        "Full raw LLM response": "**My ARC Puzzle-Solving Journey**\n\nAlright, the task at hand is to crack this ARC puzzle using three examples and a test input. Let's dive in. First, I need to understand the patterns.\n\n**Phase 1: Deep Dive into the Examples**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   I see 20x20 grids filled with different shapes: orange and grey 5x5 keys (which stay the same!) and irregular enclosures.\n    *   The really interesting part is how a yellow pixel (marker) moves within these enclosures. It seems to move differently based on the color (orange or grey) of the container.\n    *   The 5x5 orange key block contains a specific pattern (1s and 2s) and the grey key too. Hmm, I have a hunch these keys are the magic here.\n    *   I'm observing that these yellow markers shift right or left inside the containers. The 5x5 keys' internal 1s and 2s look like the key to this displacement.\n\n*   **Hypothesis:** The internal pattern of a key block dictates movement of the yellow pixels inside corresponding containers. Let me figure out if there's a specific numerical relation for these shifts.\n\n*   **Shifting:** The yellow pixel in orange container moves right, while in grey container it goes left. I calculate the shift and now it looks like it's multiples of 2. I need a more robust relation.\n\n*   **Analyzing the shift values:** The 5x5 key block has specific patterns of ones and twos. Are these bits? Additive values? I am not sure what they mean yet, but there's a clue. The \"Keys\" block might have values related to these shifts.\n\n*   **Examining Containers:** Okay, focusing on the yellow marker inside the container of a specific color. I determine the container's bounds and assess the original and final position of the yellow marker inside the container. It's moving to the extreme right in the orange containers and the extreme left in the grey containers. I wonder why.\n\n*   **Directional Clues:** The \"1\" and \"2\" in the key seem directional. The orange key had the \"2\" at the end, and the shift was towards the right. I believe \"2\" is the head, and \"1\" is the tail. The direction of this 1,1,2 pattern indicates an arrow pointing right. Grey has \"2\" at the beginning, so left shift!\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Now, things get trickier, more complex patterns!\n    *   The keys seem to be more complex shapes. The direction is no longer just horizontal.\n\n*   **The Key's Role:** It is clear the \"Keys\" block contains some pattern, and now this \"Key\" is more complex than a horizontal shift. Now it's a vector that indicates direction.\n    *   The \"key\" has the pattern of two arrows, pointing down-right.\n\n*   **Arrow Interpretation:** It looks like this key can be interpreted as one or more direction arrows, with the 2 or the head pointing the direction. 1=body, 2=head. Now I know that arrows point to some direction.\n\n*   **Vector Displacement:** Using the arrows, now I know that the direction is the movement in a vector.\n    *   The movement isn't a single jump; it\u2019s a vector-based motion with the 2 as the tail and the 1 as the head.\n\n*   **Verification:** I'm double-checking the pattern and the vector again. It appears that 2 is the head. In this new shape, there is direction with arrows.\n    *   The pattern defines the vector, and the pixel must move in that vector until it hits a wall.\n\n*   **General Rules:** I can establish general rules!\n    1.  Keys are the patterns of 1s and 2s, like arrows.\n    2.  For each container of a given color, find the yellow pixel.\n    3.  Move the pixel along the vector of the key as far as possible until it is blocked by a wall.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   One grey-colored key block with down arrows. All containers are grey so only one directional flow, so simple.\n\n**Phase 2: Applying to the Test Input**\n\n*   **Analyzing the key:** Apply the steps on the new Test Input and identify the keys first. I see a similar Grey Key as Example 2 but this time a new Blue Key (1s).\n    *   Blue key: 2,5,5 vertical arrows. This direction is \"up.\"\n    *   I see a 5x5 pattern with \n\nThe problem asks us to determine the final position of yellow pixels (4) inside various containers. The behavior of the yellow pixels is determined by \"key\" blocks present in the grid.\n\n### Analysis of Examples\n\n1.  **Key Blocks**:\n    *   There are 5x5 blocks (or similarly identifiable regions) filled with a dominant color (the container color) and a pattern of other colors inside.\n    *   **Orange Key (Color 7)**: In Example 1, the pattern consists of `1, 1, 2` in rows. If we interpret `1` as the tail/shaft and `2` as the head of an arrow, the sequence `1 -> 1 -> 2` points to the **Right**.\n    *   **Grey Key (Color 5)**: In Example 1, the pattern is `2, 1, 1`. With `2` as the head, the arrow `2 <- 1 <- 1` points to the **Left**. In Example 2 and the Test Input, the Grey Key has a diagonal pattern of `1`s ending in `2` (e.g., `(0,3)->1, (1,4)->1, (2,5)->2`). This defines a **Down-Right** direction (+1, +1).\n    *   **Blue Key (Color 1)**: In the Test Input, there is a block of 1s containing columns with `2` on top and `5`s below it (`2` at row 16, `5` at 17, `5` at 18). If `2` is the head and `5` is the shaft, the arrow points **Up**.\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule**:\n    *   For each yellow pixel (`4`) enclosed in a shape of a specific color:\n        *   Determine the movement direction from the \"Key\" corresponding to that container's color.\n        *   Move the yellow pixel (`4`) in that direction as far as possible through empty space (`0`) until it hits a wall (a non-zero pixel of the container or other object).\n\n### Application to Test Input\n\n**Key 1: Grey (5)**\n*   Located at top-left (rows 0-5).\n*   Pattern: `1`s and `2`s arranged diagonally (`1` at row 1, `1` at row 2, `2` at row 3...).\n*   Direction: **Down-Right** (+1 row, +1 col).\n\n**Key 2: Blue (1)**\n*   Located at bottom-left (rows 15-19).\n*   Pattern: Vertical columns with `2` at the top (row 16) and `5`s below. `2` is the head.\n*   Direction: **Up** (-1 row, 0 col).\n\n**Moves:**\n\n1.  **Yellow at (3, 11)** (Inside Grey container):\n    *   Direction: Down-Right.\n    *   Path: (4,12) -> (5,13) -> (6,14) -> (7,15) -> (8,16).\n    *   Blocked at (9,17) by a wall of `5`s.\n    *   **New Position: (8, 16)**.\n\n2.  **Yellow at (6, 11)** (Inside Grey container):\n    *   Direction: Down-Right.\n    *   Path: (7,12) -> (8,13) -> (9,14).\n    *   Blocked at (10,15) by a wall of `5`s.\n    *   **New Position: (9, 14)**.\n\n3.  **Yellow at (12, 9)** (Inside Blue container):\n    *   Direction: Up.\n    *   Path: (11,9).\n    *   Blocked at (10,9) by a wall of `1`s.\n    *   **New Position: (11, 9)**.\n\n4.  **Yellow at (18, 11)** (Inside Blue container):\n    *   Direction: Up.\n    *   Path: (17,11) -> (16,11).\n    *   Blocked at (15,11) by a wall of `1`s.\n    *   **New Position: (16, 11)**.\n\n5.  **Yellow at (17, 16)** (Inside Blue container):\n    *   Direction: Up.\n    *   Path: (16,16) -> (15,16) -> (14,16).\n    *   Blocked at (13,16) by a wall of `1`s.\n    *   **New Position: (14, 16)**.\n\nThe final grid is constructed by clearing the original `4`s and placing `4`s at the new coordinates.\n\n### Final Output Grid\n\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n5,5,5,1,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n5,1,5,5,1,5,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n5,5,1,5,5,2,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0\n5,5,5,2,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,5,5,5,0,4,5,5,5,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,1,1,0\n1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0\n1,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0\n1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0\n1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0\n1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

There are \"reference patterns\" - bounded rectangular regions with internal structure (colors 1, 2)\n2. There are irregular bounded regions with 4s inside them\n3. The 4s move within their containing regions based on the reference pattern's structure\n\n**Determining Reflection Type:**\n- The reference pattern's internal arrangement determines reflection axis\n- Horizontal internal pattern \u2192 horizontal reflection (Example 1)\n- Vertical internal pattern \u2192 vertical reflection (Example 3)  \n- Diagonal internal pattern \u2192 diagonal reflection (Example 2)\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\nReference patterns:\n- Top-left (5-bordered, rows 0-5): Has diagonal internal structure (1s and 2s arranged diagonally)\n- Bottom-left (1-bordered, rows 15-19): Has vertical internal structure (columns repeat)\n\nThis means:\n- 4s in 5-bounded regions use **diagonal reflection**\n- 4s in 1-bounded regions use **vertical reflection**\n\n**Finding 4 positions and their transformations:**\n\n1. **(3,11)** - in 5-region: Diagonal reflection toward bottom-right \u2192 **(8,16)**\n2. **(6,11)** - in 5-region: Closer to bottom-left, diagonal toward top-right \u2192 **(5,12)**  \n3. **(12,9)** - in 1-region: Centered in vertical interior (rows 11-13) \u2192 stays **(12,9)**\n4. **(17,16)** - in 1-region: At bottom of interior \u2192 moves to top **(14,16)**\n5. **(18,11)** - in 1-region: At bottom of interior (rows 16-18) \u2192 moves to top **(16,11)**\n\n```\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n5,5,5,1,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n5,1,5,5,1,5,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n5,5,1,5,5,2,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0\n5,5,5,2,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,4,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,1,1,0\n1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0\n1,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0\n1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0\n1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0\n1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### Key observation from the examples\nThe only cells that change are the **4s**. Everything else stays fixed.\n\nEach puzzle contains one (or more) \u201cinstruction panels\u201d: a solid-colored rectangular block containing **exactly two other colors** in a small pattern.  \nThat pattern encodes a **movement direction**.\n\n#### How the direction is read\nInside an instruction panel:\n- One inner color appears **4 times** (call it the *tail*).\n- The other inner color appears **2 times** (call it the *head*).\n- The movement direction is the step direction from the **center (centroid) of the 4-cell color** toward the **centroid of the 2-cell color**, reduced to a unit step (each component becomes -1, 0, or +1).\n\nThis produces one of the 8 grid directions (N, S, E, W, and diagonals).\n\n#### How to choose which panel controls a given \u201c4\u201d\nA \u201c4\u201d is \u201cin front of\u201d one panel\u2019s color.  \nFor each panel with outer color `C` and direction `d`:\n- Look from the 4 **backwards** along `-d` until hitting the first non-zero cell.\n- If that first hit is color `C`, then this panel\u2019s direction `d` applies to that 4.\n\n#### How the 4 moves\nOnce its direction `d` is known:\n- Slide the 4 step-by-step along `d` through **0s**.\n- Stop just before the next cell would be **non-zero** (or leave the grid).\n- The original 4 position becomes 0.\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test input\nThere are **two instruction panels**:\n\n1) **Top-left panel (outer color 5)** contains 4 cells of color 1 and 2 cells of color 2, in the same layout as Example 2 \u2192 direction is **SE** `( +1, +1 )`.\n\n2) **Bottom-left panel (outer color 1)** contains 4 cells of color 5 and 2 cells of color 2 \u2192 direction is **N** `( -1, 0 )`.\n\nAssigning each 4 by looking backward:\n- The two upper 4s have **5** behind them along NW \u2192 they move **SE**.\n- The three lower 4s have **1** behind them along South \u2192 they move **North**.\n\nAfter sliding each 4 until blocked, we get the output grid below.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n5,5,5,1,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n5,1,5,5,1,5,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n5,5,1,5,5,2,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0  \n5,5,5,2,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0  \n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,5,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,5,5,5,0,4,5,5,5,5,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,1,1,0  \n1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0  \n1,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0  \n1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0  \n1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0  \n1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",
