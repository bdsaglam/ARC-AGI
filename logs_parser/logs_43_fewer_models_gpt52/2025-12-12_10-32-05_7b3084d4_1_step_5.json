            "Full raw LLM response": "The solution involves identifying a transformation that rearranges and reorients the distinct colored objects (blocks) in the input grid into a compact output grid.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** The input contains four distinct objects made of colored pixels:\n    *   Top-Left (TL): A 7x7 block of `2`s (Red) with some holes.\n    *   Top-Right (TR): A 7x7 block of `3`s (Green) with holes.\n    *   Bottom-Left (BL): A 7x7 block of `7`s (Orange) containing a single gray pixel `5` at its bottom-right.\n    *   Bottom-Right (BR): An 8x8 block of `8`s (Azure).\n\n2.  **Anchor and Transformation Rule:**\n    *   The gray pixel `5` acts as a unique anchor point. In all examples, the pixel `5` moves to position `(0,0)` (Top-Left) in the output grid.\n    *   In the Test Input, the `5` is located in the Bottom-Left quadrant (specifically, at the bottom-right of the 7-block).\n    *   To move the `5` to the Top-Left of the output, the entire grid (or the specific blocks) undergoes a transformation. The examples suggest a permutation of the quadrants followed by a rotation/flip of the blocks to orient the `5` correctly.\n    *   Comparing the input and output of Example 3 (where `5` was also in the Bottom-Left block, but at the top):\n        *   The Bottom-Left block moves to Top-Left.\n        *   The Bottom-Right block moves to Top-Right.\n        *   The Top-Left block moves to Bottom-Right.\n        *   The Top-Right block moves to Bottom-Left.\n        *   Effectively, the rows of blocks are swapped (Top $\\leftrightarrow$ Bottom), and then the new Bottom row is swapped horizontally (Left $\\leftrightarrow$ Right).\n    *   Furthermore, since the `5` in the Test Input is at the *bottom-right* of its block, and must end up at *top-left*, the block itself must be **Rotated 180 degrees**. Consistency suggests all blocks are rotated 180 degrees during this transformation.\n\n3.  **Constructing the Output:**\n    *   **Top-Left:** The 7-block (originally BL). Rotated 180 degrees.\n        *   Original: `7`s with `5` at bottom-right.\n        *   Rotated: `7`s with `5` at top-left.\n    *   **Top-Right:** The 8-block (originally BR). Rotated 180 degrees.\n    *   **Bottom-Left:** The 3-block (originally TR). Rotated 180 degrees.\n    *   **Bottom-Right:** The 2-block (originally TL). Rotated 180 degrees.\n\n4.  **Block Details (Rotated 180):**\n    *   **7-Block (TL):** The `5` is at (0,0). The indentation `0 0` originally at left (Row 14) moves to the right in the corresponding rotated row.\n    *   **8-Block (TR):** The single `8` tip (Row 18) moves to the top. The row of `8`s with width 8 (Row 14) preserves its width.\n    *   **3-Block (BL):** The hole `0` originally in the bottom section moves to the top section.\n    *   **2-Block (BR):** The gap `0 0 0 0` moves from left to right.\n\n    The final grid assembles these rotated blocks into a single coherent image.\n\n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,0,3,3,3,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,0,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0\n3,3,3,0,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,0,2,2,2,0",

All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**The Puzzle of Assembly**\n\nI'm tackling a puzzle where the input is a jumble of colored shapes on a grid, and the output is a more compact, complete image. The core is figuring out how these shapes, seemingly scattered pieces, fit together.\n\n**The Strategy: Anchor and Alignment**\n\nThe trick, I think, lies in a special \"anchor\" shape. This shape is always marked by a grey pixel (`5`).  My plan is to use this grey pixel to guide the reconstruction:\n1. **Identify the Anchor:** Find the shape that contains the grey `5`.\n2. **Determine the Correct Rotation/Flip:** Transform the anchor shape (and *only* that shape) such that the grey pixel ends up at the top-left corner (0,0) of that shape's bounding box. I deduce the required transformation by observing how `5`'s relative position changes in the provided examples: a horizontal flip for one, a vertical flip for another, etc. In the test input, it appears that a 180-degree rotation is needed to place the grey pixel in the top-left position of the new output.\n3. **Apply and Squash:** I apply this anchor-derived transformation to *all* the other pieces.  Then, by examining the example outputs, I am going to try to squeeze all of the transformed shapes together in a rectangle, removing any empty rows or columns (a \"squash\" operation). The examples indicate a solid rectangular form, so I believe this 'squash' principle should work.\n\n**Applying the Plan**\n-I see that the test input shows the grey 5 at the bottom right.\n-I know that the solution will involve performing a 180 degree rotation (equivalent to H-Flip and V-Flip). I have deduced that I must perform the transformation on all the pieces individually. The \"squash\" is implied as the \"puzzle\" aspect - the shapes will fit together and there is only 1 layout.\n\nIn the end, I'll need to meticulously construct a grid from the individual shapes in their new orientations to form the complete, assembled output.",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Extract puzzle pieces**: Each input contains colored shapes scattered on a black background, with one shape containing a gray (5) marker pixel.\n\n2. **Identify interlocking**: The shapes are puzzle pieces designed to fit together. They have complementary protrusions and gaps that interlock.\n\n3. **Assemble output**: The shapes are rotated/flipped as needed and assembled into a complete rectangle with no gaps. The shape with the gray 5 marker is positioned at the top-left corner with 5 at position (0,0).\n\n4. **Position mapping**: The shape with 5 goes to top-left, and other shapes are arranged to interlock around it based on their complementary edges.\n\nFor the test input, I identify:\n- **Shape 7** (with 5 at bottom-right): Located at bottom-left, 10\u00d77 with protrusion upward\n- **Shape 2**: Located at top-left, 7\u00d77 with gaps\n- **Shape 3**: Located at top-right, 7\u00d710 with protrusion leftward\n- **Shape 8**: Located at bottom-right, 9\u00d78 with protrusions\n\nTotal cells: 50 + 45 + 49 + 52 = 196 = 14\u00d714\n\nAfter rotating shape 7 by 180\u00b0 (placing 5 at top-left) and arranging the other shapes to interlock:\n- Shape 7's gap at row 3 is filled by shape 3's protrusion\n- Shape 7's vertical protrusion (rows 7-9, col 3) fits into shape 2's gap\n- Shape 8 fills the bottom-right with its protrusions interlocking with shapes 3 and 2\n\n```\n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,8,3,3,3\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,8,3,3,3\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,8,3,3,3\n2,2,2,7,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,7,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,7,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,2,2,2\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Okay, here\u2019s the plan: I\u2019m being asked to solve an ARC puzzle, and I\u2019ve got three examples and a test input to work with. Time to break this down.\n\n**Initial Assessment:**\nMy primary goal is to decipher the relationship between the inputs and outputs, paying close attention to any patterns.  I need to start by looking for standard colors used in ARC and the dimensions.\n\n*   **Example 1**: The first thing I noticed was a cluster of colors with dimensions of 20x20. I looked at the color clusters. The Output is 6x6. Then I also checked a pixel (5) that seems to be specially placed. Based on the hint, it \"forms a top-left corner\" in the output. Based on all the information, the output's size doesn't correlate to a sub-grid of the input. I realized that the clusters of colors rearrange.\n*   **Example 2**:  Input size: 20x20. Output size: 10x10. I tried to find a scale, it seems to scale by 0.5. No obvious rules.\n*   **Example 3**: Input size: 20x20. Output size: 4x4. The colors seem to be flipped to positions or rotated.\n\nIt seems I need to figure out the output grid size, and figure out how the clusters shift around.\n\n**Deeper Analysis:**\nLet's see: I figured out that the output grid size must be the square root of the number of non-black pixels in the input. In the Examples, it matches.\n\n*   In example 3, I confirmed I was correct on that rule: Input = 16 pixels. Output = 4x4.\n\nThe \"gray\" pixel seems to be in a special place (0,0) in the output. I also noticed that the output's pixel count is the same as the sum of the non-black pixels from the input. I suspect this is some kind of rearrangement problem.\n\nI needed a good rule. Is it a Voronoi diagram or other shape representation? I needed to map input coordinate to output coordinates. It seems that the topology is shifted, not directly transposed. Maybe based on a seed or distance from the gray pixel. Also the output looks like the number of pixels is preserved and they are just being rearranged into a solid shape. Maybe I use the original coordinate locations and map based on those?\n\n**Refining the Approach:**\n*   **Coordinate mapping:** I attempted to map with transformations. It didn't work. The positions seem to relate, but some components were flipped/shifted. In particular, the Gray seems to be at the center. I needed a transformation to \"centralize\" the grid, but preserve neighbors. I found that I get inconsistent sign results.\n*   **New Idea:** I think it will be best if the output is a *sorted* list of pixels. The output is constructed by a \"seed\" (Gray pixel) and then ordering using a metric. I am going to see if the distance to the gray pixel can work as an ordering metric. It didn't work as expected. The result looked like a projection on 2D axes, not just distance.\n*   **Hypothesis:** I needed to consider a \"Seed Anchor\" idea. Maybe the Gray pixel is special and its position defines (0,0)? The pixels will be filled in, to make \"stepped borders\" and preserve the neighbors. This makes me suspect I need to keep neighbors \"close\" together.\n*   I considered a BFS or \"Simultaneous Expansion\" or a Voronoi diagram idea. The \"Gray Pixel\" seems to consistently form the small top-left corner. Maybe this is a distance-from-the-origin approach. So I made a \"Relative coordinate\" system. I think I will use the position of the Gray pixel as the seed (0,0). I then try \"Quadrents\" based on the location of the pixel.\n*   I attempted to flip axis when negative, but did not work. I considered ranking, which also did not work.\n\n**Towards a Solution:**\n*   I suspect there might be a \"cyclic shift\" logic.\n*   If I shift the input, it is consistent with \"shift, not reflection\". But it is still confusing. In Example 1 and Example 3, The input does something, the output is different, and the gray pixel determines which one goes where.\n*   **Cluster Approach:** It seems that the clusters, or \"blocks\" of colors are re-arranged. It seems to have been rotated.\n*   **Shift/Swap logic:**\n    *   Examine the cluster of the Seed (Gray), and arrange it to the top/left of the matrix (the seed location).\n    *\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation rules are as follows:\n\n1.  **Output Size:** The total area of the output grid (Width $\\times$ Height) equals the total number of non-black colored pixels in the input grid. The output is always a square. In the test input, there are 196 colored pixels (45 Red, 49 Green, 49 Orange + 1 Gray = 50 Orange, 52 Azure), so the output is a **14x14** grid.\n\n2.  **Relative Positioning (Topology):** The relative positions of the colored clusters in the output are determined by the position of the \"Seed\" cluster (the one containing the Gray pixel) in the input.\n    *   The Grid is treated as a toroidal 2x2 layout of clusters.\n    *   The rows and columns of clusters are cyclic-shifted so that the Seed cluster moves to the Top-Left.\n    *   Specifically, if the Seed is in the Bottom row of the input (as in Example 3 and the Test Input), the Bottom row moves to the Top, and the Top row moves to the Bottom.\n    *   For the row that does *not* contain the Seed (now the Bottom row), the left/right order of the clusters is swapped (flipped).\n    *   **Application to Test Input:**\n        *   **Input Layout:**\n            *   Top-Left: Red (2)\n            *   Top-Right: Green (3)\n            *   Bottom-Left: Orange (7) + Gray (5) **[SEED]**\n            *   Bottom-Right: Azure (8)\n        *   **Transformation:**\n            *   Move Bottom row (Orange, Azure) to Top.\n            *   Move Top row (Red, Green) to Bottom.\n            *   In the new Bottom row, swap Left/Right: Red/Green becomes Green/Red.\n        *   **Output Layout:**\n            *   Top-Left: Orange (7)\n            *   Top-Right: Azure (8)\n            *   Bottom-Left: Green (3)\n            *   Bottom-Right: Red (2)\n\n3.  **Tessellation and Boundaries:** The clusters expand to fill their assigned quadrants, creating a solid tessellation with stepped borders. The exact area of each region matches its pixel count.\n    *   **Orange (TL):** 50 pixels.\n    *   **Azure (TR):** 52 pixels.\n    *   **Green (BL):** 49 pixels.\n    *   **Red (BR):** 45 pixels.\n    *   **Filling Strategy:**\n        *   Base quadrants are 7x7 (49 pixels).\n        *   Orange (50): 7x7 square (Rows 0-6, Cols 0-6) plus 1 pixel at (7, 0).\n        *   Azure (52): 7x7 square (Rows 0-6, Cols 7-13) plus 3 pixels at (7, 11-13).\n        *   Green (49): Remainder of Bottom-Left. It fills Rows 8-13 (Cols 0-6) = 42 pixels. It takes the remaining space in Row 7 (Cols 1-6) = 6 pixels. Total 48. It needs 1 more pixel, so it takes (13, 7) from the Red region.\n        *   Red (45): Remainder of Bottom-Right. It fills Rows 8-13 (Cols 7-13) excluding (13,7) = 41 pixels. It takes the remaining space in Row 7 (Cols 7-10) = 4 pixels. Total 45.\n\n4.  **The Seed:** The Gray pixel (5) is always placed at **(0,0)** in the output, replacing the color of the Top-Left cluster at that specific position.\n\n**Completed Output Grid Generation:**\n\n*   **Row 0:** (0,0) is 5. (0,1) to (0,6) are 7. (0,7) to (0,13) are 8.\n*   **Rows 1-6:** (0-6) are 7. (7-13) are 8.\n*   **Row 7:** (0) is 7. (1-6) are 3. (7-10) are 2. (11-13) are 8.\n*   **Rows 8-12:** (0-6) are 3. (7-13) are 2.\n*   **Row 13:** (0-7) are 3. (8-13) are 2.\n\n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand how the transformation works based on the examples:\n\n1. **Identify the 4 colored clusters** in the input (excluding black/0)\n2. **Find the cluster containing color 5 (gray)** - this acts as an anchor\n3. **Transform the grid** so that the 5 ends up at position (0,0) in the output\n4. **Determine output size**: Based on the examples, output size = 2 \u00d7 (smaller dimension of the 7+5 cluster)\n5. **Clusters fill their quadrants**, with holes in one cluster allowing neighboring clusters to intrude\n\nFor the test input:\n- **Color 2**: top-left (7\u00d77)\n- **Color 3**: top-right (7\u00d710)  \n- **Color 7+5**: bottom-left (10\u00d77), with 5 at position (17,6)\n- **Color 8**: bottom-right (9\u00d78)\n\nSince 5 is at the bottom-right of the 7+5 cluster (which is in the bottom-left of input), I need to rotate 180\u00b0 to place 5 at (0,0).\n\n**Output size**: 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\u00d714\n\n**Quadrant mapping after transformation**:\n- 7+5 \u2192 top-left (with 180\u00b0 rotation)\n- 8 \u2192 top-right  \n- 3 \u2192 bottom-left\n- 2 \u2192 bottom-right\n\nAfter rotating each cluster and placing them in quadrants, holes get filled by adjacent clusters:\n- 7+5 cluster holes at row 3, cols 5-6 \u2192 filled by 8\n- 3 cluster holes at rows 7-9, col 3 \u2192 filled by 7\n- 2 cluster holes at row 10, cols 11-13 \u2192 filled by 8\n- 2 cluster hole at row 13, col 10 \u2192 filled by 3\n\n```\n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,7,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,7,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,7,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,3,2,2,2\n```",

Describe the observable structures**\n\nDescribe what you see **without guessing** the rule:\n\n* What objects exist? (shapes, colors, connected components)\n* How are they arranged? (locations, orientations, bounding boxes)\n* What changes from input to output? (additions, removals, movements)\n* What stays the same? (stable background, preserved shapes)\n\nBe very literal and avoid hypothesizing here.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Identify transformation categories**\n\nFor each, say \u201cpresent\u201d, \u201cmaybe\u201d, or \u201cabsent\u201d:\n\n* **Object movement**\n* **Object recoloring**\n* **Bordering / outlining**\n* **Filling holes or cavities**\n* **Removing noise / extracting main shape**\n* **Copying / pasting / repositioning**\n* **Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center)**\n* **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors**\n* **Size-based filtering or selection**\n* **Symmetry or reflection operations**\n* **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion**\n* **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping**\n\nThis helps narrow down plausible rule families.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Extract the key non-obvious insights**\n\nList 3\u20136 insights that are **crucial and not immediately obvious**.\nExamples of the kind of insights to extract:\n\n* \u201cOnly the *largest* blue cluster receives a border; smaller ones are ignored.\u201d\n* \u201cNew colors in the output correspond to *inside* regions of hollow shapes.\u201d\n* \u201cThe transformation only acts on objects touching the top edge.\u201d\n* \u201cThe rule depends on which color appears in the **top-left tile** of the input.\u201d\n* \u201cObjects are replaced with templated icons depending on their color.\u201d\n* \u201cInternal holes are treated as objects and recolored independently.\u201d\n\nFocus on the subtle but general behavior.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)**\n\nIn 2\u20134 sentences, propose a **general transformation mechanism** that would explain the mapping *across inputs and outputs*.\n\nAvoid low-level pixel descriptions; describe conceptual behavior.\n\nExample styles:\n\n* \u201cThe task identifies hollow shapes and outlines them in red while recoloring their interior according to hole depth.\u201d\n* \u201cThe task compresses all meaningful objects to the top-left quadrant while preserving their original shapes.\u201d\n* \u201cAll scattered singletons are deleted and replaced by large structured blocks based on color frequency.\u201d\n\nIf ambiguous, propose the *two or three* most likely rule families.\n\n---\n\n## **5. List checks you would perform when solving**\n\nGive 3\u20135 quick algorithmic checks for validation, e.g.:\n\n* \u201cVerify whether recoloring depends on hole depth or on adjacency to perimeter.\u201d\n* \u201cCheck if the anchor color is always the top-left non-background pixel.\u201d\n* \u201cTest whether clusters are preserved or converted into icons.\u201d\n* \u201cDetermine whether the largest cluster always receives the transformation.\u201d\n\nThese guide a solver toward the correct general rule.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Summarize final insights**\n\nIn 3-4 bullet points, give the distilled essence \u2014 short, hard, and generalizable.\n**IMPORTANT: Start this section with the exact line `HINT_START` and end it with the exact line `HINT_END`.**\n\nExample:\nHINT_START\n* The task outlines certain shapes using a new color.\n* Only shapes with internal cavities are processed.\n* Inner cavities receive a secondary recolor distinct from the border.\nHINT_END\n",

Identify transformation categories\n\n- **Object movement:** maybe (small clusters don\u2019t appear as isolated objects anymore; unclear if they \u201cmove\u201d vs. get absorbed into larger regions)\n- **Object recoloring:** present (black background becomes colored; gray also appears as a region)\n- **Bordering / outlining:** absent\n- **Filling holes or cavities:** absent\n- **Removing noise / extracting main shape:** absent\n- **Copying / pasting / repositioning:** maybe (colors propagate widely, but not as rigid copies of the original shapes)\n- **Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center):** present (persistent gray at top-left; regions often align to quadrants/areas)\n- **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors:** maybe (gray is a small, special region; could be \u201cspecial\u201d/marker-like)\n- **Size-based filtering or selection:** absent\n- **Symmetry or reflection operations:** absent\n- **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion:** present (small seeds become large regions)\n- **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping:** absent\n\n---\n\n## 3. Key non-obvious insights (crucial)\n\n1. **The output is a complete partition (tessellation):** every cell belongs to exactly one solid-colored region; the original black background is entirely eliminated.\n2. **Each input color becomes a single large \u201cterritory\u201d:** output regions are uniform (no patterns), implying the input clusters act as *seeds* rather than shapes to be preserved.\n3. **Boundaries look like collision fronts:** the stepped, rectilinear borders resemble what you\u2019d get if multiple colors expanded outward until they met (a multi-source region-growing effect).\n4. **Gray behaves like an additional special seed/region:** gray consistently occupies the **top-left corner** as a compact block, suggesting either (a) there is a gray seed near that corner in inputs, or (b) gray is constructed/collected as a corner anchor.\n5. **Exact polyomino geometry is not preserved:** the fine shapes seen in input are not reproduced; only their colors (and implicitly their positions/seed influence) matter in forming the final tiling.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)\n\nMost likely, the task performs a **multi-source flood fill / region growth** from all non-background colored cells (including gray), expanding each color into the black background until the entire grid is filled; where expansions meet, they form the stepped borders (i.e., a grid-based \u201cnearest-seed\u201d / watershed-style partition).  \nA secondary possibility is that growth is driven not by *all* colored cells but by a **specific marker cell per object** (potentially the gray-attached cell), with the object\u2019s main color used to fill that marker\u2019s territory.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Checks to perform when solving\n\n1. **Distance/nearest-seed check:** For each output cell, verify whether its color matches the nearest input colored cell/component under Manhattan distance (multi-source Voronoi).\n2. **Seed definition check:** Test whether seeds are **all non-black pixels**, or only **one representative pixel per object** (e.g., a gray \u201ctag\u201d attached to each cluster).\n3. **Tie-breaking check:** Locate border cells that are equidistant to two seeds and see which color wins (scan-order priority? fixed color priority?).\n4. **Gray origin check:** Confirm whether gray exists in the input and where; determine if the output\u2019s gray corner region corresponds to a gray seed\u2019s influence region.\n5. **Color set preservation:** Verify output colors are exactly the set of non-black input colors (no new colors introduced).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Summarize final insights\n\nHINT_START\n* Inputs have a few small colored clusters on black; outputs are fully filled by large solid regions of those same colors (black disappears).\n* The output looks like a tessellation where regions meet along stepped, grid-aligned borders (suggesting simultaneous expansion until collision).\n* Gray consistently forms a small top-left corner region, acting like a special additional seed/anchor.\n* The original cluster shapes aren\u2019t preserved; they mainly serve as seeds determining which color claims which area.\nHINT_END",

Shapes range from single pixels and small squares to large rectangular blocks, 1-cell-thick line segments, and irregular polyominoes (L/T/stepped/triangular/diamond-like). Some components have internal color 0 holes/notches, and different-colored components may touch edge-to-edge.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1) Identify non-zero components; merge edge-touching components into composite pieces (notably 5+7). 2) Crop each piece to its tight bounding box (keep internal 0 holes). 3) Re-orient pieces via rotations/reflections (seen: 90\u00b0 CW, 180\u00b0, horizontal flip; sometimes 90\u00b0 CCW is also possible) \u2014 especially orient the 5-containing piece so 5 is at the top-left of its box. 4) Translate and pack the transformed boxes into a compact ~2\u00d72 arrangement with the 5-piece at output top-left. 5) Allow overlaps where 0 acts as transparency; avoid non-zero color collisions. 6) Crop to the final minimal rectangle (outputs show no 0 remaining).\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Alright, here's the plan. The user wants me to solve this ARC task, and after carefully analyzing the examples and the test input, I've figured out the core logic. \n\n**Deconstructing the ARC Puzzle:**\n\nIt's all about taking these colorful, complex shapes in the input and turning them into a neat, compact grid. The key is the \"5\" pixel, it anchors everything.\n\n**Finding the Hidden Logic:**\n1.  **Spot the Components:** First, I identify each connected shape of pixels in the input, ignoring the black (0) ones.\n2.  **The \"5\" Anchor Shape:** There's always one specific shape that has that \"5\" pixel (Gray) inside. My job is to isolate this shape and *re-orient* it so the \"5\" ends up in the top-left corner of its bounding box. I need to crop the shapes and then maybe rotate it, flip it, or some combination of both, depending on how the pixels are arranged.\n3.  **The Remaining Shapes:**  For all the other shapes I have to crop them too. The tricky part is figuring out how to transform them so they all fit in a rectangular shape.\n\n**Putting the Pieces Together:**\n1.  **Grid Formation:** The final output grid will be arranged in a kind of 2x2 pattern. The \"5\" shape will always be in the top-left corner, as I have just demonstrated.\n2.  **Transforming for Fit:** I must be careful about fitting the shapes in the grid. Rotate/flip or other transformations might be needed.\n3.  **The Overlap Dilemma:**  The user wants the shapes packed tightly so there may be some pixel overlap. So there may be some holes, but the output must be rectangular.\n\n**Applying the Hypothesis:**\nI believe I have to check for overlaps/gaps. I should generate this grid and assume the overlap, and also consider cropping/filling to avoid these gaps.\n\nNow, based on the test input, I will:\n\n1. Identify those separate connected regions.\n2. Determine how each piece, the \"5\"-shape as the anchor and others, are supposed to be re-oriented and re-aligned, to create a final solution that respects the provided constraints.\n3. Carefully map each shape's data onto the output grid, being mindful of overlaps and how to handle them. The key will be to make sure the \"5\" shape ends up in the correct place, and that all shapes are somehow fitted into a single rectangular output.\n\nI should be able to produce the final answer.\n\n\nTo solve this challenge, I will first identify and isolate the four distinct connected components in the input grid. Then, I will transform each component (crop, rotate, flip) to fit them into a compact rectangular arrangement, ensuring the component containing the color 5 is at the top-left.\n\n**1. Component Identification & Extraction**\n\n*   **Component 1 (Orange/Gray):**\n    *   Located in the bottom-left area of the input.\n    *   Contains the unique '5' pixel.\n    *   Shape: A roughly 7x7 block of 7s with a \"tail\" of 7s extending upwards in the input, and the 5 is at the bottom-right of the block.\n    *   Input details: Tail of 7s at cols 0-6 (rows 8-10 are narrower, rows 11-17 are the block). The 5 is at row 17, col 6.\n    *   **Transformation:** To place the 5 at the top-left (0,0) of the bounding box, we need to rotate the shape 180 degrees.\n    *   **Transformed Shape (Rotated 180):** A 7x10 shape.\n        *   Top row: `5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7`\n        *   Main block: 7x7 solid 7s (rows 0-6).\n        *   Tail: Extends downwards from the center (cols 2-4 roughly) for 3 rows.\n        *   Notch: The input shape has empty space at row 14, cols 0-1. In 180 rotation, this becomes a notch on the *right* side at row 3 (cols 5-6).\n\n*   **Component 2 (Azure):**\n    *   Located in the bottom-right area.\n    *   Shape: A 7x7 block of 8s with a \"tail\" at the bottom and a protrusion on the right.\n    *   Input details: Block at rows 11-17, cols 9-15. Protrusion at row 14, col 16. Tail at rows 18-19, col 13.\n    *   **Transformation:** We need to fit this into the Top-Right quadrant. To lock into the Top-Left component (which has a notch on the right), we **Flip Horizontal** this shape.\n    *   **Transformed Shape (Flipped H):**\n        *   Main block 7x7.\n        *   Protrusion is now on the *left* (row 3), fitting into the neighbor's notch.\n        *   Tail is at the bottom (cols 2, rows 7-8 relative to shape).\n\n*   **Component 3 (Green):**\n    *   Located in the top-right area.\n    *   Shape: An irregular block of 3s.\n    *   Input details: Top block (rows 1-3), Middle wide line (row 4, extending left and right), Bottom legs (rows 5-7) with a hole in the middle.\n    *   **Transformation:** We need to fit this into the Bottom-Left quadrant. The Top-Left component has a tail sticking down. To accommodate this, we **Rotate 180** the Green shape.\n    *   **Transformed Shape (Rotated 180):**\n        *   The \"legs\" with the hole become the top. The hole (depth 3) accepts the tail from the Orange component.\n        *   The wide middle line (protrusions) is at row 3 (relative to top of this shape).\n        *   The solid block is at the bottom.\n\n*   **Component 4 (Red):**\n    *   Located in the top-left area.\n    *   Shape: A 7x7 block of 2s with notches.\n    *   Input details: Notch at top (row 0, col 3). Notch at left (row 3, cols 0-2).\n    *   **Transformation:** No rotation needed. This fits in the Bottom-Right quadrant.\n    *   **Fitting:**\n        *   Top notch (depth 1) aligns with the tail of the Azure component above it.\n        *   Left notch (depth 3) aligns with the right protrusion of the Green component to its left.\n\n**2. Assembly & Layout**\n\nThe components are packed into a 15x15 grid (derived from the sum of widths and heights accounting for overlaps).\n\n*   **Top-Left (Orange 7/5):** Anchored at (1,0). The column 0 is left empty (or occupied by the Green protrusion lower down). The 5 is at (1,0). The block fills (1,0) to (7,6). Tail extends to (4,9).\n*   **Top-Right (Azure 8):** Anchored at (8,0). Protrusion at (7,3) fills the notch of the Orange block. Main block at (8,0) to (14,6). Tail extends to (10,8).\n*   **Bottom-Left (Green 3):** Anchored at (1,7). Top hole accommodates Orange tail. Left protrusion extends to (0,10). Main body fills (1,11) to (7,14).\n*   **Bottom-Right (Red 2):** Anchored at (7,7) (overlapping slightly to fit). Top notch accepts Azure tail. Left notch accepts Green right protrusion. Main block fills (8,7) to (14,13), mostly solid 2s.\n\n**3. Final Grid Generation**\n\nThe resulting grid is 15x15.\n*   (0,0) is 0. (1,0) is 5.\n*   The components interlock to form a nearly solid rectangle.\n*   We handle overlaps by prioritizing the specific packing logic (e.g., notches filling holes).\n\nHere is the completed output grid:\n\n0,5,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,7,7,7,7,7,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,3,3,3,7,3,3,3,2,2,0,2,2,2,2\n0,3,3,3,7,3,3,3,2,2,8,2,2,2,2\n0,3,3,3,7,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2",

Shapes range from single pixels and small squares to large rectangular blocks, 1-cell-thick line segments, and irregular polyominoes (L/T/stepped/triangular/diamond-like). Some components have internal color 0 holes/notches, and different-colored components may touch edge-to-edge.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1) Identify non-zero components; merge edge-touching components into composite pieces (notably 5+7). 2) Crop each piece to its tight bounding box (keep internal 0 holes). 3) Re-orient pieces via rotations/reflections (seen: 90\u00b0 CW, 180\u00b0, horizontal flip; sometimes 90\u00b0 CCW is also possible) \u2014 especially orient the 5-containing piece so 5 is at the top-left of its box. 4) Translate and pack the transformed boxes into a compact ~2\u00d72 arrangement with the 5-piece at output top-left. 5) Allow overlaps where 0 acts as transparency; avoid non-zero color collisions. 6) Crop to the final minimal rectangle (outputs show no 0 remaining).\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to:\n1. Identify the four non-zero components in the test input\n2. Determine how they should be transformed and arranged based on the examples\n\n**Identifying Components:**\n- **Component 7+5** (bottom-left, rows 8-17, cols 0-6): 10\u00d77 shape with 5 at position (9,6)\n- **Component 2** (top-left, rows 0-6, cols 1-7): 7\u00d77 shape with internal structure\n- **Component 3** (top-right, rows 1-7, cols 9-18): 7\u00d710 shape with internal holes\n- **Component 8** (bottom-right, rows 11-19, cols 9-16): 9\u00d78 shape with vertical stem\n\n**Transformation Pattern:**\nFrom the examples, the piece containing 5 must be positioned at top-left with 5 at corner position (0,0). This requires a 180\u00b0 rotation of the 7+5 piece.\n\nThe spatial arrangement swaps: since 7+5 was at bottom-left and needs to go to top-left, the rows swap, giving:\n- Top-left: 7+5 (rotated 180\u00b0)\n- Top-right: 8 (rotated 180\u00b0)\n- Bottom-left: 2 (rotated 180\u00b0)\n- Bottom-right: 3 (rotated 180\u00b0)\n\n**Overlapping:**\nThe pieces must overlap where internal 0s exist, with 0 acting as transparency. The stems and holes align:\n- 7+5's vertical stem (all 7s at col 3) aligns with holes in 2 and 3\n- 8's vertical stem aligns with holes in the arrangement\n- Non-zero values fill where other pieces have 0s\n\n**Constructing Output:**\nAfter rotating each piece 180\u00b0 and arranging them in a 2\u00d72 grid with appropriate overlap to eliminate all 0s:\n\n```\n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,7,2,2,2,3,3,3,8,3,3,3\n2,2,2,7,2,2,2,3,3,3,8,3,3,3\n2,2,2,7,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n```",

Shapes range from single pixels and small squares to large rectangular blocks, 1-cell-thick line segments, and irregular polyominoes (L/T/stepped/triangular/diamond-like). Some components have internal color 0 holes/notches, and different-colored components may touch edge-to-edge.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1) Identify non-zero components; merge edge-touching components into composite pieces (notably 5+7). 2) Crop each piece to its tight bounding box (keep internal 0 holes). 3) Re-orient pieces via rotations/reflections (seen: 90\u00b0 CW, 180\u00b0, horizontal flip; sometimes 90\u00b0 CCW is also possible) \u2014 especially orient the 5-containing piece so 5 is at the top-left of its box. 4) Translate and pack the transformed boxes into a compact ~2\u00d72 arrangement with the 5-piece at output top-left. 5) Allow overlaps where 0 acts as transparency; avoid non-zero color collisions. 6) Crop to the final minimal rectangle (outputs show no 0 remaining).\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

                "response": "The grids contain **cell-based objects** made from contiguous regions of the same value (typically using 4-neighbor connectivity). In many cases **color 0** acts as an empty background that separates objects, though some grids are **fully tiled** by adjacent colored regions with no color 0 background.\n\nCommon object types and attributes across the grids:\n\n- **Monochrome filled regions (patches):**  \n  Connected components in colors **2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9** that form solid areas. These range from very small clusters to large multi-row/multi-column blocks. Many are **rectangular or blocky** in outline.\n\n- **Small single-cell objects:**  \n  Isolated **1\u00d71** pixels appear (notably in **color 5**, and sometimes other colors), either standing alone on a color 0 background or positioned adjacent to larger regions.\n\n- **Thin line segments / bars:**  \n  Some objects appear as **1-cell-thick straight segments** (vertical or horizontal), sometimes attached to or near larger blocks.\n\n- **Irregular polyomino shapes:**  \n  Non-rectangular connected shapes occur, including **L-like**, **T-like**, and **stair-stepped/triangular/diamond-like** clusters formed by blocky diagonals.\n\n- **Regions with cutouts (holes/notches):**  \n  Some larger monochrome areas include **interior gaps of color 0** (or missing cells), producing shapes that are not fully solid within their bounding box.\n\n- **Touching contrasting pixels/regions:**  \n  Occasionally, a small region of one color is **directly adjacent to** (or embedded within the boundary of) a larger region of another color, creating tightly packed multi-color groupings even though each color still forms its own connected component(s).\n\n<objects_summary>\nObjects include a color 0 background (sometimes absent) plus connected monochrome components in colors 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Shapes range from single pixels and small squares to large rectangular blocks, 1-cell-thick line segments, and irregular polyominoes (L/T/stepped/triangular/diamond-like).

                "response": "### Transformations observed / implied across the examples\n\n#### 1) Object detection and grouping\n- Treat **0** as background/empty.\n- Find connected components of non-zero colors.\n- **Merge touching components of different colors into one composite \u201cpiece\u201d** when they share an edge.  \n  - In all examples, the **5** pixel touches the **7** component, and **5+7 move/rotate together**, so they function as one multi-color piece.\n\n#### 2) Cropping (extraction)\n- For each piece, extract its **tight bounding box** (minimum rectangle containing all its non-zero cells).\n- The bounding box keeps internal **0** holes/notches as **0** (they later act like transparency).\n\n#### 3) Per-piece geometric transformations (orientation normalization / fitting)\nPieces may be re-oriented before assembly. Across examples the following were used:\n\n- **Rotation 90\u00b0 clockwise**  \n  - Example1: color **4** piece  \n  - Example2: the **5+7** composite piece\n- **Rotation 180\u00b0**  \n  - Example1: color **9** piece  \n  - Example3: color **2** piece\n- **Horizontal reflection** (left-right mirror)  \n  - Example1: the **5+7** composite piece (this also places **5** into the top-left corner of its box)\n- **Rotation 90\u00b0 counterclockwise** is also *consistent/possible* for Example1\u2019s **5+7** piece (it produces the same oriented box there), so it is another potential transformation seen as equivalent in at least one case.\n- Some pieces remain **unchanged** (no rotation/flip).\n\nA strong repeated pattern:\n- The composite containing **5** is oriented so that the **5** ends up at the **top-left corner** of that piece\u2019s bounding box (achieved via rotation/flip as needed).\n\n#### 4) Translation and packing into a new output canvas\n- Create a new (smaller) output grid and **place the transformed bounding boxes** into it.\n- Placement is a **tight packing** (roughly a 2\u00d72 assembly in all examples):\n  - The **5-containing piece** is placed at the **output\u2019s top-left**.\n  - The other three pieces are placed around it (to the right and/or below), forming top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right regions.\n\n#### 5) Overlap rules (0 as transparency)\n- Pieces are allowed to **overlap** in the output.\n- **0 cells inside a piece\u2019s bounding box behave like transparent cells**:\n  - When overlapping occurs, a non-zero cell from one piece can occupy a position where the other piece has **0**.\n  - Overlaps are arranged so **non-zero cells of different colors do not collide**; overlaps primarily happen where at least one piece has **0**.\n- This overlap/packing eliminates empty space and contributes to the reduced output size.\n\n#### 6) Final cropping / no background shown\n- The final output is the **minimal bounding rectangle** of the assembled pieces.\n- In the provided outputs, the final rectangle ends up **fully filled with non-zero colors** (no **0** remains), because holes in one piece are filled by other pieces during overlap.\n\n---\n\n<transformation_summary>\n1) Identify non-zero components; merge edge-touching components into composite pieces (notably 5+7). 2) Crop each piece to its tight bounding box (keep internal 0 holes). 3) Re-orient pieces via rotations/reflections (seen: 90\u00b0 CW, 180\u00b0, horizontal flip; sometimes 90\u00b0 CCW is also possible) \u2014 especially orient the 5-containing piece so 5 is at the top-left of its box. 4) Translate and pack the transformed boxes into a compact ~2\u00d72 arrangement with the 5-piece at output top-left. 5) Allow overlaps where 0 acts as transparency; avoid non-zero color collisions. 6) Crop to the final minimal rectangle (outputs show no 0 remaining).\n</transformation_summary>",

Shapes range from single pixels and small squares to large rectangular blocks, 1-cell-thick line segments, and irregular polyominoes (L/T/stepped/triangular/diamond-like). Some components have internal color 0 holes/notches, and different-colored components may touch edge-to-edge.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1) Identify non-zero components; merge edge-touching components into composite pieces (notably 5+7). 2) Crop each piece to its tight bounding box (keep internal 0 holes). 3) Re-orient pieces via rotations/reflections (seen: 90\u00b0 CW, 180\u00b0, horizontal flip; sometimes 90\u00b0 CCW is also possible) \u2014 especially orient the 5-containing piece so 5 is at the top-left of its box. 4) Translate and pack the transformed boxes into a compact ~2\u00d72 arrangement with the 5-piece at output top-left. 5) Allow overlaps where 0 acts as transparency; avoid non-zero color collisions. 6) Crop to the final minimal rectangle (outputs show no 0 remaining).\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
