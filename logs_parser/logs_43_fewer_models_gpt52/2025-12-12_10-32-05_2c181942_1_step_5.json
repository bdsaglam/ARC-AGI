            "Full raw LLM response": "**Okay, here's my plan to tackle this ARC task:**\n\nI'm starting by carefully analyzing the input and output grids provided, focusing on identifying the background color (which seems to be teal, coded as `8`), and the shapes formed by different colors. I'm taking a deep dive into the example inputs and outputs to discern the underlying transformation rules.  My main objective is to figure out how the scattered shapes in the input are assembled or rearranged to produce the output.\n\nI believe this is a \"puzzle assembly\" task. I'm hypothesizing that there's a central \"Key\" configuration or \"Hub\" in the input grid, usually defined by a central, often sparse, arrangement of colors. The other shapes, which I'm calling \"Parts\", are then moved, rotated, and connected to this Hub to create the final output. The main goal of this task is to discern the relationship between the parts and how they join the hub.\n\nTo test this idea, I'm carefully examining the geometry of the shapes and how they interact. I'm looking at their pixel counts, shape characteristics, and how they relate to each other. I'm considering translations, rotations, and possibly more complex transformations. For instance, the position of each \"Part\" in the output relative to the \"Hub\" is crucial.\n\nDuring my testing, I've observed that the Parts are typically rotated by 90 degrees clockwise (at least in my initial examples), then attached to the Hub.  I'm also looking for patterns in where the Parts are positioned relative to the Hub: are they on the top, bottom, left, or right? Is there a consistent rotation rule or a pattern?  \n\nI have to be very careful to verify my assumption about rotations. I saw in the examples, that each Part attaches in a way to \"dock\", and in some cases, the shape may overlap the \"hub\", so I'm trying to find an explanation for this. For example, if a part is rotated, and has a contact point of 1 row, but the hub is two, is it just touching or partially in the Hub.\n\nI've noted that certain Parts, often corresponding to colors present in the Hub, are transformed and assembled. Conversely, Parts without a matching color in the hub are typically discarded.\n\nI will continue to carefully evaluate each test example to discover all rules for determining the shape of the hub, the part transformations, how it interfaces with each other, and all exceptions. Then, I'll be ready to apply these rules to solve the test input.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on a set of examples. The examples show a pattern where a central \"Hub\" object (composed of multiple colors) remains in place, while other single-color \"Part\" objects scattered around the grid move to attach to the Hub. Specifically:\n\n1.  **Identify the Hub:** There is a central structure containing components of different colors. In the Test Input, the Hub is located in the middle (Rows 11-14) and consists of:\n    *   Top: Blue (`1,1`) at Row 11, Cols 14-15.\n    *   Left: Yellow (`4`s) at Rows 12-13, Col 13.\n    *   Right: Red (`2`s) at Rows 12-13, Col 16.\n    *   Bottom: Magenta (`6,6`) at Row 14, Cols 14-15.\n\n2.  **Identify Parts and Filter:** We look for isolated shapes of a single color.\n    *   Blue (`1`) Part at Top Right.\n    *   Yellow (`4`) Part at Bottom Right.\n    *   Red (`2`) Part at Left.\n    *   Magenta (`6`) Part at Bottom.\n    *   Green (`3`) Part at Left (Rows 14-16). Since the Hub contains no Green component, this part is discarded (similar to the Yellow part in Example 1).\n\n3.  **Transform and Attach Parts:** Each remaining part is rotated 90 degrees clockwise and attached to the corresponding color component of the Hub. The attachment is geometric, often filling gaps or interlocking.\n    *   **Blue Part:** Input is a symmetric diamond shape. Rotating 90\u00b0 CW preserves the shape. It attaches to the Top of the Hub (Blue `1,1`).\n        *   Position: Rows 7-10, centered horizontally on the Hub (Cols 13-15).\n    *   **Magenta Part:** Input is a 4x4 block with `6`s filling the top two rows and the right column. Rotating 90\u00b0 CW creates an 'L' shaped block (or boot shape). It attaches to the Bottom of the Hub (Magenta `6,6`).\n        *   Position: Rows 15-18. The top of the rotated part (`6,6`) aligns with the Hub's bottom (`6,6`), placing it at Cols 14-15 for the connection, with the base extending to the left.\n    *   **Red Part:** Input is a 'C' like bracket. Rotating 90\u00b0 CW produces a shape with a vertical gap on its left side. This gap fits perfectly over the vertical Red bar of the Hub.\n        *   Position: Rows 11-14. It wraps around the Hub's Red component at Col 16. The tips of the part are at Col 16 (Rows 11, 14), and the body is at Cols 17-19 (Rows 12-13).\n    *   **Yellow Part:** Input is a 'C' like bracket. Rotating 90\u00b0 CW produces a shape with a vertical gap on its right side. This gap fits over the vertical Yellow bar of the Hub.\n        *   Position: Rows 11-14. It wraps around the Hub's Yellow component at Col 13. The tips are at Col 13 (Rows 11, 14), and the body is at Cols 11-12 (Rows 12-13).\n\n4.  **Final Assembly:** The background is filled with 8s. The Hub and the transformed parts are drawn in their calculated positions.\n\noutput:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,1,1,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,6,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

My gut feeling is that it involves spatial reasoning and likely some element of object transformation (rotation/translation).\n\n**1. Observations:**\n- The grids are filled with different colored objects against a background color (teal).\n- Input grids seem scattered, while outputs show organized structures.\n- A \"hub\" structure is a recurring theme, often in the center of the grid, that seems to connect these scattered objects.\n\n**2. Deep Dive (Example 1):**\n\n*   **Initial View:** Looking at example 1, I see that I am given different shapes: red (2), green (3), and yellow (4) against the teal background (8).  I also notice a central multi-colored structure that I am going to call \"the hub\".\n*   **Hub Discovery:** The Hub is a set of colored segments around a central \"hole.\" The colors around the hub are crucial: Magenta (6) is on top, Green (3) is on the left, Red (2) is on the right, and Blue (1) is at the bottom of the hub.\n*   **Object Properties:**\n    *   The \"hub\" is fixed, the objects are movable.\n    *   The Green (3) is a U/C-like shape.\n    *   The Red (2) is a T-like shape,\n    *   The Yellow (4) is a reverse-T shape.\n*   **Clue - Example 1 output: Only Green and Red Objects were present.**\n    *   The output grid contains just the connected parts, so it's a \"selection\" and positioning process.\n*   **Forming a theory:** Based on example 1, I am deducing that if a part has a color that is also present in the hub, then the part needs to move near and \"plug\" into the matching color on the hub. If a part has a color that is not in the hub, then it is discarded. So, the green (3) object will move to the green side of the hub, and the red (2) will move to the red side of the hub.\n*   **Key Detail- The yellow part is discarded.** The yellow (4) object is not present in the output, since the hub does not have a yellow connector, so the object is discarded.\n*   **Connector Definition.** It seems like the shapes need a way to \"connect\" with the hub, and that the only way to do that is to have a flat side that will be adjacent to the hub. It also appears the part may be rotated to fit the \"plug.\"\n*   **Example 1 Analysis: Part shapes become \"plugs.\"** Let's try to find out where the \"plug\" and the \"socket\" are. The connector or \"plug\" on the Red object is on a vertical side, and the connector for the Green object is an open shape that can connect from the left.\n    *   The Green (3) object's \"plug\" is a concave shape that fits the port.\n    *   The Red (2) object's \"plug\" is a horizontal line that matches the port.\n\n**3. Generalizing the Strategy:**\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify the Hub.** Find the central fixed structure and its directional \"ports\" (colored segments).\n*   **Step 2: Identify Parts.** Find all of the moveable objects by their distinct color.\n*   **Step 3: Connect Parts.**  Try rotating each part to have it connect to its correct colored slot on the hub. if the color does not match, then the part is discarded. The shape of the \"plug\" on the part must be rotated to fit.\n*   **Step 4: The rotation.** The part needs to be oriented such that the connector touches the matching port. The rotation will be either clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n\n**4. Example 2 Walkthrough:**\n-   **Hub:** Again, there is a central hub with a blue(1), red(2), and green(3) ports. The fourth side is empty, with no matching color.\n-   **Objects:** There are the usual colors (1), (2), (3) but no (4) color.\n-   **Output:** The objects that do appear are positioned on the hub.\n    -   **Blue:** Now, the blue object is a large horizontal shape that needs to attach to the left port. I found the input and saw that the shape was wider, and so it had to be rotated to fit into the smaller\n\nThe problem requires us to assemble scattered puzzle pieces into a central \"hub\" based on color matching.\n\n**Rules inferred from examples:**\n1.  **Identify the Hub:** There is a central structure composed of four ports around a 2x2 center. Each port is a line of 2 cells with a specific color (Blue, Red, Green, Yellow, etc.). The ports are directional (Top, Bottom, Left, Right).\n2.  **Identify the Parts:** Scattered around the grid are several distinct shapes (puzzle pieces).\n3.  **Transformation (Assembly):**\n    *   For each part, determine if its color matches one of the hub's ports.\n    *   If there is a match, the part must be moved and attached to that port.\n    *   The part must be **rotated** (90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, or 270\u00b0) so that a 2-cell wide \"connector\" segment on its boundary aligns perfectly with the hub's port. The \"connector\" is usually a flat side or a protrusion that matches the port's shape.\n    *   Specifically, the part is placed such that its connector touches the hub's port.\n    *   Parts that do not have a matching colored port on the hub are discarded (e.g., the Green part in the test input has no corresponding green port on the hub).\n4.  **Output:** The final grid consists of the hub with all valid parts attached.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Hub Analysis:**\n    *   Located at the center (Rows 11-14, Cols 13-16).\n    *   **Top Port:** Blue (1), located at Row 11, Cols 14-15. Facing Up.\n    *   **Bottom Port:** Magenta (6), located at Row 14, Cols 14-15. Facing Down.\n    *   **Left Port:** Yellow (4), located at Rows 12-13, Col 13. Facing Left.\n    *   **Right Port:** Red (2), located at Rows 12-13, Col 16. Facing Right.\n\n2.  **Parts Analysis & Construction:**\n\n    *   **Blue Part (1):** Found in top right. Shape is `_1_ / 111 / 111 / _1_`.\n        *   Target: Top Port (Blue).\n        *   Action: Rotate 90\u00b0 so the `_11_` side (formerly vertical) becomes the bottom edge to connect to the horizontal port.\n        *   Placement: Attaches above the hub. Occupies Rows 8-10.\n        *   Coordinates:\n            *   Row 8: `1` at 14, 15.\n            *   Row 9: `1` at 13, 14, 15, 16.\n            *   Row 10: `1` at 14, 15.\n\n    *   **Yellow Part (4):** Found in bottom right. Shape is `4..4 / 4444 / .44.`.\n        *   Target: Left Port (Yellow).\n        *   Action: No rotation needed. The right side of the part (`4,4` on top two rows) matches the vertical port.\n        *   Placement: Attaches to the left of the hub. Occupies Rows 12-14.\n        *   Coordinates:\n            *   Row 12: `4` at 9, 12.\n            *   Row 13: `4` at 9, 10, 11, 12.\n            *   Row 14: `4` at 10, 11.\n\n    *   **Red Part (2):** Found in middle left. Shape is `_22_ / _22_ / _22_ / 2__2`.\n        *   Target: Right Port (Red).\n        *   Action: Rotate 90\u00b0 Counter-Clockwise. The top `_22_` becomes the left vertical edge `_22_` to match the right port.\n        *   Placement: Attaches to the right of the hub. Occupies Rows 11-14.\n        *   Coordinates:\n            *   Row 11: `2` at 20.\n            *   Row 12: `2` at 17, 18, 19.\n            *   Row 13: `2` at 17, 18, 19.\n            *   Row 14: `2` at 20.\n\n    *   **Magenta Part (6):** Found in bottom left. Shape is tall with `6666` in middle.\n        *   Target: Bottom Port (Magenta).\n        *   Action: Rotate 90\u00b0 Clockwise. The vertical segment `6,6` becomes the top horizontal edge to match the bottom port.\n        *   Placement: Attaches below the hub. Occupies Rows 15-18.\n        *   Coordinates:\n            *   Row 15: `6` at 14, 15.\n            *   Row 16: `6` at 14, 15.\n            *   Row 17: `6` at 14, 15.\n            *   Row 18: `6` at 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.\n\n    *   **Green Part (3):** Found in middle left.\n        *   Target: None (Hub has no Green port).\n        *   Action: Discard.\n\n3.  **Final Assembly:**\n    Combine the static hub and the transformed parts onto the grid.\n\noutput:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

The transformation moves each colored shape to extend outward from its corresponding arm on the cross, with appropriate rotation\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n\nThe cross is located at rows 10-13, cols 13-16:\n- Top arm (blue/1): row 10, cols 14-15\n- Left arm (yellow/4): rows 11-12, col 13\n- Right arm (red/2): rows 11-12, col 16  \n- Bottom arm (magenta/6): row 13, cols 14-15\n\nThe scattered shapes that need to be moved:\n- Blue (1) plus shape at rows 1-4 \u2192 extends upward\n- Red (2) shape at rows 3-6 \u2192 extends rightward\n- Yellow (4) shape at rows 14-16 \u2192 extends leftward\n- Magenta (6) plus shape at rows 17-22 \u2192 extends downward\n\nFor each shape, I rotate 90\u00b0 and position it to extend from its corresponding arm.\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,1,1,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,6,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

Everything not used in the final construction becomes background.\n\n2. **Find the \u201chub\u201d**: a **2\u00d72 block of background** surrounded by four **2-cell bars**:\n   - **Top bar**: 2 adjacent cells (horizontal)\n   - **Bottom bar**: 2 adjacent cells (horizontal)\n   - **Left bar**: 2 adjacent cells (vertical)\n   - **Right bar**: 2 adjacent cells (vertical)\n\n   This hub stays **fixed in place**.\n\n3. For each of the four hub-side colors:\n   - Collect **all cells of that color that are NOT part of the hub bar** (they may be disconnected; treat them together as one pattern).\n   - Take their **tight bounding box** (the shape pattern).\n   - On that pattern, find the **connector side**: the outer side of the bounding box that contains a **run of exactly 2 adjacent cells** (typically centered, like `0XX0` on an edge).\n   - **Rotate** the whole pattern in 90\u00b0 steps so that this connector side faces the hub:\n     - attaching to **top** of hub \u2192 connector must be on the **bottom** of the pattern  \n     - attaching to **bottom** of hub \u2192 connector on the **top**\n     - attaching to **left** of hub \u2192 connector on the **right**\n     - attaching to **right** of hub \u2192 connector on the **left**\n   - **Translate** the rotated pattern so its connector cells sit **one cell away** from the hub bar and **align exactly** with the two hub-bar cells.\n\n4. **All other colors** (not used as hub-side colors) are removed (set to background).\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\n- Hub hole (2\u00d72 of `8`) is at **rows 12\u201313, cols 15\u201316**.\n- Hub bars:\n  - **Top**: color `1` at (11,15\u201316)\n  - **Bottom**: color `6` at (14,15\u201316)\n  - **Left**: color `4` at (12\u201313,14)\n  - **Right**: color `2` at (12\u201313,17)\n\nExternal shapes are rotated and attached:\n- Color `1` pattern: connector on **right** \u2192 rotate **90\u00b0 CW** \u2192 attach **above** hub.\n- Color `2` pattern: connector on **top** \u2192 rotate **90\u00b0 CCW** \u2192 attach **right** of hub.\n- Color `4` pattern: connector on **bottom** \u2192 rotate **90\u00b0 CCW** \u2192 attach **left** of hub.\n- Color `6` pattern: connector on **left** \u2192 rotate **90\u00b0 CW** \u2192 attach **below** hub.\n\nEverything else becomes `8`.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* A unique small 4-color cluster with a 1-cell empty center acts as the anchor/hub.\n* The four colors\u2019 positions around the hub (top/bottom/left/right) define where same-colored larger pieces are placed in the output.\n* Only colors present in the hub survive; extra-color objects are removed.\n* Missing same-colored large pieces can leave just the hub\u2019s small indicator pixel for that direction; the hub\u2019s central hole stays empty.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that

            "Full raw LLM response": "**The Essence of Hub-Driven Transformations**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The task is to figure out a transformation rule applied to various shapes within a grid, based on a few examples. It looks like we're dealing with a central \"hub\" that acts as an anchor, and the shapes are somehow rearranged around it. My primary goal is to decipher this relationship.\n\nThe key is this recurring \"hub\" - a small, distinct configuration of four different colors surrounding an empty central area. It's a cross-like shape with a 2x2 hole in the middle. The color arrangement in this hub appears to dictate the placement of larger, similar-colored shapes in the output. Objects that are *not* present as part of the hub don't get represented. The hub itself stays fixed.\n\nI've noticed something consistent: objects surrounding the hub seem to *dock* or *attach* to the faces of the hub that have matching colors. The trick is to find the proper orientation and that's tricky to sort. To align the side which is of size 2, or if none, the longest.\n\nMy approach:\n\n1.  **Hub Identification:** First, pinpoint the hub. Find that 2x2 empty center with those four specific colors in the 'cross' pattern.\n2.  **Object Detection:** Next, I'll identify all colored objects in the input, excluding the hub itself.\n3.  **Color Filtering:** Keep only those objects that share a color with the hub's component colors. Discard those that don't match.\n4.  **Transformation & Placement:** This is where the magic happens.\n    *   For each object, determine where it needs to go relative to the hub. It will be near a face of the Hub.\n    *   **Rotation is key**: We might have to rotate the object to allow it to \"touch\" the hub's face, usually the longest or a face of length 2.\n    *   **Attachment**:  Place the transformed object so it connects with the designated hub face. This attachment also has an implied alignment with respect to the hub's center, generally favoring the top of an element.\n\nI think the important thing to think about is the concept of shape and position is relative to the hub itself, and it acts as an anchor to other shapes. I just need to solidify those steps.\n\n\nTo solve this task, we identify a \"hub\" structure in the grid that dictates how other objects are transformed and placed.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Hub**\nScanning the input grid, we look for a characteristic 4-color cluster surrounding a 2x2 empty center.\nIn the test input, this structure is found centered at Rows 12-13 and Columns 14-15 (using 0-based indexing for calculations, but the grid logic is relative).\nThe hub components are:\n- **Top** (Row 11, Cols 14-15): Blue (1).\n- **Bottom** (Row 14, Cols 14-15): Magenta (6).\n- **Left** (Rows 12-13, Col 13): Yellow (4).\n- **Right** (Rows 12-13, Col 16): Red (2).\nThe center (Rows 12-13, Cols 14-15) is empty (color 8).\n\n**Step 2: Identify and Filter Objects**\nWe locate colored shapes in the grid matching the hub's colors. Other colors (like Green 3) are ignored.\n- **Blue (1)**: Located at top-left. Shape: a cross/diamond `1` over `111` over `111` over `1`.\n- **Magenta (6)**: Located at bottom-center. Shape: `6` over `6` over `6666` over `6666` over `6` over `6`.\n- **Yellow (4)**: Located at bottom-right. Shape: `4..4` over `4444` over `.44.`.\n- **Red (2)**: Located at top-left/center. Shape: `22` over `22` over `22` over `2 2`.\n\n**Step 3: Transform and Place Objects**\nFor each object, we move it to attach to the corresponding face of the hub. We rotate the object so that a side of length 2 (matching the hub's connection interface) faces the hub.\n\n1.  **Blue (Top):**\n    - Target: Attach to Hub Top (Row 11).\n    - Hub Face is Horizontal (width 2).\n    - Object Sides: Top/Bottom are width 1. Left/Right are width 2.\n    - Transformation: Rotate 90 degrees so a width-2 side faces the hub. The shape `0110` / `1111` / `0110` (rotated) fits perfectly.\n    - Placement: Above the hub at Rows 8-10, Cols 13-16.\n\n2.  **Magenta (Bottom):**\n    - Target: Attach to Hub Bottom (Row 14).\n    - Hub Face is Horizontal (width 2).\n    - Object Sides: Top/Bottom width 1. Left/Right (middle section) width 2.\n    - Transformation: Rotate 90 degrees. The new Top side will be width 2 (`001100`).\n    - Placement: Below the hub at Rows 15-17, Cols 12-17.\n\n3.  **Yellow (Left):**\n    - Target: Attach to Hub Left (Col 13).\n    - Hub Face is Vertical (height 2).\n    - Object Sides: Right side is height 2 (`110` pattern relative to the 3-row height).\n    - Transformation: No rotation needed; Right side already matches.\n    - Placement: Left of the hub at Rows 12-14, Cols 9-12.\n\n4.  **Red (Right):**\n    - Target: Attach to Hub Right (Col 16).\n    - Hub Face is Vertical (height 2).\n    - Object Sides: Left side height 4. Top side width 2.\n    - Transformation: Rotate 90 degrees Counter-Clockwise so the Top side (`22`) becomes the Left side facing the hub.\n    - Placement: Right of the hub at Rows 12-14, Cols 17-20.\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\nWe reconstruct the grid with the background color (8), place the preserved hub pixels, and draw the transformed objects in their new positions.\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* A unique small 4-color cluster with a 1-cell empty center acts as the anchor/hub.\n* The four colors\u2019 positions around the hub (top/bottom/left/right) define where same-colored larger pieces are placed in the output.\n* Only colors present in the hub survive; extra-color objects are removed.\n* Missing same-colored large pieces can leave just the hub\u2019s small indicator pixel for that direction; the hub\u2019s central hole stays empty.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to identify the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1. **Find the Hub**: There's a small 4-color cluster with a 2x2 empty center (forming a cross/diamond pattern with 4 different colors positioned at TOP, BOTTOM, LEFT, RIGHT).\n\n2. **Hub Colors Define Placement**: Each color's position in the hub (top/bottom/left/right) indicates where the corresponding larger shape of that same color should be placed.\n\n3. **Shapes are Transformed**: The larger shapes are rotated so their \"connecting edge\" (the edge that will touch the hub) has cells matching the hub marker pattern (2 cells).\n\n4. **Non-hub Colors Removed**: Any colored object whose color isn't in the hub is removed.\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\nHub location (rows 10-13, cols 13-16):\n- TOP (row 10, cols 14-15): color 1\n- LEFT (rows 11-12, col 13): color 4  \n- RIGHT (rows 11-12, col 16): color 2\n- BOTTOM (row 13, cols 14-15): color 6\n\nColor 3 is NOT in the hub \u2192 its shape is removed.\n\n**Transformations:**\n- **Color 1** (TOP): Rotate 90\u00b0 CCW \u2192 place above hub (rows 7-9)\n- **Color 4** (LEFT): Rotate 90\u00b0 CCW \u2192 place left of hub (cols 10-12)\n- **Color 2** (RIGHT): Rotate 90\u00b0 CCW \u2192 place right of hub (cols 17-20)\n- **Color 6** (BOTTOM): Rotate 90\u00b0 CW \u2192 place below hub (rows 14-17)\n\nEach rotation ensures the connecting edge has the correct 2-cell pattern matching the hub markers.\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* A unique small 4-color cluster with a 1-cell empty center acts as the anchor/hub.\n* The four colors\u2019 positions around the hub (top/bottom/left/right) define where same-colored larger pieces are placed in the output.\n* Only colors present in the hub survive; extra-color objects are removed.\n* Missing same-colored large pieces can leave just the hub\u2019s small indicator pixel for that direction; the hub\u2019s central hole stays empty.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred rule (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Find the hub**: a unique small cluster made of **4 different colors** arranged **top/left/right/bottom** around an **empty center** (here it\u2019s a 2\u00d72 empty hole).  \n2. **Only those 4 hub-colors remain** in the output. Every other colored object is removed.\n3. For each of the 4 hub-colors:\n   - Locate the **largest connected component** of that color **outside the hub** (the \u201clarge piece\u201d).\n   - **Rotate** that large piece (by 0/90/180/270\u00b0) so that the side that will touch the hub has a **straight length\u20112 edge** matching the hub\u2019s indicator domino orientation (horizontal for top/bottom, vertical for left/right).\n   - **Move** (translate) it so it sits **one cell outward** from the hub\u2019s indicator in that direction, aligned so the two indicator cells are exactly adjacent to the matching edge.\n   - If a color had no large piece, you\u2019d just keep the small hub indicator for that side (not needed here).\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\nThe hub is at rows 11\u201314 / cols 14\u201317 with:\n- **Top = 1**, **Left = 4**, **Right = 2**, **Bottom = 6** (center stays empty).\nSo we keep only colors **{1,2,4,6}**, rotate/attach each largest piece to its side of the hub, and delete all other colors (like 3).\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

            "Full raw LLM response": "## 1. Describe the observable structures (literal)\n\nAcross all three pairs:\n\n- **Background** is a uniform light-cyan color in both inputs and outputs.\n- Each **input** contains several **disconnected colored components** (polyomino-like shapes):\n  - One component is **small and multi-colored**, made of **four different colors** arranged around a **single background-colored cell** (a 1-cell \u201chole\u201d/gap in the middle of that cluster).\n  - The other components are **larger, single-colored shapes** (each a connected blob of one color), scattered in different areas.\n- Each **output** keeps the same background color and grid size, but the colored content changes:\n  - The scattered single-colored shapes are **no longer in their original positions**.\n  - A **single larger connected arrangement** appears, where multiple colored pieces are now **adjacent/connected** near where the small multi-colored cluster is.\n  - Some shapes/colors that existed in the input may **disappear** (e.g., one input has a yellow shape that is not present in its output).\n\nPair-specific observable notes:\n\n- **Input 1** has a small 4-color cluster (with a 1-cell hole), plus separate larger shapes including a **yellow** one; **Output 1** shows an assembled cluster using several colors but **no yellow** shape.\n- **Input 2** has the small 4-color cluster and several single-color shapes; **Output 2** shows them arranged into one connected structure around the small cluster/hole.\n- **Input 3** similarly has the small 4-color cluster plus four single-color shapes; **Output 3** shows a cross-like connected structure combining them.\n\n## 2. Identify transformation categories\n\n- **Object movement**: **present**\n- **Object recoloring**: **absent** (colors appear preserved)\n- **Bordering / outlining**: **absent**\n- **Filling holes or cavities**: **absent/maybe** (the central \u201chole\u201d in the small cluster appears to remain a hole)\n- **Removing noise / extracting main shape**: **present** (some input objects vanish)\n- **Copying / pasting / repositioning**: **present** (objects are repositioned; no clear duplication)\n- **Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center)**: **present** (the small multi-color cluster behaves like a focal point)\n- **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors**: **maybe** (the small multi-color cluster uses distinct colors, but frequency logic isn\u2019t explicit)\n- **Size-based filtering or selection**: **maybe** (if multiple same-color objects existed, selection might matter; not shown clearly here)\n- **Symmetry or reflection operations**: **maybe** (rotation/reflection is not clearly provable from the sketch, but could be involved)\n- **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion**: **absent**\n- **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping**: **absent**\n\n## 3. Key non-obvious insights (crucial)\n\n1. The **only multi-colored object** (4 colors around a 1-cell gap) behaves like a **structural reference**: outputs place other objects relative to it rather than keeping their original scattered layout.\n2. The **output\u2019s palette** matches the **four colors present in the small reference cluster**; any object whose color is **not** in that cluster can be **dropped** (seen with the extra yellow piece in Input 1 disappearing).\n3. The **relative positions of the four colors inside the small cluster** (which color is on the \u201cleft/right/top/bottom\u201d around the gap) appear to determine **where the corresponding larger same-colored shape ends up** in the final assembled structure.\n4. The **central gap** in the small cluster is consistently treated as a **hub**: the final arrangement forms around it and does **not** fill it.\n5. If a color appears in the small cluster but there is **no separate larger object** of that color, the output can still show just the **small indicator part** for that direction (i.e., that \u201carm\u201d remains minimal).\n\n## 4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)\n\nIdentify the small 4-color \u201chub\u201d cluster that surrounds a 1-cell empty center. Treat the four colored positions around the center as a blueprint for assembling: for each of those colors, take the separate object(s) of the same color and move (and possibly rotate, if needed) it so it attaches to the hub on the corresponding side. Remove any objects whose colors are not part of the hub\u2019s four colors; keep the hub\u2019s central hole empty.\n\n(Alternative family if rotation is not used: pieces are only **translated**, preserving orientation, and simply \u201csnapped\u201d onto the hub-side indicated by the matching color.)\n\n## 5. Checks to perform when solving\n\n1. **Locate the hub**: verify there is exactly one small multi-colored cluster with a **single background cell** enclosed/adjacent as the center.\n2. **Map directions to colors**: record which color is **north/south/east/west** of the hub\u2019s central hole.\n3. For each hub color, **find the external object** of that color (if multiple, test \u201clargest\u201d or \u201cclosest-to-hub\u201d selection).\n4. Determine the **attachment rule**: does the moved piece **overlap** the hub\u2019s colored pixel (replacing it) or does it attach **adjacent** while keeping the hub pixel?\n5. **Test rotation necessity** by comparing input vs output orientations of the moved pieces; confirm whether side (N/E/S/W) implies a rotation.\n\n## 6. Summarize final insights\n\nHINT_START\n* A unique small 4-color cluster with a 1-cell empty center acts as the anchor/hub.\n* The four colors\u2019 positions around the hub (top/bottom/left/right) define where same-colored larger pieces are placed in the output.\n* Only colors present in the hub survive; extra-color objects are removed.\n* Missing same-colored large pieces can leave just the hub\u2019s small indicator pixel for that direction; the hub\u2019s central hole stays empty.\nHINT_END",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nUniform background of color 8 with multiple separated, monochrome foreground objects in colors 1/2/3/4/6/7. Object shapes include single pixels, short horizontal/vertical bars (often 1\u00d72), small filled rectangles (e.g., 2\u00d72 and 2\u00d7N), larger irregular polyominoes with protrusions/indentations (T/cross/stepped-like), and occasional hollow/frame-like forms; all axis-aligned and typically non-touching.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nKeep background 8 and locate the 2\u00d72 hole of 8 surrounded by four 1\u00d72/2\u00d71 bars (four non-8 colors). Only those four bar colors remain; all other non-8 colors are converted to 8. For each of the four kept colors, remove its other objects from their old locations and relocate them to attach to the corresponding side of the frame (top/left/right/bottom), using rotations (90/180/270) and/or reflections as needed so the attaching edge matches a length-2 segment aligned with the anchor bar; then translate to touch the bar while keeping the central 2\u00d72 of 8 empty.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Understanding the ARC task and developing a solution strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task based on examples. The goal is to transform an input grid. It seems the key is identifying and manipulating certain foreground objects in relation to a background color (teal, or 8).\n\nFrom the examples, I see a common structure: a central \"hub\" and satellite objects. My strategy will be:\n\n1.  **Identify the Hub**: This seems to be a 2x2 hole (color 8) surrounded by four bars of non-8 colors. These bars form a frame around the hole.\n2.  **Clear the Grid**: Set all non-hub elements to 8.\n3.  **Process Satellites**: Examine non-hub objects, or \"satellites\", in the grid.\n    *   If a satellite color isn't one of the hub bar colors, it gets erased (becomes 8).\n    *   If a satellite color *is* a hub color, it needs to be attached to its corresponding bar.\n4.  **Satellite Transformation**: For attaching satellites to bars:\n    *   Find the side of the satellite that can connect contiguously with the bar's two pixels.\n    *   The satellites need to be rotated (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees) to get that side to the hub bar's side.\n    *   Then, translate the shape to touch the hub's pixel bar.\n\nThis is a general structure. I'll need to check the examples to solidify this further. Example 1 shows the hub clearly, with objects attached to it. Example 2 seems similar. Example 3 has a more complex structure, so it's a good test case.\n\n**Analyzing the examples and refining the transformation rules**\n\nLooking closer, I'm identifying key points.\n\n*   The hub always stays put.\n*   Satellites either get removed or have their shape attached to a bar.\n*   The connection must be two pixels. In Example 2 and 3 it's always this way.\n*   The satellite shape might need a simple rotation.\n\nMy revised thinking: I'll need to locate each hub bar by its coordinates and color. Then search for the unique \"satellite\" color (excluding the background color 8 and the hub's colors). Then, to get attachment, for that \"satellite\" shape, I will:\n\n1.  Extract the satellite as a subgrid, ignoring the background.\n2.  Rotate the satellite 0, 90, 180 or 270 and check where it might contact the bar.\n3.  Find a contiguous length 2 edge of the satellite.\n4.  That edge is translated to the hub bar.\n\n**Specific implementation details and application to the test case**\n\nTo make this practical, I'll need:\n\n1.  **Hub Discovery**: Scan the grid to find the 2x2 hole and its surrounding bars.\n2.  **Extraction**: Extract satellite objects as sub-grids.\n3.  **Rotation & matching rule**: To find the right side for contacting the hub bar.\n4.  **Translation**: Then, the shape will need to be positioned to touch the bar.\n\nAfter reviewing, I apply this to the test input.\n\n1.  Identify hub location, bar colors and coordinates.\n2.  Extract the satellites for each bar color.\n3.  For each satellite, perform rotations:\n    *   For the Top bar (color 1), I'll rotate 90 degrees clockwise (the original right side should align on the top side of the bar).\n    *   For the Bottom bar (color 6), I'll also rotate 90 degrees clockwise (the original left side becomes top).\n    *   For the Left bar (color 4), no rotation is needed.\n    *   For the Right bar (color 2), I'll rotate 270 degrees clockwise, as a result the top side goes to left and attaches at that side.\n4.  Finally I draw the new satellites and hub.\n\n\nTo solve this ARC task, I will follow a procedure based on the \"hub and satellites\" pattern observed in the examples.\n\n**1. Identify the Hub**\nThe grid contains a central structure (the \"Hub\") consisting of a 2x2 empty center (color 8) surrounded by four bars of length 2. I will locate this hub in the test input.\n- Scanning the input grid, I found the 2x2 center of 8s at Rows 11-12, Columns 14-15 (0-indexed).\n- **Top Bar:** Color **1** at Row 10, Columns 14-15.\n- **Bottom Bar:** Color **6** at Row 13, Columns 14-15.\n- **Left Bar:** Color **4** at Rows 11-12, Column 13.\n- **Right Bar:** Color **2** at Rows 11-12, Column 16.\n\n**2. Isolate and Transform Satellites**\nFor each of the four colors (1, 6, 4, 2), I will find the corresponding \"satellite\" object elsewhere in the grid, determine the necessary rotation to attach it to the hub, and place it in the output. The attachment rule requires a side of the object's shape to have a contiguous length-2 segment that matches the hub's bar.\n\n- **Top Satellite (Color 1):**\n  - **Original Shape:** Found at Rows 1-4, Columns 17-19. It is a cross-like shape with a wider center.\n  - **Target:** Attach to the Top Bar (horizontal).\n  - **Transformation:** The original Right side of the shape (cols 2-3 of the shape) is `1` over `1` (length 2). To face the Bottom (to touch the Top Bar from above), we rotate the shape **90 degrees clockwise**.\n  - **Resulting Shape:**\n    Row 8: `1, 1, 1, 1` (Cols 13-16)\n    Row 9: `8, 1, 1, 8` (Cols 13-16) \u2014 The `1,1` at Cols 14-15 touches the bar.\n\n- **Bottom Satellite (Color 6):**\n  - **Original Shape:** Found at Rows 19-22, Columns 9-12. A 4x4 block with some empty corners.\n  - **Target:** Attach to the Bottom Bar (horizontal).\n  - **Transformation:** The original Left side (Row 19-20, Col 9) is length 2 (`6,6`). To face the Top (to touch the Bottom Bar from below), we rotate the shape **90 degrees clockwise** (Left becomes Top).\n  - **Resulting Shape:**\n    Row 14: `6, 6` (Cols 14-15) \u2014 Touches the bar.\n    Row 15: `6, 6` (Cols 14-15)\n    Row 16: `6, 6` (Cols 14-15)\n    Row 17: `6, 6, 6, 6` (Cols 14-17)\n\n- **Left Satellite (Color 4):**\n  - **Original Shape:** Found at Rows 14-16, Columns 20-23.\n  - **Target:** Attach to the Left Bar (vertical).\n  - **Transformation:** The original Right side (Rows 14-15, Col 23) is length 2 (`4` over `4`). To face the Right (to touch the Left Bar from the left), no rotation is needed (Right side is already facing right).\n  - **Resulting Shape:**\n    Row 11: `4, 8, 8, 4` (Cols 9-12) \u2014 The `4` at Col 12 touches the bar.\n    Row 12: `4, 4, 4, 4` (Cols 9-12) \u2014 The `4` at Col 12 touches the bar.\n    Row 13: `8, 4, 4, 8` (Cols 9-12)\n\n- **Right Satellite (Color 2):**\n  - **Original Shape:** Found at Rows 3-6, Columns 3-5 (or derived coordinates). It is an \"Omega\" or headphones shape.\n  - **Target:** Attach to the Right Bar (vertical).\n  - **Transformation:** The original Top side is length 2 (`2,2`). To face the Left (to touch the Right Bar from the right), we rotate the shape **270 degrees clockwise** (or 90 CCW). Top becomes Left.\n  - **Resulting Shape:**\n    Row 9: `8, 8, 8, 2` (Cols 17-20)\n    Row 10: `8, 8, 8, 8`\n    Row 11: `2, 2, 2, 8` (Cols 17-20) \u2014 The `2` at Col 17 touches the bar.\n    Row 12: `2, 2, 2, 2` (Cols 17-20) \u2014 The `2` at Col 17 touches the bar.\n\n**3. Construct Output**\nI will start with a grid of 8s, draw the Hub at its original location, and then draw the transformed satellites at their calculated positions.\n\noutput:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nUniform background of color 8 with multiple separated, monochrome foreground objects in colors 1/2/3/4/6/7. Object shapes include single pixels, short horizontal/vertical bars (often 1\u00d72), small filled rectangles (e.g., 2\u00d72 and 2\u00d7N), larger irregular polyominoes with protrusions/indentations (T/cross/stepped-like), and occasional hollow/frame-like forms; all axis-aligned and typically non-touching.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nKeep background 8 and locate the 2\u00d72 hole of 8 surrounded by four 1\u00d72/2\u00d71 bars (four non-8 colors). Only those four bar colors remain; all other non-8 colors are converted to 8. For each of the four kept colors, remove its other objects from their old locations and relocate them to attach to the corresponding side of the frame (top/left/right/bottom), using rotations (90/180/270) and/or reflections as needed so the attaching edge matches a length-2 segment aligned with the anchor bar; then translate to touch the bar while keeping the central 2\u00d72 of 8 empty.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to:\n1. Find the central frame structure (a 2\u00d72 hole of 8s surrounded by four 1\u00d72/2\u00d71 bars of different colors)\n2. Identify which shapes correspond to each frame color\n3. Transform and attach those shapes to the frame, removing all other objects\n\n**Finding the Frame:**\nIn the test input, I can see the frame at rows 10-13, cols 13-16:\n- Top bar (color 1): row 10, cols 14-15\n- Left bar (color 4): rows 11-12, col 13\n- Right bar (color 2): rows 11-12, col 16\n- Bottom bar (color 6): row 13, cols 14-15\n- Center 2\u00d72: rows 11-12, cols 14-15 (all 8s)\n\n**Identifying Associated Shapes:**\n- Color 1: rows 1-4, cols 17-19 (plus-like shape)\n- Color 4: rows 14-16, cols 20-23\n- Color 2: rows 3-6, cols 2-5\n- Color 6: rows 17-22, cols 9-12 (cross-like shape)\n\n**Transformations:**\n- **Top (1)**: Rotate 90\u00b0 CW to get shape with bottom edge matching bar. Position rows 8-10, cols 13-16.\n- **Left (4)**: Rotate 90\u00b0 CCW so right edge has 1s at middle rows.

Object shapes include single pixels, short horizontal/vertical bars (often 1\u00d72), small filled rectangles (e.g., 2\u00d72 and 2\u00d7N), larger irregular polyominoes with protrusions/indentations (T/cross/stepped-like), and occasional hollow/frame-like forms; all axis-aligned and typically non-touching.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nKeep background 8 and locate the 2\u00d72 hole of 8 surrounded by four 1\u00d72/2\u00d71 bars (four non-8 colors). Only those four bar colors remain; all other non-8 colors are converted to 8. For each of the four kept colors, remove its other objects from their old locations and relocate them to attach to the corresponding side of the frame (top/left/right/bottom), using rotations (90/180/270) and/or reflections as needed so the attaching edge matches a length-2 segment aligned with the anchor bar; then translate to touch the bar while keeping the central 2\u00d72 of 8 empty.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "### How the transformation works (inferred from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Find the special \u201cframe\u201d**: a **2\u00d72 block of background color 8** that is surrounded on its four sides by four **length\u20112 bars** (each bar is 1\u00d72 or 2\u00d71) in **four different non\u20118 colors**:\n   - one bar above (top),\n   - one below (bottom),\n   - one to the left (left),\n   - one to the right (right).\n\n2. **Only keep those four colors** (the colors of the four bars).  \n   Every other non\u20118 color in the grid is turned into 8.\n\n3. For each of the four kept colors:\n   - Keep the **bar** that is part of the frame in its original place.\n   - Take **all other pixels** of that color elsewhere in the grid, and **move them** to the corresponding side of the frame:\n     - the top-color object attaches **above** the top bar,\n     - the bottom-color object attaches **below** the bottom bar,\n     - the left-color object attaches **left** of the left bar,\n     - the right-color object attaches **right** of the right bar.\n   - You may **rotate/reflect** the moved shape so that the side that touches the bar matches a **length\u20112 attaching segment**, then translate it so it **touches** the bar while the central 2\u00d72 hole stays 8.\n\n---\n\n### Applying this to the test input\n\n- The unique 2\u00d72 hole of 8 is at **rows 11\u201312, cols 14\u201315** (0\u2011indexed).\n- The surrounding bars are:\n  - **Top bar**: color **1** at row 10, cols 14\u201315\n  - **Left bar**: color **4** at rows 11\u201312, col 13\n  - **Right bar**: color **2** at rows 11\u201312, col 16\n  - **Bottom bar**: color **6** at row 13, cols 14\u201315\n\nSo we remove all **3s**, and relocate the other objects of colors **1,2,4,6** to attach to their respective sides (with rotations as needed).\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

Objects Description\nUniform background of color 8 with multiple separated, monochrome foreground objects in colors 1/2/3/4/6/7. Object shapes include single pixels, short horizontal/vertical bars (often 1\u00d72), small filled rectangles (e.g., 2\u00d72 and 2\u00d7N), larger irregular polyominoes with protrusions/indentations (T/cross/stepped-like), and occasional hollow/frame-like forms; all axis-aligned and typically non-touching.",
                "response": "1) **Preserve the grid size and background**\n- Output grid dimensions stay the same as the input.\n- All cells are background color **8** unless occupied by the transformed/kept foreground pixels.\n\n2) **Detect the \u201canchor frame\u201d (the key structure)**\n- Find a **2\u00d72 block of color 8** (an empty \u201chole\u201d) that is **orthogonally surrounded** by four small bars:\n  - **Top bar:** a **1\u00d72** horizontal segment (non-8 color)\n  - **Bottom bar:** a **1\u00d72** horizontal segment (non-8 color)\n  - **Left bar:** a **2\u00d71** vertical segment (non-8 color)\n  - **Right bar:** a **2\u00d71** vertical segment (non-8 color)\n- These four bars define **exactly 4 \u201cselected colors\u201d**: the colors used by the top/left/right/bottom bars.\n- The 2\u00d72 hole of **8** and these four bars remain in the same location in the output (they act as anchors).\n\n3) **Color filtering / deletion**\n- **All objects whose colors are NOT one of the 4 anchor-frame colors are removed** (their pixels become **8**).\n- This explains cases where a color present in the input disappears completely in the output.\n\n4) **Per-color aggregation (merge same-colored objects)**\nFor each of the 4 anchor-frame colors:\n- Keep the pixels of that color that already form its anchor bar (top/left/right/bottom of the hole).\n- Find **all other disconnected objects** of that same color elsewhere in the input.\n- Those extra objects are **removed from their original locations** (set to **8**) and **relocated** near the anchor frame, effectively **merging** all pixels of that color into a single connected cluster attached to the anchor bar.\n\n5) **Directional attachment rule (where the moved objects go)**\n- If the color is the **top bar color**, move its other object(s) to the region **above** the top bar.\n- If the color is the **bottom bar color**, move its other object(s) to the region **below** the bottom bar.\n- If the color is the **left bar color**, move its other object(s) to the region **left** of the left bar.\n- If the color is the **right bar color**, move its other object(s) to the region **right** of the right bar.\n- The moved object(s) are positioned so they **touch** (are 4-connected to) the anchor bar; the central **2\u00d72** hole of **8** is **not filled**.\n\n6) **Rotation / reflection of moved objects (shape preserved under rigid transforms)**\n- Before attaching, moved objects may be **rotated** (commonly **90** or **180** degrees; sometimes effectively **270**) and/or **reflected**, to make them \u201cfit\u201d the side they attach to.\n- The consistent constraint is: the moved object is oriented so that the side facing the anchor bar presents a **contiguous run of length 2** aligned with the anchor bar:\n  - For **left/right** attachments: the edge facing the anchor has a **2-pixel vertical segment** aligned with the anchor\u2019s two rows.\n  - For **top/bottom** attachments: the edge facing the anchor has a **2-pixel horizontal segment** aligned with the anchor\u2019s two columns.\n- After orientation, the object is **translated** so that this length-2 edge aligns and touches the anchor bar.\n\n7) **No recoloring**\n- Foreground colors themselves do not change: pixels keep their original non-8 color; only **position/orientation** changes.\n- Total pixel counts for each kept anchor color are conserved (pixels are moved, not created/deleted), while non-anchor colors are deleted to **8**.\n\n<transformation_summary>\nKeep background 8 and locate the 2\u00d72 hole of 8 surrounded by four 1\u00d72/2\u00d71 bars (four non-8 colors).

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nUniform background of color 8 with multiple separated, monochrome foreground objects in colors 1/2/3/4/6/7. Object shapes include single pixels, short horizontal/vertical bars (often 1\u00d72), small filled rectangles (e.g., 2\u00d72 and 2\u00d7N), larger irregular polyominoes with protrusions/indentations (T/cross/stepped-like), and occasional hollow/frame-like forms; all axis-aligned and typically non-touching.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nKeep background 8 and locate the 2\u00d72 hole of 8 surrounded by four 1\u00d72/2\u00d71 bars (four non-8 colors). Only those four bar colors remain; all other non-8 colors are converted to 8. For each of the four kept colors, remove its other objects from their old locations and relocate them to attach to the corresponding side of the frame (top/left/right/bottom), using rotations (90/180/270) and/or reflections as needed so the attaching edge matches a length-2 segment aligned with the anchor bar; then translate to touch the bar while keeping the central 2\u00d72 of 8 empty.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
