        "Full raw LLM response": "**General Strategy and Observations for ARC Task**\n\nI'm analyzing ARC tasks, focusing on a pattern-recognition challenge. The typical setup involves large input grids (30x30 or similar) and smaller output grids (5x5 or 4x4). I've observed that the inputs often contain repeating patterns, noise, and specific, prominent regions within them.\n\nMy initial approach involves breaking down Example 1 and Example 2, looking for consistent elements like recurring colors, shapes (squares, boxes), and patterns. The size discrepancy between input and output strongly hints at a feature extraction or compression process. I'm hypothesizing that distinct \"boxes\" or \"tiles\" within the input are being extracted and combined in some way to form the output. I'm focusing on trying to find the process of identifying boxes.\n\n**In-depth analysis of example 1**.\n\nMy method involves scanning the input for box-like structures, defined by consistent borders (often a single color) and inner content. Using the numerical values within the input grid, I extract the inner dimensions of each of these boxes. I quickly recognize that the color `4` forms a border. I note that there seem to be 4 boxes that I have found.\n\nI then look at the output examples for Example 1. Given that there are several boxes in the Input 1, it's clear the output 1 can't show all the information in the input.\n\n**Hypothesis: Mapping Boxes to Output**.\nI believe that the output grid is a result of overlaying/combining the contents of one or more extracted boxes. This involves identifying specific transformations (color mappings, rotations, etc.) applied to the box content before it is merged into the output.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis**.\nI identify four boxes, each defined by a border of `4`s. The inner box structure is 5x5. I extracted the contents of each box.\n- One notable example is the mapping of `1`s from a box to a `2` in the output. This suggests a transformation of color.\n\n**Mapping, combining the shapes in Output 1.**\nBased on the mapping, I hypothesize that 2 or more of the boxes combine using a transformation, such as horizontal mirroring.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis, Color mapping, Structure**.\nExample 2 has `8` as the border. Its inner structure is 4x4.\nMy process finds that I've found multiple boxes in the input data. The output is a simple structure of 0s and 2s.\n\n**Further Analysis**.\nCombining this with output, I form another hypothesis about how the values in the inner portion of the extracted boxes influence the overall structure of the outputs.\n\n**Test Input Analysis, Building an Output for the Test Case**.\nI'm now applying this learning to a new test input, which looks similar to the prior examples. It contains similar boxes. I extract 3 of these boxes.\n\n-   Box 1 has a structure.\n-   Box 2 has all 0s\n-   Box 3 has a shape structure.\n-   I see it has border 5.\n-   Colors 2, 8, 4, and 1 show up in different boxes.\n\nI then combine these with an overlay logic that determines the output.\n\n**Final Solution for Test Input**\nBased on this, I now believe I can build a solution for the test output:\n\nMapping:\n1 -> 2\n4 -> 2\n8 -> 0\n2 -> 2\n\n**Output Structure**:\nA grid (5 x 5) with a distinctive pattern of 0s and 2s that can be formed from an overlay of the boxes extracted, and with this mapping.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a large grid into a small 5x5 grid.\nAnalysis of the examples reveals the following pattern:\n1.  **Identify Regions of Interest (Boxes):** The input grid contains four potential 7x7 regions (or similarly sized) that are defined by a border of a specific color.\n    *   In Example 1, the border color is `4`. The regions are Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), Bottom-Right (BR). The inner content is 5x5.\n    *   In Example 2, the border color is `8`. The inner content is 4x4 (borders are 6x6).\n    *   In the Test Input, the border color is `5` (based on rows of 5s surrounding regions). There are three clear regions: TL, BL, BR. The TR region is empty (all 0s). The inner content is 5x5.\n\n2.  **Extract Inner Content:**\n    *   **TL Box:** Contains a cross shape of `1`s with an `8` in the center.\n        ```\n        0 0 0 0 0\n        0 0 1 0 0\n        0 1 8 1 0\n        0 0 1 0 0\n        0 0 0 0 0\n        ```\n    *   **BL Box:** Contains a pattern of `1`s and `8`s. `8`s are at corners and `1`s are at the mid-points of the quadrant edges.\n        ```\n        8 1 8 1 8\n        1 8 0 8 1\n        8 0 0 0 8\n        1 8 0 8 1\n        8 1 8 1 8\n        ```\n    *   **BR Box:** Contains a cross shape of `4`s with a `2` in the center.\n        ```\n        0 0 0 0 0\n        0 0 4 0 0\n        0 4 2 4 0\n        0 0 4 0 0\n        0 0 0 0 0\n        ```\n\n3.  **Map Colors:**\n    Based on Examples 1 and 2, there is a mapping from input box colors to output colors:\n    *   `1` maps to `2` (seen in Ex 1).\n    *   `4` maps to `2` (seen in Ex 2).\n    *   `2` maps to `2` (Identity, seen in Ex 1 & 2).\n    *   `6` maps to `6` (Identity, seen in Ex 1).\n    *   `8` maps to `0` (Inferred as background/border color).\n    *   `0` maps to `0`.\n\n4.  **Overlay Boxes:**\n    The output is formed by overlaying the mapped content of the boxes. Where values overlap, non-zero values take precedence (specifically `2` seems to override `0`). In Example 1, `2` from the BL box overrode `6` from the TL box, but here we mostly have `0`s and `2`s.\n\n    *   **Mapped TL:** Cross of `2`s, center `0` (from 8).\n    *   **Mapped BR:** Cross of `2`s, center `2`.\n    *   **Mapped BL:** `1`s become `2`s, `8`s become `0`s.\n\n    **Composite:**\n    *   **Center (2,2):** TL(0) + BR(2) + BL(0) -> **2**.\n    *   **Cross Arms (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2):** TL(2) + BR(2) + BL(0) -> **2**.\n    *   **Diamond Ring (0,1), (0,3), (1,0), (1,4), ...:** TL(0) + BR(0) + BL(2) -> **2**.\n    *   **Corners/Gaps (0,0), (0,2), (0,4), (1,1), (1,3)...:** All boxes provide `0` (or `8`->`0`). -> **0**.\n\n    The resulting grid combines the Cross from TL/BR and the Diamond from BL.\n\n    **Calculated Output Grid:**\n    ```\n    0 2 0 2 0\n    2 0 2 0 2\n    0 2 2 2 0\n    2 0 2 0 2\n    0 2 0 2 0\n    ```\n\noutput:\n0,2,0,2,0\n2,0,2,0,2\n0,2,2,2,0\n2,0,2,0,2\n0,2,0,2,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### Key observation (from the examples)\nEach input contains several *same-sized square frames* (a 1-cell-thick border of a single color) that enclose small \u201cpanels\u201d.  \nThe output is the **interior** of one panel after applying a change-pattern learned from two other panels.\n\n### How the transformation works\n1. **Find all framed panels** (solid-color square borders).  \n   Use only the **inside** (border removed).\n\n2. **Pick the two reference panels**: they have the **same set of colors** (same \u201cpalette\u201d) and do **not** contain color `2`.  \n   Compute a boolean **difference mask** `M` of the same size:  \n   `M[r,c] = (ref1[r,c] != ref2[r,c])`.\n\n3. **Pick the target panel**: the one whose interior contains color `2`.\n\n4. **Apply the mask to the target interior**:\n   - If `M[r,c]` is true:\n     - if target cell is `0` \u2192 change it to `2`\n     - otherwise (any nonzero color) \u2192 change it to `0`\n   - If `M[r,c]` is false: leave the target cell unchanged.\n\nThis exactly reproduces both training examples (in one, the mask covers only a few cells; in the other it covers all cells, so it becomes a full inversion).\n\n### Applying to the test input\n- The frames are the `5`-colored borders (size 7\u00d77, so interior is 5\u00d75).\n- The two left-column interiors (colors `{0,1,8}`) are the reference pair; they differ **everywhere**, so `M` is all true.\n- The bottom-right interior is the target (it contains `2`).\n\nSo we invert the target interior under the rule \u201c0\u21922, nonzero\u21920\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n2,2,2,2,2  \n2,2,0,2,2  \n2,0,0,0,2  \n2,2,0,2,2  \n2,2,2,2,2",
