        "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task Solution: Test Input Analysis and Solution Construction**\n\nAlright, the user wants me to tackle an ARC task based on examples and a test input. Let's dig in. I see a large grid with shapes of different colors, and my gut tells me there's a pattern to decode.\n\nThe examples show a recurring theme: there's a connection between the shape, its color, and its location within the grid. My first hunch is that I need to find the \"active\" or \"target\" region defined by the color 5 markers, a.k.a the \"5s\".  This seems to define the dimensions of my output grid. The outputs are all grids of a specific size, but the contents are derived from the input.\n\nIn Example 1, I noticed that the output grid was determined by the bounding box defined by the \"5s.\" The shape inside was related to the shape defined by the \"gray markers\" or color 5s. Furthermore, the shapes were progressively wider (3, 4, 5 and the target should be 6). The output shape was related to the shape and color of an existing shape. I need to note how the contents of the shapes relate to the target area shape. In example 2, I saw a repetitive pattern, where vertical columns were repeated and then applied to the output.\n\nExample 2 showed a more complex repeating pattern where it was a set of vertical columns. The \"5\" markers again indicated the output shape dimensions.  The output shape was just the next continuation of the pattern.\n\nExample 3 reinforced this bounding box and repetition.  The patterns were made of colors 7, 2, and 3.  The next expected shape will fill the same geometry as the repeating pattern but different color.  This also makes it seem likely that a set sequence of shapes must be followed (7, 2, 3, 7, 2, 3)\n\nThe key takeaway is that the color and relative position of shapes seem to play a role, and the \"5s\" are crucial. There are hints about a horizontal progression of the geometry. The bounding box formed by the \"5s\" is the output grid. The horizontal structure is important.\n\nNow, for the Test Input. I see shapes in the grid, mostly 3s and 2s, and two target regions marked by those 5s! This is interesting because previous examples only had one. I need to handle this. It looks like it wants me to place shapes and repeat patterns.  I see a \"center\" and two \"side\" columns of the shapes which diverge away from the \"center\". This resembles a tree.\n\nI realized that the vertical distances in the patterns tell me where to position the shapes.\nI have to place the shapes that will meet specific constraints based on where the target 5s exist and based on the shapes. I am to combine all that knowledge into one grid!\n\nIt seems I have to find a pattern or create one based on the existing shapes.  The shape should exist in the target region determined by the coordinates of the 5's.  I have two targets, so I expect two shapes. The task might require placing the shape into the target region. The 5s define the shape geometry: size and form. This is the crucial aspect of the problem.\n\nOk, let's nail this. I see a repeating pattern of widths and the shapes. I have to create this repeating shape.\n\nLet me break down the shapes' structures.  I see a repeating pattern of 3, 2, 3. The 3 shapes make a tree that diverges. The tree begins at row 0 (height 5) and then splits into branches in further rows. The \"branches\" go to rows 5,6 and row 12,13.\n\nIt's all about how I find that shape!\n\nI look at the 5s in Test Input and notice 5 marks some of the color 3s and not all. The fact that the target 5s define the locations for my result and also contain hints about shape geometries. I found that I should extract a repeating geometric pattern. This lets me use the hints in the 5s. The shapes must be in the right location.\n\nI have to account for the spatial relationship of the shapes and this should guide me.\n\nI also can see how the patterns of shapes in my test input have a repeating geometric shape which I must re-draw within my result grid!\nIn essence, the task can be restated as \"Create a shape\".\n\nNow to create the final grid. I have two regions. I see that there are two shapes that diverge to the Left and the Right, so I will build my shapes there. There's a rule about how the outer shapes are to be positioned.\n\nI deduce the final shape geometry which is 2 x \n\nThe problem asks us to determine the content of the output grid based on a transformation inferred from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain one or more shapes composed of colored pixels (integers 1-9) and a specific region marked by the color 5 (gray).\n2.  **Transformation Rule:** The output grid's dimensions correspond to the bounding box of the region containing the color 5 in the input. The content of the output grid is a continuation or next step of the pattern formed by the other shapes in the input.\n    *   In Example 1, a sequence of shapes (Red width 3, Yellow width 4, Blue width 5) leads to a Target width 6 filled with the first color of the cycle (Red/2).\n    *   In Example 2, vertical strips of patterns repeat and evolve. The target region continues this pattern.\n    *   In Example 3, a repeating sequence of shapes (7, 2, 3, 7, 2) implies the next shape is 3, but the output is 7. Closer inspection reveals the target position corresponds to a specific slot in the sequence.\n\n**Analysis of the Test Input:**\n1.  **Shapes:** The input features a branching tree-like structure growing downwards.\n    *   Top (Rows 0-4): A central block of width 5 (Green 3s frame, Red 2s inside).\n    *   Level 1 (Rows 5-6): Two blocks of width 3 split to the left and right.\n        *   Left Block: Top row `3 3 3`, Bottom row `3 0 2`.\n        *   Right Block: Top row `3 3 3`, Bottom row `2 0 3`.\n    *   Level 2 (Rows 12-13): Two blocks of width 3, further out.\n        *   Left Block: Top row `3 3 3`, Bottom row `3 0 2`.\n        *   Right Block: Top row `3 3 3`, Bottom row `2 0 3`.\n    *   Level 3 (Target): We expect two blocks of width 2, further out.\n\n2.  **Target Markers (5s):**\n    *   There are two separate groups of 5s.\n    *   **Left Group:** Rows 15-16, Cols 6-7. Pattern: `5 5` / `5 0`.\n    *   **Right Group:** Rows 21-22, Cols 21-22. Pattern: `0 5` / `5 5`.\n    *   The bounding box covering all 5s extends from (15, 6) to (22, 22). This implies an output grid of height 8 and width 17.\n\n3.  **Pattern Deduction:**\n    *   The shapes evolve from Width 3 to Width 2.\n    *   **Left Shape:** Based on previous blocks (`3` on left/outer, `2` on right/inner), the Width 2 shape should be `3 3` on top and `3 2` on bottom.\n        *   Checking against Left 5s: The 5s pattern `5 5` / `5 0` matches the shape `3 3` / `3 2` if we assume **5 represents color 3** and **0 represents color 2**.\n    *   **Right Shape:** The Right Branch logic (`3` on right/outer, `2` on left/inner) suggests `3 3` on top and `2 3` on bottom. However, the 5s pattern `0 5` / `5 5` implies a shape where the top-left is 2 and the rest are 3s.\n        *   If we assume **5 represents color 3**, the shape matching `0 5` / `5 5` is `2 3` / `3 3`. This is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the expected `3 3` / `2 3`. This fits the available data (5s pattern) perfectly.\n\n**Construction of Output:**\n*   Grid size: 8 rows, 17 columns.\n*   **Top-Left (Relative (0,0)):** Corresponds to Input (15,6). Fill with Left Shape `3 3` / `3 2`.\n*   **Bottom-Right (Relative (6,15)):** Corresponds to Input (21,21). Fill with Right Shape `2 3` / `3 3`.\n*   **Background:** Fill remaining cells with 0.\n\noutput:\n3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n**Key observations:**\n1. Each input has a main repeating pattern and two 5-markers (in \"L\" shapes)\n2. The 5-markers define a direction and distance for extending the pattern\n3. Output dimensions = distance between markers + 2 in each direction\n4. The output extends the core pattern unit in the specified direction(s)\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n\nFinding the 5-markers:\n- First marker (upper-left L): rows 15-16, cols 6-7: pattern `5,5 / 5,0`\n- Second marker (lower-right L): rows 21-22, cols 21-22: pattern `0,5 / 5,5`\n\nCalculating distances:\n- Horizontal: col 21.5 - col 6.5 = 15 \u2192 output width = 15 + 2 = **17 cols**\n- Vertical: row 21.5 - row 15.5 = 6 \u2192 output height = 6 + 2 = **8 rows**\n\n**Identifying the core pattern:**\nThe main pattern uses colors 3 and 2 in nested rectangles. The innermost/edge pattern uses color 3:\n```\n3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,3\n```\nThis is a bordered rectangle pattern (3s on top row, 3s on left and right edges with 0s in middle for bottom row).\n\n**Extending the pattern:**\n- Horizontal stretch to 17 cols: preserve left and right borders (3), fill middle with interior pattern\n- Vertical tiling: repeat the 2-row pattern 4 times for 8 rows\n\nThe extended core pattern becomes:\n- Row A (full): all 3s (17 cols)\n- Row B (hollow): 3 at edges, 0s in middle (17 cols)\n\nTiled vertically: A, B, A, B, A, B, A, B\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n```",
