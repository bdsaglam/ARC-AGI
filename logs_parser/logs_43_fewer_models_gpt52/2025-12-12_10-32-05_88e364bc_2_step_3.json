        "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition:**\n\nOkay, here we go. I'm being asked to solve an ARC puzzle. The core is a grid of numbers 0-9, and the task is to figure out the transformation from an input grid to an output grid. I'm given three solved examples and a test input. My job is to explain my reasoning, step by step, and generate the final output grid.\n\n**Delving into the Examples:**\n\nThe examples are key. I need to spot a pattern here. The grid is filled with integers representing different colors or objects. There are these \"rooms\" made up of connected components of the same color and some internal patterns. The yellow pixels (4s) seem like the movers. I notice that the yellow pixels move, but the rooms, keys, and other features remain mostly the same. \n\n**First Hypothesis: Displacement Related to \"Keys\"**\n\nI have a suspicion about these \"Key\" blocks.  They seem to be grids within the colored blocks. I see blue (1s) and red (2s) pixels.  In the first example, the yellow dots shift a number of spaces. The key seems to hold the clues. So if I find a mapping between the \u201cKey\u201d structure and the Yellow dot movement, I will have the core of the solution.\n\n**Refining the Hypothesis: Vector Based Movement**\n\nAfter some iterations, it looks like a vector based displacement rule is at play. The direction of a Yellow dot's movement seems to be encoded as a vector in the \"Key\". A red pixel (2) relative to a blue pixel (1) creates a simple pattern. So a relative position of the Red (2) to Blue(1) implies an \u201cAttraction\u201d in that direction. \n\n**Key Characteristics**\n\n1.  Each key is a solid shape filled with its color.\n2.  Each key has a pattern of blues and reds inside.\n3.  Each key has a specific position in the test Input.\n\n**Validating the hypothesis with Example 2**\n\nThe movement in example 2 is diagonal - Down-Right. The key shows a specific positioning of blue and red pixels. Again, I analyze this to derive a vector. Centroid of all blues - Centroid of all Reds. And voila, the vector I get is Down-Right, which matches the direction the Yellow pixel moves. I have a theory!\n\n**Example 3 Consolidation**\n\nThe third example shows vertical down movement, this aligns with the hypothesis. \n\n**Establishing the Rule**\n\nMy rule is now clear:\n\n1.  Find the \"Key\" and its pattern of 1's (Blues) and 2's (Reds).\n2.  Find the Centroid of each of the Blue(1) and Red(2) pixels.\n3.  Subtract the Centroid of Blue(1) from Red(2).\n4.  Movement = The sign or major direction of the vector. The Yellow dots move through their respective colors.\n\n**Test Input**\n\nNow, I'll apply the rule to the test input. There are now two distinct color \u201cRooms\u201d to apply the rules to. I calculate the movement direction for each \u201croom\u201d type. Then, I trace the movement of the yellow pixels based on that vector direction. I make sure to account for walls (non-zero values) in the grid so that the Yellow pixels don't move into them.\n**Test Input Movement**\n\n1.  Magenta moves Up\n2.  Green Moves Up-Left\n\n**Output Grid Construction**\n\nI will now construct the output by shifting the position of the Yellow dots from the input as determined above. The new positions replace the old and the result is the output grid. I am doing a careful reconstruction based on all of the above. Now, it is time to write the output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the transformation rule from the given solved examples and apply it to the test input.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects and Roles**:\n    *   **Containers/Rooms**: The grid contains hollow or irregular shapes made of specific colors (e.g., Orange/7, Gray/5, Magenta/6, Green/3). These act as \"rooms\".\n    *   **Keys**: For each container color, there is a distinct, solid rectangular block of the same color (the \"Key\"). Inside these keys are patterns of Blue (1) and Red (2) pixels.\n    *   **Agents**: Yellow pixels (4) are scattered inside the empty spaces (0s) of the \"rooms\".\n    *   **Task**: The yellow pixels (4) move from their initial positions to new positions within their respective rooms. The other structures (walls, keys) remain unchanged.\n\n2.  **Determine Movement Rules**:\n    *   The movement of the yellow pixels is determined by the \"Key\" corresponding to the color of the room they are in.\n    *   We analyze the internal structure of the Keys (Blue/1 and Red/2 pixels) to find a direction vector.\n    *   **Hypothesis**: The direction is defined by the vector pointing from the **centroid of the Blue pixels (1)** to the **centroid of the Red pixels (2)**.\n    *   **Verification**:\n        *   *Example 1*:\n            *   Orange Key: Blue on left, Red on right. Vector points **Right**. Yellow pixels in Orange rooms move Right until they hit a wall.\n            *   Gray Key: Red on left, Blue on right. Vector points **Left**. Yellow pixels in Gray rooms move Left until they hit a wall.\n        *   *Example 2*:\n            *   Gray Key: Blue cluster centered roughly top-left, Red cluster roughly bottom-right relative to each other. Vector points **Down-Right**. Yellow pixels move diagonally Down-Right until blocked.\n        *   *Example 3*:\n            *   Gray Key: Blue rows above Red row. Vector points **Down**. Yellow pixels move Down until blocked.\n\n3.  **Apply to Test Input**:\n    *   **Magenta (6) Key**: Located at top-left.\n        *   Blue (1) pixels at (2,1), (3,1). Centroid: Row 2.5, Col 1.\n        *   Red (2) pixel at (1,1). Centroid: Row 1, Col 1.\n        *   Vector: From (2.5, 1) to (1, 1) is **UP** (-1.5 rows, 0 cols).\n        *   Rule: Yellow pixels in Magenta rooms move **UP** until blocked.\n    *   **Green (3) Key**: Located at bottom-right.\n        *   Blue (1) pixels at (16,17), (17,15), (17,18), (18,16). Centroid: Row 17, Col 16.5.\n        *   Red (2) pixels at (15,16), (16,14). Centroid: Row 15.5, Col 15.\n        *   Vector: From (17, 16.5) to (15.5, 15) is **UP-LEFT** (-1.5 rows, -1.5 cols).\n        *   Rule: Yellow pixels in Green rooms move **UP-LEFT** (diagonal) until blocked.\n\n4.  **Execute Movement**:\n    *   **Dot 1 at (5, 16)** (Magenta room): Move Up.\n        *   Path: (4,16). (3,16) is a wall (6).\n        *   Final Position: **(4, 16)**.\n    *   **Dot 2 at (7, 9)** (Green room): Move Up-Left.\n        *   Path: (6,8) -> (5,7).

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Template patterns exist** - There are filled border patterns (like 7/5/6/3) with internal markers (1s and 2s) that serve as templates.\n\n2. **The 4s are markers inside regions** - Each 4 is inside an irregular closed region bounded by colored borders.\n\n3. **The direction of movement is determined by the 2's position in the template** - The 2 in each template indicates which direction the 4s should move:\n   - In Example 1: 7-template has 2 on right \u2192 4s move right; 5-template has 2 on left \u2192 4s move left\n   - In Example 3: 5-template has 2 at bottom \u2192 4s move down\n\n4. **4s move toward the boundary** until they're adjacent to it.\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n- Top-left 6-template (rows 0-4, cols 0-4): The 2s are at row 1 (top area) \u2192 move UP\n- Bottom-right 3-template (rows 14-19, cols 13-19): The 2s are at rows 1-2 (top area) \u2192 move UP\n\n**Finding 4s and their new positions:**\n1. (5, 16) in 6-region \u2192 moves up \u2192 boundary at row 3 col 16 \u2192 new position (4, 16)\n2. (7, 9) in 3-region \u2192 moves up \u2192 boundary at row 1 \u2192 new position (2, 9)  \n3. (8, 11) in 3-region \u2192 moves up \u2192 boundary at row 1 \u2192 new position (2, 11)\n4. (8, 18) in 6-region \u2192 moves up \u2192 boundary at row 1 \u2192 new position (2, 18)\n5. (13, 6) in 3-region \u2192 moves up \u2192 boundary at row 10 \u2192 new position (11, 6)\n6. (17, 5) in 3-region \u2192 moves up \u2192 boundary at row 10 \u2192 new position (11, 5)\n\n```\n6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,4,0,4,0,3,0,0,6,0,4,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,6,6,6,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,0,4,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,0,6\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,3,4,4,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n```",
