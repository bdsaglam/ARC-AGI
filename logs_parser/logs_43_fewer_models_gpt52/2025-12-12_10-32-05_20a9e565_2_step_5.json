            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis of an ARC Problem**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants me to solve this Abstract Reasoning Challenge (ARC) problem. They've given me a set of examples and a test input. I need to figure out the underlying pattern or rule and then apply it to the test input to generate the correct output.  The user is giving me some clues. They're using a lot of jargon but it seems like they want a clear explanation and the final grid. No chain-of-thought, just the final output with a description.  \n\nBased on the examples, it looks like a sequence of some objects defined by the positions of the \"5\" markers is the key. Those \"5\"s define a region or \"viewport\" (like a frame or mask) and it seems like the content within that viewport is being modified. The outputs in the examples show some kind of transformation or relation to shapes inside the input grid. I'm focusing on those markers, the shapes within those bounds, and how they relate to the output.\n\nIn the first example, the \"5\"s create a box and the output has a \"C\" shape made of 2s. There are shapes with 1, 2, and 4 colors in the input, and the shapes are related. This suggests a pattern completion of a sequence of shapes.  I keep trying to find a clear connection between the input shapes and the output shape. I'm noting the shape, size, and positions of the \"5\" markers, and the structure of the shapes.\n\nIn the second example, the \"5\"s mark a thin strip. The output is a sequence of numbers (4, 8, 9) and it seems the pattern is related to the input shape that this strip \"overlays.\" There are some vertical strips of patterns, with some columns of data that are replicated and reflected in the output. Maybe the output is a \"mapping\" of a sequence from the input (some reflection or transformation of the data). I'm looking at how the \"5\"s relate to the data, and if there is any reflection.\n\nThe third example also helps. The \"5\"s define a wide, tall strip. The Output is a column. The output seems to repeat the first element, which suggests we are dealing with a repeating cycle, or periodic patterns that get projected in the output. The periodic pattern has 7, 2, and 3 as part of it. The output always copies one column from the input, which is based on an extrapolation of these columns.\n\nNow, let's look at the patterns across examples. All the outputs are related. The \"5\" markers create the viewport or \"target\". The goal is to project the correct object in the target region. The output follows some sequence or mapping, which is based on the positions and relative sizes of the \"5\". The positions indicate a sequence or series.\n\nIn the Test Input, there are 5s at the corners. There is a larger area for the output. I need to identify repeating patterns in this input. I see some 2s and 3s. There are several vertical strips. It seems like the elements expand as you go down. I must apply the pattern of horizontal and vertical patterns, and vertical expansion to create the grid. There must be vertical and horizontal attraction between these.\n\nI'm thinking about how the patterns expand in the inputs. The horizontal width of 3 expands into separate blocks. So it is the position and horizontal size, and then the vertical expansion, that define how objects grow and shrink.\n\nHere's my logic:\n*   **The \"5\" markers define the output grid.**\n*   **Identify the sequence of patterns in the input.** (2s, 3s, and the gap between them).\n*   **Follow the expansion rule.** \n\nThe output is this grid:\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0\n3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3\n3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3\n0,\n\nThe problem asks us to solve an ARC task where the goal is to infer a transformation rule from examples and apply it to a test input.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Object Identification:** The grids contain distinct \"objects\" formed by colored pixels. There is also a recurring \"target marker\" consisting of grey pixels (color 5).\n2.  **Target Marker:** In all examples, the grey (5) pixels define the corners of a rectangular region. The output grid always has the same dimensions as this defined region.\n    *   In Example 1, the 5s frame a 3x6 region. The input contains a sequence of shapes (2-shape, 4-shape, 1-shape). The output is a filled \"C\" shape made of 2s. The sequence 2, 4, 1 suggests a cycle or pattern, and the target region captures the next iteration.\n    *   In Example 2, the 5s frame a 14x2 region. The input contains vertical strips of patterns that evolve across columns. The target region is positioned to capture the next strip in the sequence. The evolution involves reflection and shifting.\n    *   In Example 3, the 5s frame a 17x3 region. The input consists of repeating vertical blocks of colors 7, 2, 3. The sequence is 7, 2, 3, 7, 2. The target is the next block, and the output is a block of 7s (completing the 7-2-3 cycle).\n3.  **General Rule:** The task is a \"sequence completion\" problem. We must identify the sequence of objects/patterns in the input grid, determine the transformation or cycle governing them, and then generate the next object in the sequence inside the region marked by the grey (5) pixels.\n\n**Analysis of the Test Input:**\n1.  **Sequence Identification:**\n    *   **Object 1 (Rows 0-6):** A composite object centered at column 14.\n        *   Top part (fixed): A 3-box (green) at cols 12-16.\n        *   Gap: Row 2 is empty.\n        *   Middle part: A single 2-box (red) at cols 12-16.\n        *   Bottom part: Two 3-boxes (green with inner red) at cols 10-12 and 16-18.\n    *   **Gap Row:** Row 7 is empty.\n    *   **Object 2 (Rows 8-14):** A variation of Object 1, centered at column 14.\n        *   Top part (fixed): Same 3-box at cols 12-16.\n        *   Gap: None (The middle part moved up).\n        *   Middle part: Two 3-boxes (red with inner green) at cols 10-12 and 16-18. Relative to Object 1, the single box split and moved outward (shift 3), and contracted in width.\n        *   Bottom part: Two 3-boxes at cols 8-10 and 18-20. Relative to Object 1, they moved outward (shift 2).\n\n2.  **Trend Extraction:**\n    *   **Vertical Movement (Contraction):**\n        *   Middle part starts at relative row 3 in Obj 1, and relative row 2 in Obj 2. **Prediction:** Starts at relative row 1 in Obj 3.\n        *   Bottom part starts at relative row 5 in Obj 1, and relative row 4 in Obj 2. **Prediction:** Starts at relative row 3 in Obj 3.\n    *   **Horizontal Movement (Expansion/Split):**\n        *   **Middle Part:** Center 14 (Width 5) -> Centers 11/17 (Width 3, Shift 3). **Prediction:** Centers 8/20 (Width 1, Shift 3).\n            *   *Shape/Color:* The width-3 box had `2` on outer edges and `3` on inner. Collapsing to width 1 likely results in a vertical stack of the outer color (`2`) and the inner color (`3`), or simply maintaining the vertical connectivity found in other layers. Based on the pattern `2` (top) and `3` (bottom) creates a consistent alternating stack (2-3-3-2) with the layer below.\n        *   **Bottom Part:** Centers 11/17 -> Centers 9/19 (Shift 2). **Prediction:** Centers 7/21 (Shift 2).\n            *   *Shape:* Maintains the 3x2 structure with `3`s on top and `3,0,2` / `2,0,3` on bottom.\n            *   *Position:* Center 7 implies columns 6-8. Center 21 implies columns 20-22.\n\n3.  **Target Construction:**\n    *   **Target Region:** The grey 5s define a region from (Row 15, Col 6) to (Row 22, Col 22). Dimensions: 8 rows x 17 columns.\n    *   **Output Row 0 (corresponds to Input Row 15):** This is the \"Gap\" row in the global sequence (after Object 2). It should be empty.\n    *   **Output Row 1 (Input R16, Obj Rel 0):** Top part (Fixed). `3,3,3,3,3` centered.\n    *   **Output Row 2 (Input R17, Obj Rel 1):** Top part Row 1 (`3,0,0,0,3`) + Middle part Row 0 (`2` at cols 8, 20).\n    *   **Output Row 3 (Input R18, Obj Rel 2):** Middle part Row 1 (`3` at cols 8, 20).\n    *   **Output Row 4 (Input R19, Obj Rel 3):** Bottom part Row 0 (`3,3,3` at cols 6-8, 20-22).\n    *   **Output Row 5 (Input R20, Obj Rel 4):** Bottom part Row 1 (`3,0,2` left, `2,0,3` right).\n    *   **Output Rows 6-7:** Empty.\n\n**Final Output Grid Generation:**\nThe grid is 17 columns wide (indices 0-16).\n- **Row 0:** All 0.\n- **Row 1:** 0s, then `3,3,3,3,3` (indices 6-10), then 0s.\n- **Row 2:** 0s, `2` (index 2), 0s, `3,0,0,0,3` (indices 6-10), 0s, `2` (index 14), 0s.\n- **Row 3:** 0s, `3` (index 2), 0s...0s, `3` (index 14), 0s.\n- **Row 4:** `3,3,3` (indices 0-2), 0s...0s, `3,3,3` (indices 14-16).\n- **Row 5:** `3,0,2` (indices 0-2), 0s...0s, `2,0,3` (indices 14-16).\n- **Row 6, 7:** All 0.\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0\n3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3\n3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

They define the output dimensions.\n\n2. **Output dimensions** are calculated as the span of all 5-marker positions:\n   - Example 1: Rows 26-28 (span 3), Cols 19-24 (span 6) \u2192 3\u00d76 output\n   - Example 2: Rows 14-27 (span 14), Cols 19-20 (span 2) \u2192 14\u00d72 output  \n   - Example 3: Rows 1-17 (span 17), Cols 25-27 (span 3) \u2192 17\u00d73 output\n\n3. **The content** is a repeating/scaled tile pattern based on the main colored structure, using the outermost layer's color.\n\n**Applying to test input:**\n\nFinding the 5 markers:\n- Group 1: (15,6), (15,7), (16,6)\n- Group 2: (21,22), (22,21), (22,22)\n\nOutput dimensions:\n- Row span: 22 - 15 + 1 = 8\n- Column span: 22 - 6 + 1 = 17\n- Output: 8 rows \u00d7 17 columns\n\nThe main pattern shows nested rectangles with colors 3 and 2, where **color 3 forms the outermost layer** (visible at rows 12-13, spanning the widest extent).\n\nThe base tile pattern for color 3 is:\n```\n3,3,3,3,3  (filled row)\n3,0,0,0,3  (hollow row - borders only)\n```\n\nScaling to 8\u00d717:\n- Vertically: 8 rows = 4 repetitions of the 2-row tile\n- Horizontally: Scale filled row to all 17 cells filled; hollow row has 3s at first and last positions with 0s between\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n```",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's my thought process for tackling this ARC task:**\n\nI'm being asked to solve an ARC task, likely involving pattern recognition. I'll need to analyze examples to identify the underlying rules and then apply those rules to a test input. I'm focusing on finding consistent patterns in how the inputs are processed to produce the outputs.\n\n**Initial Analysis of Example 1:**\nI begin by inspecting the first example.  The grid dimensions are large, mostly black, with shapes at the bottom. The shapes are colored and look like modified letters or Tetris blocks. I note the pixel coordinates of colored regions and trace their outlines. I observe a repeated sequence of colors and shapes, plus some grey blocks that seem out of place. This suggests they are important to the operation, and not just parts of the main object. My initial thought is the shapes could indicate regions in some way or select one region for output. A key pattern starts to emerge: that grey pixels likely act as a bounding box or selector of sorts, defining the size of the output. I carefully examine the coordinates of these \"marker\" pixels and visualize how they map out a rectangular region, separate from the primary objects. Then I check for a relationship between their region of pixels and the final output and its colors. Next, I look closely at the relationship between the colors in the input, the markers, and the final output's color, but cannot see any.\n\nI try to extract the specific shapes, notice their relative positions, and try to find a relationship between the markers and their locations. When the markers are at the end, I suspect they have an index or a sequence in how they select the output shape. I look at each shape's dimensions and the marker locations for how the selected object becomes the output, but I'm not confident. I then think about *how* the markers are positioned, and how that influences what part of the shape is shown.\n\nA key realization is that the markers seem to define the output's *dimensions*\u2014specifically, its height and width. I carefully compare the dimensions of the marker's defined region (3x6) to the output grid (also 3x6). This is the key observation. The output's content is a red 'C'-shape.\n\nI need to understand *what* determines the content of the output. I carefully compare the input shape of the 'C' with the marker position, and the output shape. This helps to identify that it's a shape extraction operation or some sort of mapping of the source shape to the output area. A comparison of the red shape shows that the output is actually a horizontal stretch (width-wise) of the red shape in the input, suggesting a scaling or transformation. Since the input's bounding box is smaller, the marker size forces a scale factor. The markers indicate which shape to select from the existing shape list and how to modify it.\n\n**Analyzing Example 2:**\n\nNow I approach the second example. I see a stack of shapes forming a pyramid and observe the color palette. There are more shapes, so the task becomes more challenging. The marker configuration here looks similar to the first example: they are located at one edge of the input. I identify the defined rectangular region again and carefully identify its size (15x2), then relate this to the output, to see the operation it performs. I also examine how the shapes are color-coded.\n\nI compare the marker-defined rectangle to the actual size of the output and notice one size larger than another. Then I carefully count the rows of the final output, to identify the source of the size difference. I note that the output is only one pixel wider than tall, but not the same dimensions as the output! I conclude that the operation might have some sort of cropping operation, even if the dimensions differ. The output appears to be the central section of the input pyramid (2 columns). This hints that I will need to find a central or symmetrical point. I carefully verify this is not just a direct crop of the marker location, by checking the image and the text values. A key observation is that the output appears to be a vertical slice of the input pattern, specifically, the *center* section of the pyramid. The markers effectively \"select\" this center slice and show how it has a consistent sequence of colors.\n\nI revisit the markers' positioning and their relationship to the object positions to understand the transformation. I realize the operation is not just cropping, but rather \"projecting\" the pattern onto the marker-defined area. I am beginning to believe that the pattern to be selected, can be from a different location, so long as it has certain geometric symmetry.\n\n**Hypothesis Development and Refinement**\n\nThe marker region seems to be a key element for creating the output. I formulate a new hypothesis: the markers represent a \"viewport\" to focus a section of the grid. From here, I need to know which portion is selected.\n\nThe task is to infer the transformation rule from the solved examples and apply it to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains a sequence of colored shapes at the bottom (Blue, Red, Yellow, Blue) and a set of grey marker pixels (color 5) forming a bounding box on the right.\n    *   **Markers:** The grey pixels define a rectangular region of **Height 3 and Width 6**.\n    *   **Shapes Sequence:**\n        *   Shape 1 (Blue): Width 2.\n        *   Shape 2 (Red): Width 3.\n        *   Shape 3 (Yellow): Width 4.\n        *   Shape 4 (Blue): Width 5.\n        *   The widths form a sequence: 2, 3, 4, 5. The next expected width is **6**.\n    *   **Output:** A Red (color 2) shape filling a 3x6 grid. The shape is a stretched 'C' pattern.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The markers define the dimensions of the *next* item in the sequence. The width 6 corresponds to the next step in the arithmetic progression of widths. The color pattern (1, 2, 4, 1) suggests a cycle or pattern where the next element is 2. The output is the generated next shape fitting the marker dimensions.\n\n2.  **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** A large pyramid structure and a marker box.\n    *   **Markers:** Define a region of **Height 15 and Width 2**.\n    *   **Output:** A 14x2 or 15x2 vertical strip.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The markers denote a \"viewport\". The output is a crop of the central vertical strip of the pyramid structure, corresponding to the height defined by the markers. The content is essentially the axis of symmetry of the input pattern.\n\n3.  **Example 3:**\n    *   **Input:** Vertical bars of colors Orange(7), Red(2), Green(3), Orange(7), Red(2). Markers define a box of **Height 17 and Width 3**.\n    *   **Output:** An Orange(7) bar of size 17x3.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The markers define the target dimensions. The input contains repeating shapes of this size. The output captures the first element of the sequence or the one matching the pattern logic.\n\n**Analysis of Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:**\n    *   A repeating vertical pattern of shapes in rows 0-13.\n    *   **Block 1 (Rows 0-6):**\n        *   Top (Rows 0-1): Color 3. Solid bar (width 5) -> Hollow bar.\n        *   Mid (Rows 3-4): Color 2. Solid bar (width 5) -> Hollow bar.\n        *   Bot (Rows 5-6): Color 3. Split bar (width 9) -> Split bar with inner details.\n    *   **Block 2 (Rows 8-13):**\n        *   Top (Rows 8-9): Color 3. Solid bar (width 5). (Unchanged from Block 1).\n        *   Mid (Rows 10-11): Color 2. Split bar (width 9). (Changed from Solid to Split).\n        *   Bot (Rows 12-13): Color 3. Split bar (width 9). (Unchanged from Block 1).\n\n2.  **Markers:**\n    *   Located in rows 15-22.\n    *   Define a bounding box from (Row 15, Col 6) to (Row 22, Col 22).\n    *   **Target Dimensions:** Height = 8, Width = 17.\n\n3.  **Pattern Evolution & Prediction:**\n    *   We need to generate **Block 3** inside the marker box.\n    *   **Progression Logic:** The shapes are expanding in width (Solid 5 -> Split 9 -> Split 17).\n        *   **Bottom Item:** Started as Split 9 in Block 1. Remained 9 in Block 2. Following the wave pattern, it should expand to **Width 17** in Block 3.\n        *   **Middle Item:** Started as Solid 5 in Block 1. Expanded to Split 9 in Block 2. It should remain **Width 9** in Block 3 (following the delay pattern).\n        *   **Top Item:** Started as Solid 5 in Block 1. Remained Solid 5 in Block 2. It should expand to **Width 9** in Block 3.\n    *   **Predicted Widths for Block 3:** Top=9, Mid=9, Bot=17. This fits the marker width constraint (max width 17).\n\n4.  **Layout Construction:**\n    *   Target Height is 8 rows. We have 3 items, each 2 rows high.\n    *   To fill 8 rows symmetrically: Item(2) - Gap(1) - Item(2) - Gap(1) - Item(2).\n    *   **Row 1-2 (Top Item):** Color 3, Width 9.\n        *   Shape: `333 000 333` and inner `3 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 3`.\n    *   **Row 3 (Gap):** Empty.\n    *   **Row 4-5 (Mid Item):** Color 2, Width 9.\n        *   Shape: `222 000 222` and inner `2 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 2`.\n    *   **Row 6 (Gap):** Empty.\n    *   **Row 7-8 (Bot Item):** Color 3, Width 17.\n        *   Shape: `333`...`333` and inner `3 0 2`...`2 0 3` separated by 11 zeros.\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\nConstructing the 8x17 grid based on the plan above.\n\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3\n3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3",

The gray (5) markers indicate direction. Output extracts the basic unit (red rectangle pattern) and extends it horizontally.\n\n**Example 2:** Diamond pattern with stacked colors. Gray markers indicate vertical direction. Output shows a vertical slice of the color pattern.\n\n**Example 3:** Staircase of boxes (colors 7,2,3). Gray markers define vertical extent (~16 rows). Output is the first color (7) pattern repeated for 17 rows.\n\n**Key observations:**\n1. Gray (5) markers indicate the direction and extent of the output\n2. The output extracts and repeats the basic pattern unit\n3. The length is determined by the distance between gray markers\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n- Concentric rectangular frames with colors 3 and 2 alternating\n- Basic unit is a 5-wide frame: `X,X,X,X,X` / `X,0,0,0,X`\n- Gray markers at upper-left (rows 15-16, cols 6-7) and lower-right (rows 21-22, cols 21-22)\n- Diagonal distance between markers \u2248 17 cells\n\nThe pattern alternates: 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2... starting from the center outward.\n\nFollowing Example 3's format (17 rows based on marker distance), the output should show these frames stacked vertically with alternating colors:\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,3\n2,2,2,2,2\n2,0,0,0,2\n3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,3\n2,2,2,2,2\n2,0,0,0,2\n3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,3\n2,2,2,2,2\n2,0,0,0,2\n3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,3\n2,2,2,2,2\n2,0,0,0,2\n3,3,3,3,3\n```",

strip/frame assembled from the meaningful colored structures.\n* Black cells in outputs function as preserved internal cavities (holes/windows), not as external background padding.\n* Orientation and (sometimes) monochrome recoloring likely depend on which structure is selected and/or how the marker geometry implies the target strip.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Summary of Thought Process for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this ARC problem with three examples and a test input.  My initial thought is to analyze the examples to understand the underlying logic and then apply that to the test case.\n\n**Example 1**: The first example's a big grid with colored shapes. I see a grey \"marker\" near one of the colored objects. It looks like it defines a region or a boundary for the final output. The main goal here seems to be to find patterns that link the input, these markers, and the output. I also note that the grey marker is ignored. The output, a red U-shape, seems to be a transformation of the red input \"F\" shape. It is extracted at the marker height.\n\n**Example 2**: The markers here are also present. The output, again a vertical colored strip, looks related to a column from the input. I figure the markers here define the dimensions of the output, but the content is taken from somewhere else. The colored components look related. I think it's a shifted selection.\n\nI am suspecting a shift operation linked to the marker positions. The numbers shift from each other. I analyze the marker pattern. I think the marker is to the right. The marker defines the next shape in a series or sequence. Maybe I have to extend a pattern here. Also, the pattern could involve color as well as shape.\n\n**Example 3**: We have a few strips, with the markers also being present. The output, a series of colors, seems to come from a specific strip, and the markers define the start position. I confirm that the markers define the bounding box, which, in this case, matches one column from the pattern. The recurring sequences and color selection are essential hints here.\n\nNow, I start to formulate my hypothesis: The marker positions define a region, the shape, the height, or the new shape's color. Then, a transformation, either shift or scaling, is required. I consider the output sizes compared to input shapes, as well as the shape composition or shape evolution in each of these outputs and inputs.\n\nI check for a \"next in sequence\". I look at widths as a key. Ex 1, the width increased and color followed a repeating pattern, while the output matched the marker size. I think that the output is related to the series.\n\nI'm thinking to connect the input shape to the output:\n\n*   The markers define the output box. The markers help define the series, and the output represents the next element in the sequence.\n*   The shape and color of this next element need to be derived from the series present in the input.\n\nFor Test Input:\n\nI get a bunch of shapes; some are in a column, some are in a mixed column.\n\nI look for the markers.\n\nThe output will be:\n\n*   The bounding box of the output.\n*   The extrapolated sequence, shape and color.\n*   My hypothesis is: The shape is U. The color is red. I am going to produce an Inverted U shape in Red, based on the repeating sequence.\n\nI verify my hypothesis by creating the expected 6x15 output grid:\n\n`222222222222222\n200000000000002\n200000000000002\n200000000000002\n200000000000002\n200000000000002`\n\nI then review the markers and shapes.\nAll the marker information matches.\n\nI have my answer.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the output grid based on the input grid, using the logic inferred from the solved examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains a sequence of three colored \"C\" or bracket shapes (Red, Yellow, Blue) in the bottom half. Their widths are 3, 4, and 5 respectively. There are two grey markers (color 5) that define a rectangular region of size 3x6 to the right of the sequence.\n    *   **Output:** A 3x6 Red (color 2) \"C\" shape.\n    *   **Logic:** The markers define the bounding box of the output. The content extends the sequence found in the input. The sequence of shapes is Red(width 3) -> Yellow(width 4) -> Blue(width 5). The next in sequence would be width 6. The color sequence Red, Yellow, Blue cycles back to Red. The shape is a \"C\" bracket, which matches the geometry of the input shapes (when cropped to the relevant rows). The markers are positioned where this \"next\" shape would be.\n\n2.  **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains vertical strips of data. The markers define a 14x2 region.\n    *   **Output:** A 14x2 strip.\n    *   **Logic:** The output corresponds to extrapolating the pattern of vertical strips to the location of the markers. The markers define the dimensions and location of the target. The specific content matches the prediction of the next strip in the series (based on the shifting pattern of values).\n\n3.  **Example 3:**\n    *   **Input:** Alternating vertical strips of 7s, 2s, 3s. The markers define a region corresponding to the position of the next \"7\" strip.\n    *   **Output:** A strip of 7s matching the pattern of the input 7s.\n    *   **Logic:** Similar to Ex 1 and Ex 2, the markers identify the location for the next element in a repeating sequence.\n\n**Analysis of Test Input:**\n\n*   **Input Structure:**\n    *   There is a vertical sequence of \"U\" shaped objects (inverted U / arches) in the center columns (12-16).\n    *   **Row 0-1:** Pink (3) shape, size 5x2. (Inverted U: `33333` / `30003`).\n    *   **Row 3-4:** Red (2) shape, size 5x2. (Inverted U: `22222` / `20002`).\n    *   **Row 8-9:** Pink (3) shape, size 5x2.\n    *   There are also side shapes in rows 5-6 and 10-11 using mixed colors, but the main sequence in the center is pure Pink, Red, Pink.\n*   **Sequence:**\n    *   Colors: Pink(3) -> Red(2) -> Pink(3). The next color in the alternating sequence is **Red(2)**.\n    *   Shapes: All are inverted U-shapes (arches).\n*   **Markers:**\n    *   Located in the lower empty region.\n    *   Top-left marker around (15,6)-(16,7). Defines top-left inner corner at Row 16, Col 7.\n    *   Bottom-right marker around (21,22). Defines bottom-right inner corner at Row 21, Col 21.\n    *   **Region:** Rows 16 to 21 (Height 6). Cols 7 to 21 (Width 15).\n*   **Target Output:**\n    *   **Dimensions:** 6 rows, 15 columns (matching the marker region).\n    *   **Color:** Red (2) (next in sequence).\n    *   **Shape:** Inverted U-shape (matching the previous shapes). The input shapes have a thickness of 1 pixel. We maintain this thickness.\n    *   **Construction:**\n        *   Top row (Row 0) filled with 2s.\n        *   Leftmost column (Col 0) filled with 2s.\n        *   Rightmost column (Col 14) filled with 2s.\n        *   The center is empty (0s), preserving the \"cavity\" as per the hints. The bottom is open (no line of 2s on Row 5 between the legs), matching the \"arch\" topology of the input shapes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe output should be a 15x6 grid containing a Red (2) arch/inverted-U shape.\n\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Gray corner-like pieces never appear in outputs; treat them as non-output markers/distractors.\n* The output is a tightly cropped, single connected strip/frame assembled from the meaningful colored structures.\n* Black cells in outputs function as preserved internal cavities (holes/windows), not as external background padding.\n* Orientation and (sometimes) monochrome recoloring likely depend on which structure is selected and/or how the marker geometry implies the target strip.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n**Example 1:** Shows horizontal colored patterns of increasing width (2, 3, 4, 5 cells). Gray markers are positioned horizontally. Output is color 2's pattern (3\u00d73 unit) stretched horizontally to 6 columns.\n\n**Example 2:** Shows a diamond pattern with vertical gray markers. Output is a vertical strip (14 rows \u00d7 2 cols) following the diamond edge.\n\n**Example 3:** Shows a diagonal staircase pattern. Gray markers are arranged vertically. Output is color 7's unit (3\u00d72) repeated vertically to 17 rows.\n\n**Key observations:**\n- Gray (5) markers indicate direction and extent of the output strip\n- The marker distance correlates with output dimensions\n- The basic colored unit is stretched/repeated in the indicated direction\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n- Pattern uses colors 2 and 3 forming a diamond shape\n- Basic unit is 5 columns \u00d7 2 rows: `3,3,3,3,3` and `3,0,0,0,3`\n- Marker 1: rows 15-16, cols 6-7 (L-shape, inner corner at row 16, col 7)\n- Marker 2: rows 21-22, cols 21-22 (L-shape, inner corner at row 21, col 21)\n\n**Marker analysis:**\n- Horizontal distance: 21 - 7 = 14\n- Vertical distance: 21 - 16 = 5\n- Slope: 5/14 \u2248 0.36 (predominantly horizontal, similar to Example 1)\n\n**Determining output:**\n- Since slope is low (horizontal orientation), output should be horizontally stretched\n- First color in pattern is 3, so use color 3\n- Output width: ~15 columns (14+1, a multiple of unit width 5)\n- Output preserves row count of unit: 2 rows\n\n**Applying the stretching rule from Example 1:**\n- Top row: all 3s extended to 15 columns\n- Bottom row: 3s on edges, 0s extended in middle\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Gray corner-like pieces never appear in outputs; treat them as non-output markers/distractors.\n* The output is a tightly cropped, single connected strip/frame assembled from the meaningful colored structures.\n* Black cells in outputs function as preserved internal cavities (holes/windows), not as external background padding.\n* Orientation and (sometimes) monochrome recoloring likely depend on which structure is selected and/or how the marker geometry implies the target strip.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "### 1) Identify what the gray (5) markers mean\nIn all training examples, the gray \u201ccorner\u201d pieces are *not* part of the output.  \nInstead, their **bounding box** defines the **exact output rectangle size** (tight crop).\n\nFor the test input, gray cells occur at:\n- top-left corner around `(row 15, col 6)`\n- bottom-right corner around `(row 22, col 22)`\n\nSo the gray bounding box spans:\n- rows `15..22`  \u2192 **height = 8**\n- cols `6..22`   \u2192 **width = 17**\n\nTherefore, the output must be an **8\u00d717** grid.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Find the \u201cmeaningful\u201d pattern to reproduce inside that box\nAbove the gray box, the non-gray colors (2 and 3) form a clear **growing two-row-block stack**:\n\n- A 2\u00d75 pattern (term 1)\n- A 4\u00d79 pattern (term 2)\n- A 6\u00d713 pattern (term 3)\n\nEach \u201cterm\u201d has:\n- **height = 2\u00b7n**\n- **width = 4\u00b7n + 1**\n\nAnd each term is built from **n blocks**, each block being **2 rows** tall, centered, with width `4\u00b7i+1` for block index `i=1..n`.\n\nThe gray box size **8\u00d717** matches **term 4** because:\n- `2\u00b74 = 8`\n- `4\u00b74 + 1 = 17`\n\nSo we must **generate term 4**.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Block construction rule (from observed terms)\nFor a block of width `w` with outer color `A` and inner color `B` (the other of {2,3}):\n\n**Row 1 (top of block):**\n- paint `A` in the first 3 cells and last 3 cells (`0..2` and `w-3..w-1`)\n- zeros in between  \n  (for `w=5` these overlap, making the whole row `A`)\n\n**Row 2 (second row of block):**\n- paint `A` at the two ends (`0` and `w-1`)\n- paint `B` at positions `2` and `w-3` **only if they are different** (so not for `w=5`)\n- zeros elsewhere\n\n**Colors alternate by block**, and the starting outer color alternates by term:\n- term 1 starts with 3, term 2 starts with 2, term 3 starts with 3 \u21d2 **term 4 starts with 2**\nSo for term 4 blocks (i=1..4), outer colors are: **2,3,2,3**.\n\n---\n\n### 4) Completed output (8\u00d717)\n```csv\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0\n0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0\n0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,2,0,0\n3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3\n3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "## 1. Describe the observable structures (literal)\n\n### Pair 1 (Input 1 \u2192 Output 1)\n- **Input 1**\n  - Large **black** background grid.\n  - Along the **bottom-left edge**, there are several small **colored polyomino-like shapes** placed side-by-side (notably **blue**, **red**, **yellow**, and another **blue**).\n  - Near the **bottom-right area**, there are small **gray corner/L-like components** separate from the colored shapes.\n- **Output 1**\n  - A **smaller grid** than the input.\n  - Contains a single **red** connected rectangular \u201cframe-like\u201d region with an internal **black horizontal cavity** (a long black rectangle inside).\n  - No gray elements are present.\n\n### Pair 2 (Input 2 \u2192 Output 2)\n- **Input 2**\n  - Large **black** background grid.\n  - A dense **central cluster** made of many small repeated polyomino-like shapes in **three colors** (appearing as **maroon**, **light blue**, **yellow**), arranged in a roughly **diamond/parallelogram** footprint.\n  - Small **gray corner/L-like components** appear near the **right side** and **bottom-right**.\n- **Output 2**\n  - A **tall, narrow** grid (strip-like).\n  - Filled with a **tessellated/stacked pattern** of **maroon**, **light blue**, and **yellow** regions.\n  - A small **black** region appears near the bottom.\n  - No gray elements are present.\n\n### Pair 3 (Input 3 \u2192 Output 3)\n- **Input 3**\n  - Large **black** background grid.\n  - Several **vertical rectangular columns** near the **top-left**, in colors including **orange**, **red**, **green** (multiple columns), each showing internal **black square holes** (\u201cwindow\u201d-like gaps).\n  - Two small **gray corner/L-like components** near the **right side** (one higher, one lower).\n- **Output 3**\n  - A **tall, narrow** grid (strip-like).\n  - A single **orange** vertical rectangle with multiple internal **black square holes** arranged down the strip.\n  - No gray elements are present.\n\n**Overall changes (input \u2192 output):**\n- Outputs are **much smaller** (cropped/tightly framed around some constructed result).\n- **Gray components disappear** in all outputs.\n- Outputs tend to be **one compact connected structure** (strip/frame) with **black used as internal holes/cavities**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identify transformation categories\n\n- **Object movement**: **present** (pieces/clusters end up in new compact layouts and/or extracted into a new small canvas)\n- **Object recoloring**: **maybe** (pair 1 and 3 outputs are monochrome despite multicolor inputs; pair 2 retains multiple colors)\n- **Bordering / outlining**: **maybe** (pair 1 and 3 look like \u201cframes/filled bars with holes\u201d)\n- **Filling holes or cavities**: **absent** (holes remain; black cavities persist)\n- **Removing noise / extracting main shape**: **present** (gray elements removed; background largely discarded)\n- **Copying / pasting / repositioning**: **present**\n- **Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center)**: **maybe** (gray corner markers suggest an anchor/target area; outputs are strip-like)\n- **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors**: **maybe** (monochrome outputs might reflect selecting one color/object)\n- **Size-based filtering or selection**: **maybe** (outputs look like they come from a dominant/selected structure)\n- **Symmetry or reflection operations**: **absent**\n- **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion**: **maybe** (the output structure could be a packed/assembled form rather than a direct crop)\n- **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping**: **absent**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Key non-obvious insights (crucial)\n\n1. **Gray corner/L-like components are consistently excluded from the output**, implying they are either pure distractors or act as *markers* (e.g., for size/orientation) rather than content.\n2. **Outputs are \u201ctight\u201d**: the result is presented with minimal surrounding background; black mainly appears as **intentional interior holes**, not as padding around the main shape.\n3. The transformation seems to **convert multiple separated/repeated units into one compact connected strip/frame**, suggesting a \u201cpacking/stacking/straightening\u201d style of operation rather than simple recolor-only.\n4. **Internal cavities matter**: black holes inside the final structure are preserved and appear structurally organized (one long cavity in pair 1; repeated windows in pair 3).\n5. **Orientation varies by example** (wide horizontal result in pair 1 vs tall vertical strips in pairs 2\u20133), hinting that the process may depend on an inferred direction/extent (possibly tied to marker placement or the dominant cluster\u2019s geometry).\n6. **Color handling differs across examples**: one output keeps multiple colors (pair 2), while others collapse to a single foreground color (pairs 1 and 3). This suggests either **selecting a specific object/color subset** or **recoloring after assembly** under certain conditions.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)\n\nMost likely, the task **identifies the meaningful non-gray blocks**, then **compacts/assembles them into a single connected rectangular strip/frame**, preserving any enclosed black \u201choles,\u201d and finally **crops** to the result\u2019s bounding box.  \nA secondary behavior may be that the final assembled structure is sometimes **recolored uniformly to a chosen input color** (e.g., the selected/dominant piece\u2019s color), while in other cases the **original multi-color pattern is preserved**.\n\n(Alternative plausible family: the gray corner shapes define a **target strip/area** (size + orientation), and the colored cluster is **mapped/packed** into that target area.)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Checks you would perform when solving\n\n1. **Locate gray corner components** and test whether their positions/orientations imply the **output\u2019s dimensions** (strip height/width) or direction (horizontal vs vertical).\n2. **Extract all non-black, non-gray connected components** and see whether the output can be formed by **stacking/concatenating** these components into one compact strip (with no gaps).\n3. Compare **hole counts/placement**: do black holes in the output match the **sum/concatenation** of holes from selected input components (especially in pair 3)?\n4. Test whether the output foreground color (when monochrome) equals:\n   - the **largest component\u2019s** color,\n   - the **leftmost/topmost** component\u2019s color,\n   - or a color **indicated by marker proximity**.\n5. For the multi-color cluster case (pair 2), check if the output equals the input cluster after a consistent **row/column shift (\u201cde-shear/straighten\u201d) + crop**.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Summarize final insights\n\nHINT_START\n* Gray corner-like pieces never appear in outputs; treat them as non-output markers/distractors.\n* The output is a tightly cropped, single connected strip/frame assembled from the meaningful colored structures.\n* Black cells in outputs function as preserved internal cavities (holes/windows), not as external background padding.\n* Orientation and (sometimes) monochrome recoloring likely depend on which structure is selected and/or how the marker geometry implies the target strip.\nHINT_END",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nMonochrome connected objects on a mostly uniform background (often color 0). Object shapes include: isolated pixels; small clusters (pairs/2x2); short horizontal/vertical bars; stem+bar glyphs (T/ladder-like); hollow frames with interior color 0 (notably 3x3 donuts and wider arch-like frames); U/C-shaped borders; repeated tiled copies of frame objects; and at least one large multi-color symmetric motif built from small blocks/segments (colors 4/8/9). Colors used include 0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nOpenAI Background Job resp_09c966c9e4e90fa600693c0985546c8191a68ad76df32f15ce timed out after 3600s\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Deep Dive into ARC Problem-Solving**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got. The task seems to revolve around taking an input grid, which is typically a large black area with some colored shapes, and producing a smaller output grid based on a few examples. The secret sauce is the gray \"5\" shapes scattered around the input. These 5s define a \"camera\", a viewfinder, or a \"crop\" of sorts.  I've broken it down step-by-step:\n\nFirst, I need to find the \"Bounding Box\" (BB) of all the 5s. This BB defines the size of my output grid. The 5s also seem to contain some logical meaning within the space it defines.\n\nSecond, the input shapes can have multiple shapes, with the first shape in the sequence setting some kind of key. I need to analyze how these shapes are positioned, as the output is somehow a continuation or an instantiation of that pattern.\n\nThird, the contents inside the BB are where things get tricky. It's not a direct copy, but some kind of logical extraction and placement. In other words, I'm not just copying the colors inside the crop, I am building something.\n\nIt's all about pattern recognition and extrapolation. The \"5\" shapes are a query. I have to look for and describe the shape-objects in terms of size, number, position, color and any other relationships. Then use the \"5\" to locate the same pattern and use it to predict the correct objects and their positions within the output grid.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid into an output grid based on patterns inferred from solved examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Task:**\n1.  **Input Structure:** The inputs contain \"connected objects\" (shapes made of colors) and a distinct set of pixels of color 5 (gray).\n2.  **The Role of Color 5:** In all examples, the color 5 pixels form the corners or boundaries of a rectangular region. The dimensions of the output grid exactly match the dimensions of the bounding box defined by these color 5 pixels.\n    *   Example 1: Color 5 bounding box is 6x3. Output is 6x3.\n    *   Example 2: Color 5 bounding box is 2x14. Output is 2x14.\n    *   Example 3: Color 5 bounding box is 3x17. Output is 3x17.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The output grid is a \"crop\" or \"generation\" of the pattern inside the region defined by the color 5 markers.\n\n3.  **Pattern Extrapolation:** The content inside the color 5 region in the input is mostly empty (0s) or contains the markers themselves. The output, however, is filled with the complex patterns seen elsewhere in the grid. This implies we must **predict or extend the pattern** into the target region defined by the color 5 markers.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n1.  **Identify Pattern Sequence:**\n    The input shows a sequence of objects growing downwards:\n    *   **Group 1 (Rows 0-1):** A solid block of color 3 (width 5).\n    *   **Group 2 (Rows 3-6):**\n        *   Item 1: A solid block of color 2 (width 5).\n        *   Item 2: A split block of color 3 (width 9, gap 3).\n    *   **Group 3 (Rows 8-13):**\n        *   Item 1: A solid block of color 3 (width 5).\n        *   Item 2: A split block of color 2 (width 9, gap 3).\n        *   Item 3: A split block of color 3 (width 13, gap 7).\n    \n    The pattern follows a recursive structure where **Group N** has N items.\n    *   Item 1 is always a \"Solid\" block (width 5).\n    *   Item `k` is a \"Split\" block expanding outwards (Split `k-1`).\n    *   The split sizes increase: Split 0 (Solid) -> Split 1 (Gap 3) -> Split 2 (Gap 7). The outer width increases by 4 each step (5 -> 9 -> 13 -> 17).\n    *   The colors alternate starting colors for each group:\n        *   Group 1 starts with 3.\n        *   Group 2 starts with 2.\n        *   Group 3 starts with 3.\n        *   **Group 4 should start with 2.**\n    *   Within a group, colors alternate (e.g., Group 3: 3 -> 2 -> 3).\n\n2.  **Predict Group 4:**\n    The target region (defined by color 5s) covers **Rows 16-23**. This corresponds to the location of **Group 4** (assuming a gap between groups as seen previously). Group 4 should have 4 items.\n    *   **Item 1 (Rows 16-17):** Color 2, Solid (Width 5).\n    *   **Item 2 (Rows 18-19):** Color 3, Split 1 (Width 9, Gap 3).\n    *   **Item 3 (Rows 20-21):** Color 2, Split 2 (Width 13, Gap 7).\n    *   **Item 4 (Rows 22-23):** Color 3, Split 3 (Width 17, Gap 11).\n\n3.  **Define Shapes:**\n    *   **Solid (Color C):** Top row `C,C,C,C,C`. Bottom row `C,0,0,0,C`.\n    *   **Split (Color C, Inner Color I):**\n        *   Top row: `C,C,C` ... gap ... `C,C,C`.\n        *   Bottom row: `C,0,I` ... gap ... `I,0,C`.\n        *   Note: The inner pixel `I` is the *alternate* color (e.g., if Main is 3, Inner is 2).\n\n4.  **Construct Output:**\n    The bounding box of 5s has width 17. The expanding pattern fits perfectly into this width (Item 4 has width 17).\n    \n    *   **Row 0,1 (Item 1):** 2-Solid.\n        `0,0,0,0,0,0, 2,2,2,2,2, 0,0,0,0,0,0`\n        `0,0,0,0,0,0, 2,0,0,0,2, 0,0,0,0,0,0`\n    *   **Row 2,3 (Item 2):** 3-Split1.\n        `0,0,0,0, 3,3,3, 0,0,0, 3,3,3, 0,0,0,0`\n        `0,0,0,0, 3,0,2, 0,0,0, 2,0,3, 0,0,0,0`\n    *   **Row 4,5 (Item 3):** 2-Split2.\n        `0,0, 2,2,2, 0,0,0,0,0,0,0, 2,2,2, 0,0`\n        `0,0, 2,0,3, 0,0,0,0,0,0,0, 3,0,2, 0,0`\n    *   **Row 6,7 (Item 4):** 3-Split3.\n        `3,3,3, 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, 3,3,3`\n        `3,0,2, 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, 2,0,3`\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0\n0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0\n0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,2,0,0\n3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3\n3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nMonochrome connected objects on a mostly uniform background (often color 0). Object shapes include: isolated pixels; small clusters (pairs/2x2); short horizontal/vertical bars; stem+bar glyphs (T/ladder-like); hollow frames with interior color 0 (notably 3x3 donuts and wider arch-like frames); U/C-shaped borders; repeated tiled copies of frame objects; and at least one large multi-color symmetric motif built from small blocks/segments (colors 4/8/9). Colors used include 0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nOpenAI Background Job resp_09c966c9e4e90fa600693c0985546c8191a68ad76df32f15ce timed out after 3600s\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation pattern:\n\n**Analyzing the 5-markers:**\nEach example has two L-shaped patterns made of 5s. These define a direction and distance:\n- Example 1: 5s span horizontally (cols 19-24), output is 6 columns wide\n- Example 2: 5s span vertically (rows 14-27), output is 14 rows tall  \n- Example 3: 5s span vertically (rows 1-17), output is 17 rows tall\n\nThe span between 5s determines the output dimension in that direction.\n\n**Analyzing the color choice:**\n- Example 1: Uses color 2 (following the color progression pattern)\n- Example 3: Uses color 7 (the dominant/first color in the diagonal pattern)\n\n**Analyzing the unit pattern:**\nThe output extends the basic \"unit\" of one color in the indicated direction:\n- Example 1: The 2-colored pattern (bar-edge-bar) extended horizontally\n- Example 3: The 7-colored pattern (bar-edges) repeated vertically\n\n**For the test input:**\n- First 5 group: rows 15-16, cols 6-7\n- Second 5 group: rows 21-22, cols 21-22\n- Horizontal span: col 6 to col 22 = 17 columns (primary direction)\n- Direction is mostly horizontal\n\nThe main pattern consists of concentric frames using colors 3 (outer) and 2 (inner). The basic frame unit is:\n```\n3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,3\n```\n\nSince the 5s indicate horizontal extension and color 3 forms the outer frames, the output should be color 3's pattern extended to 17 columns:\n- Top row: continuous bar of 3s (17 columns)\n- Bottom row: edges on both sides with 0s in the middle\n\n**Output:**\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n```",

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "### 1) Identify what part becomes the output\nIn all three solved examples, the color **5** is not part of the final picture: it acts as a **marker** that defines a rectangular \u201cmissing piece\u201d.  \nThe **output grid size is exactly the bounding box of all 5-cells**:\n\n- Find all cells with value **5**\n- Compute their bounding box:  \n  \\[\n  r_{\\min}\\dots r_{\\max},\\; c_{\\min}\\dots c_{\\max}\n  \\]\n- The output grid has height \\((r_{\\max}-r_{\\min}+1)\\) and width \\((c_{\\max}-c_{\\min}+1)\\)\n\nFor the test input, the 5-cells occur in two small corner clusters (near row 15 col 6\u20137, and near row 23 col 21\u201322).  \nSo the bounding box is:\n\n- rows **15..23** \u2192 height **9**\n- cols **6..22** \u2192 width **17**\n\nTherefore the output must be a **9\u00d717** grid.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Determine what pattern fills that box\nAbove the 5-box, the grid contains repeated \u201ctwo-ended\u201d motifs made from colors **2** and **3**:\n\n- A \u201cfull\u201d row: two **3-long bars** (one on the left side, one on the right side)\n- Followed by a \u201ccorner\u201d row: only the four endpoints, where the **outer endpoints keep the bar color** and the **inner endpoints flip to the other color**\n\nThis is visible in the input around rows 10\u201313 (the motif exists at narrower widths there). The next outward step is exactly what the 5-box is marking (it spans the widest left/right positions).\n\nThe last visible outward step (just above the gap row) is a 3-based step, so the next step uses **2** as the main bar color, with the inner endpoints becoming **3**.\n\nFinally, as in the examples where the missing box is taller than a single 3-row unit, the motif is **stacked vertically** to fill the entire 5-box height, producing alternating full/corner rows, starting and ending with a full row.\n\nSo within the 17 columns of the output:\n- Full rows: `2,2,2` at the left edge and `2,2,2` at the right edge\n- Corner rows: `2` at the far left, `3` at the inner-left end, `3` at the inner-right end, `2` at the far right\n\n---\n\n### 3) Output grid (9\u00d717)\n\n0: `2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2`  \n1: `2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,2`  \n(repeat alternating, ending with a full row)\n\n```csv\n2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2\n2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,2\n2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2\n2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,2\n2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2\n2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,2\n2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2\n2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,2\n2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2\n```",

Each color forms its own contiguous regions, creating a layered or nested appearance.\n\n- **Colors used**\n  - Foreground colors appearing across the set include: **color 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9** (with color 0 commonly acting as background and also as \u201choles\u201d inside frame objects).\n\n<objects_summary>Monochrome connected objects on a mostly uniform background (often color 0). Object shapes include: isolated pixels; small clusters (pairs/2x2); short horizontal/vertical bars; stem+bar glyphs (T/ladder-like); hollow frames with interior color 0 (notably 3x3 donuts and wider arch-like frames); U/C-shaped borders; repeated tiled copies of frame objects; and at least one large multi-color symmetric motif built from small blocks/segments (colors 4/8/9).
