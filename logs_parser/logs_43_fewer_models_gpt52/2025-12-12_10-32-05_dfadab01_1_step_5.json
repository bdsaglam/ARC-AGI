            "Full raw LLM response": "**Okay, let's break down this ARC task. My goal is to figure out the transformation rule applied to the input to get the output. This seems like a \"block-based\" problem where input pixels define the shapes or properties of 4x4 blocks in the output grid.**\n\n1.  **Grid structure analysis:** The 20x20 input and output strongly suggest a 5x5 grid of 4x4 blocks.  Example 2 (10x10) doesn't fit the 4x4 mold, so Example 1 is guiding the way.\n\n2.  **Pixel-to-shape mapping:** The input contains sparse pixels with colors (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 8). These seem to *activate* or *trigger* specific 4x4 shapes in the output. This is crucial: the pixel color is the key. Example 4 confirms this: each color maps to a *different* 4x4 pattern.\n\n3.  **Dictionary of Glyphs:**  It seems there's an implicit dictionary: color X maps to shape/color Y. This dictionary is built from the given examples. Ex. 2 -> Color 4 (yellow). Ex 4. 2 -> Yellow. 3->Blue Diamond (1), 5 -> Magenta Checker (6), and 8 -> Orange X (7).\n\n4.  **Column Override & Offset Importance:**  Here's where it gets interesting: the column determines which block gets applied. The critical detail is how pixels positioned *within* each 4x4 block determine the output. If a pixel is in the *topmost* position in a block-column. This overrides whatever else is below and creates the appropriate shape. Examples 1 and 4 have offset-zero pixels that drive the block's behavior, but examples like Ex1 are thrown off when other pixels are in the same block.\n\n5.  **Test Case:** The Test Input strongly implies that this concept persists. The 8 at the top of the columns sets the Orange X shape. All blocks at an offset of 1 will become X-shaped blocks in a pattern. The input can be summarized with a grid with ones where an orange block can be found and zeros where it can't.\n\nNow, all I need to do is apply this rule to generate the output based on the input. Each block's output is determined from what's in its column, at offset 1 or zero, and, more specifically, by its color. With a good model in hand, this should be easy.\n\n\nThe transformation rule inferred from the examples is as follows:\n\n1.  **Grid Decomposition:** The 20x20 input grid is treated as a 5x5 array of 4x4 distinct blocks.\n2.  **Block Activation:** A 4x4 block in the output is \"activated\" if the corresponding 4x4 area in the input contains any non-zero pixels.\n3.  **Pattern Determination:** The shape and color of the activated output block are determined by a \"dictionary\" of glyphs associated with input colors.\n    *   Input Color `2` (Red) $\\rightarrow$ Output: **Yellow Hollow Square** (Color 4).\n    *   Input Color `3` (Green) $\\rightarrow$ Output: **Blue Hollow Diamond** (Color 1).\n    *   Input Color `5` (Gray) $\\rightarrow$ Output: **Magenta Checkerboard** (Color 6).\n    *   Input Color `8` (Azure) $\\rightarrow$ Output: **Orange X** (Color 7).\n4.  **Column Override/Persistence:** If the input pixels are aligned such that they are not at the top-left of their respective blocks (specifically, if they have a non-zero row offset, as seen in Example 1 and the Test Input), the \"type\" of the pattern for the entire column of blocks is determined by the topmost input pixel in that column.\n    *   In the Test Input, the top-most pixel in every occupied column is an `8` (at row 1, which corresponds to row offset 1 in the first block).\n    *   Therefore, all activated blocks in the output will use the pattern for `8`, which is the **Orange X** (Color 7).\n5.  **Output Construction:** For every block $(row, col)$ in the 5x5 grid:\n    *   Check if the input has any pixels in that block's region.\n    *   If yes, fill the output block with the **Orange X** pattern.\n    *   If no, leave the block empty (all 0s).\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n*   **Column 0:** Blocks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 are active (Inputs at rows 1, 5, 9, 13, 17). $\\rightarrow$ All 5 blocks are Orange X.\n*   **Column 1:** Blocks 0, 1, 2, 4 are active (Inputs at rows 1, 5, 9, 17). Block 3 is empty. $\\rightarrow$ 4 blocks are Orange X.\n*   **Column 2:** Blocks 0, 4 are active (Inputs at rows 1, 17). Blocks 1, 2, 3 are empty. $\\rightarrow$ 2 blocks are Orange X.\n*   **Column 3:** Blocks 0, 3, 4 are active (Inputs at rows 1, 13, 17). Blocks 1, 2 are empty. $\\rightarrow$ 3 blocks are Orange X.\n*   **Column 4:** Blocks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 are active (Inputs at rows 1, 5, 9, 13, 17). $\\rightarrow$ All 5 blocks are Orange X.\n\n**Orange X Shape:**\n```\n7 0 0 7\n0 7 7 0\n0 7 7 0\n7 0 0 7\n```\n\noutput:\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7",

For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Grid Structure**: The input contains a grid of marker points (single colored pixels) that define a meta-grid of cells.\n\n2. **Shape Template**: There's a 4x4 shape pattern defined in the input (in this test case, the anti-diagonal pattern with 7s at rows 5-8, cols 4-7).\n\n3. **Marker-to-Pattern Mapping**: Each marker color maps to a specific pattern:\n   - Color 2 \u2192 hollow rectangle (pattern 4)\n   - Color 3 \u2192 hollow diamond (pattern 1)  \n   - Color 5 \u2192 diagonal (pattern 6)\n   - Color 8 \u2192 anti-diagonal (pattern 7)\n\n4. **Transformation Rule**: For each cell in the meta-grid:\n   - If there's a marker at that position, draw the corresponding pattern\n   - If no marker exists (including where the shape template is), leave it empty\n\n**Analyzing the test input**:\n- Markers (all value 8) are at rows 1, 5, 9, 13, 17 and various columns\n- The shape template (anti-diagonal with 7s) is at cell (1,1) - rows 5-8, cols 4-7\n- Missing markers at positions: (5,4), (5,8), (5,12), (9,4), (9,12), (13,4), (13,8)\n\nFor each cell with marker 8, I draw the anti-diagonal pattern. Cells without markers remain empty.\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n```",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Okay, let's break down this ARC problem. Here's my thought process:**\n\nI'm being asked to solve an ARC task based on examples. The goal is to generate an output grid given an input grid, following a pattern. I need to analyze the examples to understand the transformation rules.\n\n1.  **Initial Observations and Hypotheses:**\n\n    *   The input seems to contain \"seed\" pixels of specific colors and potentially noise/distractor shapes.\n    *   The output appears to be a grid of repeating patterns. The grid size is usually the same as the input.\n    *   Example 1 showed initial confusion with grid dimensions, but it looks like there are tiles.\n    *   Looking at Example 2 and 4, the output is filled with tiles.\n    *   **Hypothesis 1:** Perhaps the output has 4x4 tiles, with 20x20 total.\n    *   **Hypothesis 2 (Refined):** Focus on seed pixels. Could be that we need to find the non-zero pixel in each 4x4 or 5x5 tile to determine the output tile.\n    *   Example 1 text data shows patterns not completely aligning at first glance.\n    *   Example 2, the blue shape has structure that makes counting difficult, but 5x5 tile size appears valid.\n\n2.  **Delving Deeper and Refinement:**\n\n    *   Looked again at Example 1 output and discovered a pattern where it is the seed pixels that affect output. There seems to be a consistent mapping from input colors to output patterns.\n    *   Example 1 is confusing, but by examining row and column, I found 2 appears as hollow square 4x4 at position (1,8) -> output appears at same offset (1,8).\n    *   *Now:* The input is a map where seed pixels (not a grid of values) dictate the tiling.\n    *   Example 1, again. At (11,8)=5. Output is 2x2. (11,2)=3. Output 4x4 diamond shape. Grid arrangement is being preserved from the input.\n    *   Each seed pixel at coordinate (r, c) creates its output pattern with the top-left corner at (r, c).\n    *   **Hypothesis Refined: For every non-zero pixel (or cluster) in the input, expand it into a pattern in the output.**\n    *   Let's check 6s, and look at image 1. Then I see 6 -> Empty, with a blue shape instead.\n\n3.  **Pattern Discovery and Color Mapping:**\n\n    *   Reread Example 1. There are 2x2 blocks of 6, so they make a different 2x2 pattern.\n    *   In the text, 6 maps to zero in the output. The example images are showing different things. Text will be primary.\n    *   In the output text of Example 1, the 6 appears to vanish.\n    *   The magenta squares are removed (6->0), not mapped.\n    *   Looking at Example 3, the yellow squares (4) vanish in the output.\n    *   The seed 2 -> a yellow square pattern.\n    *   **So, Seed Pixels trigger the patterns, the other objects vanish.**\n    *   In Example 2, the blue shapes appear in the input as 3s, not just as 1s.\n    *   A lot of patterns.\n    *   **Color Mapping Table:**\n        *   2 (Red) -> 4x4 Yellow Hollow Square\n        *   3 (Green) -> 4x4 Blue Diamond/Circle shape\n        *   5 (Grey) -> 2x2 Magenta Diagonal Blocks\n        *   8 (Azure) -> Orange X-Shape\n        *   Other colors are ignored, map to 0 (remove)\n    *   The input pixel (r,c) anchors (top-left) the output 4x4 or 2x2 pattern.\n    *   The noise is ignored in the tiling patterns, but the patterns overlap if the location permits.\n    *   The tile size can be 4 or 2 depending on the example. The scale and pattern depend on the data.\n    *   Check overlap between the pixel and patterns.\n    *   No overlap found in the tests, even though 17 has offset.\n    *   Verify the table with Example 4, and the table works.\n    *   Input (0,0) with color 2 should make a Yellow hollow square in the output.\n\n4.  **Solving the Test Input:**\n\n    *   Scan Test Input\n\nThe problem requires transforming an input grid into an output grid by identifying specific \"seed\" pixels and expanding them into 4x4 patterns. The grid size is preserved (20x20 in the test case).\n\n**Rules derived from examples:**\n1.  **Grid Transformation:** The input contains single pixels (\"seeds\") of specific colors and sometimes larger \"distractor\" shapes. The output is constructed by placing 4x4 patterned tiles anchored at the location of each seed pixel (top-left corner).\n2.  **Seed-to-Pattern Mapping:**\n    *   **2 (Red) $\\rightarrow$** 4x4 Yellow (4) Hollow Square.\n    *   **3 (Green) $\\rightarrow$** 4x4 Blue (1) Diamond/Circle shape (`0110/1001/1001/0110`).\n    *   **5 (Grey) $\\rightarrow$** 4x4 Magenta (6) Diagonal Blocks (`6600/6600/0066/0066`).\n    *   **8 (Azure) $\\rightarrow$** 4x4 Orange (7) X-Shape.\n        *   Pattern:\n            `7,0,0,7`\n            `0,7,7,0`\n            `0,7,7,0`\n            `7,0,0,7`\n3.  **Distractors:** Existing patterns in the input (like the orange X-shape seen in the test input or the yellow square in example 3) are treated as noise and removed (mapped to 0), unless a seed pixel dictates a pattern there.\n4.  **Placement:** The seed pixel at $(r, c)$ becomes the top-left corner $(0,0)$ of the 4x4 pattern in the output. If the pattern extends beyond the grid boundaries, it is clipped.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Grid Size:** 20x20.\n*   **Seed Color:** The input contains pixels of color 8 (Azure). There are also pre-formed patterns of color 7 (Orange) which are distractors.\n*   **Target Pattern:** 8 maps to the Orange (7) X-Shape.\n*   **Seed Locations:**\n    *   **Row 1:** Cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. (All 5 slots).\n    *   **Row 5:** Cols 0, 16. (Cols 4-7 contain the distractor pattern which is ignored).\n    *   **Row 9:** Cols 0, 8, 16.\n    *   **Row 13:** Cols 0, 12, 16.\n    *   **Row 17:** Cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. (All 5 slots).\n\n**Construction:**\nWe create a 20x20 black grid and place the 4x4 Orange X-pattern at the seed locations.\n*   **Row 0:** Empty (all 0s).\n*   **Rows 1-4:** Patterns at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n*   **Rows 5-8:** Patterns at 0, 16. (Middle is 0).\n*   **Rows 9-12:** Patterns at 0, 8, 16.\n*   **Rows 13-16:** Patterns at 0, 12, 16.\n*   **Rows 17-19:** Patterns at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. Since the seeds are at row 17, the pattern occupies rows 17, 18, 19, and 20. Row 20 is out of bounds, so the last line of the pattern (`7,0,0,7`) is clipped.\n\n**Final Output Grid:**\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Identify the template pattern**: In the input, there's a defined shape (like a hollow square or 2x2 diagonal blocks) in a specific color.\n\n2. **Identify the markers**: Single pixels at grid positions indicate where to place patterns.\n\n3. **Color pairing rule**: There's a pairing relationship between colors:\n   - (1, 3): marker 3 \u2192 pattern in color 1\n   - (2, 4): marker 2 \u2192 pattern in color 4\n   - (5, 6): marker 5 \u2192 pattern in color 6\n   - (7, 8): marker 8 \u2192 pattern in color 7\n\n4. **Placement**: At each marker position, place a 4x4 pattern. The template pattern's shape is used when the marker color is paired with the template color. The original template location becomes blank if there's no marker there.\n\n**For the test input:**\n- Template: Orange (7) hollow square at cell (1,1), rows 5-8, cols 4-7\n- Markers: Azure (8) pixels at various grid positions\n- Since 8 and 7 are paired, marker 8 produces the hollow square pattern in color 7\n\n**Grid structure**: 5\u00d75 cells, each 4\u00d74, with markers at rows 1, 5, 9, 13, 17 and cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16\n\n**Cells with marker 8**: All cells in rows 0 and 4; cells (1,0), (1,4); cells (2,0), (2,2), (2,4); cells (3,0), (3,3), (3,4)\n\n**Cells without markers**: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2) \u2192 remain blank\n\nThe hollow square pattern:\n```\n7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7\n```\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred transformation\n\nAcross the solved examples, every *single marker pixel* expands into a **4\u00d74 tile** whose **top-left corner is exactly the marker\u2019s position**. The marker color determines which 4\u00d74 pattern (and output color) is drawn:\n\n- **Color 2 \u2192 color 4** : 4\u00d74 hollow square (full border)\n  ```\n  4 4 4 4\n  4 0 0 4\n  4 0 0 4\n  4 4 4 4\n  ```\n- **Color 3 \u2192 color 1** : 4\u00d74 \u201cborder without corners\u201d\n  ```\n  0 1 1 0\n  1 0 0 1\n  1 0 0 1\n  0 1 1 0\n  ```\n- **Color 5 \u2192 color 6** : 4\u00d74 with two diagonal 2\u00d72 blocks\n  ```\n  6 6 0 0\n  6 6 0 0\n  0 0 6 6\n  0 0 6 6\n  ```\n- **Color 8 \u2192 color 7** : 4\u00d74 X (both diagonals)\n  ```\n  7 0 0 7\n  0 7 7 0\n  0 7 7 0\n  7 0 0 7\n  ```\n\nAlso seen in the examples: sometimes one such 4\u00d74 tile is already drawn in the input as a \u201cdemonstration\u201d, with a marker located **4 down and 4 right** from that tile\u2019s top-left. That marker is just a label and is **not expanded**, and the already-drawn demo tile is **not kept**.\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\n- The input contains a pre-drawn **7-colored X tile** at rows 5\u20138, cols 4\u20137, and there is an **8** at (9,8) = (5,4)+(4,4), so that 8 is the label and is **ignored**, and the pre-drawn X is **removed**.\n- Every other **8** that can fit a full 4\u00d74 tile inside the grid (start row \u2264 16, start col \u2264 16) is expanded into the **7-colored X tile**.\n- The 8s on row 17 cannot fit a 4\u00d74 tile, so they simply disappear.\n\n### Output grid\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

include black cells/holes as part of their template.\n* Icon placements are lattice-like (regularly aligned), suggesting \u201cstamp icons at marker locations\u201d or \u201cpack a lattice of stamped

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Task Decomposition and Hypothesis Formation**\n\nAlright, the user wants me to solve this Abstract Reasoning Challenge (ARC) task. It looks like I'm given a bunch of examples and need to figure out a rule that transforms input grids into output grids. The input grids are mostly empty, with scattered, colored \"markers\", while the outputs are filled with complex, multi-colored patterns. The hint suggests replacing the markers with templates or motifs. Grid dimensions seem consistent.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. First, I need to understand the \"marker\" concept. In Example 1, the input has blocks of a single color. It's not just isolated pixels. After re-reading the prompt, it sounds like these are \"low resolution\" layouts, meaning inputs are simplified and not fully rendered. Comparing inputs and outputs, I notice the output in Ex 1 seems to have 4x4 blocks. Let's try 5x5 blocks in Ex 1, and map the marker in the input to the shape in output. It seems that each color maps to an output shape.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the grid size is different, and again, the output has repeated shapes. The shapes have 4x4 dimensions, which points to downsampling. The shapes are 4x4. The third example shows that the input contains the template's definition. The locations of the markers, and thus the output shapes, appear to be defined by the input. The key is in Example 3: If you have a pattern in the top-left, the output has this pattern somewhere else defined by the markers.\n\nSo, here's my hypothesis: The input grid is split into regions. One region defines a legend that describes the template shapes. The rest defines how to place those shapes. In Example 3 the template is made from 4s, while the marker is a 2. Let's see if 2 is consistent with all examples. Or maybe the template is at the top-left, and the colors are only a placement guide.\n\n**Refining the Hypothesis: Template Definition and Mapping**\n\nRevisiting Example 3, the shape definition and the markers (2) are both present, leading to the pattern replicated at locations specified by the markers. It doesn't seem that we are using all colors in the input to generate output. Now, the Example 3 shape is placed at (0,6), (6,0), and (6,6) as dictated by the '2' values. The input seems to *define* the shape's *color* and its *layout*.\n\nLooking closer, the input color defines the template, and another color defines its location. Maybe the template is *always* in the top-left corner? Let's check Example 1. It seems that the colors in input 1 are mapped to shapes in the output. The legend might be consumed and not present at the output. If the input contains a `6` block in the top-left of the input, why isn't it in the output?\n\nLet's look at Example 2 and 3 more. Example 2's output looks offset, so it's not a direct pixel mapping. Example 3 has the yellow hollow square (4) template in output. Then, where is `4` in the input? No such thing, but the `2`s determine the output placement. So there are some *hidden* definitions, or global knowledge. The color mapping might be: `2` maps to yellow, `3` maps to blue, and `5` maps to pink. Also, a different grid shape with new definitions (Ex 4).\n\nSo, the new hypothesis is: The input contains two kinds of information: shape \"templates\" and \"marker\" locations. The templates are in the input, and the markers are placed, and have color. Maybe the templates ARE inside the input?\n\n**Establishing a Consistent Color Mapping**\n\nIn Ex 1, Input has markers 2, 3, and 5 and has the hidden colors 4 (Yellow), 1 (Blue), 6 (Pink) in the Output. Let's find out how the color mapping happens. In Ex 1, Input 2 is Yellow (4), 3 is Blue (1), and 5 is Pink (6). In Example 1, the location of the pink template is determined by `5` which maps to Pink (6). But there are `2`s in the Input that dictate the location of the yellow hollow square (4).\n\nLet's look at Example 4. It also has this pattern: 2 maps to yellow (4), 3 maps to blue (1), and 5 maps to pink (6) and there is a new color: 8 maps to orange (7). Example 3 is similar. Example 2 has it. So this\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid containing isolated colored pixels (\"markers\") and potentially a shape definition into a grid filled with repeated patterns.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1.  **Identify Markers and Patterns:**\n    *   From the solved examples, we see a consistent mapping between specific marker colors and 4x4 structured motifs (icons).\n        *   Marker **2 (Red)** $\\rightarrow$ **Yellow (4)** Hollow Square.\n        *   Marker **3 (Green)** $\\rightarrow$ **Blue (1)** Hollow Octagon/Circle.\n        *   Marker **5 (Gray)** $\\rightarrow$ **Pink (6)** Checkerboard/Cluster.\n        *   Marker **8 (Azure)** $\\rightarrow$ **Orange (7)** Shape.\n    *   In some examples (like Example 2 and the Test Input), the shape associated with a marker is explicitly \"defined\" or drawn in the input grid using the target color, while the marker color is different.\n    *   The placement of the output icon corresponds to the location of the marker in the input. Specifically, the marker's position $(r, c)$ becomes the top-left corner of the 4x4 icon in the output.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Test Input:**\n    *   The input grid is 20x20.\n    *   It contains markers of color **8 (Azure)**.\n    *   It also contains a specific shape drawn in color **7 (Orange)** at rows 5-8, columns 4-7. This shape serves as the \"prototype\" or definition for the marker 8.\n    *   The Orange shape is:\n        ```\n        7, 0, 0, 7\n        0, 7, 7, 0\n        0, 7, 7, 0\n        7, 0, 0, 7\n        ```\n        This looks like an \"X\" or butterfly pattern.\n    *   We need to replace every occurrence of the marker **8** with this 4x4 Orange shape.\n    *   The original definition (the 7s at rows 5-8, cols 4-7) should be removed unless there is a marker there (there isn't; there is a 7 there). Only locations with markers (8) get the stamp.\n\n3.  **Locate Markers (Color 8):**\n    *   Row 1: Columns 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n    *   Row 5: Columns 0, 16.\n    *   Row 9: Columns 0, 8, 16.\n    *   Row 13: Columns 0, 12, 16.\n    *   Row 17: Columns 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n\n4.  **Construct the Output:**\n    *   Create a 20x20 black (0) grid.\n    *   For each marker at $(r, c)$, place the 4x4 Orange shape.\n    *   Handle boundary clipping: Markers at Row 17 will result in a shape spanning rows 17, 18, 19, 20. Row 20 is out of bounds, so only the first 3 rows of the shape will be visible.\n\n5.  **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n    *   **Row 0:** All 0.\n    *   **Rows 1-4:** Markers at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. The shape repeats across the whole width.\n    *   **Rows 5-8:** Markers at 0, 16. Shape at left edge and right edge. Middle is 0.\n    *   **Rows 9-12:** Markers at 0, 8, 16. Shape at left, center, right. Gaps at cols 4-7 and 12-15.\n    *   **Rows 13-16:** Markers at 0, 12, 16. Shape at left, then gap, gap, shape, shape.\n    *   **Rows 17-19:** Markers at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. Shape repeats across width, but bottom row of shape is cut off.\n\n**Output Grid Content:**\n*   Rows 1, 4, 8, 12, 17 are the top rows of the shapes (`7,0,0,7`).\n*   Rows 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, 18, 19 are the middle rows of the shapes (`0,7,7,0`).\n*   Rows 4, 8, 12, 16 are the bottom rows of the shapes (`7,0,0,7`).\n*   The pattern is applied only where markers existed.\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Inputs are mostly black with many isolated colored \u201cmarker\u201d cells; outputs contain repeated multi-cell **icon templates** instead of single pixels.\n* Each marker class/color appears to map consistently to one specific **structured motif** (hollow frame, cluster, solid block, checkerboard).\n* The original marker pixels disappear; icons include black cells/holes as part of their template.\n* Icon placements are lattice-like (regularly aligned), suggesting \u201cstamp icons at marker locations\u201d or \u201cpack a lattice of stamped icons.\u201d\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand how markers map to icon patterns.\n\nFrom the examples, I can identify a consistent mapping:\n- Marker **2** \u2192 Pattern **4** (solid hollow border)\n- Marker **3** \u2192 Pattern **1** (hollow diamond)\n- Marker **5** \u2192 Pattern **6** (diagonal 2\u00d72 blocks)\n- Marker **8** \u2192 Pattern **7** (X pattern)\n\nEach marker is replaced by its corresponding 4\u00d74 icon template.\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n- There are **8** markers at a 5\u00d75 grid of positions (rows 1, 5, 9, 13, 17; cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16)\n- There's a **7** pattern (X shape) at position (5,4)-(8,7) - this is the template for marker 8\n- The 8\u21927 mapping means all 8 markers should be replaced with the 7 pattern (X shape)\n\nThe 7 pattern template is:\n```\n7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7\n```\n\n**Identifying which cells have markers:**\n- Row 1: cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 \u2713\n- Row 5: cols 0, 16 (cols 4-7 have template, cols 8, 12 empty)\n- Row 9: cols 0, 8, 16 (cols 4, 12 empty)\n- Row 13: cols 0, 12, 16 (cols 4, 8 empty)\n- Row 17: cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 \u2713\n\nCells without markers (including the template area) remain blank.\n\n**Constructing the output:**\nEach 8 marker position gets the 7 pattern stamped. Empty positions stay as 0s.\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Inputs are mostly black with many isolated colored \u201cmarker\u201d cells; outputs contain repeated multi-cell **icon templates** instead of single pixels.\n* Each marker class/color appears to map consistently to one specific **structured motif** (hollow frame, cluster, solid block, checkerboard).\n* The original marker pixels disappear; icons include black cells/holes as part of their template.\n* Icon placements are lattice-like (regularly aligned), suggesting \u201cstamp icons at marker locations\u201d or \u201cpack a lattice of stamped icons.\u201d\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "### What the examples show\n\n1. **Only \u201cmarker\u201d pixels are used.**  \n   The inputs contain mostly black (0) with a few colored cells. The output is rebuilt from scratch using only the marker information; other existing shapes in the input (even if they look like an icon) do **not** get copied through.\n\n2. **A marker becomes a fixed 4\u00d74 icon (template) whose color/shape depends only on the marker color.**  \n   From the solved examples we can read off these templates (top-left aligned at the marker position):\n\n   - **Marker color 2 \u2192 icon made of color 4** (4\u00d74 hollow square):\n     ```\n     4 4 4 4\n     4 0 0 4\n     4 0 0 4\n     4 4 4 4\n     ```\n\n   - **Marker color 3 \u2192 icon made of color 1** (4\u00d74 \u201crounded\u201d frame, corners empty):\n     ```\n     0 1 1 0\n     1 0 0 1\n     1 0 0 1\n     0 1 1 0\n     ```\n\n   - **Marker color 5 \u2192 icon made of color 6** (two 2\u00d72 blocks on a diagonal):\n     ```\n     6 6 0 0\n     6 6 0 0\n     0 0 6 6\n     0 0 6 6\n     ```\n\n   - **Marker color 8 \u2192 icon made of color 7**:\n     ```\n     7 0 0 7\n     0 7 7 0\n     0 7 7 0\n     7 0 0 7\n     ```\n\n3. **Not every colored cell is a marker.**  \n   In the examples, the cells that get expanded are single-cell \u201cblobs\u201d (isolated pixels), while larger connected groups of a color act like non-marker content and disappear.\n\n4. **Markers that cannot fit a full 4\u00d74 icon in-bounds are skipped.**  \n   (This is consistent with the way edge cases are handled in the examples.)\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\n- The isolated marker color present is **8**, so we stamp the **4\u00d74 color-7 icon** at each isolated 8.\n- The 7\u2019s in the middle form a multi-cell connected shape (not isolated markers), so they are not expanded and do not persist.\n- Any 8 at row 17 would require rows 17\u201320 for a 4\u00d74 stamp, which goes out of bounds in a 20\u00d720 grid, so those are skipped.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n```text\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "## 1. Describe the observable structures (literal)\n\n### Pair 1 (Input 1 \u2192 Output 1)\n- **Input:** A black background with multiple **isolated single cells** in several colors (notably magenta/pink, red, green, and gray).  \n  - Near the **top-left** there is a short **diagonal/stepped** arrangement of colored cells (magenta/pink and gray).  \n  - Elsewhere, the colored cells appear **separated** (not forming large connected shapes), and several seem aligned in a loose grid.\n- **Output:** Black background with multiple **repeated multi-cell motifs**:\n  - Several **yellow hollow square frames** (a square outline with a black \u201chole\u201d inside), arranged together in a **2\u00d72 block** near the **upper-right**.\n  - Several **blue multi-cell motifs** (small structured clusters with black gaps/holes), clustered in the **lower half**.\n  - A few **magenta/pink solid blocky motifs**, clustered near the **lower middle-right**.\n- **Change:** Input singletons are no longer present as single pixels; output contains only the larger motifs. Input colors (red/green/gray) largely do not appear as-is in the output.\n- **Stable:** Background stays black; the output motifs are consistent/repeated rather than varied.\n\n### Pair 2 (Input 2 \u2192 Output 2)\n- **Input:** Black background with a small **blue multi-cell cluster** (already larger than a single pixel) plus a few **isolated red and green single cells**.\n- **Output:** Black background with a compact **2\u00d72 arrangement** of larger motifs:\n  - Two blue motifs similar in style to the blue cluster type.\n  - Two yellow hollow square frames.\n- **Change:** Red/green singletons disappear; output is made from repeated larger motifs.\n\n### Pair 3 (Input 3 \u2192 Output 3)\n- **Input:** Black background containing one **yellow hollow square frame** (multi-cell) near the **top-left**, plus several **isolated red single cells** elsewhere.\n- **Output:** Black background with **three yellow hollow square frames** placed at different positions (forming a \u201cthree-corners\u201d style layout). No red singletons remain visible.\n- **Change:** Red singletons disappear; number/placement of yellow frames changes compared to input.\n\n### Pair 4 (Input 4 \u2192 Output 4)\n- **Input:** A larger black grid with many **isolated single cells** in multiple colors (red, green, gray, light-blue/cyan-like).\n- **Output:** A larger black grid filled with many repeated motifs of several types:\n  - Yellow hollow square frames,\n  - Blue structured clusters,\n  - Magenta/pink blocky motifs,\n  - Orange-and-black **checkerboard-like blocks**.\n- **Change:** Many single cells become larger patterned motifs; output introduces patterns (holes/checkers) not present in input as singletons.\n- **Stable:** Black background remains; motifs repeat with consistent internal structure.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identify transformation categories\n\n- **Object movement:** maybe  \n- **Object recoloring:** present  \n- **Bordering / outlining:** present (hollow square frames)  \n- **Filling holes or cavities:** maybe (holes appear as part of motifs)  \n- **Removing noise / extracting main shape:** absent  \n- **Copying / pasting / repositioning:** present (many repeated motif copies)  \n- **Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center):** maybe  \n- **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors:** maybe  \n- **Size-based filtering or selection:** maybe  \n- **Symmetry or reflection operations:** absent  \n- **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion:** maybe (single pixels become larger stamps)  \n- **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping:** present  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Key non-obvious insights (crucial)\n\n1. **Output uses a small fixed \u201cvocabulary\u201d of icon templates** (yellow hollow frame, blue cluster, magenta block, orange checker/checker-like block) that recur across multiple pairs.\n2. **Input information is carried primarily by sparse markers (single cells) rather than input shapes**; the output shapes look templated rather than derived from each marker\u2019s local geometry.\n3. **There appears to be a near one-to-one relationship between markers and produced icons**: outputs show multiple copies of the same icon type, suggesting each input marker of a given class produces one corresponding icon.\n4. **Marker colors do not persist**; instead, each marker class seems to map to a different output motif *and often a different output color*.\n5. **Black \u201choles\u201d/black pixels are part of the produced motifs**, indicating the transformation isn\u2019t just scaling up a color\u2014it's stamping structured patterns with internal background.\n6. **Some inputs already contain one of the final motif types (Pairs 2\u20133)**, implying the solver should check whether such a motif acts as a template/example or is treated as another instance to be relocated/replicated.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)\n\nMost likely, the task **detects sparse colored markers** (and/or small motif instances) on a black field and **replaces each marker with a fixed multi-pixel icon template** determined by the marker\u2019s color/class. The output is then the composition of all stamped icons on the black background (with marker pixels removed), with icons aligned to a regular lattice (often appearing as compact blocks or corner placements).\n\nAlternative (template-driven) family: the input may sometimes **include an example icon**, and the task **copies that icon** to positions indicated by certain colored single-pixel markers, possibly removing the example instance afterward.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Checks you would perform when solving\n\n1. **Size/alignment check:** measure the icon footprint (e.g., 3\u00d73 vs 4\u00d74) and verify whether each icon is centered on, or anchored relative to, the original marker pixel coordinates.\n2. **Count correspondence:** for each input color, compare the number of markers to the number of output icons of a particular type (does each marker yield exactly one icon?).\n3. **Color\u2192icon mapping consistency:** infer which input colors map to which output motif types using pairs where only 1\u20132 colors appear.\n4. **Canvas-size rule:** verify whether output grid size equals input size (stamping in place) or if the output is a compressed/packed layout of the stamped icons.\n5. **Template presence behavior:** in pairs where an icon already exists in the input (e.g., a yellow hollow square), check whether it is preserved, ignored, removed, or used as the template to replicate elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Summarize final insights\n\nHINT_START\n* Inputs are mostly black with many isolated colored \u201cmarker\u201d cells; outputs contain repeated multi-cell **icon templates** instead of single pixels.\n* Each marker class/color appears to map consistently to one specific **structured motif** (hollow frame, cluster, solid block, checkerboard).\n* The original marker pixels disappear; icons include black cells/holes as part of their template.\n* Icon placements are lattice-like (regularly aligned), suggesting \u201cstamp icons at marker locations\u201d or \u201cpack a lattice of stamped icons.\u201d\nHINT_END",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nBackground: color 0. Foreground objects include (1) color 4 hollow square frames (usually 4\u00d74, 1-cell border, 2\u00d72 interior hole; sometimes connected into larger outlined regions with multiple holes), (2) solid 2\u00d72 blocks (notably color 6, sometimes arranged in pairs within a 4\u00d74), (3) 4\u00d74 motifs: a color 1 ring made of four 2-cell side segments around a 2\u00d72 hole with empty corners, and a color 7 motif with a central 2\u00d72 block plus four corner pixels, and (4) isolated single-pixel markers in colors 2/3/5/7/8.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nIdentify single-cell markers (notably 2,3,5,8). For each marker at (r,c), generate a fixed 4\u00d74 motif with its top-left at (r,c): 2\u2192a 4-bordered frame, 3\u2192a 1 ring (corners/center 0), 5\u2192two diagonal 2\u00d72 blocks of 6, 8\u2192a 7 motif with 7 at corners and central 2\u00d72. Remove/overwrite the original marker pixels and erase unrelated input objects. Omit motifs that do not fit in-bounds, and possibly omit/resolve motifs that would overlap or are treated as noise.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Problem Breakdown and Solution Strategy**\n\nThe task involves transforming a grid based on identified \"marker\" pixels. I've broken it down into identifying the markers, understanding their associated transformations, and then constructing the output grid. The primary transformation is \"8\" (from the input) produces a \"7 motif\". I need to follow these steps carefully.\n\n**Understanding the Motifs**\n\nI've carefully analyzed the examples, focusing on how each marker affects the output:\n*   **The Markers**: I identify the key markers (2, 3, 5, 8). Each is associated with a specific 4x4 pattern (motif).\n*   **The \"7-Motif\":** The \"7-motif\" is the key. For the test input, all the relevant markers are '8'. The output pattern associated with '8' will be a specific design of the '7' color. The rule for constructing it: Place a \"7 motif\" (7 at corners, 7 central 2x2) at the marker location.\n*   **Boundaries & Overlaps:** I must handle markers that go out of bounds. If a motif would extend beyond the grid, it must be omitted. If there are overlapping markers, \"later beats earlier\" meaning the most recent marker is drawn. I assume the overlap issue doesn't come into play. There will not be any overlap in the test input.\n\n**Applying the Logic to the Test Input**\n\nI applied the extracted logic to the specific test input:\n*   **Identify Markers**: I identified the '8' markers present in the test input (isolated single pixels that are not part of any existing object).\n*   **Out-of-Bounds Markers**: Based on the grid size, I discard motifs that go out of bounds.\n*   **Constructing the Output Grid**: A black grid (filled with '0') is the starting point. Markers will be overlaid on top. I systematically iterate through the grid, finding marker pixels and drawing their associated motifs at the right place.\n\n**The Test Input Analysis**\n*   The valid positions for markers 8 are (1,0), (1,4), (1,8), (1,12), (1,16), (5,0), (5,16), (9,0), (9,8), (9,16), (13,0), (13,12), (13,16). \n*   They are placed in such a way that no overlap can take place.\n*   The \"7-motif\" will be placed on (1,0), (1,4), (1,8), (1,12), (1,16) and (5,0), (5,16) and (9,0), (9,8), (9,16) and (13,0), (13,12), (13,16) and the other places would be filled with zeros.\n*   I will draw only the valid motifs in their corresponding locations.\n\n**Final Output**\n\nBased on this analysis, I have derived the correct grid, where the \"7-motif\" are placed on the valid locations, and other places are filled with zeros.\n\n\nThe logic for solving this task is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Markers and Noise**: The input grid consists of a background (color 0), pre-existing objects, and isolated single-pixel \"markers\". The goal is to identify these markers and generate specific 4x4 motifs based on their color and position. All other existing pixels (such as the block of 7s in the test input) are treated as noise and removed (overwritten with 0). In the test input, the only valid markers are the isolated pixels of color **8**. The cluster of 7s is an object, not a marker, and is ignored.\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule**: Each marker of color 8 generates a \"7-motif\".\n    *   **Motif Shape**: A 4x4 grid with color 7 at the four corners and a solid 2x2 block of color 7 in the center.\n    *   **Pattern**:\n        ```\n        7 0 0 7\n        0 7 7 0\n        0 7 7 0\n        7 0 0 7\n        ```\n    *   **Placement**: The motif is drawn with its top-left corner located exactly at the marker's coordinates $(r, c)$.\n\n3.  **Boundary Constraints**: A crucial rule observed from the examples (specifically Example 2 and Example 4) is that if a generated 4x4 motif would extend outside the grid boundaries, it is **omitted** entirely.\n\n4.  **Application to Test Input**:\n    *   **Row 1**: Markers at indices 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. These generate motifs in rows 1-4. All fit horizontally and vertically.\n    *   **Row 5**: Markers at indices 0, 16. These generate motifs in rows 5-8. (The input object at col 4 is removed).\n    *   **Row 9**: Markers at indices 0, 8, 16. These generate motifs in rows 9-12.\n    *   **Row 13**: Markers at indices 0, 12, 16. These generate motifs in rows 13-16.\n    *   **Row 17**: Markers at indices 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. A 4x4 motif starting at row 17 would occupy rows 17, 18, 19, and 20. Since the grid is 20x20 (indices 0-19), row 20 is out of bounds. Thus, **all markers in Row 17 are ignored** and produce no output.\n\n5.  **Final Grid Construction**: We start with a 20x20 grid of zeros and draw the 4x4 motifs at the identified valid locations (Row 1: cols 0,4,8,12,16; Row 5: cols 0,16; Row 9: cols 0,8,16; Row 13: cols 0,12,16).\n\noutput:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nBackground: color 0. Foreground objects include (1) color 4 hollow square frames (usually 4\u00d74, 1-cell border, 2\u00d72 interior hole; sometimes connected into larger outlined regions with multiple holes), (2) solid 2\u00d72 blocks (notably color 6, sometimes arranged in pairs within a 4\u00d74), (3) 4\u00d74 motifs: a color 1 ring made of four 2-cell side segments around a 2\u00d72 hole with empty corners, and a color 7 motif with a central 2\u00d72 block plus four corner pixels, and (4) isolated single-pixel markers in colors 2/3/5/7/8.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nIdentify single-cell markers (notably 2,3,5,8). For each marker at (r,c), generate a fixed 4\u00d74 motif with its top-left at (r,c): 2\u2192a 4-bordered frame, 3\u2192a 1 ring (corners/center 0), 5\u2192two diagonal 2\u00d72 blocks of 6, 8\u2192a 7 motif with 7 at corners and central 2\u00d72. Remove/overwrite the original marker pixels and erase unrelated input objects. Omit motifs that do not fit in-bounds, and possibly omit/resolve motifs that would overlap or are treated as noise.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand the transformation from the examples:\n\n**Transformation Rules:**\n1. Single-cell markers (colors 2, 3, 5, 8) each generate a 4\u00d74 motif with top-left at the marker position\n2. The motif mappings are:\n   - **2 \u2192 Color 4 hollow frame**: `4,4,4,4 / 4,0,0,4 / 4,0,0,4 / 4,4,4,4`\n   - **3 \u2192 Color 1 ring**: `0,1,1,0 / 1,0,0,1 / 1,0,0,1 / 0,1,1,0`\n   - **5 \u2192 Diagonal 6 blocks**: `6,6,0,0 / 6,6,0,0 / 0,0,6,6 / 0,0,6,6`\n   - **8 \u2192 Color 7 corners+center**: `7,0,0,7 / 0,7,7,0 / 0,7,7,0 / 7,0,0,7`\n3. Pre-existing patterns (like the 7-motif template in input) are erased\n4. Motifs that don't fit within grid bounds are omitted\n\n**Analyzing Test Input:**\n\nThe 8 markers are located at:\n- Row 1: (1,0), (1,4), (1,8), (1,12), (1,16)\n- Row 5: (5,0), (5,16) [the 7-pattern at cols 4-7 is a pre-existing motif, not a marker]\n- Row 9: (9,0), (9,8), (9,16)\n- Row 13: (13,0), (13,12), (13,16)\n- Row 17: (17,0), (17,4), (17,8), (17,12), (17,16)\n\n**Important:** Row 17 markers cannot fit a 4\u00d74 motif (would need row 20, which doesn't exist in a 20-row grid), so they're omitted.\n\n**Building Output:**\n- Place the 7-motif (`7,0,0,7 / 0,7,7,0 / 0,7,7,0 / 7,0,0,7`) at each valid 8 marker position\n- Erase the pre-existing 7-pattern at rows 5-8, cols 4-7\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nBackground: color 0. Foreground objects include (1) color 4 hollow square frames (usually 4\u00d74, 1-cell border, 2\u00d72 interior hole; sometimes connected into larger outlined regions with multiple holes), (2) solid 2\u00d72 blocks (notably color 6, sometimes arranged in pairs within a 4\u00d74), (3) 4\u00d74 motifs: a color 1 ring made of four 2-cell side segments around a 2\u00d72 hole with empty corners, and a color 7 motif with a central 2\u00d72 block plus four corner pixels, and (4) isolated single-pixel markers in colors 2/3/5/7/8.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nIdentify single-cell markers (notably 2,3,5,8). For each marker at (r,c), generate a fixed 4\u00d74 motif with its top-left at (r,c): 2\u2192a 4-bordered frame, 3\u2192a 1 ring (corners/center 0), 5\u2192two diagonal 2\u00d72 blocks of 6, 8\u2192a 7 motif with 7 at corners and central 2\u00d72. Remove/overwrite the original marker pixels and erase unrelated input objects. Omit motifs that do not fit in-bounds, and possibly omit/resolve motifs that would overlap or are treated as noise.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

The existing 7-shape in the input is cleared because it is not produced by a marker stamp.\n\n## Output grid\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

Objects Description\nBackground: color 0. Foreground objects include (1) color 4 hollow square frames (usually 4\u00d74, 1-cell border, 2\u00d72 interior hole; sometimes connected into larger outlined regions with multiple holes), (2) solid 2\u00d72 blocks (notably color 6, sometimes arranged in pairs within a 4\u00d74), (3) 4\u00d74 motifs: a color 1 ring made of four 2-cell side segments around a 2\u00d72 hole with empty corners, and a color 7 motif with a central 2\u00d72 block plus four corner pixels, and (4) isolated single-pixel markers in colors 2/3/5/7/8.",
                "response": "### 1) Detect \u201cmarker\u201d pixels (single-cell anchors)\nAcross the examples, isolated non\u20110 pixels act as anchors that *spawn* larger 4\u00d74 motifs in the output. The key marker colors observed are **2, 3, 5, 8**.\n\nIn the output, the original marker pixels themselves do **not** remain as their original color; they are either overwritten by the new motif or cleared to **0**.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Expand each marker into a fixed 4\u00d74 motif (anchored at the marker\u2019s position)\nFor a marker at input coordinate **(r,c)**, the produced motif occupies **rows r..r+3** and **cols c..c+3** (i.e., the marker is the **top\u2011left** of the 4\u00d74 block).\n\n#### Marker **2**  \u2192 4\u00d74 hollow frame in **4**\nPattern (within the 4\u00d74 block):\n```\n4 4 4 4\n4 0 0 4\n4 0 0 4\n4 4 4 4\n```\nSo input **2** is effectively \u201crecolored+expanded\u201d into a **4** frame.\n\n---\n\n#### Marker **3**  \u2192 4\u00d74 ring motif in **1** (corners and center are 0)\nPattern:\n```\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n```\nNotably, the marker cell (top\u2011left corner) becomes **0**, not **1**.\n\n---\n\n#### Marker **5**  \u2192 4\u00d74 motif made of two 2\u00d72 solid blocks in **6** (diagonal)\nPattern:\n```\n6 6 0 0\n6 6 0 0\n0 0 6 6\n0 0 6 6\n```\n\n---\n\n#### Marker **8**  \u2192 4\u00d74 motif in **7** (corners + central 2\u00d72)\nPattern:\n```\n7 0 0 7\n0 7 7 0\n0 7 7 0\n7 0 0 7\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3) Global color changes / palette remapping\nThe output uses a different set of colors than the input markers. The effective marker\u2192motif color mapping observed:\n- **2 \u2192 4** (frame)\n- **3 \u2192 1** (ring)\n- **5 \u2192 6** (diagonal 2\u00d72 blocks)\n- **8 \u2192 7** (corner+center motif)\n\n---\n\n### 4) Erase/remove non-marker \u201cextra\u201d input objects (or treat them as irrelevant templates)\nSome inputs contain additional objects (e.g., existing **4** frames, **6** blocks, stray **5** pixels). In the outputs, these do **not** persist unless they coincide with the generated motifs. This implies a transformation step like:\n- Start from an all\u2011**0** canvas (same size), then draw only the generated 4\u00d74 motifs; OR\n- Clear all non\u20110 input content first, then redraw motifs from markers.\n\n---\n\n### 5) Boundary handling (motif must fit)\nIf a marker is too close to the bottom/right edge to fit a full 4\u00d74 motif, the motif may be **omitted** and the marker cleared (e.g., a **3** at (near) bottom\u2011right in a 10\u00d710 leading to no output motif).\n\n---\n\n### 6) Possible overlap/collision handling (seen as \u201csome markers produce nothing\u201d)\nThere are cases where a marker exists but its expected motif does not appear in the output. Plausible collision/selection rules consistent with the examples:\n- **Skip** motifs that would **overlap** another generated 4\u00d74 motif.\n- **Skip** \u201cisolated\u201d markers that are not part of the main intended marker set (noise filtering).\n- Or apply a **priority** (keep one motif, drop the other) when two generated motifs would intersect.\n\n---\n\n### 7) Motif merging when adjacent\nWhen multiple 4\u00d74 motifs of the same drawn color (especially **4** frames) are placed adjacent, their borders can visually merge into a larger connected region of **4**, while still being explainable as independent 4\u00d74 placements.\n\n---\n\n<transformation_summary>\nIdentify single-cell markers (notably 2,3,5,8). For each marker at (r,c), generate a fixed 4\u00d74 motif with its top-left at (r,c): 2\u2192a 4-bordered frame, 3\u2192a 1 ring (corners/center 0), 5\u2192two diagonal 2\u00d72 blocks of 6, 8\u2192a 7 motif with 7 at corners and central 2\u00d72. Remove/overwrite the original marker pixels and erase unrelated input objects. Omit motifs that do not fit in-bounds, and possibly omit/resolve motifs that would overlap or are treated as noise.\n</transformation_summary>",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nBackground: color 0. Foreground objects include (1) color 4 hollow square frames (usually 4\u00d74, 1-cell border, 2\u00d72 interior hole; sometimes connected into larger outlined regions with multiple holes), (2) solid 2\u00d72 blocks (notably color 6, sometimes arranged in pairs within a 4\u00d74), (3) 4\u00d74 motifs: a color 1 ring made of four 2-cell side segments around a 2\u00d72 hole with empty corners, and a color 7 motif with a central 2\u00d72 block plus four corner pixels, and (4) isolated single-pixel markers in colors 2/3/5/7/8.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nIdentify single-cell markers (notably 2,3,5,8). For each marker at (r,c), generate a fixed 4\u00d74 motif with its top-left at (r,c): 2\u2192a 4-bordered frame, 3\u2192a 1 ring (corners/center 0), 5\u2192two diagonal 2\u00d72 blocks of 6, 8\u2192a 7 motif with 7 at corners and central 2\u00d72. Remove/overwrite the original marker pixels and erase unrelated input objects. Omit motifs that do not fit in-bounds, and possibly omit/resolve motifs that would overlap or are treated as noise.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
