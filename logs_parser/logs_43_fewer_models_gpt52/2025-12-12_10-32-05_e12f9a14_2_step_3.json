with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**1. Analyzing the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task, and it seems I need to figure out the transformation rules applied to input grids to generate output grids. My initial thought process involves breaking down the examples and identifying patterns.\n\n**2. Breaking Down Example 1**\n\nFirst up, Example 1. It's got a big grid filled with teal (8s) except for a few distinct structures outlined in green (3s).  These green outlines surround what I'm calling \"gems.\" Each gem has a core of a specific color and a 2x2 shape. The first gem has a maroon core (9).  I notice these gems are sort of diamond or octagon-shaped. Let's trace their positions and the colors inside.\n\nOkay, so the output... the background remains teal.  Hmm, the gems seem to have *moved*? No, wait... they're still there, but changed! I see diagonal rays or beams coming from the *centers* of these shapes. The output has these colored lines pointing to/from locations. It's a projection problem! I examine the gems closely. The corners of the shapes are filled with the core color (9).\n\nSo, the first step is to fill in the missing corners to make the shape into 4x4 squares. The shape is now:\n\n```\nC B B C\nB C C B\nB C C B\nC B B C\n```\n\nwhere C is the central color and B is the border.  Then, from the corners of this 4x4 box, I need to project a ray of color out from the corners.  Tracing these rays, I realize the main rule is \"project diagonal rays outwards from the corners.\"\n\nOkay, let's verify.  The output shows diagonal lines extending outwards.  Let's look at colors. The outputs show a pattern with the colors. Okay, great, so the diagonal lines extend upwards and left, right.\n\nBut what if these rays intersect? I check the output at the crossing points. This is where it gets interesting... The colors look like they \"bounce\" or swap.\nThis helps explain what happens when the rays run into each other (S1 and S2)... the paths shift to vertical. Okay, so when rays cross or hit an object, they stop at the boundary, and otherwise change to run vertically.\n\n**3. Refining the Hypothesis**\n\nOkay, let's summarize:\n\n1.  We have 4x4 shapes composed of a core and border.\n2.  Fill in the corners to create a solid square with core color.\n3.  Project diagonal rays from the corners of the shape.\n4.  When rays intersect, they turn vertical.\n\nLet's test this with other examples. Example 2 seems simple. The shapes are \"broken\" - the shapes have noise in the output. The broken shape is \"repaired\".  It turns out this is because we need to *reconstruct* the shape based on the core positions.  Even if the original structure is jumbled, the core position is what tells us the positions for corner-filling.\n\n**4. Considering Collision Rules**\n\nNow, I look at Test Input, and the interaction of a lot of shapes. I trace the path and what to do when rays intersect:\n\n*   For example, if two horizontal neighbors (say, S1 and S2) have overlapping or adjacent paths that \"squeeze,\" they will turn vertical at that point.\n*   For two vertical neighbors, they move towards each other, and if the path squeezes, or if they collide at a point, they run parallel vertically.\n\n**5. Applying the Rules**\n\nLet's apply these rules to the Test Input and define the paths of these rays as they travel through the grid. Let's see how each shape works, and how the rays go.\n\nSo, now I create a plan. I'm going to find the shapes, fill them, create the rays, and then resolve any collisions.\n\n\nThe transformation involves identifying \"gem\" structures, repairing them, and projecting \"rays\" from their corners.\n\n**1. Structure Identification & Repair**\n*   **Pattern:** Each structure is a 4x4 block. The inner 2x2 \"core\" determines the structure's color. The surrounding border is color 3 (green), but the 4 corners of the 4x4 block are \"open\" (initially background 8).\n*   **Repair:** Locate the 2x2 cores in the input. Reconstruct the 4x4 box around them. Fill the border with 3s. Crucially, **fill the 4 corners** of the 4x4 box with the **core color**.\n*   **Structures in Test Input:**\n    1.  **S1 (Red 2):** Core at rows 5-6, cols 4-5. Box rows 4-7, cols 3-6.\n    2.  **S2 (Yellow 4):** Core at rows 5-6, cols 15-16. Box rows 4-7, cols 14-17.\n    3.  **S3 (Magenta 6):** Core at rows 14-15, cols 23-24. Box rows 13-16, cols 22-25.\n    4.  **S4 (Orange 7):** Core at rows 20-21, cols 22-23. Box rows 19-22, cols 21-24.\n    5.  **S5 (Maroon 9):** Core at rows 25-26, cols 1-2. Box rows 24-27, cols 0-3.\n\n**2. Ray Projection**\n*   **Source:** Rays emanate from the 4 newly filled corners of each structure.\n*   **Direction:** Diagonal outwards (Top-Left corner $\\to$ Up-Left, Top-Right $\\to$ Up-Right, etc.).\n*   **Color:** Same as the core color.\n*   **Interaction Rules:**\n    *   **Crossing/Collision:** If two rays are on a collision course (either head-on or side-swipe where they would cross or occupy the same cell):\n        *   If they are approaching horizontally and become adjacent (distance 1) or collide, they turn **Vertical** and continue parallel (Up or Down depending on original vertical direction).\n        *   If they are approaching vertically (head-on) or diagonally into the same cell, they **Stop** before the collision.\n    *   **Shearing:** If rays pass each other diagonally on adjacent cells without claiming the same cell, they continue.\n\n**3. Applying Logic to Test Input**\n*   **S1 (Red 2) & S2 (Yellow 4) - Top Interaction:**\n    *   S1 Top-Right ray (Up-Right) and S2 Top-Left ray (Up-Left) converge.\n    *   At Row 1, they are at cols 9 and 11. They turn vertical to avoid collision at Row 0.\n    *   Result: (0,9) is 2, (0,11) is 4.\n*   **S1 (Red 2) & S2 (Yellow 4) - Bottom Interaction:**\n    *   S1 Bottom-Right ray (Down-Right) and S2 Bottom-Left ray (Down-Left) converge.\n    *   At Row 10, they are at cols 9 and 11. They turn vertical to avoid collision at Row 11.\n    *   They continue vertically down at cols 9 and 11 respectively.\n*   **S1 (Red 2) & S5 (Maroon 9) - Vertical Collision:**\n    *   S1's vertical ray (col 9) going down meets S5's Top-Right ray (diagonal Up-Right) coming up.\n    *   S5 TR path: (23,4)...(19,8). Next would be (18,9).\n    *   S1 vertical ray is at (18,9). Head-on collision. Both stop.\n    *   S5 TR ends at (19,8). S1 vertical ends at (17,9).\n*   **S2 (Yellow 4) & S3 (Magenta 6) - Shearing Pass:**\n    *   S2 Bottom-Right ray (Down-Right) and S3 Top-Left ray (Up-Left) pass each other.\n    *   They occupy adjacent diagonal cells (e.g., Row 12: S2@22, S3@21) but never the same cell. They continue to grid edges.\n*   **S3 (Magenta 6) & S4 (Orange 7) - Collision:**\n    *   S3 Bottom-Left ray (Down-Left) and S4 Top-Left ray (Up-Left) converge on (18,20).\n    *   S3 BL path: (16,22) $\\to$ (17,21). Next (18,20).\n    *   S4 TL path starts (19,21). Next (18,20).\n    *   They stop before collision. S3 ends at (17,21). S4 TL is blocked immediately (doesn't start).\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,2,8,4,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,19,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,2,8,8,8,2,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,4,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,2,3,3,2,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,4,3,3,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,2,2,3,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,2,2,3,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,2,3,3,2,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,4,3,3,4,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,2,8,8,8,8,2,8,2,8,4,8,4,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,8,4,4,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,8,8,8,6,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,8,8,6,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,6,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,6,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n9,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n8,9,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n8,8,9,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7",
