        "Full raw LLM response": "**Test Input Analysis and Solution Generation**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task. I have examples, but I need to figure out the logic for this new one, which involves a grid and some, what seems like, shapes indicated by grey markings.\n\nFirst, I looked at a few examples, trying to decipher a pattern. I noticed that the grey pixels (color 5) often formed a shape, and this shape seemed to correlate with the output grid's size. My hypothesis was that the grey pixels were marking a region in the input that the output was related to.  I tried several approaches, including cropping the image section, scaling up the shape, or using the grey shape as a template, or defining the output grid.\n\nI noticed a recurring \"Periodic Pattern\" in the test inputs. In the Examples, I realized the color 5 region defined where to select pattern and size the output, and that this might be present in the new example.\n\nIn the test input I'm focused on now, I see a 30x30 grid with yellow, magenta, and grey pixels. I zeroed in on the grey pixels. They seem to mark two distinct areas in the grid, not one contiguous shape like in the earlier examples. These grey areas are positioned in rows 12 and 13, and in columns 7-8 and 26-27.  This led me to the conclusion that they bound a region by defining a top-left and bottom-right corner.\n\nI looked at the shapes in the grid below the grey markings. I recognized a pattern of vertical strips of repeating shapes: yellow, magenta, yellow, magenta, etc. And each shape is three rows high (15-17). Based on this I'm concluding the grey marks define a box, two rows high, and extend between column 7-8 and 26-27 so the width is 21 columns (because the pattern continues across the whole picture).\n\nUsing the periodic pattern, I made a plan:\n\n1.  *Identify the Grey Box* . The grey pixels now suggest a rectangular bounding box encompassing the area between the grey pixels (7-27 by 12-13).\n2.  *Analyze the Periodic Pattern*. There's a periodic pattern of repeating shapes \u2013 yellow, magenta. I'll need to figure out which \"phase\" of this pattern the output corresponds to. Because the Box Rows 12 and 13, this determines what's in the pattern.\n3.  *Generate the Output*. Create the output grid with the determined height and width (2x21). Fill the grid cells with the appropriate colors and patterns. The height is 2, the width 21. For the Magenta shape, I built two rules, since the first row and second row of a strip is different. Row12 in my Box corresponds to the 6 in the formula for \"middle\" row for Magenta. Row 13 corresponds to the \"bot\" of the formula in that phase, where pattern continues horizontally.\n\nI derived formula for each pattern within the phase, such as if i%5 in this set then its color, else its a 0 to describe the repeating patterns in each row.\n\nI applied these formulas to my output and the final answer.\n\n\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the output grid based on the input grid, learning the transformation rule from three solved examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Transformation Rule:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Region:** In all examples, there are grey pixels (color 5) that act as markers.\n    *   In Example 1 and Example 3, the grey pixels define a rectangular bounding box (top-left to bottom-right).\n    *   In Example 2, the grey pixels form a column segment, defining a height and a horizontal position.\n    *   In the Test Input, there are grey pixels at `(Row 12, Cols 7-8)` and `(Row 13, Cols 26-27)`. Using the top-left of the first group and the bottom-right of the second group, we define a bounding box covering **Rows 12-13** and **Columns 7-27**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Pattern Source:** The input grids contain repeating patterns or shapes organized in strips or grids.\n    *   Example 2 shows that we must extrapolate the pattern found in the rest of the grid into the region defined by the grey box.\n    *   Example 3 confirms this: the output matches the pattern (\"7\" stripe) that would exist at the grey box's location based on the periodicity of the strips.\n\n3.  **Determine the Specific Pattern for the Test Input:**\n    *   **Vertical Pattern:** The grid has alternating rows of shapes.\n        *   Rows 15-17 contain Yellow (4) shapes.\n        *   Rows 19-21 contain Magenta (6) shapes.\n        *   Rows 23-25 contain Yellow (4) shapes.\n        *   Rows 27-29 contain Magenta (6) shapes.\n        *   This establishes a repeating vertical sequence: Magenta, Yellow, Magenta, Yellow with a period of 4 rows.\n        *   Extrapolating upwards: Rows 11-13 should contain a **Magenta (6)** shape sequence.\n        *   Specifically, since the sequence repeats every 4 blocks, and row 19 starts a Magenta block, row 11 should start a Magenta block.\n        *   The Grey Box covers **Rows 12 and 13**. Relative to a 3-row shape starting at Row 11 (Top, Middle, Bottom), Row 12 is the **Middle** row and Row 13 is the **Bottom** row.\n\n    *   **Horizontal Pattern:** The shapes repeat horizontally with a period of 5 columns.\n        *   Let's determine the pixel values for the Magenta shape (based on observed shapes in rows 19-21) modulo 5.\n        *   **Middle Row (e.g., Row 20):** Contains `6,6,6,6` followed by `0`.\n            *   Columns 8-11 are 6. Indices modulo 5: $8 \\equiv 3$, $9 \\equiv 4$, $10 \\equiv 0$, $11 \\equiv 1$.\n            *   Column 12 is 0. Index modulo 5: $12 \\equiv 2$.\n            *   Rule for Middle Row: **6** if `col % 5` is in `{0, 1, 3, 4}`, **0** if `col % 5` is `2`.\n        *   **Bottom Row (e.g., Row 21):** Contains `6,6` ... `0,0` ... `6,6,6`.\n            *   Columns 7-8 are 6. Indices modulo 5: $7 \\equiv 2$, $8 \\equiv 3$.\n            *   Columns 9-10 are 0. Indices modulo 5: $9 \\equiv 4$, $10 \\equiv 0$.\n            *   Columns 11-13 are 6. Indices modulo 5: $1 \\equiv 1$, $12 \\equiv 2$, $13 \\equiv 3$.\n            *   Rule for Bottom Row: **6** if `col % 5` is in `{1, 2, 3}`, **0** if `col % 5` is in `{0, 4}`.\n\n4.  **Construct the Output:**\n    *   Target Grid Size: Height 2 (Rows 12-13), Width 21 (Cols 7-27).\n    *   **Row 1 (corresponding to pattern Middle Row):** Apply Middle Row rule to columns 7 through 27.\n        *   Pattern repeats `0, 6, 6, 6, 6`.\n    *   **Row 2 (corresponding to pattern Bottom Row):** Apply Bottom Row rule to columns 7 through 27.\n        *   Pattern repeats `6, 6, 0, 0, 6` (aligned to modulo index).\n\n**Generated Output Rows:**\n\n*   **Row 1 (Indices 7-27):**\n    *   7%5=2 -> 0\n    *   8..11 -> 6,6,6,6\n    *   12 -> 0\n    *   ...\n    *   Sequence: `0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0`\n\n*   **Row 2 (Indices 7-27):**\n    *   7%5=2 -> 6\n    *   8%5=3 -> 6\n    *   9%5=4 -> 0\n    *   10%5=0 -> 0\n    *   11%5=1 -> 6\n    *   12%5=2 -> 6\n    *   13%5=3 -> 6\n    *   ...\n    *   Sequence: `6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 6, 6`\n\n0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0\n6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6",
