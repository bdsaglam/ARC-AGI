        "Full raw LLM response": "**I'm focusing on a complex ARC task where I'm given examples and a test input to determine how to manipulate grids with colored shapes. I've broken down my thought process as follows:**\n\nI'm starting by analyzing the problem, noticing that the grids contain colored shapes, and the goal is to transform them by removing some and altering others.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:** I carefully examine the first example to identify patterns. I observe a gray loop containing other shapes, and I determine what happens to each shape during the transformation.  I realize there are two key concepts to look out for: the colors *inside* a shape, which seem to be important, and the shapes' own color, which determines its \"container.\"  I make notes about where and how the inner colors are changing within shapes.\n\nI notice specific transformations: Shapes can have their internal content removed entirely.  The inner color of a shape seems to have an effect.  I make a table to analyze all of the shape's data.  I look at the specific inner patterns within the shapes, like if there are any repeating blocks of color.\n\nI then focus on the 'inner' colors and begin to see a pattern; they could be a path of sorts that link shapes to each other. I'm starting to think about chains of shapes. If a shape \"points\" to another by containing the other's color, maybe a transfer of information or action happens.\n\nI create the rule: \"If a shape 'A' contains the color of shape 'B', then some sort of transfer will happen involving A and B.\"\n\nI start to see a \"source\" and \"target\" with the internal colors and shape. I start to write a rule: \"If Box A contains color B, and Box B exists, then Box A takes Box B's content.\"\n\nI re-examine the examples, looking for pairings between inner and container colors.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:** I repeat the analysis with the second example, noting similarities and differences. I look at each of the shapes in the second example and the transformations that they undergo. I make tables to look for the \"cycle\" that is being formed in the second example.  I have identified the pattern of how the content of these shapes may move from one shape to the next.\n\n**Cycle Analysis and Rule Refinement:** I am starting to look at a pattern within a pair of shapes.  I focus on which \"survive\" the rule and which ones \"die.\"  I am developing a set of rules that involve pointers and a specific flow of content.  I then apply this information to the second example. I refine the transfer of content, or pointer, rule. I come up with a new rule: \"If a Box A contains the color B, then A takes the contents of B.\"\n\nI realize there is a potential exception.  If Shape 5 points to 2 and there is no Shape 2, a rule is needed to handle this scenario.  I am trying to generalize the previous rule to account for new shape scenarios. I determine that the rule has a dependency on if \"boxes\" and \"complex shapes\" exist in the image.  I define that a complex shape may act as a container for another.  I then determine there is a structure that is needed for certain shapes.\n\nI am re-examining the examples I have completed so far.  I am creating a list to identify the direction content transfers between shapes. I start to create the rule: If Box A contains color B, the content of Box B transfers to Box A.\n\nI am refining my \"take content\" rule. I see that Box 6 must pull the content, not push it.  I determine I have a \"Receiver pulls\" rule: If Box A contains color B, and Box B exists, Box A takes Box B's content.\n\nI look at the spatial structure of shapes to better understand the transfer directions.\n\nI then make adjustments on the previous rule to account for all of the different scenarios.  I come up with a few new cases: Shapes that don't have a color, shapes that have multiple colors.\n\n**Pattern Emerges: Keep, Delete, Keep, Delete:** I re-analyze my findings and realize there is an alternating Keep and Delete pattern among shapes.  I have developed a few rules regarding this process.  I determine that only the \"receivers\" are left.  If there is a box or object that does not get pointed to, it is deleted.\n\nI am developing the chain logic, as I am noticing that they are only deleted in certain cases.  I am developing the hypothesis: If B has been in an even position in an equation, then it is deleted.  A is kept, and B is deleted. I'm thinking about deleting vs. emptying.  I'm trying to figure out the differences between these two scenarios. I try to refine the chain\n\nThe solution relies on identifying colored shapes (\"Boxes\" or \"Complex Shapes\"), their contents, and how they form chains based on \"pointers\" (inner colors pointing to container colors).\n\n**Logic:**\n1.  **Identify Nodes:**\n    *   **Boxes:** 3x3 squares of a single color with a different center color.\n    *   **Complex Shapes:** Larger, irregular shapes (like the gray loops). If a complex shape fully encloses a 3x3 block of another color, it acts as a \"Box\" of that inner color.\n    *   Each node is defined by its **Container Color** (or the color it acts as) and its **Pointer** (the center pixel of the 3x3 area).\n\n2.  **Form Chains:**\n    *   A node $A$ points to node $B$ if $A$'s pointer color matches $B$'s container color.\n    *   Trace chains starting from nodes that are not pointed to by any other node.\n\n3.  **Process Chains (Pairing Rule):**\n    *   Traverse each chain from the start. Group nodes into pairs $(A \\to B)$.\n    *   **Node A (The Receiver):** Keeps its shape but updates its center color to match the **content** (center pointer) of Node B.\n    *   **Node B (The Source):** Is \"Deleted\".\n        *   If it is a standard Box, it is removed completely (pixels become 0).\n        *   If it is a Complex Shape, it is \"Emptied\" (inner non-shape pixels become 0, but the shape's shell remains).\n    *   **Leftovers:** If a chain has an odd number of nodes, the last node is a leftover. Leftover nodes are treated as \"Deleted\" (Box removed, Complex Shape emptied).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Node Identification:**\n    *   **Box 6 (Magenta, Top Right):** Inner color 1. Points to 1.\n    *   **Box 1 (Blue, Top Left):** Inner color 3. Points to 3.\n    *   **Box 3 (Green, Mid Right):** Inner color 9. Points to 9.\n    *   **Box 7 (Orange, Bottom Left):** Inner color 2. Points to 2.\n    *   **Shape 5 (Gray, Left):** Contains a 3x3 block of **2s** with a center of **4**. Acts as **Box 2**. Points to 4.\n\n*   **Chains:**\n    *   **Chain 1:** $6 \\xrightarrow{1} 1 \\xrightarrow{3} 3 \\xrightarrow{9} \\text{None}$.\n        *   Sequence: 6, 1, 3.\n        *   Pair (6, 1): **Box 6** keeps and takes content of Box 1 (which is 3). **Box 1** is deleted.\n        *   Leftover (3): **Box 3** is deleted.\n    *   **Chain 2:** $7 \\xrightarrow{2} 5 \\xrightarrow{4} \\text{None}$.\n        *   Sequence: 7, 5.\n        *   Pair (7, 5): **Box 7** keeps and takes content of Shape 5 (which is 4). **Shape 5** is emptied.\n\n*   **Execution:**\n    *   **Box 6:** Remains. Center changes from 1 to 3.\n    *   **Box 1:** Deleted (becomes 0s).\n    *   **Box 3:** Deleted (becomes 0s).\n    *   **Box 7:** Remains. Center changes from 2 to 4.\n    *   **Shape 5:** Shell (5s) remains. Inner content (2s and 4) removed (become 0s).\n\n**Output Grid Generation:**\n\n*   **Rows 0-2:** Box 1 (left) gone. Box 6 (right) center becomes 3.\n*   **Rows 3-7 (Left):** Shape 5 shell remains. Inner block of 2s removed.\n*   **Rows 5-7 (Right):** Box 3 removed.\n*   **Rows 8-9:** Box 7 remains. Center pixel at (9,2) becomes 4.\n\noutput:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,7,7,7,0,5,5,0,0,5\n0,7,4,7,0,0,0,5,5,0",

This creates directed chains like `O1 \u2192 O2 \u2192 O3 \u2192 ...`.\n\nThe transformation works along each chain:\n1. **Start at chain roots** (squares whose outer color is not the center-pointer of any other square).\n2.

Also **delete any square that does not point to another square** (a chain end where its center color is not an outer color of any framed square).\n4. For each square that remains (positions 1, 3, 5, \u2026), **replace its center color with the center color of the next (deleted) square**. The frame stays unchanged.\n\nApplying this to the test grid:\n- Framed squares found:\n  - Outer **1**, center **3** (points to outer 3)\n  - Outer **6**, center **1** (points to outer 1)\n  - Outer **2**, center **4** (points to nothing) \u21d2 deleted\n  - Outer **3**, center **9** (points to nothing) \u21d2 deleted\n- Chain: `6 \u2192 1 \u2192 3`\n  - Keep **6**, delete **1**, delete terminal **3**\n  - Update center of the kept **6** square from 1 to the deleted **1** square\u2019s center (=3)\n\nAll other cells stay the same.\n\nOutput grid:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,7,7,7,0,5,5,0,0,5\n0,7,2,7,0,0,0,5,5,0",
