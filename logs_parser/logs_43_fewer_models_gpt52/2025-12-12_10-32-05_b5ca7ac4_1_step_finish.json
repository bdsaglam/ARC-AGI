It looks like I need to figure out a transformation rule applied to a grid containing framed, square-like objects. Here's how I'm thinking about it:\n\n**Initial Analysis and Hypothesis Formation**\n\n*   **Object Identification:** The core visual elements are 5x5 blocks. Each block is defined by an outer border color and a filled interior color. There's also a background color, which is uniform. This is consistent across all examples.\n\n*   **Transformation Hints:** The examples show the input grid's objects rearranged to create distinct outputs. From the example outputs, I see that these framed squares, somehow, appear to be compacted into columns, separated based on the color of their border. The arrangement has a strong *horizontal* compaction, with the object's original *vertical* position mostly maintained.\n\n*   **Object Properties and Logic:** Objects, especially those that \"group\" together by border color, have their x coordinates rearranged in such a manner that they are next to each other in columns. Objects which *do* have Y-coordinate alignment should be positioned next to each other. Those are the ones which are arranged into a column. I can see a \"left\" group and a \"right\" group. This partitioning must be caused by the colors of the border.\n\n*   **The Big Idea:** My working hypothesis is that I can separate these objects by their border colors. Objects get moved to the left if the border is light-blue, and to the right if the border is red. I also think I may need to calculate the appropriate \"shift\" for the X positions, stacking the objects horizontally from left to right in the target group.\n\n**Formalizing the Algorithm**\n\nI think I have the logic, which will require me to:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the input grid, look for contiguous 5x5 blocks. Record the top-left coordinate, the border color, and the interior color for each object.\n\n2.  **Separate Groups:** Based on border color, divide the objects into two groups (light-blue and red).\n\n3.  **Process Left (Light-Blue):**\n    *   Sort the items in the left group according to their X positions (ascending). Items with close starting X positions in the input grid should be positioned next to each other to form a stacked column.\n    *   Find any overlaps with other items that are already placed. If there is, move the item to the right (a single \"step\" corresponds to the width of the frame).\n\n4.  **Process Right (Red):**\n    *   Sort the items in the right group according to their X positions, descending. The sorting order doesn't *really* matter if the logic is correct. Descending is more intuitive when packing from right to left.\n    *   Use a similar collision avoidance approach, pushing the \"right\" objects left until there's no collision with another item already on the right side.\n    *   I'll be mindful of the edge of the grid!\n\n5.  **Rebuild Grid:** Use the calculated new X-positions from the previous two steps and the original Y-positions, draw each object into its new location in the output grid. The objects do not overlap, so the building order will not matter.\n\n**Testing the Hypothesis**\n\nI need to apply this algorithm to the provided test input. I'll need to meticulously record each object's properties, determine the new X and Y positions, and finally, verify that the constructed output grid matches the expected output according to the example transformations. Let's start with the test input...\n\n**Applying to the Test Input**\n\nI need to:\n1.  Parse the input: Read the numbers from the input grid and locate all the 5x5 object frames. Record their color and location.\n\n2.  Separate into groups based on border color (Red and Light Blue).\n\n3.  Arrange the light-blue frames on the left-side (X=0,5,10) - based on an appropriate sorting algorithm to determine collisions and keep Y positions fixed, compacting horizontally.\n\n4.  Arrange the red frames on the right-side (X=17,12,7) - based on an appropriate sorting algorithm to determine collisions and keep Y positions fixed, compacting horizontally.\n\n5.  Write the final pixel output.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nThis seems like the correct logic, and I am confident that following these steps will lead me to the solution. I just need to be very careful with the bookkeeping: the input grid numbers, locations of the frames, and new locations. The vertical alignment is important. I need to get the sort order right so that the \"left side\" and \"right side\n\nThe problem asks us to identify \"framed square\" objects in the grid, sort them based on their border color into two groups (left and right), and rearrange them horizontally while preserving their vertical positions (y-coordinates) and stacking them horizontally towards their respective sides.\n\n**1. Object Identification:**\nWe scan the 22x22 grid for 5x5 squares with a distinct border color. The background color is 9.\n\n*   **Object A:** Top-left at (0, 1). Border: 2 (Red). Inner: 4 (Yellow). Target: Right.\n*   **Object B:** Top-mid at (2, 10). Border: 2 (Red). Inner: 3 (Green). Target: Right.\n*   **Object C:** Top-right at (3, 16). Border: 8 (Light Blue). Inner: 4 (Yellow). Target: Left.\n*   **Object D:** Mid-left at (7, 2). Border: 8 (Light Blue). Inner: 1 (Blue). Target: Left.\n*   **Object E:** Mid-center at (8, 10). Border: 8 (Light Blue). Inner: 7 (Orange). Target: Left.\n    *(Note: In the thought block, I identified E starting at row 8 based on the input text. `8,8,8,8,8` appears at row 8, cols 10-14, and `8,7,7,7,8` below it.)*\n*   **Object F:** Low-mid at (13, 9). Border: 2 (Red). Inner: 6 (Magenta). Target: Right.\n    *(Note: Input row 14 (index 13) has `2,2,2,2,2`. Row 15 `2,6,6,6,2`. So top is y=13, x=9.)*\n*   **Object G:** Bottom-leftish at (15, 3). Border: 2 (Red). Inner: 3 (Green). Target: Right.\n    *(Note: Input row 16 (index 15) has `2,2,2,2,2` at x=3? Let's re-verify row 16. Row 16 col 3 is `2`. Yes. Top is y=15.)*\n*   **Object H:** Bottom-rightish at (16, 15). Border: 8 (Light Blue). Inner: 3 (Green). Target: Left.\n    *(Note: Input row 17 (index 16) has `9,9,9,9... 9,8,8,8,8,8,9,9`. Yes, top is y=16, x=15.)*\n\n**2. Transformation Logic:**\n*   **Vertical Position (Y):** Preserved for all objects.\n*   **Horizontal Position (X):**\n    *   **Border 8 (Left Group):** Objects move to the left (x=0). If they overlap vertically with an object already to their left (based on original x-order), they stack to the right (x=5, x=10, etc.).\n    *   **Border 2 (Right Group):** Objects move to the right (x=17 for a 22-width grid). If they overlap vertically with an object already to their right (based on original x-order), they stack to the left (x=12, x=7, etc.).\n\n**3. Applying Logic:**\n\n**Left Group (Border 8):**\n*   **Object D (y=7, x=2):** Leftmost in its vertical range. Moves to **x=0**.\n*   **Object H (y=16, x=15):** Leftmost in its vertical range (no overlap with D). Moves to **x=0**.\n*   **Object C (y=3, x=16):** Overlaps vertically with D (rows 7). Original x(16) > D(2). Must be right of D. Moves to **x=5**.\n*   **Object E (y=8, x=10):** Overlaps vertically with D (rows 8-11). Original x(10) > D(2). Must be right of D. Moves to **x=5**. (Check C vs E overlap: y=3-7 vs y=8-12. No overlap. So both can be at x=5).\n\n**Right Group (Border 2):**\n*   **Object B (y=2, x=10):** Rightmost in its vertical range. Moves to **x=17** (Cols 17-21).\n*   **Object F (y=13, x=9):** Rightmost in its vertical range. Moves to **x=17**.\n*   **Object A (y=0, x=1):** Overlaps vertically with B (rows 2-4). Original x(1) < B(10). Must be left of B. Moves to **x=12** (Cols 12-16).\n*   **Object G (y=15, x=3):** Overlaps vertically with F (rows 15-17). Original x(3) < F(9). Must be left of F. Moves to **x=12**.\n\n**4. Final Coordinates & Rendering:**\n*   **Obj A (Inner 4):** x=12, y=0.\n*   **Obj B (Inner 3):** x=17, y=2.\n*   **Obj C (Inner 4):** x=5, y=3.\n*   **Obj D (Inner 1):** x=0, y=7.\n*   **Obj E (Inner 7):** x=5, y=8.\n*   **Obj F (Inner 6):** x=17, y=13.\n*   **Obj G (Inner 3):** x=12, y=15.\n*   **Obj H (Inner 3):** x=0, y=16.\n\nThe output grid is constructed by placing these objects onto the background (9).\n\noutput:\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,4,4,4,2,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2\n9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,2,4,4,4,2,2,3,3,3,2\n9,9,9,9,9,8,4,4,4,8,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,2\n9,9,9,9,9,8,4,4,4,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,3,3,3,2\n9,9,9,9,9,8,4,4,4,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,1,1,1,8,8,7,7,7,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,1,1,1,8,8,7,7,7,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,6,6,6,2\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,2\n8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,3,3,3,2,2,6,6,6,2\n8,3,3,3,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2\n8,3,3,3,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,3,3,3,2,9,9,9,9,9\n8,3,3,3,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n</REASONING_MODEL_C>\n<REASONING_MODEL_D model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_5_step_5_generate_hint\">\n### What the transformation does (inferred from the examples)\n\n1. **Identify the background** (the most common color).  \n   In the test, the background is **9**.\n\n2. **Find all \u201cframed square\u201d objects**: each object is a **5\u00d75 square** with:\n   - a 1-cell-thick **border** of a single color\n   - a 3\u00d73 **solid fill** inside\n   - here, borders are either **8 (light-blue)** or **2 (red)**\n\n3. **Reposition without changing shapes/colors**:\n   - All **8-bordered** squares slide **left** as far as possible.\n   - All **2-bordered** squares slide **right** as far as possible.\n   - Squares **keep their original vertical (row) position**.\n   - Squares of the same group **cannot overlap**; if they overlap in rows, they end up **touching side-by-side** (horizontal compaction).\n   - Relative left-to-right order is preserved within each group (they don\u2019t pass through each other).\n\nApplying this to the test input yields the following packed arrangement:\n- Blue (8-bordered) squares occupy columns **0\u20139** (two columns of 5-wide squares where needed).\n- Red (2-bordered) squares occupy columns **12\u201321** (packed against the right edge).\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,4,4,4,2,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2\n9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,2,4,4,4,2,2,3,3,3,2\n9,9,9,9,9,8,4,4,4,8,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,2\n9,9,9,9,9,8,4,4,4,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,3,3,3,2\n9,9,9,9,9,8,4,4,4,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,1,1,1,8,8,7,7,7,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,1,1,1,8,8,7,7,7,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,6,6,6,2\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,2\n8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,3,3,3,2,2,6,6,6,2\n8,3,3,3,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2\n8,3,3,3,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,3,3,3,2,9,9,9,9,9\n8,3,3,3,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n</REASONING_MODEL_D>\n<REASONING_MODEL_E model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_4_step_5_image\">\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Identify the background color** (the most frequent color in the grid).  \n2. **Identify all 5\u00d75 \u201cframed squares\u201d objects**: each is a 1-cell-thick border (frame) surrounding a solid 3\u00d73 interior.\n3.

Here's the breakdown of my thinking:\n\nFirst, I need to understand the basic building blocks: the 5x5 squares. They have borders (teal or red, mostly) and 3x3 centers of a single color. The rest is a background color.  I noticed a pattern: the squares are defined by their top-left coordinates.\n\nThe challenge is to move these squares, sorting them by their border color. Teal squares move to the left edge; red ones move to the right. My main question was, do they have to stay in their original vertical positions or can they shift vertically, perhaps getting packed closer together? The examples showed the key: they shift horizontally, but vertically overlapping squares get pushed over by five columns.\n\nMy strategy started to form:\n1.  **Identify all the squares in the grid**.\n2.  **Separate them into two groups**: one for teal borders, one for red borders.\n3.  **Within each group, assign new X-coordinates**:  Teal squares go left, red squares go right.  But how do I deal with overlaps?  I realized the input X position is important.\n4.  To resolve these overlaps, I will use a packing strategy. I will sort the input object by x-coordinate. I can sort these objects by original X position and pack them in a lane, then move to an adjacent lane if an overlap occurs.\n\nTo verify my logic, I traced through an example in detail. I started by listing the input objects, then placed them on the output grid.\n*   Sorting:  For teal, I sort by input X. For red, I sort by input x.\n*   Placement: I try the default position (left or right). If it overlaps, I shift it to the next column.\n\nI've tested the logic with the example input, and I also checked a second example, making sure my assumptions hold. It looks like it works. I\u2019m feeling confident!\n\nI went ahead and formulated a comprehensive algorithm that breaks down like this:\n\n1.  **Parse the Grid**:\n    *   Find the border and center coordinates for all squares.\n    *   Define Background.\n2.  **Separate into Groups**: Based on Border color (8 or 2).\n3.  **Assign New Positions**:\n    *   For each group, I sort by input X coordinate to preserve the input object's arrangement in the new grid.\n    *   I iterate and find the best column. I test for vertical overlaps to make the next column, so the squares fit tightly.\n4.  **Reconstruct the Grid**: Fill the background and place each square at its calculated position.\n\nNow that I have a clear plan, I'll apply it to the user's test input.\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the \"framed square\" objects, categorize them by their border color, and rearrange them based on specific rules while preserving their shape and vertical position.\n\n### Method Explanation\n\n1.  **Object Identification**:\n    *   We scan the grid to find all 5x5 squares defined by a 1-cell thick border enclosing a 3x3 solid center of a different color.\n    *   The background is identified as the uniform color filling the rest of the grid (color 9 in the test input).\n    *   We record the original position (row, column), border color, and center color for each object.\n\n2.  **Grouping and Sorting**:\n    *   Objects are divided into two groups based on their border color:\n        *   **Border 8 (Teal)**: These move to the **left** side of the grid.\n        *   **Border 2 (Red)**: These move to the **right** side of the grid.\n    *   To pack them tightly without changing their vertical order more than necessary, we determine priority based on their original horizontal position (closeness to their target side):\n        *   **Border 8**: Sorted by original Column **Ascending** (closest to the left moves first).\n        *   **Border 2**: Sorted by original Column **Descending** (closest to the right moves first).\n\n3.  **Position Assignment**:\n    *   We place objects one by one from the sorted lists into their new positions.\n    *   **Vertical Position**: The object's Row index remains exactly the same (`keeping their original rows`).\n    *   **Horizontal Position**:\n        *   **Border 8**: We try to place the object at the leftmost column (`x=0`). If it overlaps vertically with any object already placed in that column, we shift it to the next available \"lane\" to the right (incrementing x by 5).\n        *   **Border 2**: We try to place the object at the rightmost column (`x=GridWidth-5`). If it overlaps vertically, we shift it to the next available \"lane\" to the left (decrementing x by 5).\n\n4.  **Reconstruction**:\n    *   We create a new grid filled with the background color (9).\n    *   We draw each object at its newly assigned coordinates.\n\n### Application to Test Input\n\n**Detected Objects:**\n*   **Border 2 (Right Group)**:\n    *   Obj A: Center 4, Pos (0, 1)\n    *   Obj B: Center 3, Pos (2, 10)\n    *   Obj F: Center 6, Pos (13, 9)\n    *   Obj G: Center 3, Pos (15, 3)\n*   **Border 8 (Left Group)**:\n    *   Obj C: Center 4, Pos (3, 16)\n    *   Obj D: Center 1, Pos (7, 2)\n    *   Obj E: Center 7, Pos (8, 10)\n    *   Obj H: Center 3, Pos (16, 15)\n\n**Sorting and Placement:**\n\n*   **Left Group (Border 8)** - Target `x=0`:\n    1.  **Obj D** (Original `x=2`): Placed at **`x=0`**, `y=7`.

Moves to **`x=5`**, `y=8`.\n    3.  **Obj H** (Original `x=15`): No overlap with Obj D in lane 0 (row 16 > 11).

                "response": "**Deep Dive into ARC Puzzle Solutions**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My task is to audit these candidate solutions for an ARC puzzle. The core of the problem is taking 22x22 grids and figuring out how to transform them based on 5x5 colored squares with a one-pixel frame. The first thing I'm doing is getting a solid understanding of how these squares are laid out. The color '0' represents the background in the examples, and color '9' in the test input.\n\nI'm starting by analyzing Example 1, looking at the inputs and how they map to the outputs. I'm focusing on the border colors (2 and 8) and their corresponding inner colors. I'm carefully reading the input grid, tracing each object's position and the border and inner colors of those 5x5 grids to decode what's going on.\n\nIt looks like 'Gravity' is at play \u2013 the objects are moving towards the edges based on their border color. Border 8 objects move to the left edge, and border 2 objects go to the right. I'm noting overlaps. If the objects overlap horizontally, the input x coordinate of those objects is the decision maker for the output position.  For example, in Ex 1, I see that the object furthest to the left in the input keeps its place at the left of other border 8 objects in the output. Objects overlap by rows, and in these cases position matters. The position of these objects on input, determines what the output should look like.\n\nI'm developing the rule: Border 8 squares, to the left edge, and border 2 to the right edge. I need to sort these, and the left object is sorted by an x coordinate and is placed at the left edge of the grid. For the right edge objects, they are sorted by x coordinate, in descending order, with the rightmost object first. This gravity is the first step, then overlaps are settled. In all cases the original y coordinate is kept.\nI then applied this theory to Example 2 and checked the result.\n\nOnce I have the logic, I go through a test input. It confirms what I had derived and verifies that what I came up with actually works. I apply it to the specific candidate solutions that I am analyzing.\n\nAlright, now to audit these candidate solutions. Candidate 1 is first. I'm checking if it's applying the rules correctly, with the sorting and positioning. I quickly spot a problem \u2013 it's prioritizing the vertical position of squares (rows) and applying a heuristic, seemingly random sorting. This contradicts Example 1 which sorted by X coordinate.\n\nNext up, Candidate 2. This candidate is looking good! It's following my logic precisely, placing objects according to the X coordinates and respecting overlaps. Its analysis matches the expected output perfectly.\n\nFinally, Candidate 6. Sadly, this candidate has the same flaw as Candidate 1. It is not preserving x-axis horizontal placement in the output. The x placement is reversed. This invalidates this candidate.\n\nSo, here's my verdict: Candidate 2 is the gold standard! Its reasoning and grid output are spot-on, completely consistent with the puzzle's logic.\n\n\n<AUDIT_LOG>\n### PHASE 1: LOGIC SELECTION & CRYSTALLIZATION\n\n**Candidate 1 (Reasoning Model A):**\n- **Logic:** Identifies shapes by frame color (8 moves left, 2 moves right).\n- **Sorting Rule:** \"Ordered by their starting row (earlier rows go closer to their respective edge)\".\n- **Crystallized Rule:**\n  1. Identify 5x5 framed squares.\n  2. Group by Frame Color (8=Left, 2=Right).\n  3. Sort groups by **Y-coordinate (Ascending)**.\n  4. Place sorted objects into target side, stacking outward if overlaps occur.\n\n**Candidate 2 (Reasoning Model F):**\n- **Logic:** Identifies shapes by frame color.\n- **Sorting Rule:** \"Sort by original Column... Ascending for Left (closest to left moves first), Descending for Right (closest to right moves first).\"\n- **Crystallized Rule:**\n  1. Identify 5x5 framed squares.\n  2. Group by Frame Color (8=Left, 2=Right).\n  3. Sort Left Group by **Input X-coordinate (Ascending)**.\n  4. Sort Right Group by **Input X-coordinate (Descending)** (Rightmost input -> Rightmost output).\n  5. Place objects, stacking inward if overlaps occur.\n\n**Candidate 6 (Reasoning Model B):**\n- **Logic:** Moves 8-frames Left, 2-frames Right.\n- **Sorting Rule:** Implicit/Vague in text (\"Optimal packing\"), but output grid shows specific placements.\n- **Crystallized Rule:** Vague, but output suggests inconsistent sorting (see Phase 3).\n\n---\n\n### PHASE 2: THE GROUND TRUTH AUDIT\n\n**Test Case:** Solved Example 1 (Right-side objects).\n- **Objects:**\n  - Object A (Inner 3): Input X=4, Y=8.\n  - Object B (Inner 9): Input X=11, Y=9.\n- **Overlap:** Vertical overlap exists (Rows 9-12).\n- **Sorting Check:**\n  - **Candidate 1 (Y-Sort):** Object A (Y=8) is earlier than Object B (Y=9). Rule \"Earlier goes closer to edge (Right)\" implies Object A goes to X=17 (Edge). Object B goes to X=12.\n  - **Candidate 2 (X-Sort):** Object B (X=11) is right of Object A (X=4). Rule \"Rightmost input goes to Rightmost output\" implies Object B goes to X=17. Object A goes to X=12.\n- **Ground Truth Observation:**\n  - In Example 1 Output, the object at the Edge (X=17) is Inner 9 (Object B).\n  - The object to its left (X=12) is Inner 3 (Object A).\n- **Verdict:**\n  - **Candidate 1:** FAILED. Predicted A at Edge, B Left. Actual was B at Edge, A Left.\n  - **Candidate 2:** PASSED. Predicted B at Edge, A Left. Matches Actual.\n\n**Conclusion:** The transformation preserves **horizontal spatial relationships** (Left-to-Right order), not Vertical-to-Horizontal mapping. Candidate 1's logic is falsified by Example 1.\n\n---\n\n### PHASE 3: EXECUTION CONSISTENCY\n\n**Candidate 2 (Test Input):**\n- **Left Group Inputs:** D (X=2), E (X=10), C (X=16). (Note: C and D overlap at Row 7; D and E overlap at Rows 8-11).\n- **Candidate 2 Logic:** Sort X Ascending -> D, E, C.\n  - Place D (Leftmost Input) at X=0.\n  - Place E (Middle Input) -> Overlaps D? Yes. Move to X=5.\n  - Place C (Rightmost Input) -> Overlaps D? Yes. Move to X=5.\n  - Result: D at X=0; E and C at X=5.\n- **Candidate 2 Grid:** Shows D at X=0, E at X=5, C at X=5.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent execution.\n\n**Candidate 6 (Test Input):**\n- **Grid Observation:** Shows E (Inner 7) at X=0 and D (Inner 1) at X=5.\n- **Contradiction:** Input D (X=2) is Left of Input E (X=10). The grid swaps their relative order.\n- **Verdict:** Internal Contradiction / Invalid Logic.\n\n**Candidate 1 (Test Input):**\n- **Grid Observation:** Shows C (Inner 4, Y=3) at X=0 and D (Inner 1, Y=7) at X=5.\n- **Logic Check:** This follows Candidate 1's (incorrect) Y-sorting rule (Y=3 < Y=7).\n- **Verdict:** Consistent with its own flawed logic, but the logic itself was falsified in Phase 2.\n\n---\n\n### PHASE 4: STACK RANKING\n\n1.  **Candidate 2 (GOLD):** Correctly identified the spatial preservation rule (X-sorting). Logic holds up against Example 1 back-testing and is perfectly applied to the Test Input.\n2.  **Candidate 1 (INVALID):** Proposed a Y-to-X sorting rule (\"Earlier rows go to edge\") which is explicitly contradicted by Example 1 (where a lower object went to the edge because it was further right).\n3.  **Candidate 6 (INVALID):** Failed to preserve spatial order on the Test Input (swapped Left/Right order of objects).\n\n</AUDIT_LOG>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 2,\n      \"score\": 9.5,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Correctly identified that horizontal input order determines output stacking order (Leftmost -> Leftmost).

It looks like I need to figure out a transformation rule applied to a grid containing framed, square-like objects. Here's how I'm thinking about it:\n\n**Initial Analysis and Hypothesis Formation**\n\n*   **Object Identification:** The core visual elements are 5x5 blocks. Each block is defined by an outer border color and a filled interior color. There's also a background color, which is uniform. This is consistent across all examples.\n\n*   **Transformation Hints:** The examples show the input grid's objects rearranged to create distinct outputs. From the example outputs, I see that these framed squares, somehow, appear to be compacted into columns, separated based on the color of their border. The arrangement has a strong *horizontal* compaction, with the object's original *vertical* position mostly maintained.\n\n*   **Object Properties and Logic:** Objects, especially those that \"group\" together by border color, have their x coordinates rearranged in such a manner that they are next to each other in columns. Objects which *do* have Y-coordinate alignment should be positioned next to each other. Those are the ones which are arranged into a column. I can see a \"left\" group and a \"right\" group. This partitioning must be caused by the colors of the border.\n\n*   **The Big Idea:** My working hypothesis is that I can separate these objects by their border colors. Objects get moved to the left if the border is light-blue, and to the right if the border is red. I also think I may need to calculate the appropriate \"shift\" for the X positions, stacking the objects horizontally from left to right in the target group.\n\n**Formalizing the Algorithm**\n\nI think I have the logic, which will require me to:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Scan the input grid, look for contiguous 5x5 blocks. Record the top-left coordinate, the border color, and the interior color for each object.\n\n2.  **Separate Groups:** Based on border color, divide the objects into two groups (light-blue and red).\n\n3.  **Process Left (Light-Blue):**\n    *   Sort the items in the left group according to their X positions (ascending). Items with close starting X positions in the input grid should be positioned next to each other to form a stacked column.\n    *   Find any overlaps with other items that are already placed. If there is, move the item to the right (a single \"step\" corresponds to the width of the frame).\n\n4.  **Process Right (Red):**\n    *   Sort the items in the right group according to their X positions, descending. The sorting order doesn't *really* matter if the logic is correct. Descending is more intuitive when packing from right to left.\n    *   Use a similar collision avoidance approach, pushing the \"right\" objects left until there's no collision with another item already on the right side.\n    *   I'll be mindful of the edge of the grid!\n\n5.  **Rebuild Grid:** Use the calculated new X-positions from the previous two steps and the original Y-positions, draw each object into its new location in the output grid. The objects do not overlap, so the building order will not matter.\n\n**Testing the Hypothesis**\n\nI need to apply this algorithm to the provided test input. I'll need to meticulously record each object's properties, determine the new X and Y positions, and finally, verify that the constructed output grid matches the expected output according to the example transformations. Let's start with the test input...\n\n**Applying to the Test Input**\n\nI need to:\n1.  Parse the input: Read the numbers from the input grid and locate all the 5x5 object frames. Record their color and location.\n\n2.  Separate into groups based on border color (Red and Light Blue).\n\n3.  Arrange the light-blue frames on the left-side (X=0,5,10) - based on an appropriate sorting algorithm to determine collisions and keep Y positions fixed, compacting horizontally.\n\n4.  Arrange the red frames on the right-side (X=17,12,7) - based on an appropriate sorting algorithm to determine collisions and keep Y positions fixed, compacting horizontally.\n\n5.  Write the final pixel output.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nThis seems like the correct logic, and I am confident that following these steps will lead me to the solution. I just need to be very careful with the bookkeeping: the input grid numbers, locations of the frames, and new locations. The vertical alignment is important. I need to get the sort order right so that the \"left side\" and \"right side\n\nThe problem asks us to identify \"framed square\" objects in the grid, sort them based on their border color into two groups (left and right), and rearrange them horizontally while preserving their vertical positions (y-coordinates) and stacking them horizontally towards their respective sides.\n\n**1. Object Identification:**\nWe scan the 22x22 grid for 5x5 squares with a distinct border color. The background color is 9.\n\n*   **Object A:** Top-left at (0, 1). Border: 2 (Red). Inner: 4 (Yellow). Target: Right.\n*   **Object B:** Top-mid at (2, 10). Border: 2 (Red). Inner: 3 (Green). Target: Right.\n*   **Object C:** Top-right at (3, 16). Border: 8 (Light Blue). Inner: 4 (Yellow). Target: Left.\n*   **Object D:** Mid-left at (7, 2). Border: 8 (Light Blue). Inner: 1 (Blue). Target: Left.\n*   **Object E:** Mid-center at (8, 10). Border: 8 (Light Blue). Inner: 7 (Orange). Target: Left.\n    *(Note: In the thought block, I identified E starting at row 8 based on the input text. `8,8,8,8,8` appears at row 8, cols 10-14, and `8,7,7,7,8` below it.)*\n*   **Object F:** Low-mid at (13, 9). Border: 2 (Red). Inner: 6 (Magenta). Target: Right.\n    *(Note: Input row 14 (index 13) has `2,2,2,2,2`. Row 15 `2,6,6,6,2`. So top is y=13, x=9.)*\n*   **Object G:** Bottom-leftish at (15, 3). Border: 2 (Red). Inner: 3 (Green). Target: Right.\n    *(Note: Input row 16 (index 15) has `2,2,2,2,2` at x=3? Let's re-verify row 16. Row 16 col 3 is `2`. Yes. Top is y=15.)*\n*   **Object H:** Bottom-rightish at (16, 15). Border: 8 (Light Blue). Inner: 3 (Green). Target: Left.\n    *(Note: Input row 17 (index 16) has `9,9,9,9... 9,8,8,8,8,8,9,9`. Yes, top is y=16, x=15.)*\n\n**2. Transformation Logic:**\n*   **Vertical Position (Y):** Preserved for all objects.\n*   **Horizontal Position (X):**\n    *   **Border 8 (Left Group):** Objects move to the left (x=0). If they overlap vertically with an object already to their left (based on original x-order), they stack to the right (x=5, x=10, etc.).\n    *   **Border 2 (Right Group):** Objects move to the right (x=17 for a 22-width grid). If they overlap vertically with an object already to their right (based on original x-order), they stack to the left (x=12, x=7, etc.).\n\n**3. Applying Logic:**\n\n**Left Group (Border 8):**\n*   **Object D (y=7, x=2):** Leftmost in its vertical range. Moves to **x=0**.\n*   **Object H (y=16, x=15):** Leftmost in its vertical range (no overlap with D). Moves to **x=0**.\n*   **Object C (y=3, x=16):** Overlaps vertically with D (rows 7). Original x(16) > D(2). Must be right of D. Moves to **x=5**.\n*   **Object E (y=8, x=10):** Overlaps vertically with D (rows 8-11). Original x(10) > D(2). Must be right of D. Moves to **x=5**. (Check C vs E overlap: y=3-7 vs y=8-12. No overlap. So both can be at x=5).\n\n**Right Group (Border 2):**\n*   **Object B (y=2, x=10):** Rightmost in its vertical range. Moves to **x=17** (Cols 17-21).\n*   **Object F (y=13, x=9):** Rightmost in its vertical range. Moves to **x=17**.\n*   **Object A (y=0, x=1):** Overlaps vertically with B (rows 2-4). Original x(1) < B(10). Must be left of B. Moves to **x=12** (Cols 12-16).\n*   **Object G (y=15, x=3):** Overlaps vertically with F (rows 15-17). Original x(3) < F(9). Must be left of F. Moves to **x=12**.\n\n**4. Final Coordinates & Rendering:**\n*   **Obj A (Inner 4):** x=12, y=0.\n*   **Obj B (Inner 3):** x=17, y=2.\n*   **Obj C (Inner 4):** x=5, y=3.\n*   **Obj D (Inner 1):** x=0, y=7.\n*   **Obj E (Inner 7):** x=5, y=8.\n*   **Obj F (Inner 6):** x=17, y=13.\n*   **Obj G (Inner 3):** x=12, y=15.\n*   **Obj H (Inner 3):** x=0, y=16.\n\nThe output grid is constructed by placing these objects onto the background (9).\n\noutput:\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,4,4,4,2,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2\n9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,2,4,4,4,2,2,3,3,3,2\n9,9,9,9,9,8,4,4,4,8,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,2\n9,9,9,9,9,8,4,4,4,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,3,3,3,2\n9,9,9,9,9,8,4,4,4,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,1,1,1,8,8,7,7,7,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,1,1,1,8,8,7,7,7,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,6,6,6,2\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,2\n8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,3,3,3,2,2,6,6,6,2\n8,3,3,3,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2\n8,3,3,3,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,3,3,3,2,9,9,9,9,9\n8,3,3,3,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,4,4,4,2,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,2,4,4,4,2,2,3,3,3,2\n      9,9,9,9,9,8,4,4,4,8,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,2\n      9,9,9,9,9,8,4,4,4,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,3,3,3,2\n      9,9,9,9,9,8,4,4,4,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      8,1,1,1,8,8,7,7,7,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      8,1,1,1,8,8,7,7,7,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,6,6,6,2\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,6,6,2\n      8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,3,3,3,2,2,6,6,6,2\n      8,3,3,3,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      8,3,3,3,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,3,3,3,2,9,9,9,9,9\n      8,3,3,3,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,9\n      8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"D\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_5_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### What the transformation does (inferred from the examples)\n\n1. **Identify the background** (the most common color).  \n   In the test, the background is **9**.\n\n2. **Find all \u201cframed square\u201d objects**: each object is a **5\u00d75 square** with:\n   - a 1-cell-thick **border** of a single color\n   - a 3\u00d73 **solid fill** inside\n   - here, borders are either **8 (light-blue)** or **2 (red)**\n\n3. **Reposition without changing shapes/colors**:\n   - All **8-bordered** squares slide **left** as far as possible.\n   - All **2-bordered** squares slide **right** as far as possible.\n   - Squares **keep their original vertical (row) position**.\n   - Squares of the same group **cannot overlap**;

Here's the breakdown of my thinking:\n\nFirst, I need to understand the basic building blocks: the 5x5 squares. They have borders (teal or red, mostly) and 3x3 centers of a single color. The rest is a background color.  I noticed a pattern: the squares are defined by their top-left coordinates.\n\nThe challenge is to move these squares, sorting them by their border color. Teal squares move to the left edge; red ones move to the right. My main question was, do they have to stay in their original vertical positions or can they shift vertically, perhaps getting packed closer together? The examples showed the key: they shift horizontally, but vertically overlapping squares get pushed over by five columns.\n\nMy strategy started to form:\n1.  **Identify all the squares in the grid**.\n2.  **Separate them into two groups**: one for teal borders, one for red borders.\n3.  **Within each group, assign new X-coordinates**:  Teal squares go left, red squares go right.  But how do I deal with overlaps?  I realized the input X position is important.\n4.  To resolve these overlaps, I will use a packing strategy. I will sort the input object by x-coordinate. I can sort these objects by original X position and pack them in a lane, then move to an adjacent lane if an overlap occurs.\n\nTo verify my logic, I traced through an example in detail. I started by listing the input objects, then placed them on the output grid.\n*   Sorting:  For teal, I sort by input X. For red, I sort by input x.\n*   Placement: I try the default position (left or right). If it overlaps, I shift it to the next column.\n\nI've tested the logic with the example input, and I also checked a second example, making sure my assumptions hold. It looks like it works. I\u2019m feeling confident!\n\nI went ahead and formulated a comprehensive algorithm that breaks down like this:\n\n1.  **Parse the Grid**:\n    *   Find the border and center coordinates for all squares.\n    *   Define Background.\n2.  **Separate into Groups**: Based on Border color (8 or 2).\n3.  **Assign New Positions**:\n    *   For each group, I sort by input X coordinate to preserve the input object's arrangement in the new grid.\n    *   I iterate and find the best column. I test for vertical overlaps to make the next column, so the squares fit tightly.\n4.  **Reconstruct the Grid**: Fill the background and place each square at its calculated position.\n\nNow that I have a clear plan, I'll apply it to the user's test input.\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the \"framed square\" objects, categorize them by their border color, and rearrange them based on specific rules while preserving their shape and vertical position.\n\n### Method Explanation\n\n1.  **Object Identification**:\n    *   We scan the grid to find all 5x5 squares defined by a 1-cell thick border enclosing a 3x3 solid center of a different color.\n    *   The background is identified as the uniform color filling the rest of the grid (color 9 in the test input).\n    *   We record the original position (row, column), border color, and center color for each object.\n\n2.  **Grouping and Sorting**:\n    *   Objects are divided into two groups based on their border color:\n        *   **Border 8 (Teal)**: These move to the **left** side of the grid.\n        *   **Border 2 (Red)**: These move to the **right** side of the grid.\n    *   To pack them tightly without changing their vertical order more than necessary, we determine priority based on their original horizontal position (closeness to their target side):\n        *   **Border 8**: Sorted by original Column **Ascending** (closest to the left moves first).\n        *   **Border 2**: Sorted by original Column **Descending** (closest to the right moves first).\n\n3.  **Position Assignment**:\n    *   We place objects one by one from the sorted lists into their new positions.\n    *   **Vertical Position**: The object's Row index remains exactly the same (`keeping their original rows`).\n    *   **Horizontal Position**:\n        *   **Border 8**: We try to place the object at the leftmost column (`x=0`). If it overlaps vertically with any object already placed in that column, we shift it to the next available \"lane\" to the right (incrementing x by 5).\n        *   **Border 2**: We try to place the object at the rightmost column (`x=GridWidth-5`). If it overlaps vertically, we shift it to the next available \"lane\" to the left (decrementing x by 5).\n\n4.  **Reconstruction**:\n    *   We create a new grid filled with the background color (9).\n    *   We draw each object at its newly assigned coordinates.\n\n### Application to Test Input\n\n**Detected Objects:**\n*   **Border 2 (Right Group)**:\n    *   Obj A: Center 4, Pos (0, 1)\n    *   Obj B: Center 3, Pos (2, 10)\n    *   Obj F: Center 6, Pos (13, 9)\n    *   Obj G: Center 3, Pos (15, 3)\n*   **Border 8 (Left Group)**:\n    *   Obj C: Center 4, Pos (3, 16)\n    *   Obj D: Center 1, Pos (7, 2)\n    *   Obj E: Center 7, Pos (8, 10)\n    *   Obj H: Center 3, Pos (16, 15)\n\n**Sorting and Placement:**\n\n*   **Left Group (Border 8)** - Target `x=0`:\n    1.  **Obj D** (Original `x=2`): Placed at **`x=0`**, `y=7`. (Occupies rows 7-11)\n    2.  **Obj E** (Original `x=10`): Overlaps Obj D (rows 8-12 overlap 7-11). Moves to **`x=5`**, `y=8`.\n    3.  **Obj H** (Original `x=15`): No overlap with Obj D in lane 0 (row 16 > 11). Placed at **`x=0`**, `y=16`.\n    4.  **Obj C** (Original `x=16`): Overlaps Obj D in lane 0 (row 3-7 overlaps 7). Check lane 1 (`x=5`): No overlap with Obj E (rows 3-7 vs 8-12). Placed at **`x=5`**, `y=3`.\n\n*   **Right Group (Border 2)** - Target `x=17` (22-5):\n    1.  **Obj B** (Original `x=10`): Placed at **`x=17`**, `y=2`.

Any space an object leaves behind is refilled with the background color.\n\n2. The grid contains multiple **5\u00d75 framed squares**:\n   - A **1-cell-thick border** (either color **8** or color **2**)\n   - A solid **3\u00d73 interior** of some other color\n\n3. **Move framed squares horizontally by border color, without changing their rows**:\n   - Squares with **border color 8** slide **left**\n   - Squares with **border color 2** slide **right**\n\n4. **Packing / collision rule (why some don\u2019t go all the way to the edge):**\n   - Two squares of the **same border color** may not overlap after moving.\n   - If their **vertical spans overlap** (their row-ranges intersect), they must occupy **different 5-column \u201cslots\u201d** side-by-side.\n   - Packing is tight toward the target side; squares that were originally closer to that side take the outer slots (so squares do not \u201cpass through\u201d each other).\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n- All **8-bordered** squares are packed into the left side (columns 0\u20139).\n- All **2-bordered** squares are packed into the right side (columns 12\u201321).\n- Everything else becomes background **9**.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,9

                "response": "**Comprehensive Analysis of ARC Task Candidate Solutions**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with evaluating several potential solutions to an ARC problem. It seems like the core challenge is transforming a grid of \"framed squares,\" and I need to figure out the underlying rules behind the transformation.\n\nFirst, I identified the key elements: a 5x5 grid with solid interiors and a dominant background color. The task involves moving framed squares left or right based on their border color. Vertical positions should remain unchanged, but overlapping seems to cause stacking.\n\nI carefully analyzed the provided training examples to infer the rules.  I'm looking for the color coding for left/right movement, and how objects are ordered (stacked) within each group. The examples provided a good set of cases.\n\nThe first example revealed that cyan-bordered objects move left, red-bordered ones right.  Stacking appears to happen left-to-right for left movers and right-to-left for right movers, and the vertical positions remain constant. I noticed that the horizontal x-coordinate determined the final position.\n\nExample 2 reinforces these rules, with yellow background and different colors but the same left/right movement based on border.  I also noticed overlapping with x coordinates. The object closer to the target end (right) stacks on the outside of its group.\n\nExample 3 solidified the general concept.\n\nNow, I switched to the test input. I found the colors: 9 (maroon) background, with a set of objects with border 2 and 8. The task is to apply these to the test grid. This is where the sorting/stacking rules would become clearer.  There are a series of objects, split into a \"left\" group (border 8) and a \"right\" group (border 2). I then checked these for horizontal and vertical overlaps, as these seemed to affect the stacking order.\n\nThe key seemed to be the input x-coordinate relative to the target side.  Objects closer to the target side within each group go to the edge, so, right movers closer to the right, and left-movers closer to the left.\n\nNow I compared candidate solutions.\n\nCandidate 1 proposed a rule related to starting row (for ordering), but also maintained a left-to-right order. It messed up the x order on the test set. It put the shape which started further right to the left. The rule also failed on the example. I could see inconsistencies in its ordering. It couldn't sort properly, and so, the shape order was wrong. It had a flawed \"row-priority\" rule.\n\nCandidate 2 seemed much more sound.  It's rule uses x-coordinate based stacking/sorting.  The solution appeared to be based on the input x-coordinates, and it successfully arranged all the objects, keeping everything in the right order. I reviewed the test grid. Everything looked good and correct.\n\nCandidate 6, unfortunately, had problems.  It was making fundamental errors in the test solution. The grid was inconsistent with the provided explanation. The vertical position/row was being changed.\n\nSo, Candidate 2 emerges as the clear winner. This candidate provided clear explanations, and accurate grid generation, based on a correct x-axis stacking logic. The x coordinate and the horizontal gravity were key.\n\nFinally, I confirmed Candidate 2 produced the correct grid, with everything ordered based on the distance to their target. The other two candidates got the wrong results for reasons I documented above, and so my final answer is for Candidate 2.\n\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 2,\n      \"score\": 10.0,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"The rule correctly identifies that objects move to their color-coded side (8-Left, 2-Right) while preserving vertical position and their relative horizontal order (packing based on original x-position).\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Framed squares move horizontally to the side dictated by their border color (8->Left, 2->Right).
