        "Full raw LLM response": "**Detailed Analysis of ARC Task and Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, I've got this. The task is to solve an ARC problem where I'm given several solved examples and a test input. I need to figure out the rule and apply it to the test input. My immediate thought is to look at how the inputs relate to the outputs and identify patterns.\n\n*   **Example 1**: I started by breaking down the first example. I noticed a vertical green (color 3) line and a horizontal line of alternating colors (1 and 2). The output extended the vertical line and altered the horizontal line. The alternating 1s and 2s became solid 2s. The green line seemed to form a path, connecting the two segments, but the precise coordinates are a bit mysterious. It involves a \"snake\" which makes a right-angle bend. It seems the horizontal line \"repels\" the vertical line at one bend.\n\n*   **Example 2**: Moving to the second example, I saw a single green pixel and a vertical line. The output was a path expanding from the green pixel, going around the vertical line. Interesting! The path seems to \"wrap around\" obstacles.\n\n*   **Example 3**:  In the third example, I saw a clear pattern. The initial green pixel is at (0,4) and the path is influenced by three horizontal lines which I've started calling \"walls\". This reinforced the concept of \"walls\". The output was a path avoiding the walls. What's most important is the vertical lines (that contain 1s and 2s) \"block\" the path. The walls seem to force the path to make perpendicular turns. I began to hypothesize that the turns are related to the spacing between walls.\n\n*   **Example 4**:  The fourth example introduced vertical walls. The green pixel is now at the left edge of the grid, and I needed to figure out the precise relationship between the walls and the path again. The output involved a path going around the wall. The path made an L-shape, which is interesting.\n\n*   **Logic Extraction**: Based on these examples, I've started to form a general logic:\n    1.  **Identify the Start**: The green pixel (3) marks the starting point for the path. The starting edge of the line determines the path direction.\n    2.  **Locate Walls**:  Lines consisting of alternating 1s and 2s, in the input, seem to become solid 2s (red) in the output. These are the obstacles.\n    3.  **Path Extension**:  Extend a green path from the start point.\n    4.  **Wall Avoidance**: When a wall is encountered, the path must find a way \"around\" the wall. This generally means making a right-angle bend. The path *must* pass through gaps to keep drawing to the opposite end.\n    5.  **Turn-Off Point**: It is becoming clearer that the turns happen at specific points. The turns are related to the \"midpoint\" between obstacles (or the beginning and the obstacle) in the direction of the travel. The specific coordinate along the gap must be carefully figured out.\n\n*   **Midpoint Hypothesis**:  I then looked very closely at the midpoint of an obstruction. Turns seem to happen a \"midway\" point. I need to test this. If wall is y=7, the path turns y=2? Then if next wall is y=10. The path turns at y=7. This is the \"midpoint\" hypothesis.\n\n*   **Test Input Analysis:** I am starting the test input. The problem gave me a large grid, with one green pixel, and several obstacles. Now the key is to apply the midpoint logic, and see if I can derive the path. The test grid is 14x26. The key is now, where will the next segment turn? Based on the earlier examples, turns will be 2 before the wall.\n\n*   **Coordinate Refinement**: It's time to test the theory with the test data. I have determined a formula to calculate where the path turns. The path turns can be summarized:\n    * (X,25) -> (X,21)\n    * (6,21) -> (12,21)\n    * (12, 21) -> (12,12)\n    * (12,12) -> (2,12)\n    * (2,12) -> (2,4)\n    * (2,4) -> (8,4)\n    * (8,4) -> (8,0).\n\n*   **Final Verification**: The plan is solid: first to convert the wall pixels (1s) to 2s, then draw the path\n\nThe task is to find a path for a green line (color 3) from a starting point to the opposite edge of the grid, navigating through \"walls\" composed of colors 1 and 2. The walls must also be solidified into color 2.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:**\n    -   The input contains a background of 8s (teal), a starting point of 3 (green), and obstacle lines made of 1s (blue) and 2s (red).\n    -   The output shows the 1s and 2s converted uniformly to 2s (red).\n    -   A continuous path of 3s (green) is drawn from the start point to the opposite edge of the grid. In the Test Input, the start is at the right edge `(row 6, col 25)`, so the goal is the left edge (column 0).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Obstacles (Walls):**\n    -   Walls are vertical or horizontal lines blocking the direct path. In the Test Input, there are three vertical walls blocking the Leftward movement:\n        -   **Wall 1 (Col 17):** Blocks rows 0-9. Gap is rows 10-13.\n        -   **Wall 2 (Col 7):** Blocks rows 6-13. Gap is rows 0-5.\n        -   **Wall 3 (Col 1):** Blocks rows 0-5 and 11-13. Gap is rows 6-10.\n\n3.  **Determine Path Strategy:**\n    -   The path moves horizontally towards the goal. When blocked, it moves vertically to align with a gap in the wall.\n    -   **Turn Coordinates (X-axis):** Based on the solved examples (specifically Example 3), the path turns at the horizontal midpoint between obstacles.\n        -   Start (X=25) to Wall 1 (X=17): Midpoint is 21. Turn at **Col 21**.\n        -   Wall 1 (X=17) to Wall 2 (X=7): Midpoint is 12. Turn at **Col 12**.\n        -   Wall 2 (X=7) to Wall 3 (X=1): Midpoint is 4. Turn at **Col 4**.\n    -   **Gap Crossing Coordinates (Y-axis):** The path must pass through the gaps. Based on Example 4, a reliable heuristic for the crossing row is `Gap Start + 2`.\n        -   Gap 1 (10-13): Start 10 + 2 = **Row 12**.\n        -   Gap 2 (0-5): Start 0 + 2 = **Row 2**.\n        -   Gap 3 (6-10): Start 6 + 2 = **Row 8**.\n\n4.  **Construct the Path:**\n    -   Start at `(6, 25)`.\n    -   Move Left to `(6, 21)`.\n    -   Move Vertical to `(12, 21)`.\n    -   Move Left through Wall 1 gap to `(12, 12)`.\n    -   Move Vertical to `(2, 12)`.\n    -   Move Left through Wall 2 gap to `(2, 4)`.\n    -   Move Vertical to `(8, 4)`.\n    -   Move Left through Wall 3 gap to `(8, 0)` (Finish).\n\n5.  **Finalize Grid:**\n    -   Replace all original 1s and 2s with 2s.\n    -   Overlay the calculated green path (3s) onto the grid.\n\n**Output Generation:**\n\n-   **Walls:** Columns 1, 7, and 17 contain the 2s.\n-   **Path:**\n    -   Horizontal: `(6, 21-25)`, `(12, 12-21)`, `(2, 4-12)`, `(8, 0-4)`.\n    -   Vertical: `(6-12, 21)`, `(2-12, 12)`, `(2-8, 4)`.\n\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,3,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,3,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,3,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,3,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,3,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this puzzle, I need to understand the transformation rules from the examples.\n\n**Key observations from examples:**\n1. There's always a `3` marker and lines with alternating `1,2` patterns\n2. All `1`s in the patterns are replaced with `2`s\n3. The `3` creates L-shaped or rectangular paths that connect to the pattern boundaries\n4. The boundaries are offset from pattern positions by `(number_of_1s + 1)`\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n- `3` marker at position (5, 25)\n- Pattern 1: Column 1, rows 0-5 (1 one at row 0)\n- Pattern 2: Column 7, rows 5-13 (2 ones at rows 11, 13)  \n- Pattern 3: Column 17, rows 0-9 (3 ones at rows 0, 2, 4)\n\n**Calculating boundaries:**\n- Pattern 1 (1 one): boundary at col 1+2 = 3\n- Pattern 2 (2 ones): boundary at col 7+3 = 10\n- Pattern 3 (3 ones): boundary at col 17+4 = 21\n\n**Constructing the 3-path:**\nSince the marker is on the right side (col 25), the path forms rectangles connecting to patterns:\n- Rectangle 1: cols 10-21, rows 5-8\n- Rectangle 2: cols 3-10, rows 5-7\n- Extensions: row 5 from col 0-3 and col 21-25\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,2,3,3,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3\n8,8,8,3,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### What the examples show\n\n1. **Color 1 is always \u201cfilled in\u201d to become color 2.**  \n   In every example, all `1` cells change to `2` in the output, while existing `2` cells stay `2`.\n\n2. **The `1`+`2` cells form straight line-segments.**  \n   Each segment is either purely horizontal or purely vertical (a contiguous run/column of non\u20118 cells).\n\n3. **Each segment determines a \u201cclearance distance\u201d used to draw a `3` path.**  \n   For a given segment, let  \n   \\[\n   d = (\\text{number of 1s in that segment}) + 1\n   \\]\n   This `d` is how far away the drawn `3` path stays from that segment.\n\n4. **A single `3` on the border is the start of a polyline path.**  \n   The path starts at that `3` and moves *into the grid* (away from the border). It \u201csnakes\u201d around the line-segments: whenever it is heading toward a segment, it stops `d` cells before the segment, turns 90\u00b0, goes past the segment\u2019s far end by `d`, turns again, and continues. (If a segment touches a border, only one of \u201cgo above/go below\u201d is possible because the other would go out of bounds.)\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\n**Step A: Convert all `1` to `2`.**  \nThis makes three vertical `2`-segments:\n\n- Segment at **col 18, rows 1\u201310** had `1`s at rows 1,3,5 \u2192 `d = 3+1 = 4`\n- Segment at **col 8, rows 6\u201314** had `1`s at rows 12,14 \u2192 `d = 2+1 = 3`\n- Segment at **col 2, rows 1\u20136** had `1` at row 1 \u2192 `d = 1+1 = 2`\n\n**Step B: Draw the `3` path.**  \nThe start `3` is at **(row 7, col 26)** on the **right border**, so the path starts moving **left**.\n\nFollowing the \u201cstop `d` before the next segment, turn, pass its end by `d`, turn again\u201d rule gives this route:\n\n- Left to **col 22** (4 cells to the right of the col18 segment)\n- Down to **row 14** (4 below that segment\u2019s bottom)\n- Left to **col 11** (3 to the right of the col8 segment)\n- Up to **row 3** (3 above that segment\u2019s top)\n- Left to **col 4** (2 to the right of the col2 segment)\n- Down to **row 8** (2 below that segment\u2019s bottom)\n- Left to the **left border** (col 1)\n\nMark all cells along this polyline as `3`.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,3,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8",
