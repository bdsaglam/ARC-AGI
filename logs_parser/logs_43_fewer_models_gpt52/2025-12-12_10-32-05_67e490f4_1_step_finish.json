model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_1_step_1\">\n### Inferred transformation (from the solved examples)\n\n1. **Find the \u201ctemplate\u201d object**:  \n   In each input there is one large connected region of a single color (Example 1: color 4, Example 2: color 1).  \n   The **output grid is exactly the bounding box** of this large region.\n\n2. **Treat non-template cells inside the box as \u201choles\u201d**:  \n   Inside that bounding box, any cell that is *not* the template color (usually the global background color) forms **hole components** (connected groups).\n\n3. **Determine what color fills each hole component by shape-matching**:  \n   Elsewhere in the input (outside the template), there are small colored objects.  \n   For each hole-component shape, find matching object shapes (allowing rotation), and use the matching object\u2019s **color** to fill that hole shape in the template.  \n   If multiple colors have the same matching shape, choose the color that appears **most often** with that shape (this resolves the \u201cdistractor\u201d duplicates seen in the examples).\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\n- The large template is the **7\u00d730** block of color **4** at the top (rows 1\u20137), so the output is **7 rows \u00d7 30 columns**.\n- The holes are the **1**-colored components inside it.\n- Hole shapes found (and matched to outside objects) give these fills:\n  - L-shape of 3 cells \u2192 **7**\n  - T-shape of 4 cells \u2192 **9**\n  - Line of 5 cells \u2192 **6**\n  - Plus of 5 cells \u2192 **8**\n  - Pair of 2 cells \u2192 **2**\n  - U/\u03a0-shape of 8 cells \u2192 **9** (only color with that shape)\n\nFilling all holes accordingly yields:\n\n### Output

model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_2_step_3\">\n### What changes from input to output\n\n1. **Find the background color.**  \n   In the test grid, the most common color is **1**, so treat **1 as background**.\n\n2. **Find the \u201cstencil/frame\u201d object (the area we will output).**  \n   Look for the **largest connected component that is not background**.  \n   Here, that is the big **4-colored rectangle** at the top (rows 1\u20137, all 30 columns).  \n   The **output grid is exactly this rectangle\u2019s bounding box** \u2192 **7\u00d730**.\n\n3. **Inside that rectangle, identify the holes.**  \n   Every **background-colored (1)** connected component *inside* the 4-rectangle is a **hole shape** to be recolored.\n\n4. **Build a shape\u2192color dictionary from the rest of the grid.**\n   - Consider all connected components **outside the stencil**, with colors \u2260 1 and \u2260 4.\n   - For each such component, record its **shape** (as a set of relative coordinates), but compare shapes **up to rotation/reflection** (so a vertical line matches a horizontal line, etc.).\n   - For each shape type, choose the **most frequent color** among components having that shape.\n\n   In this test input, that yields:\n   - **3-cell L shape** \u2192 most frequent color **7**\n   - **4-cell T shape** \u2192 most frequent color **9**\n   - **5-cell plus shape** \u2192 most frequent color **8**\n   - **2-cell line** \u2192 color **2**\n   - **5-cell line** \u2192 color **6**\n   - **8-cell \u201cU/bracket\u201d shape** \u2192 color **9**\n\n5. **Fill

                "response": "**Audit Summary for ARC Puzzle Candidates**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with auditing these two candidates, and it's a bit of a head-scratcher, but I'm getting there. We've got these large input grids, smaller output grids, and the goal is to figure out the logic behind transforming the \"template\" region with holes filled by shapes from scattered objects.\n\nEssentially, both candidates start with the same basic idea: identify the background, the template, crop it, find the holes, find the scattered objects, match them by shape, and fill the holes.\n\nThe real challenge is figuring out how they *match* the shapes. It looks like it boils down to identifying the shape, and, for colors that have many instances of the same shape, which \"rules\" to use to determine which colors fill a hole for that shape.  In Example 1, both candidates agree on the logic, but the question is which candidate best generalizes this logic to the Test Input.\n\nNow, both candidates are using the same basic logic, so it's a matter of the details. And the Test Input is where the rubber meets the road. Looking at the example outputs, there's a clear difference. One Candidate fills one particular hole shape with the color '9', while the other fills it with '3'. That's the key.\n\nAfter comparing the text and looking at the Candidate responses, I see that these holes are a T shape, and a bit of investigation confirms this.  The critical question is, which color *should* be associated with this T shape? And why?\n\nThere are 9s and 3s, and there are T and other shapes.  Some of the colors are associated with only one object, and some are associated with many shapes. Candidate 2 thinks that a shape most often associated with a particular color, gets mapped to that color. This is in contrast to Candidate 9, which thinks that each particular shape gets a specific color.\n\nSo, here's what I've figured out: there's this shape-to-color assignment. The question of these two cases has created a conflict.  For the T-shaped holes, one candidate picks color 9, the other picks color 3. I've re-examined the examples and the logic of the candidates.\n\n*   **Purity Rule:** Does one candidate have a bias towards this rule?  The one with the most associated is the rule!\n*   **Most Frequent Rule:** Does the number of times a certain color is associated with a shape, affect the mapping? In Example 1, this rule is sufficient to handle all mappings.\n*   **Injection Rule:** Each shape is unique to a color.\n*   **Majority Rule:** Take the object type, and see which has more counts.\n\nSo, here's the deal: both candidates have similar basic logic, but the Test Input creates a conflict in a T shape. Candidate 2 believes it\u2019s better to have more objects of a shape. Candidate 9 thinks it's best to keep shapes unique, even if that means an otherwise acceptable mapping needs to be altered.\n\nI've carefully examined the inputs and outputs, and I have found the candidates are the same except for T shape. I re-read the outputs of both candidates, and found two candidates are, otherwise, identical.   By going over each entry, it\u2019s clear which shape has the majority and which has an injection of color. I believe, after careful review, that Candidate 9 is the better candidate for his consistent application of this rule.\n\n<AUDIT_LOG>\n### PHASE 1: LOGIC SELECTION & CRYSTALLIZATION\n\n**Candidate 2 Logic:**\n1.  **Crop:** Identify the large rectangular region of color 4 (Template). Crop the grid to this 7x30 bounding box.\n2.  **Hole ID:** Identify connected components of background color (1) inside the Template.\n3.  **Mapping:** For each hole shape, find matching objects in the \"scattered\" area (outside the template).\n4.  **Conflict Resolution (Majority):** If a shape matches objects of multiple colors, choose the color that appears **most often** with that shape.\n5.  **Execution:** Fill holes with mapped colors.\n\n**Candidate 9 Logic:**\n1.  **Crop:** Same as above (7x30 Template).\n2.  **Hole ID:** Same as above.\n3.  **Mapping:** Match hole shapes to scattered objects.\n4.  **Conflict Resolution (Implicit Bijective):** Implicitly maps distinct shapes to distinct colors (1-to-1 mapping), avoiding reusing colors that are already assigned to unique shapes.\n\n### PHASE 2: THE GROUND TRUTH AUDIT\n\n**Example 1 Check:**\n-   **Input:** Template with holes (2x2, Plus, Bar-2). Scattered objects of various colors (8, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9).\n-   **Observation:**\n    -   2x2 Hole -> Filled with 8. (Input has 2x2s in colors 8, 2, 3).\n        -   Count(8)=3, Count(2)=2, Count(3)=1. **Majority Rule Holds.**\n    -   Plus Hole -> Filled with 5. (Input has Pluses in colors 5, 6).\n        -   Count(5)=2, Count(6)=1. **Majority Rule Holds.**\n    -   Bar-2 Hole -> Filled with 9. (Input has Bar-2 in color 9).\n-   **Verdict:** Example 1 strongly supports **Majority Rule**. It does not explicitly test \"Bijective/Injective\" mapping because the Majority winners (8, 5) happened to be distinct from the unique shape (9). No collision occurred.\n\n**Example 2 Check:**\n-   **Verdict:** Pass. The mapping is consistent and 1-to-1.\n\n### PHASE 3: EXECUTION CONSISTENCY & TIE-BREAKING\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n-   **Shapes to Fill:**\n    1.  Line-5 (Unique to Color 6). -> Must be **6**.\n    2.  Bracket (Unique to Color 9). -> Must be **9**.\n    3.  Plus (Found in 6, 8, 3, 9).\n    4.  T-Shape (Found in 9, 3).\n    5.  L-Shape (Found in 7, 3).\n    6.  Domino (Found in 2). -> Must be **2**.\n\n-   **Conflict 1: Plus Shape**\n    -   Counts: Color 6 (3 instances), Color 8 (2 instances).\n    -   *Majority Rule* implies **6**.\n    -   *Injective Rule* implies: 6 is taken by Line-5. Next best is **8**.\n    -   **Both Candidates choose 8.**\n    -   *Implication:* Both candidates implicitly accept that \"Color 6 is busy with Line-5, so we skip it for Pluses.\" This establishes a precedent of **Injective Mapping** (Distinct Shapes -> Distinct Colors) overriding Majority.\n\n-   **Conflict 2: T-Shape**\n    -   Counts: Color 9 (2 instances), Color 3 (1 instance).\n    -   *Majority Rule* implies **9**.\n    -   *Injective Rule* implies: 9 is taken by Bracket. Next best is **3**.\n    -   **Candidate 2 chooses 9.** (Inconsistent: Used Injective logic for Plus/6, but Majority logic for T/9).\n    -   **Candidate 9 chooses 3.** (Consistent: Uses Injective logic for both).\n\n**Critique:**\nCandidate 2's reasoning involves a logical inconsistency. It correctly identified that 6 should be used for Lines (implied) and 8 for Pluses (explicit). If it strictly followed \"Most Frequent\", it should have put 6 for Pluses (count 3 vs 2). The fact that it chose 8 suggests it respects the \"Distinctness\" of the Line-6 mapping. However, it fails to extend this respect to the Bracket-9 mapping, overwriting the T-shape with 9 as well. This leaves Color 3 unused and Color 9 overloaded.\n\nCandidate 9 produces a solution where every shape maps to a unique color (Line->6, Bracket->9, Plus->8, T->3, L->7, Domino->2). This utilizes the full palette provided in the input and aligns with the ARC principle of Bijective Mapping.\n\n### PHASE 4: RANKING\n\n1.  **Candidate 9 (Gold):** Reasoning text is slightly less detailed about the counts, but the *Solution Grid* reflects a consistent, higher-order logic (Injective Mapping) that resolves collisions cleanly. It passed all Solved Examples and handles the Test Input's ambiguity with the most \"ARC-like\" elegance (1-to-1 mapping).\n2.  **Candidate 2 (Silver):** Reasoning is detailed and fundamentally sound (Majority Rule), but application is inconsistent on the Test Input (switches between Exclusion and Majority). It creates a \"Double Mapping\" for Color 9 while leaving Color 3 orphaned.\n\n</AUDIT_LOG>\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 9,\n      \"score\": 9.5,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Implicitly follows 'Injective Mapping' (One Shape = One Color), which is consistent with all examples and resolves the Test Input conflicts cleanly.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Consistent\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Crop to template; fill holes by matching shapes to scattered objects, prioritizing a 1-to-1 mapping (Bijective) to resolve conflicts where colors might be reused.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 2,\n      \"score\": 8.0,\n      \"tier\": \"SILVER\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Follows Majority Rule, which works for examples, but applies it inconsistently on Test Input (Skipped 6 for Plus to preserve distinctness, but didn't skip 9 for T).\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Inconsistent Logic\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Crop to template; fill holes with the color most frequently associated with that shape.

object**:  \n   In each input there is one large connected region of a single color (Example 1: color 4, Example 2: color 1).  \n   The **output grid is exactly the bounding box** of this large region.\n\n2. **Treat non-template cells inside the box as \u201choles\u201d**:  \n   Inside that bounding box, any cell that is *not* the template color (usually the global background color) forms **hole components** (connected groups).\n\n3. **Determine what color fills each hole component by shape-matching**:  \n   Elsewhere in the input (outside the template), there are small colored objects.  \n   For each hole-component shape, find matching object shapes (allowing rotation), and use the matching object\u2019s **color** to fill that hole shape in the template.  \n   If multiple colors have the same matching shape, choose the color that appears **most often** with that shape (this resolves the \u201cdistractor\u201d duplicates seen in the examples).\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\n- The large template is the **7\u00d730** block of color **4** at the top (rows 1\u20137), so the output is **7 rows \u00d7 30 columns**.\n- The holes are the **1**-colored components inside it.\n- Hole shapes found (and matched to outside objects) give these fills:\n  - L-shape of 3 cells \u2192 **7**\n  - T-shape of 4 cells \u2192 **9**\n  - Line of 5 cells \u2192 **6**\n  - Plus

identify the holes.**  \n   Every **background-colored (1)** connected component *inside* the 4-rectangle is a **hole shape** to be recolored.\n\n4. **Build a shape\u2192color dictionary from the rest

For each hole shape, we find a matching-shape object (allowing rotation), and use its **color** to fill all holes of that shape:\n\n- **L (3 cells)** matches the **7** objects \u2192 fill L-holes with **7**\n- **T (4 cells)** matches a **3** T-shaped object \u2192 fill T-holes with **3**\n- **5-cell line** matches a **6** line (rotated) \u2192 fill line-holes with **6**\n- **8-cell \u03a0 shape** matches a rotated **9** object (a long vertical with end tabs) \u2192 fill \u03a0-holes with **9**\n- **2-cell segment** matches the **2** domino \u2192 fill with **2**\n- **Plus (5 cells)** matches the **8** plus objects \u2192 fill plus-holes with **8**\n\n### 4) Output\nKeep all panel **4** cells, replace each hole component by its mapped color:\n\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,7,7,4,4,4,3,3,3,4,6,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,6,4,3,3,3,4,4,4,7,7,4\n4,7,4,4,8,4,4,3,4,4,6,4,9,4,4,4,4,9,4,6,4,4,3,4,4,8,4,4,7,4\n4,4,4,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,4,4,4\n4,7,4,4,8,4,4,3,4,4,6,4,9,4,4,4,4,9,4,6,4,4,3,4,4,8,4,4,7,4\n4,7,7,4,4,4,3,3,3,4,6,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,6,4,3,3,3,4,4,4,7,7,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      4,7,7,4,4,4,3,3,3,4,6,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,6,4,3,3,3,4,4,4,7,7,4\n      4,7,4,4,8,4,4,3,4,4,6,4,9,4,4,4,4,9,4,6,4,4,3,4,4,8,4,4,7,4\n      4,4,4,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,4,4,4\n      4,7,4,4,8,4,4,3,4,4,6,4,9,4,4,4,4,9,4,6,4,4,3,4,4,8,4,4,7,4\n      4,7,7,4,4,4,3,3,3,4,6,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,6,4,3,3,3,4,4,4,7,7,4\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"C\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_4_step_5_image\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### What the examples show\n\n1. **Find the \u201ctemplate box\u201d**  \n   In each input there is one large rectangle/square made of a single non-background color.

                "response": "**Task and Analysis Summary:**\n\nAlright, here's the rundown of my thinking process. The task is to audit solutions from two candidates (2 and 9) for an ARC puzzle. The core problem revolves around interpreting grid-based inputs and outputs, where a \"template\" shape (a colored block) is filled with colors based on the shapes of objects outside the template.\n\nFirst, I examined training examples to understand the underlying logic. The central idea seems to be \"shape matching.\" Specifically:\n\n1.  Identify the global background color and the \"template\" color (the large colored block).\n2.  Within the template, identify \"holes\" (cells with the background color).\n3.  Match the shapes of the holes to shapes formed by colored objects outside the template.\n4.  Fill the holes with the color of the matched object, potentially with rotation allowed.\n\nI meticulously analyzed the training examples, especially example 1, to identify these patterns and mappings. I found that different hole shapes (like a 2x2 square or an \"L\") correspond to outside objects of the same shape and color.\n\nMy major concern, as I looked at the test input, was, is it a *hole* or part of the existing structure. It looks like \"1s\" or \"4s\" but, for my test, it's the pattern within a shape.\n\nDuring the test input audit, I realized that candidate 9's rule made more sense because it matched a consistent pattern from the outside to the structure.\n\nThen, there's the critical point of discrepancy: for the test input, the candidates disagree on the color assigned to a \"T\" shape. Candidate 9 insists that \"T shapes should match a color 3 component.\" Candidate 2 says the T-shape is color \"9\". After a detailed examination of candidate 2's reasoning, it becomes clear that it is flawed because:\n\n1.  It is self-contradictory. The explanation of candidate 2 says, \"If there are more than one color, then pick the color most frequent in the shape.\n\nOverall, candidate 9's output is consistent with the general patterns and mappings I uncovered, it's solid. Whereas candidate 2's reasoning had major issues.\n\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 9,\n      \"score\": 10.0,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"The rule (template extraction + shape-based hole filling) perfectly explains both training examples without contradictions.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Extract the large colored template object; fill its 'holes' (background-colored components) by matching their shapes to scattered objects in the input and copying their colors.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 2,\n      \"score\": 4.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"The general logic fits the examples well, similar to Candidate 9.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Contradictory\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Extract template and fill holes by shape matching; resolve shape-color collisions by choosing the 'most frequent' color.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"final_ranking_by_candidate\": [\n    9,\n    2\n  ]\n}",
