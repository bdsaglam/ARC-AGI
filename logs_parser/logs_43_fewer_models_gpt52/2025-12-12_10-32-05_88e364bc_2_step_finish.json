I'm given an ARC task with three examples and a test case, all involving 20x20 grids filled with digits 0-9. My job is to find the pattern by which the input grid is transformed to the output grid. The first thing I'll do is break the problem into smaller, manageable chunks. I'll need to analyze each example individually, looking for similarities, differences, and any recurring motifs. I know from my experience that it's often useful to think of the grid as having \"objects\" or \"agents\". So, let's start by looking at those shapes and the digit '4'.\n\n**Analyzing Example 1: Object Identification and Movement:**\n\nThe input grid has objects that seem to be \"containers\" or \"enclosures,\" mainly made up of 5s and 7s. Digits inside seem to define keys. I'm seeing that the 4s in the input, which I'll call agents, shift their positions in the output. This seems like a key behavior I need to understand.\n\n**Pattern Hunting: Movement, Directionality, and the Keys:**\n\nI'm noticing that the '4's are moving in a particular direction. For example, some moved right and some moved left. But, there seems to be a connection between what color enclosure it is in, and which direction it moves. The 'keys' at the top-left also seem relevant. I suspect they're somehow linked to the direction of movement.\n\n**Key Exploration: Decoding the Directionality:**\n\nFocusing on the keys, each appears to be a 5x5 block of a color (5 or 7 in this example) that defines direction. 1s and 2s appear within those blocks. I think these numbers might represent movement vectors somehow. I noticed that 1 = Blue and 2 = Red is the typical pattern in this kind of ARC. It's time to start interpreting the key as a direction, and the '2' as the head of an arrow.\n\n**Uncovering the Rule: Gravity and Walls:**\n\nI think the key is linked to gravity or a \"wind\" affecting the 4s. The '1's could be the body, and the '2's the head of an arrow. In the 7-enclosure key, the '1 1 2' suggests that the agent moves right. In the 5-enclosure it suggests move left. I also noticed that the agents always move until they hit a wall. In other words, the '4's keep moving in the 'wind' direction until they hit the boundary.\n\n**Extending the Rule: Arrow Head, Arrow Body:**\n\nNow I'm hypothesizing that the '1's represent the body of an arrow and the '2's represent the head. In Example 2 it means an up-right movement. Example 3 has only an up-down movement.\n\n**Test Input Application: Key Identification and Movement:**\n\nAlright, let's test this in the test input. It has color 6 at the top-left, and color 3 in the middle-bottom. I'll examine the Key.\n\n**Key 1 Analysis (Color 6): Upward Gravity:**\n\nThe key has a 2, 1 pattern in a vertical column, which I interpret as an \"Up\" movement direction, from the body (1s) to the head (2).\n\n**Key 2 Analysis (Color 3): Up-Left Gravity:**\n\nThere's no key but a shape instead. The key must be somewhere.\n\n**Rule Application: Enclosure and Obstacles:**\n\nNow I'm going to look for '4's inside enclosures formed by color 6 or color 3. I'll determine the movement direction for each agent based on the key, and then shift that '4' upwards until I hit a wall. In each step, I will need to check the grid to find if the agent's path is free.\n\n**Test Input Solution: Grid Transformation:**\n\nI'm ready to move through the test input grid, row by row. Any 4 inside an enclosure will be moved. I'll move the agents, and record where they go.\n\n**Code Verification:**\nI'm now going through the grid line by line, making sure that each location of a 4 corresponds to one step based on the rules.\n\n**Output Construction and Conclusion:**\n\nI'm constructing the final output grid, placing the '4's in their new positions and filling everything else with the original values. I've finished the transformation, and I am confident in the solution.\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the final positions of the yellow pixels (4) based on their enclosing shapes and a \"key\" that defines the transformation.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Enclosures:** The grid contains regions bounded by specific colors (e.g., 7-colored borders, 5-colored borders). Inside these regions, there are yellow pixels (4).\n2.  **Keys:** For each boundary color, there is a corresponding 5x5 \"key\" block located in the grid (usually at corners). This key contains a pattern of 1s (blue) and 2s (red).\n3.  **Pattern Decoding:**\n    *   In the keys, we observe sequences of `1, 1, 2`.\n    *   The spatial arrangement of this sequence defines a direction vector. The \"arrow\" points from the 1s towards the 2.\n    *   **Example 1 (Color 7):** The key has `1, 1, 2` arranged horizontally left-to-right. Direction: **Right**. The 4s in the 7-enclosure move right until they hit a wall.\n    *   **Example 1 (Color 5):** The key has `2, 1, 1` arranged horizontally left-to-right (which is `1, 1, 2` right-to-left). Direction: **Left**. The 4s in the 5-enclosure move left until they hit a wall.\n    *   **Example 2 (Color 5):** The key has `1, 1, 2` arranged diagonally (top-left to bottom-right). Direction: **Down-Right**.\n    *   **Example 3 (Color 5):** The key has `1, 1, 2` arranged vertically top-to-bottom. Direction: **Down**.\n4.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   Identify the color of the enclosure surrounding a yellow pixel (4).\n    *   Find the key corresponding to that color.\n    *   Determine the direction from the `1, 1, 2` pattern in the key.\n    *   Move the yellow pixel (4) in that direction step-by-step.\n    *   Stop the movement just before the pixel would overwrite a non-zero pixel (a wall). The 4 occupies the last empty (0) cell in the path.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Keys:**\n    *   **Color 6 Key (Top-Left):** Columns 1 and 3 show `2` at row 1, `1` at row 2, `1` at row 3. This corresponds to a `1, 1, 2` sequence pointing **Up**.\n    *   **Color 3 Key (Bottom-Right):** We find patterns like `(19,16)=1`, `(18,15)=1`, `(17,14)=2`. This is a diagonal line pointing **Up-Left**.\n\n2.  **Processing Yellow Pixels (4):**\n    *   **Pixel at (5, 16):** Enclosed by **6**. Direction: **Up**.\n        *   Path: (5,16) -> (4,16).\n        *   (3,16) is a 6 (wall). Stop at **(4, 16)**.\n    *   **Pixel at (7, 9):** Enclosed by **3**. Direction: **Up-Left**.\n        *   Path: (7,9) -> (6,8) -> (5,7) -> (4,6).\n        *   (4,6) is a 3 (wall). Stop at **(5, 7)**.\n    *   **Pixel at (8, 11):** Enclosed by **3**. Direction: **Up-Left**.\n        *   Path: (8,11) -> (7,10) -> (6,9) -> (5,8) -> (4,7) -> (3,6).\n        *   (3,6) is a 3 (wall). Stop at **(4, 7)**.\n    *   **Pixel at (8, 18):** Enclosed by **6**. Direction: **Up**.\n        *   Path: (8,18) -> ... -> (2,18).\n        *   (1,18) is a 6 (wall). Stop at **(2, 18)**.\n    *   **Pixel at (13, 6):** Enclosed by **3**. Direction: **Up-Left**.\n        *   Path: (13,6) -> (12,5) -> (11,4).\n        *   (11,4) is a 3 (wall). Stop at **(12, 5)**.\n    *   **Pixel at (17, 5):** Enclosed by **3**. Direction: **Up-Left**.\n        *   Path: (17,5) -> (16,4) -> (15,3) -> (14,2).\n        *   (14,2) is a 3 (wall). Stop at **(15, 3)**.\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\nWe remove the 4s from their original positions and place them at the calculated destinations.\n\n6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,6,0,4,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,6,6,6,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,4,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,0,6\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 0>\n<CANDIDATE 1>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 20x20\n66666000000000000000\n62626003333333006666\n61616003000003006006\n61616033000003666606\n66666030000033600006\n00000030000030600046\n00333330000033666006\n00340000000003306006\n00334000000003306006\n00033333333333006646\n00003333333000000666\n00003000003000000000\n00003000003000000000\n00033400003000000000\n00330000003003333333\n00300000033003332333\n00300000030003233133\n00334000030003313313\n00033300330003331333\n00000333300003333333\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_1_step_1\">\nLooking at the examples, I need to understand how the 4s (markers) move within their enclosing shapes.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1.

I'm being asked to solve an ARC puzzle. The core is a grid of numbers 0-9, and the task is to figure out the transformation from an input grid to an output grid. I'm given three solved examples and a test input. My job is to explain my reasoning, step by step, and generate the final output grid.\n\n**Delving into the Examples:**\n\nThe examples are key. I need to spot a pattern here. The grid is filled with integers representing different colors or objects. There are these \"rooms\" made up of connected components of the same color and some internal patterns. The yellow pixels (4s) seem like the movers. I notice that the yellow pixels move, but the rooms, keys, and other features remain mostly the same. \n\n**First Hypothesis: Displacement Related to \"Keys\"**\n\nI have a suspicion about these \"Key\" blocks.  They seem to be grids within the colored blocks. I see blue (1s) and red (2s) pixels.  In the first example, the yellow dots shift a number of spaces. The key seems to hold the clues. So if I find a mapping between the \u201cKey\u201d structure and the Yellow dot movement, I will have the core of the solution.\n\n**Refining the Hypothesis: Vector Based Movement**\n\nAfter some iterations, it looks like a vector based displacement rule is at play. The direction of a Yellow dot's movement seems to be encoded as a vector in the \"Key\". A red pixel (2) relative to a blue pixel (1) creates a simple pattern. So a relative position of the Red (2) to Blue(1) implies an \u201cAttraction\u201d in that direction. \n\n**Key Characteristics**\n\n1.  Each key is a solid shape filled with its color.\n2.  Each key has a pattern of blues and reds inside.\n3.  Each key has a specific position in the test Input.\n\n**Validating the hypothesis with Example 2**\n\nThe movement in example 2 is diagonal - Down-Right. The key shows a specific positioning of blue and red pixels. Again, I analyze this to derive a vector. Centroid of all blues - Centroid of all Reds. And voila, the vector I get is Down-Right, which matches the direction the Yellow pixel moves. I have a theory!\n\n**Example 3 Consolidation**\n\nThe third example shows vertical down movement, this aligns with the hypothesis. \n\n**Establishing the Rule**\n\nMy rule is now clear:\n\n1.  Find the \"Key\" and its pattern of 1's (Blues) and 2's (Reds).\n2.  Find the Centroid of each of the Blue(1) and Red(2) pixels.\n3.  Subtract the Centroid of Blue(1) from Red(2).\n4.  Movement = The sign or major direction of the vector. The Yellow dots move through their respective colors.\n\n**Test Input**\n\nNow, I'll apply the rule to the test input. There are now two distinct color \u201cRooms\u201d to apply the rules to. I calculate the movement direction for each \u201croom\u201d type. Then, I trace the movement of the yellow pixels based on that vector direction. I make sure to account for walls (non-zero values) in the grid so that the Yellow pixels don't move into them.\n**Test Input Movement**\n\n1.  Magenta moves Up\n2.  Green Moves Up-Left\n\n**Output Grid Construction**\n\nI will now construct the output by shifting the position of the Yellow dots from the input as determined above. The new positions replace the old and the result is the output grid. I am doing a careful reconstruction based on all of the above. Now, it is time to write the output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the transformation rule from the given solved examples and apply it to the test input.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects and Roles**:\n    *   **Containers/Rooms**: The grid contains hollow or irregular shapes made of specific colors (e.g., Orange/7, Gray/5, Magenta/6, Green/3). These act as \"rooms\".\n    *   **Keys**: For each container color, there is a distinct, solid rectangular block of the same color (the \"Key\"). Inside these keys are patterns of Blue (1) and Red (2) pixels.\n    *   **Agents**: Yellow pixels (4) are scattered inside the empty spaces (0s) of the \"rooms\".\n    *   **Task**: The yellow pixels (4) move from their initial positions to new positions within their respective rooms. The other structures (walls, keys) remain unchanged.\n\n2.  **Determine Movement Rules**:\n    *   The movement of the yellow pixels is determined by the \"Key\" corresponding to the color of the room they are in.\n    *   We analyze the internal structure of the Keys (Blue/1 and Red/2 pixels) to find a direction vector.\n    *   **Hypothesis**: The direction is defined by the vector pointing from the **centroid of the Blue pixels (1)** to the **centroid of the Red pixels (2)**.\n    *   **Verification**:\n        *   *Example 1*:\n            *   Orange Key: Blue on left, Red on right. Vector points **Right**. Yellow pixels in Orange rooms move Right until they hit a wall.\n            *   Gray Key: Red on left, Blue on right. Vector points **Left**. Yellow pixels in Gray rooms move Left until they hit a wall.\n        *   *Example 2*:\n            *   Gray Key: Blue cluster centered roughly top-left, Red cluster roughly bottom-right relative to each other.

I see that there are grids filled with \"rooms\" defined by colored walls. Inside, there are these yellow pixels (color 4) which are the things that need to be moved. The movement seems to be controlled by these \"key panels\" which are basically rectangular areas with a specific border color and a pattern of blue (1) and red (2) pixels.\n\n**Understanding the Movement:**\nThe key is to understand how the patterns within the key panels relate to the movement of the yellow pixels. I'm focusing on three examples to see if I can find a pattern. I think I see a link between the position of the red pixels (2) within the key panel and the direction in which the yellow pixels move.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\nIn the first example, I noticed that in an orange section, the yellow pixels moved right, and in the gray section, the yellow pixels moved left. When I looked closely at the keys, I saw that in the orange key the red pixels were on the right. In the gray key, the red pixels were on the left.\nI hypothesized that the location of the red pixels relative to the blue pixels controls the direction. In the second example, I realized that the keys could be larger than just a small block. I had to look closely at the arrangement of the 1s and 2s inside the 5-box. I found that the pattern inside corresponded to a down-right movement. I then realized, after looking at the movement in the example, that the movement could be diagonal. The yellow pixels moved diagonally down-right.\nI needed to re-evaluate the key panel and figured out that the red pixels, on average, were to the south-east of the blue pixels. I formulated the idea that the direction vector can be calculated from the center of the blue pixels to the center of the red pixels. In the third example, I saw that the direction was down, and the key panel indicated that the direction was down, matching my theory.\n\n**Hypothesis Formulation:**\nI refined my hypothesis into something I can follow:\n1.  **Locate Keys:** Identify these key panels; they are rectangular, they match wall colors in the grid, and are usually in the corners. They have pixels of colors 1 and 2 inside.\n2.  **Determine Direction:** Calculate the direction vector from the centroid of the blue pixels (1s) to the centroid of the red pixels (2s).\n3.  **Apply Movement:** Move each yellow pixel (4) inside an area with the same color walls of its key in the calculated direction. Move it step by step, stopping when it hits a wall.\n\n**Applying to the Test Input:**\nI'm ready to tackle the test input now. First, I will find these key panels. I found that there is a magenta key and a green key, each with unique patterns. The magenta key indicates an Upward movement, and the green key indicates a Up-Left movement.\n\n**Applying the Movement Logic:**\nFor each yellow pixel, I will use its wall to identify which key controls its movement. I will apply the correct direction for each. I need to be careful with paths and make sure the pixels move in parallel.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\nI'm going to carefully double-check all my calculations to make sure the movements are right. I need to make sure the new positions of all the yellow pixels are right and I am not accidentally crossing over walls. Then, I will construct my output grid with the pixels moved accordingly.\n\n\nTo solve this task, we analyze the relationship between the stationary structures (walls and \"key\" panels) and the moving elements (yellow pixels).\n\n**1. Analyzing the Examples:**\n*   **Key Panels:** In each example, there are rectangular blocks made of a specific wall color (orange, gray, magenta, etc.) located in the corners or distinct areas. Inside these blocks, there is a pattern of blue (1) and red (2) pixels.\n*   **Direction Decoding:** The relative position of the red pixels (2) to the blue pixels (1) encodes a movement direction.\n    *   **Example 1:**\n        *   Orange Key (Top-Left): Red pixels are to the *right* of blue pixels. The yellow pixels in the orange room move **Right**.\n        *   Gray Key (Top-Right): Red pixels are to the *left* of blue pixels. The yellow pixels in the gray room move **Left**.\n    *   **Example 2:**\n        *   Gray Key (Top-Right): The center of mass of the red pixels is *down-right* relative to the center of mass of the blue pixels. The yellow pixels move **Down-Right**.\n    *   **Example 3:**\n        *   Gray Key (Top-Right): The red pixels are directly *below* the blue pixels. The yellow pixels move **Down**.\n    *   **General Rule:** Calculate the vector from the centroid (average position) of the blue pixels (1) to the centroid of the red pixels (2). This vector determines the direction of movement for yellow pixels associated with that wall color.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Test Input:**\n*   **Magenta Key (Color 6):** Located in the top-left corner (Rows 0-4, Cols 0-4).\n    *   Blue pixels (1) are at rows 2 and 3. Average row $\\approx 2.5$.\n    *   Red pixels (2) are at row 1. Average row $= 1$.\n    *   Columns are symmetric around the center.\n    *   Direction Vector: From Row 2.5 to Row 1 is **Up**.\n    *   **Action:** Yellow pixels enclosed by Magenta walls move **Up**.\n\n*   **Green Key (Color 3):** Located in the bottom-right corner (Rows 14-19, Cols 13-19).\n    *   Blue pixels (1) are clustered around (Row 17, Col 16.5).\n    *   Red pixels (2) are clustered around (Row 15.5, Col 15).\n    *   Direction Vector: From (17, 16.5) to (15.5, 15) is negative in both row and column. Direction is **Up-Left**.\n    *   **Action:** Yellow pixels enclosed by Green walls move **Up-Left**.\n\n**3. applying the Transformation:**\nWe identify each yellow pixel (4) and move it in its assigned direction until it hits a wall.\n\n*   **Yellow at (5, 16) [Magenta Region]:**\n    *   Direction: Up.\n    *   Path: (5,16) $\\to$ (4,16).

Position (4,6) is a wall (3).\n    *   New Position: **(5, 7)**.\n\n*   **Yellow at (8, 11) [Green Region]:**\n    *   Direction: Up-Left.\n    *   Path: (8,11) $\\to$ ... $\\to$ (4,7).

Let's break this down. It seems the core of the problem lies in understanding how the input grids are transformed into the output grids. I'm focusing on the examples provided and the test input to identify the underlying pattern.\n\n**Grid Properties and Initial Observations:**\n\n*   All grids are 20x20 in size with values from 0 to 9.\n*   I'm immediately drawn to the distinct \"objects\" or \"frames\" within the grids. These act like containers.\n*   I'm also seeing a pattern with the color yellow (4) pixels in all the examples, so these will be important. They seem to move around.\n\n**Detailed Example Analysis:**\n\n*   In example 1, I see \"control blocks,\" which appear to be the same size and color as the containers, located at the top of the grid.\n*   The \"control blocks\" seem to dictate the yellow pixel transformations. I observe that the \"pattern\" inside the control block has a correspondence to the movement of the yellow pixels within the larger container. If the control block has color 7 (orange) it has a certain value for moving the yellow pixel. The same is true for color 5, which has a different direction.\n*   The movements are relative to the \"container\" shapes. I also notice that the movements tend to involve sliding the yellow pixels until they hit a wall defined by the container's edge.\n\n**Formulating the Hypothesis:**\n\n*   **Hypothesis:** The \"Control Block\" contains a pattern of numbers. In example 1, the pattern is `1, 1, 2` for a color 7 container, which shifts the pixel to the right until it is at a wall. For color 5, the pattern is `2, 1, 1`, and the direction is to the left.\n*   If `2` indicates a target for movement or direction. The '1s' seem like empty space.\n\n**Refinement & Generalization:**\n\n*   The direction isn't exactly straight right or left in the general case.\n*   To get the direction, I can calculate the centroid of the '1's and the centroid of the '2's within the control block. The vector from the centroid of '1' to the centroid of '2' gives the movement direction.\n*   The yellow pixel slides in that calculated direction through empty space until it hits a wall of the container.\n*   Any non-zero value other than 4 acts as a stopping point.\n\n**Applying the Rules to Test Input:**\n\n*   I'll now apply my rules to the Test input, recognizing Magenta (6) and Green (3) as container colors.\n*   For each container color, I locate the control block, calculate the centroids of 1s and 2s, and determine the direction vector, which shows the direction. The yellow pixels are in this shape.\n*   Then I slide each yellow pixel in their container in the calculated direction until it hits any non-zero value, which becomes the destination.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n\n*   I'll create the output grid by making a copy of the input.\n*   Then, I'll remove all the original yellow pixels and replace the new destination positions with yellow pixels. All remaining pixels are left the same.\n\nIn summary, I understand how each colored shape's control block determines how any yellow pixels in that shape are transformed.\n\n\nThe problem involves moving yellow pixels (4) based on instructions embedded within specific \"Control Blocks\" of the same color as the shape containing the yellow pixel.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\n1.  **Object Decomposition:** The grid contains shapes of different colors (e.g., 7, 5, 6, 3). Each shape acts as a container for yellow pixels (4).\n2.  **Control Blocks:** For each color, there is a specific rectangular \"Control Block\" that defines the movement rule for yellow pixels within shapes of that color.

Initially, I observed recurring elements: enclosed shapes, often with single \"yellow\" pixels nestled within. Corner blocks, which I intuitively called \"keys,\" seemed crucial.\n\nExample 1 was the Rosetta Stone. The key, a structured 5x5 grid, held the key to pixel movement. Two colored shapes (orange and gray) each had their own \"gravity.\" Yellow pixels in each loop would \"move\" until hitting a wall. The direction and distance of that movement was encoded in the keys. For example, the Key's placement determined movement direction: Top Left \"Orange\" pushed Right, the Top Right \"Gray\" pushed Left.\n\nI then dissected the Example 1 Keys (1s and 2s) and realized they were essentially directional vectors for moving pixels, the magnitude of the movement encoded in the structure. One `1` equaled one step and a `2` equals 2 steps. The location of the key determined the starting direction of the \"gravity.\"\n\nExample 2 showed diagonal movement, with the same \"move to the wall\" principle. The \"key\" here confirmed this direction. Again, the arrangement of 1s and 2s hinted at a vector, confirming diagonal down-right.\n\nExample 3 solidified the arrow-shaped key-logic. This revealed the principle: an arrow shape on the key defines a movement. The pixel \"falls\" towards the arrow's tail/shaft direction until encountering a \"wall\" of the color shape.\n\nThe test case presented a new challenge: one key for two shapes. Would this create global gravity? After studying the input, I concluded, that key at the top left (magenta) defines a global down \"gravity\" for any pixels not already protected by a wall and any pixel in the corresponding area will move \"up\" until hitting a 0 or other blocking wall.\n\nThe algorithm thus becomes:\n\n1.  Identify all yellow pixels.\n2.  Follow the key's arrow. All the pixels need to follow one path (up).\n3.  Move each pixel in that direction until a blocking wall is hit, in our case the other shaped areas.\n\nFinally, I carefully traced the path of each yellow pixel in the test case, mapping its starting point and final destination. The resulting output grid, with pixels moved \"up\" to the point of collision, should be the answer.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the final positions of yellow pixels (represented by the number `4`) based on a transformation rule derived from the provided examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Rules:**\n1.  **Objects:** The grid contains static structures (loops or shapes) made of colored pixels (e.g., orange `7`, grey `5`, green `3`, magenta `6`).\n2.  **Movable Agents:** The yellow pixels (`4`) are dynamic agents that move through the empty space (`0`).\n3.  **Controller (The Key):** Each puzzle contains a square \"Key\" block, often in a corner. This Key contains a pattern of Blue (`1`) and Red (`2`) pixels.\n    *   The spatial arrangement of the Blue (`1`) and Red (`2`) pixels defines a **direction vector**.\n    *   The vector points from the Blue pixels (\"tail\") towards the Red pixels (\"head\").\n    *   **Example 1:**\n        *   Left Key: `1`s on left, `2` on right. Direction: **Right**.\n        *   Right Key: `2` on left, `1`s on right. Direction: **Left**.\n    *   **Example 2:**\n        *   Key: `1`s in top-left, `2` in bottom-right. Direction: **Down-Right**.\n    *   **Example 3:**\n        *   Key: `1`s in top rows, `2`s in bottom row. Direction: **Down**.\n4.  **Movement Logic:** All yellow pixels (`4`) move in the direction defined by the Key. They travel in a straight line until they are blocked by a wall (a non-zero pixel that is part of a static structure). They stop at the last empty cell before the wall.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n1.  **Identify the Key:**\n    *   There is a Magenta (`6`) box in the top-left corner (Rows 0-4, Cols 0-4).\n    *   Content:\n        *   Row 1: `6, 2, 6, 2, 6` (Red `2`s)\n        *   Row 2: `6, 1, 6, 1, 6` (Blue `1`s)\n        *   Row 3: `6, 1, 6, 1, 6` (Blue `1`s)\n    *   **Direction:** The \"tail\" (`1`) is at the bottom (rows 2,3) and the \"head\" (`2`) is at the top (row 1). Therefore, the direction of movement is **UP**.\n\n2.  **Identify Movable Pixels (`4`) and Move Them:**\n    We scan the input grid for `4`s and trace their path upwards until they hit a non-zero pixel.\n\n    *   **Pixel 1:** At `(5, 16)`\n        *   Path Up: `(4, 16)` is `0`. `(3, 16)` is `6` (Magenta Wall).\n        *   **Final Position:** `(4, 16)`\n\n    *   **Pixel 2:** At `(7, 9)`\n        *   Path Up: `(6, 9)` to `(2, 9)` are all `0`. `(1, 9)` is `3` (Green Wall).\n        *   **Final Position:** `(2, 9)`\n\n    *   **Pixel 3:** At `(8, 11)`\n        *   Path Up: `(7, 11)` to `(2, 11)` are all `0`. `(1, 11)` is `3` (Green Wall).\n        *   **Final Position:** `(2, 11)`\n\n    *   **Pixel 4:** At `(8, 18)`\n        *   Path Up: `(7, 18)` to `(2, 18)` are all `0`. `(1, 18)` is `6` (Magenta Wall).\n        *   **Final Position:** `(2, 18)`\n\n    *   **Pixel 5:** At `(13, 6)`\n        *   Path Up: `(12, 6)` and `(11, 6)` are `0`. `(10, 6)` is `3` (Green Wall).\n        *   **Final Position:** `(11, 6)`\n\n    *   **Pixel 6:** At `(18, 5)`\n        *   Path Up: `(17, 5)` to `(11, 5)` are all `0`. `(10, 5)` is `3` (Green Wall).\n        *   **Final Position:** `(11, 5)`\n\n3.  **Construct Output:**\n    Create the output grid by copying the input, removing the original `4`s, and placing `4`s at the calculated final positions.\n\n    *   Add `4` at: `(4, 16)`, `(2, 9)`, `(2, 11)`, `(2, 18)`, `(11, 6)`, `(11, 5)`.\n    *   Remove `4` from: `(5, 16)`, `(7, 9)`, `(8, 11)`, `(8, 18)`, `(13, 6)`, `(18, 5)`.\n\n**Completed Output Grid:**\n6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,4,0,4,0,3,0,0,6,0,4,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,6,6,6,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,0,4,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,0,6\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,3,4,4,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3\n0,0,3,3,0,4,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 6>\n<CANDIDATE 7>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 20x20\n66666000000000000000\n62626003333333006666\n61616003000003006006\n61616033000003666606\n66666030000033600006\n00000030000030640006\n00333330000033666006\n00300000000043306006\n00330000000043306006\n00033333333333006646\n00003333333000000666\n00003000003000000000\n00003000003000000000\n00033400003000000000\n00330000003003333333\n00300000033003332333\n00300000030003233133\n00334000030003313313\n00033300330003331333\n00000333300003333333\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_4_step_5_image\">\nLooking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1.

I've got three examples and a test input grid to work with.  My task is to move yellow pixels (labeled '4') based on some rules that depend on the surrounding colors and special \"instruction tiles.\" These tiles are rectangular, have a base color and embedded pixels of colors 1 and 2, which seem to indicate a direction of movement for the yellow pixels.\n\nThe problem seems to require: 1) Identifying and analyzing the tiles to determine the movement directions, 2) figuring out how the yellow pixels relate to the tiles and their associated regions, and 3) applying the movement rule (\"slide until collision\").\n\n**Tile Analysis and Direction Derivation**\n\nThe crucial part is the tiles. They are rectangular blocks. I need to figure out how to calculate direction from them. The problem description suggests calculating a vector from the centroid of '1' pixels to the centroid of '2' pixels. I confirmed that with the first example.  The centroid formula is (sum of x coords)/num points, (sum of y coords)/num points. I need to keep this precise, or I will get the directions wrong. It needs to be precise relative to the tile's own coordinate system.\n\n**Association Rules & Movement Logic**\n\nNext, I have to figure out how to assign directions to the yellow pixels (movers).  The prompt says \"nearest base-color region that has a tile\". It seems like each yellow pixel is *inside* a certain region. Since there is only one tile for a color, it seems all the areas that the color encompasses, share the behavior of that tile. In the examples, the yellow pixels are either inside or near a colored shape. The examples suggest that the shape's base color, and its nearest tile, determine the yellow pixel's movement direction.  If the yellow pixels are trapped in cavities defined by colored shapes, the walls seem to block movement. The \"slide until collision\" part seems straightforward. The grid boundaries are also a hard wall.\n\n**Applying the Logic - Test Input**\n\nI will now apply this process to the test input. 1) Identify the instruction tiles. 2) Determine their direction. 3)  For each yellow pixel, find the corresponding color, and move the pixel in the associated direction until a collision occurs. I'll make sure to get the 4s' coordinates correct and keep track of all moves. I'll need to reconstruct the output grid by replacing the original 4s with the new positions. It looks like the original '4' pixels are to be overwritten with '0'. Also, no collisions between 4s!\n\nLet's do this!\n\n\nTo solve this challenge, we first need to understand the function of the different objects in the grid and how they dictate the movement of the yellow (color 4) pixels.\n\n**1. Analyze the Components**\n\n*   **Instruction Tiles:** These are rectangular regions of a specific base color (like 6 or 3) containing a pattern of embedded pixels of colors 1 and 2.\n    *   **Logic:** For each tile, we calculate a movement direction vector from the centroid of the color 1 pixels toward the centroid of the color 2 pixels. This vector aligns with one of the 8 cardinal/intercardinal directions (North, North-East, East, etc.).\n*   **Movers:** These are single pixels of color 4.\n    *   **Logic:** Each mover is associated with the \"nearest\" base-color region that possesses an instruction tile. In practice, movers are usually adjacent to or enclosed by a structure of a specific color. They adopt the movement direction derived from that color's instruction tile.\n*   **Transformation:** Move each color 4 pixel in its assigned direction through empty space (color 0) until it is about to hit a non-zero pixel or the grid boundary. Place the 4 in the last empty cell before the collision.\n\n**2. Analyze the Test Input**\n\n*   **Instruction Tile 1 (Color 6 - Top Left):**\n    *   Located roughly at rows 0-4, cols 0-4.\n    *   **Pattern:** Rows 1-3 contain 1s and 2s.\n        *   1s are in rows 2 and 3. Average Row $\\approx 2.5$.\n        *   2s are in row 1. Average Row $= 1.0$.\n        *   The columns are symmetric for both, so the horizontal component is 0.\n    *   **Vector:** From 1s (Row 2.5) to 2s (Row 1.0) is Up/North.\n    *   **Direction:** **North**.\n\n*   **Instruction Tile 2 (Color 3 - Bottom Right):**\n    *   Located roughly at rows 15-18, cols 13-19.\n    *   **Pattern:**\n        *   1s are generally in the lower/right part of the tile (Rows 16-18, Cols 15-18). Centroid roughly (Row 17, Col 16.5).\n        *   2s are generally in the upper/left part of the tile (Rows 15-16, Cols 14-16). Centroid roughly (Row 15.5, Col 15).\n    *   **Vector:** From 1s to 2s involves decreasing row index (Up/North) and decreasing column index (Left/West).\n    *   **Direction:** **North-West**.\n\n**3. Move the Pixels**\n\nWe identify every color 4 pixel and move it according to the rule of its surrounding/nearest color.\n\n1.  **Mover at (5, 16):**\n    *   Surrounded by Color 6 (right-side structure).\n    *   Direction: **North**.\n    *   Path: Moves up through (4,16). Cell (3,16) is color 6 (Wall).\n    *   **New Position:** (4, 16).\n\n2.  **Mover at (7, 9):**\n    *   Near Color 3 (left/center structure).\n    *   Direction: **North-West**.\n    *   Path: (7,9) $\\rightarrow$ (6,8)[empty] $\\rightarrow$ (5,7)[empty] $\\rightarrow$ (4,6)[Color 3 wall].\n    *   **New Position:** (5, 7).\n\n3.  **Mover at (8, 11):**\n    *   Near Color 3.\n    *   Direction: **North-West**.\n    *   Path: (8,11) $\\rightarrow$ (7,10)[empty] $\\rightarrow$ (6,9)[empty] $\\rightarrow$ (5,8)[empty] $\\rightarrow$ (4,7)[empty] $\\rightarrow$ (3,6)[Color 3 wall].\n    *   **New Position:** (4, 7).\n\n4.  **Mover at (8, 18):**\n    *   Inside Color 6 structure.\n    *   Direction: **North**.\n    *   Path: Moves up all the way to row 2. Cell (1,18) is color 6.\n    *   **New Position:** (2, 18).\n\n5.  **Mover at (13, 6):**\n    *   Inside Color 3 structure.\n    *   Direction: **North-West**.\n    *   Path: (13,6) $\\rightarrow$ (12,5)[empty] $\\rightarrow$ (11,4)[Color 3 wall].\n    *   **New Position:** (12, 5).\n\n6.  **Mover at (14, 6):**\n    *   Inside Color 3 structure.\n    *   Direction: **North-West**.\n    *   Path: (14,6) $\\rightarrow$ (13,5)[empty] $\\rightarrow$ (12,4)[Color 3 wall].\n    *   **New Position:** (13, 5).\n\n7.  **Mover at (17, 5):**\n    *   Inside Color 3 structure.\n    *   Direction: **North-West**.\n    *   Path: (17,5) $\\rightarrow$ (16,4)[0] $\\rightarrow$ (15,3)[0] $\\rightarrow$ (14,2)[0] $\\rightarrow$ (13,1)[0] $\\rightarrow$ (12,0)[0] $\\rightarrow$ (11,-1)[Grid Edge].\n    *   **New Position:** (12, 0).\n\n**4.

                "response": "**Analysis and Ranking of ARC Puzzle Solutions**\n\nAlright, let's dive into these solutions. The task is to audit nine different attempts at solving this ARC puzzle.  We're dealing with 20x20 grids, containers, instruction keys, and agents that need to move according to specific rules.  The core idea is that agents (yellow pixels) move within containers, and the direction is determined by a vector from the centroid of blue pixels (1) to the centroid of red pixels (2) within the container's corresponding key.\n\n**Here's the breakdown, after careful analysis:**\n\n*   **Candidates 0 & 2 (Gold Standard):** Both are essentially perfect and identical in terms of the results. The 4s land in the correct positions. I have carefully audited the grids, ensuring the locations of the agents align with the solutions.\n    *   **Candidate 0:** Follows the logic that the 1's represent the body and the 2's represent the head of a direction key, which is heuristic and is a good starting point.\n    *   **Candidate 2:**  Uses the more rigorous method of a vector calculated from the centroid of blue (1) to red (2), which I prefer, as it is much more generalizable to any container pattern.\n\n*   **Candidate 8 (Silver):** The logic is 100% correct, meaning it uses the correct \"vector\" approach to determine the directions. There is, however, a serious parsing error (hallucination) in the grid, leading to the yellow pixel moving to the incorrect position (12, 0).\n*   **Candidate 4 (Silver):** Mostly correct. But has a clear physics error. This solution incorrectly allows the agent to move through a wall, and stops after moving through it.\n*   **Candidates 6 & 3 (Bronze):** These candidates had logic failures, failing to recognize that the key direction can be at an angle (diagonal) and must follow this direction.\n*   **Candidates 1, 5, 7 (Invalid):** The core logic is severely flawed. It moves towards the wrong template and logic is not consistent with the rule.\n\n**To Summarize the ranking with more detail:**\n\n1.  **Candidate 2 (Gold)** The mathematically sound approach, calculating centroids to dictate movement direction. Has a robust model that can be applied in different situations.\n2.  **Candidate 0 (Gold)**  The pattern-based approach, which correctly identifies and uses these patterns for the 6 containers.\n3.  **Candidate 8 (Silver)**  Correct logic, but a significant execution error due to a misread on the grid.\n4.  **Candidate 4 (Silver)**  Correct logic, but a significant execution error due to the agent incorrectly moving through a wall.\n5.  **Candidate 6 (Bronze)**  Flawed logic due to the non-detection of the diagonal angle for the key.\n6.  **Candidate 3 (Bronze)**  Similar to 6, a flawed diagonal angle for the key.\n7.  **Candidate 1, 5, 7 (Invalid)**  The logic is incorrect, making them invalid as solutions.\n\n\n<AUDIT_LOG>\n**PHASE 1: LOGIC SELECTION & CRYSTALLIZATION**\n\n**Candidate 2 (Reasoning Model B & J):**\n- **Logic:** The \"Key\" (rectangular blocks of specific colors) defines movement vectors.\n- **Algorithm:**\n  1. Identify \"Keys\" (blocks containing 1s and 2s).\n  2. For each Key, calculate the centroid of 1s (Blue) and the centroid of 2s (Red).\n  3. The Movement Vector is `Centroid(2) - Centroid(1)`.\n  4.

Move each Agent in the calculated direction until it hits a non-zero pixel (wall) or grid boundary.\n- **Crystallized Rule:** `Vector = Centroid(Red) - Centroid(Blue)`. Slide Yellow pixels in that direction until collision.\n\n**Candidate 0 (Reasoning Model A):**\n- **Logic:** Similar to Candidate 2, but framed as \"Gravity\" or \"Wind\" based on 1s (body) and 2s (head) of an arrow.\n- **Algorithm:** Same as above.\n\n**Candidate 8 (Reasoning Model A):**\n- **Logic:** Same as above (Vector from 1-centroid to 2-centroid).\n- **Execution:** Attempted to apply this to the test input.\n\n**PHASE 2: THE GROUND TRUTH AUDIT**\n\n**Testing the \"Centroid Vector\" Rule (Candidates 0, 2, 4, 8):**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   *Orange Key (Top-Left):* 1s on left, 2 on right.

Decomposition:**\n\nOkay, here we go. I'm given an ARC task with three examples and a test case, all involving 20x20 grids filled with digits 0-9. My job is to find the pattern by which the input grid is transformed to the output grid. The first thing I'll do is break the problem into smaller, manageable chunks. I'll need to analyze each example individually, looking for similarities, differences, and any recurring motifs. I know from my experience that it's often useful to think of the grid as having \"objects\" or \"agents\". So, let's start by looking at those shapes and the digit '4'.\n\n**Analyzing Example 1: Object Identification and Movement:**\n\nThe input grid has objects that seem to be \"containers\" or \"enclosures,\" mainly made up of 5s and 7s. Digits inside seem to define keys. I'm seeing that the 4s in the input, which I'll call agents, shift their positions in the output. This seems like a key behavior I need to understand.\n\n**Pattern Hunting: Movement, Directionality, and the Keys:**\n\nI'm noticing that the '4's are moving in a particular direction. For example, some moved right and some moved left. But, there seems to be a connection between what color enclosure it is in, and which direction it moves. The 'keys' at the top-left also seem relevant. I suspect they're somehow linked to the direction of movement.\n\n**Key Exploration: Decoding the Directionality:**\n\nFocusing on the keys, each appears to be a 5x5 block of a color (5 or 7 in this example) that defines direction. 1s and 2s appear within those blocks. I think these numbers might represent movement vectors somehow. I noticed that 1 = Blue and 2 = Red is the typical pattern in this kind of ARC. It's time to start interpreting the key as a direction, and the '2' as the head of an arrow.\n\n**Uncovering the Rule: Gravity and Walls:**\n\nI think the key is linked to gravity or a \"wind\" affecting the 4s. The '1's could be the body, and the '2's the head of an arrow. In the 7-enclosure key, the '1 1 2' suggests that the agent moves right. In the 5-enclosure it suggests move left. I also noticed that the agents always move until they hit a wall. In other words, the '4's keep moving in the 'wind' direction until they hit the boundary.\n\n**Extending the Rule: Arrow Head, Arrow Body:**\n\nNow I'm hypothesizing that the '1's represent the body of an arrow and the '2's represent the head. In Example 2 it means an up-right movement. Example 3 has only an up-down movement.\n\n**Test Input Application: Key Identification and Movement:**\n\nAlright, let's test this in the test input. It has color 6 at the top-left, and color 3 in the middle-bottom. I'll examine the Key.\n\n**Key 1 Analysis (Color 6): Upward Gravity:**\n\nThe key has a 2, 1 pattern in a vertical column, which I interpret as an \"Up\" movement direction, from the body (1s) to the head (2).\n\n**Key 2 Analysis (Color 3): Up-Left Gravity:**\n\nThere's no key but a shape instead. The key must be somewhere.\n\n**Rule Application: Enclosure and Obstacles:**\n\nNow I'm going to look for '4's inside enclosures formed by color 6 or color 3. I'll determine the movement direction for each agent based on the key, and then shift that '4' upwards until I hit a wall. In each step, I will need to check the grid to find if the agent's path is free.\n\n**Test Input Solution: Grid Transformation:**\n\nI'm ready to move through the test input grid, row by row. Any 4 inside an enclosure will be moved. I'll move the agents, and record where they go.\n\n**Code Verification:**\nI'm now going through the grid line by line, making sure that each location of a 4 corresponds to one step based on the rules.\n\n**Output Construction and Conclusion:**\n\nI'm constructing the final output grid, placing the '4's in their new positions and filling everything else with the original values. I've finished the transformation, and I am confident in the solution.\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the final positions of the yellow pixels (4) based on their enclosing shapes and a \"key\" that defines the transformation.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Enclosures:** The grid contains regions bounded by specific colors (e.g., 7-colored borders, 5-colored borders). Inside these regions, there are yellow pixels (4).\n2.  **Keys:** For each boundary color, there is a corresponding 5x5 \"key\" block located in the grid (usually at corners). This key contains a pattern of 1s (blue) and 2s (red).\n3.  **Pattern Decoding:**\n    *   In the keys, we observe sequences of `1, 1, 2`.\n    *   The spatial arrangement of this sequence defines a direction vector. The \"arrow\" points from the 1s towards the 2.\n    *   **Example 1 (Color 7):** The key has `1, 1, 2` arranged horizontally left-to-right. Direction: **Right**. The 4s in the 7-enclosure move right until they hit a wall.\n    *   **Example 1 (Color 5):** The key has `2, 1, 1` arranged horizontally left-to-right (which is `1, 1, 2` right-to-left). Direction: **Left**. The 4s in the 5-enclosure move left until they hit a wall.\n    *   **Example 2 (Color 5):** The key has `1, 1, 2` arranged diagonally (top-left to bottom-right). Direction: **Down-Right**.\n    *   **Example 3 (Color 5):** The key has `1, 1, 2` arranged vertically top-to-bottom. Direction: **Down**.\n4.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   Identify the color of the enclosure surrounding a yellow pixel (4).\n    *   Find the key corresponding to that color.\n    *   Determine the direction from the `1, 1, 2` pattern in the key.\n    *   Move the yellow pixel (4) in that direction step-by-step.\n    *   Stop the movement just before the pixel would overwrite a non-zero pixel (a wall). The 4 occupies the last empty (0) cell in the path.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Keys:**\n    *   **Color 6 Key (Top-Left):** Columns 1 and 3 show `2` at row 1, `1` at row 2, `1` at row 3. This corresponds to a `1, 1, 2` sequence pointing **Up**.\n    *   **Color 3 Key (Bottom-Right):** We find patterns like `(19,16)=1`, `(18,15)=1`, `(17,14)=2`. This is a diagonal line pointing **Up-Left**.\n\n2.  **Processing Yellow Pixels (4):**\n    *   **Pixel at (5, 16):** Enclosed by **6**. Direction: **Up**.\n        *   Path: (5,16) -> (4,16).\n        *   (3,16) is a 6 (wall). Stop at **(4, 16)**.\n    *   **Pixel at (7, 9):** Enclosed by **3**. Direction: **Up-Left**.\n        *   Path: (7,9) -> (6,8) -> (5,7) -> (4,6).\n        *   (4,6) is a 3 (wall). Stop at **(5, 7)**.\n    *   **Pixel at (8, 11):** Enclosed by **3**. Direction: **Up-Left**.\n        *   Path: (8,11) -> (7,10) -> (6,9) -> (5,8) -> (4,7) -> (3,6).\n        *   (3,6) is a 3 (wall). Stop at **(4, 7)**.\n    *   **Pixel at (8, 18):** Enclosed by **6**. Direction: **Up**.\n        *   Path: (8,18) -> ... -> (2,18).\n        *   (1,18) is a 6 (wall). Stop at **(2, 18)**.\n    *   **Pixel at (13, 6):** Enclosed by **3**. Direction: **Up-Left**.\n        *   Path: (13,6) -> (12,5) -> (11,4).\n        *   (11,4) is a 3 (wall). Stop at **(12, 5)**.\n    *   **Pixel at (17, 5):** Enclosed by **3**. Direction: **Up-Left**.\n        *   Path: (17,5) -> (16,4) -> (15,3) -> (14,2).\n        *   (14,2) is a 3 (wall). Stop at **(15, 3)**.\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\nWe remove the 4s from their original positions and place them at the calculated destinations.\n\n6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,6,0,4,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,6,6,6,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,4,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,0,6\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6\n      6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,6,0,4,6\n      6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,4,0,0,6\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,0,0,6\n      0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6\n      0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n      0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n      0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,0,6\n      0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n      0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n      0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3\n      0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n      0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3\n      0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"1\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_1_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at the examples, I need to understand how the 4s (markers) move within their enclosing shapes.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1.

I'm being asked to solve an ARC puzzle. The core is a grid of numbers 0-9, and the task is to figure out the transformation from an input grid to an output grid. I'm given three solved examples and a test input. My job is to explain my reasoning, step by step, and generate the final output grid.\n\n**Delving into the Examples:**\n\nThe examples are key. I need to spot a pattern here. The grid is filled with integers representing different colors or objects. There are these \"rooms\" made up of connected components of the same color and some internal patterns. The yellow pixels (4s) seem like the movers. I notice that the yellow pixels move, but the rooms, keys, and other features remain mostly the same. \n\n**First Hypothesis: Displacement Related to \"Keys\"**\n\nI have a suspicion about these \"Key\" blocks.  They seem to be grids within the colored blocks. I see blue (1s) and red (2s) pixels.  In the first example, the yellow dots shift a number of spaces. The key seems to hold the clues. So if I find a mapping between the \u201cKey\u201d structure and the Yellow dot movement, I will have the core of the solution.\n\n**Refining the Hypothesis: Vector Based Movement**\n\nAfter some iterations, it looks like a vector based displacement rule is at play. The direction of a Yellow dot's movement seems to be encoded as a vector in the \"Key\". A red pixel (2) relative to a blue pixel (1) creates a simple pattern. So a relative position of the Red (2) to Blue(1) implies an \u201cAttraction\u201d in that direction. \n\n**Key Characteristics**\n\n1.  Each key is a solid shape filled with its color.\n2.  Each key has a pattern of blues and reds inside.\n3.  Each key has a specific position in the test Input.\n\n**Validating the hypothesis with Example 2**\n\nThe movement in example 2 is diagonal - Down-Right. The key shows a specific positioning of blue and red pixels. Again, I analyze this to derive a vector. Centroid of all blues - Centroid of all Reds. And voila, the vector I get is Down-Right, which matches the direction the Yellow pixel moves. I have a theory!\n\n**Example 3 Consolidation**\n\nThe third example shows vertical down movement, this aligns with the hypothesis. \n\n**Establishing the Rule**\n\nMy rule is now clear:\n\n1.  Find the \"Key\" and its pattern of 1's (Blues) and 2's (Reds).\n2.  Find the Centroid of each of the Blue(1) and Red(2) pixels.\n3.  Subtract the Centroid of Blue(1) from Red(2).\n4.  Movement = The sign or major direction of the vector. The Yellow dots move through their respective colors.\n\n**Test Input**\n\nNow, I'll apply the rule to the test input. There are now two distinct color \u201cRooms\u201d to apply the rules to. I calculate the movement direction for each \u201croom\u201d type. Then, I trace the movement of the yellow pixels based on that vector direction. I make sure to account for walls (non-zero values) in the grid so that the Yellow pixels don't move into them.\n**Test Input Movement**\n\n1.  Magenta moves Up\n2.  Green Moves Up-Left\n\n**Output Grid Construction**\n\nI will now construct the output by shifting the position of the Yellow dots from the input as determined above. The new positions replace the old and the result is the output grid. I am doing a careful reconstruction based on all of the above. Now, it is time to write the output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the transformation rule from the given solved examples and apply it to the test input.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects and Roles**:\n    *   **Containers/Rooms**: The grid contains hollow or irregular shapes made of specific colors (e.g., Orange/7, Gray/5, Magenta/6, Green/3). These act as \"rooms\".\n    *   **Keys**: For each container color, there is a distinct, solid rectangular block of the same color (the \"Key\"). Inside these keys are patterns of Blue (1) and Red (2) pixels.\n    *   **Agents**: Yellow pixels (4) are scattered inside the empty spaces (0s) of the \"rooms\".\n    *   **Task**: The yellow pixels (4) move from their initial positions to new positions within their respective rooms. The other structures (walls, keys) remain unchanged.\n\n2.  **Determine Movement Rules**:\n    *   The movement of the yellow pixels is determined by the \"Key\" corresponding to the color of the room they are in.\n    *   We analyze the internal structure of the Keys (Blue/1 and Red/2 pixels) to find a direction vector.\n    *   **Hypothesis**: The direction is defined by the vector pointing from the **centroid of the Blue pixels (1)** to the **centroid of the Red pixels (2)**.\n    *   **Verification**:\n        *   *Example 1*:\n            *   Orange Key: Blue on left, Red on right. Vector points **Right**. Yellow pixels in Orange rooms move Right until they hit a wall.\n            *   Gray Key: Red on left, Blue on right. Vector points **Left**. Yellow pixels in Gray rooms move Left until they hit a wall.\n        *   *Example 2*:\n            *   Gray Key: Blue cluster centered roughly top-left, Red cluster roughly bottom-right relative to each other. Vector points **Down-Right**. Yellow pixels move diagonally Down-Right until blocked.\n        *   *Example 3*:\n            *   Gray Key: Blue rows above Red row. Vector points **Down**. Yellow pixels move Down until blocked.\n\n3.  **Apply to Test Input**:\n    *   **Magenta (6) Key**: Located at top-left.\n        *   Blue (1) pixels at (2,1), (3,1). Centroid: Row 2.5, Col 1.\n        *   Red (2) pixel at (1,1). Centroid: Row 1, Col 1.\n        *   Vector: From (2.5, 1) to (1, 1) is **UP** (-1.5 rows, 0 cols).\n        *   Rule: Yellow pixels in Magenta rooms move **UP** until blocked.\n    *   **Green (3) Key**: Located at bottom-right.\n        *   Blue (1) pixels at (16,17), (17,15), (17,18), (18,16). Centroid: Row 17, Col 16.5.\n        *   Red (2) pixels at (15,16), (16,14). Centroid: Row 15.5, Col 15.\n        *   Vector: From (17, 16.5) to (15.5, 15) is **UP-LEFT** (-1.5 rows, -1.5 cols).\n        *   Rule: Yellow pixels in Green rooms move **UP-LEFT** (diagonal) until blocked.\n\n4.  **Execute Movement**:\n    *   **Dot 1 at (5, 16)** (Magenta room): Move Up.\n        *   Path: (4,16). (3,16) is a wall (6).\n        *   Final Position: **(4, 16)**.\n    *   **Dot 2 at (7, 9)** (Green room): Move Up-Left.\n        *   Path: (6,8) -> (5,7). (4,6) is a wall (3).\n        *   Final Position: **(5, 7)**.\n    *   **Dot 3 at (8, 11)** (Green room): Move Up-Left.\n        *   Path: (7,10) -> (6,9) -> (5,8) -> (4,7). (3,6) is a wall (3).\n        *   Final Position: **(4, 7)**.\n    *   **Dot 4 at (8, 18)** (Magenta room): Move Up.\n        *   Path: (7,18) -> ... -> (2,18).

I see that there are grids filled with \"rooms\" defined by colored walls. Inside, there are these yellow pixels (color 4) which are the things that need to be moved. The movement seems to be controlled by these \"key panels\" which are basically rectangular areas with a specific border color and a pattern of blue (1) and red (2) pixels.\n\n**Understanding the Movement:**\nThe key is to understand how the patterns within the key panels relate to the movement of the yellow pixels. I'm focusing on three examples to see if I can find a pattern. I think I see a link between the position of the red pixels (2) within the key panel and the direction in which the yellow pixels move.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\nIn the first example, I noticed that in an orange section, the yellow pixels moved right, and in the gray section, the yellow pixels moved left. When I looked closely at the keys, I saw that in the orange key the red pixels were on the right. In the gray key, the red pixels were on the left.\nI hypothesized that the location of the red pixels relative to the blue pixels controls the direction. In the second example, I realized that the keys could be larger than just a small block. I had to look closely at the arrangement of the 1s and 2s inside the 5-box. I found that the pattern inside corresponded to a down-right movement. I then realized, after looking at the movement in the example, that the movement could be diagonal. The yellow pixels moved diagonally down-right.\nI needed to re-evaluate the key panel and figured out that the red pixels, on average, were to the south-east of the blue pixels. I formulated the idea that the direction vector can be calculated from the center of the blue pixels to the center of the red pixels. In the third example, I saw that the direction was down, and the key panel indicated that the direction was down, matching my theory.\n\n**Hypothesis Formulation:**\nI refined my hypothesis into something I can follow:\n1.  **Locate Keys:** Identify these key panels; they are rectangular, they match wall colors in the grid, and are usually in the corners. They have pixels of colors 1 and 2 inside.\n2.  **Determine Direction:** Calculate the direction vector from the centroid of the blue pixels (1s) to the centroid of the red pixels (2s).\n3.  **Apply Movement:** Move each yellow pixel (4) inside an area with the same color walls of its key in the calculated direction. Move it step by step, stopping when it hits a wall.\n\n**Applying to the Test Input:**\nI'm ready to tackle the test input now. First, I will find these key panels. I found that there is a magenta key and a green key, each with unique patterns. The magenta key indicates an Upward movement, and the green key indicates a Up-Left movement.\n\n**Applying the Movement Logic:**\nFor each yellow pixel, I will use its wall to identify which key controls its movement. I will apply the correct direction for each. I need to be careful with paths and make sure the pixels move in parallel.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\nI'm going to carefully double-check all my calculations to make sure the movements are right. I need to make sure the new positions of all the yellow pixels are right and I am not accidentally crossing over walls. Then, I will construct my output grid with the pixels moved accordingly.\n\n\nTo solve this task, we analyze the relationship between the stationary structures (walls and \"key\" panels) and the moving elements (yellow pixels).\n\n**1. Analyzing the Examples:**\n*   **Key Panels:** In each example, there are rectangular blocks made of a specific wall color (orange, gray, magenta, etc.) located in the corners or distinct areas. Inside these blocks, there is a pattern of blue (1) and red (2) pixels.\n*   **Direction Decoding:** The relative position of the red pixels (2) to the blue pixels (1) encodes a movement direction.\n    *   **Example 1:**\n        *   Orange Key (Top-Left): Red pixels are to the *right* of blue pixels. The yellow pixels in the orange room move **Right**.\n        *   Gray Key (Top-Right): Red pixels are to the *left* of blue pixels. The yellow pixels in the gray room move **Left**.\n    *   **Example 2:**\n        *   Gray Key (Top-Right): The center of mass of the red pixels is *down-right* relative to the center of mass of the blue pixels. The yellow pixels move **Down-Right**.\n    *   **Example 3:**\n        *   Gray Key (Top-Right): The red pixels are directly *below* the blue pixels. The yellow pixels move **Down**.\n    *   **General Rule:** Calculate the vector from the centroid (average position) of the blue pixels (1) to the centroid of the red pixels (2). This vector determines the direction of movement for yellow pixels associated with that wall color.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Test Input:**\n*   **Magenta Key (Color 6):** Located in the top-left corner (Rows 0-4, Cols 0-4).\n    *   Blue pixels (1) are at rows 2 and 3. Average row $\\approx 2.5$.\n    *   Red pixels (2) are at row 1. Average row $= 1$.\n    *   Columns are symmetric around the center.\n    *   Direction Vector: From Row 2.5 to Row 1 is **Up**.\n    *   **Action:** Yellow pixels enclosed by Magenta walls move **Up**.\n\n*   **Green Key (Color 3):** Located in the bottom-right corner (Rows 14-19, Cols 13-19).\n    *   Blue pixels (1) are clustered around (Row 17, Col 16.5).\n    *   Red pixels (2) are clustered around (Row 15.5, Col 15).\n    *   Direction Vector: From (17, 16.5) to (15.5, 15) is negative in both row and column. Direction is **Up-Left**.\n    *   **Action:** Yellow pixels enclosed by Green walls move **Up-Left**.\n\n**3. applying the Transformation:**\nWe identify each yellow pixel (4) and move it in its assigned direction until it hits a wall.\n\n*   **Yellow at (5, 16) [Magenta Region]:**\n    *   Direction: Up.\n    *   Path: (5,16) $\\to$ (4,16). Position (3,16) is a wall (6).\n    *   New Position: **(4, 16)**.\n\n*   **Yellow at (8, 18) [Magenta Region]:**\n    *   Direction: Up.\n    *   Path: (8,18) $\\to$ ... $\\to$ (2,18). Position (1,18) is a wall (6).\n    *   New Position: **(2, 18)**.\n\n*   **Yellow at (7, 9) [Green Region]:**\n    *   Direction: Up-Left.\n    *   Path: (7,9) $\\to$ (6,8) $\\to$ (5,7). Position (4,6) is a wall (3).\n    *   New Position: **(5, 7)**.\n\n*   **Yellow at (8, 11) [Green Region]:**\n    *   Direction: Up-Left.\n    *   Path: (8,11) $\\to$ ... $\\to$ (4,7). Position (3,6) is a wall (3).\n    *   New Position: **(4, 7)**.\n\n*   **Yellow at (13, 6) [Green Region]:**\n    *   Direction: Up-Left.\n    *   Path: (13,6) $\\to$ (12,5). Position (11,4) is a wall (3).\n    *   New Position: **(12, 5)**.\n\n*   **Yellow at (17, 5) [Green Region]:**\n    *   Direction: Up-Left.\n    *   Path: (17,5) $\\to$ (16,4) $\\to$ (15,3).

tiles and their directions\nInstruction tiles are the clean rectangles of one \u201cbase\u201d color that contain a few embedded **1** and **2** pixels.  \nFor each tile, compute the centroid (average row/col) of all **1** pixels and of all **2** pixels, then take the direction from the **1-centroid** toward the **2-centroid** (one of the 8 compass directions).\n\n**Tile A (base color 6)**: the 5\u00d75 block at the upper-left (rows 0\u20134, cols 0\u20134).  \nHere the **2** pixels are above the **1** pixels, so the direction is **North**.\n\n**Tile B (base color 3)**: the rectangle at the

Let's break this down. It seems the core of the problem lies in understanding how the input grids are transformed into the output grids. I'm focusing on the examples provided and the test input to identify the underlying pattern.\n\n**Grid Properties and Initial Observations:**\n\n*   All grids are 20x20 in size with values from 0 to 9.\n*   I'm immediately drawn to the distinct \"objects\" or \"frames\" within the grids. These act like containers.\n*   I'm also seeing a pattern with the color yellow (4) pixels in all the examples, so these will be important. They seem to move around.\n\n**Detailed Example Analysis:**\n\n*   In example 1, I see \"control blocks,\" which appear to be the same size and color as the containers, located at the top of the grid.\n*   The \"control blocks\" seem to dictate the yellow pixel transformations. I observe that the \"pattern\" inside the control block has a correspondence to the movement of the yellow pixels within the larger container. If the control block has color 7 (orange) it has a certain value for moving the yellow pixel. The same is true for color 5, which has a different direction.\n*   The movements are relative to the \"container\" shapes. I also notice that the movements tend to involve sliding the yellow pixels until they hit a wall defined by the container's edge.\n\n**Formulating the Hypothesis:**\n\n*   **Hypothesis:** The \"Control Block\" contains a pattern of numbers. In example 1, the pattern is `1, 1, 2` for a color 7 container, which shifts the pixel to the right until it is at a wall. For color 5, the pattern is `2, 1, 1`, and the direction is to the left.\n*   If `2` indicates a target for movement or direction. The '1s' seem like empty space.\n\n**Refinement & Generalization:**\n\n*   The direction isn't exactly straight right or left in the general case.\n*   To get the direction, I can calculate the centroid of the '1's and the centroid of the '2's within the control block. The vector from the centroid of '1' to the centroid of '2' gives the movement direction.\n*   The yellow pixel slides in that calculated direction through empty space until it hits a wall of the container.\n*   Any non-zero value other than 4 acts as a stopping point.\n\n**Applying the Rules to Test Input:**\n\n*   I'll now apply my rules to the Test input, recognizing Magenta (6) and Green (3) as container colors.\n*   For each container color, I locate the control block, calculate the centroids of 1s and 2s, and determine the direction vector, which shows the direction. The yellow pixels are in this shape.\n*   Then I slide each yellow pixel in their container in the calculated direction until it hits any non-zero value, which becomes the destination.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n\n*   I'll create the output grid by making a copy of the input.\n*   Then, I'll remove all the original yellow pixels and replace the new destination positions with yellow pixels. All remaining pixels are left the same.\n\nIn summary, I understand how each colored shape's control block determines how any yellow pixels in that shape are transformed.\n\n\nThe problem involves moving yellow pixels (4) based on instructions embedded within specific \"Control Blocks\" of the same color as the shape containing the yellow pixel.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\n1.  **Object Decomposition:** The grid contains shapes of different colors (e.g., 7, 5, 6, 3). Each shape acts as a container for yellow pixels (4).\n2.  **Control Blocks:** For each color, there is a specific rectangular \"Control Block\" that defines the movement rule for yellow pixels within shapes of that color. These blocks contain a pattern of `1` (Blue) and `2` (Red) pixels.\n    *   **Vector Calculation:** Calculate the centroid (average coordinates) of all `1` pixels ($C_1$) and the centroid of all `2` pixels ($C_2$).\n    *   **Direction:** The movement direction vector $V$ is determined by the vector from the `1`s to the `2`s: $V = C_2 - C_1$.\n3.  **Movement Logic:** Each yellow pixel moves in the direction $V$ through empty space (0) until it is adjacent to a non-zero pixel (a \"wall\"). It stops at the last empty cell before the wall.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Color 6 (Magenta):**\n    *   **Control Block:** The top-left 5x5 block (Rows 0-4, Cols 0-4).\n    *   **Pattern:** `1`s are at rows 2 and 3; `2`s are at row 1.\n    *   **Direction:** The `2`s are above the `1`s. $V$ points **Up**.\n    *   **Application:** Yellow pixels inside Magenta shapes move **Up** until they hit a wall.\n\n*   **Color 3 (Green):**\n    *   **Control Block:** The region in the bottom-right (Rows 14-19, Cols 13-19).\n    *   **Pattern:** `1`s are at the bottom-right ((16,17), (17,15), etc.); `2`s are at the top-left of this cluster ((15,16), (16,14)).\n    *   **Direction:** The `2`s are up and to the left of the `1`s. $V$ points **Up-Left**.\n    *   **Application:** Yellow pixels inside Green shapes move diagonally **Up-Left** until they hit a wall.\n\n**Step-by-Step Moves:**\n\n1.  **Yellow at (5, 16) [Magenta Container]:** Moves Up.\n    *   Path: (4, 16). Next is (3, 16) which is 6 (Wall).\n    *   **New Position: (4, 16)**.\n\n2.  **Yellow at (7, 9) [Green Container]:** Moves Up-Left.\n    *   Path: (6, 8) -> (5, 7) -> (4, 6) -> (3, 5). Next is (2, 4) which is 6 (Wall).\n    *   **New Position: (3, 5)**.\n\n3.  **Yellow at (8, 11) [Green Container]:** Moves Up-Left.\n    *   Path: (7, 10) -> (6, 9) -> (5, 8). Next is (4, 7) which is 3 (Wall).\n    *   **New Position: (5, 8)**.\n\n4.  **Yellow at (8, 18) [Magenta Container]:** Moves Up.\n    *   Path: (7, 18) -> ... -> (2, 18). Next is (1, 18) which is 6 (Wall).\n    *   **New Position: (2, 18)**.\n\n5.  **Yellow at (13, 6) [Green Container]:** Moves Up-Left.\n    *   Path: (12, 5). Next is (11, 4) which is 3 (Wall).\n    *   **New Position: (12, 5)**.\n\n6.  **Yellow at (17, 5) [Green Container]:** Moves Up-Left.\n    *   Path: (16, 4) -> (15, 3). Next is (14, 2) which is 3 (Wall).\n    *   **New Position: (15, 3)**.\n\nAll original yellow pixels are erased, and new ones are placed at the calculated destinations.\n\n6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,6,0,4,6\n6,1,6,1,6,4,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,6,6,6,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,0,4,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,4,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,0,6\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6\n      6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,6,0,4,6\n      6,1,6,1,6,4,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,0,4,0,0,6\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,4,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,0,0,6\n      0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6\n      0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n      0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n      0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,0,6\n      0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n      0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n      0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3\n      0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n      0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3\n      0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"5\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_3_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at this puzzle, I need to understand how 4s (markers) move within enclosed regions.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\nIn each example, there are:\n1.

Larger irregular enclosed regions with the same border colors\n3. 4s placed inside these irregular regions that need to be repositioned\n\n**Key Transformation Rule:**\nThe 4s move within their enclosed regions to be adjacent to the boundary that is **farther** from their current position.

Initially, I observed recurring elements: enclosed shapes, often with single \"yellow\" pixels nestled within. Corner blocks, which I intuitively called \"keys,\" seemed crucial.\n\nExample 1 was the Rosetta Stone. The key, a structured 5x5 grid, held the key to pixel movement. Two colored shapes (orange and gray) each had their own \"gravity.\" Yellow pixels in each loop would \"move\" until hitting a wall. The direction and distance of that movement was encoded in the keys. For example, the Key's placement determined movement direction: Top Left \"Orange\" pushed Right, the Top Right \"Gray\" pushed Left.\n\nI then dissected the Example 1 Keys (1s and 2s) and realized they were essentially directional vectors for moving pixels, the magnitude of the movement encoded in the structure. One `1` equaled one step and a `2` equals 2 steps. The location of the key determined the starting direction of the \"gravity.\"\n\nExample 2 showed diagonal movement, with the same \"move to the wall\" principle. The \"key\" here confirmed this direction. Again, the arrangement of 1s and 2s hinted at a vector, confirming diagonal down-right.\n\nExample 3 solidified the arrow-shaped key-logic. This revealed the principle: an arrow shape on the key defines a movement. The pixel \"falls\" towards the arrow's tail/shaft direction until encountering a \"wall\" of the color shape.\n\nThe test case presented a new challenge: one key for two shapes. Would this create global gravity? After studying the input, I concluded, that key at the top left (magenta) defines a global down \"gravity\" for any pixels not already protected by a wall and any pixel in the corresponding area will move \"up\" until hitting a 0 or other blocking wall.\n\nThe algorithm thus becomes:\n\n1.  Identify all yellow pixels.\n2.  Follow the key's arrow. All the pixels need to follow one path (up).\n3.  Move each pixel in that direction until a blocking wall is hit, in our case the other shaped areas.\n\nFinally, I carefully traced the path of each yellow pixel in the test case, mapping its starting point and final destination. The resulting output grid, with pixels moved \"up\" to the point of collision, should be the answer.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the final positions of yellow pixels (represented by the number `4`) based on a transformation rule derived from the provided examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Rules:**\n1.  **Objects:** The grid contains static structures (loops or shapes) made of colored pixels (e.g., orange `7`, grey `5`, green `3`, magenta `6`).\n2.  **Movable Agents:** The yellow pixels (`4`) are dynamic agents that move through the empty space (`0`).\n3.  **Controller (The Key):** Each puzzle contains a square \"Key\" block, often in a corner. This Key contains a pattern of Blue (`1`) and Red (`2`) pixels.\n    *   The spatial arrangement of the Blue (`1`) and Red (`2`) pixels defines a **direction vector**.\n    *   The vector points from the Blue pixels (\"tail\") towards the Red pixels (\"head\").\n    *   **Example 1:**\n        *   Left Key: `1`s on left, `2` on right. Direction: **Right**.\n        *   Right Key: `2` on left, `1`s on right. Direction: **Left**.\n    *   **Example 2:**\n        *   Key: `1`s in top-left, `2` in bottom-right. Direction: **Down-Right**.\n    *   **Example 3:**\n        *   Key: `1`s in top rows, `2`s in bottom row. Direction: **Down**.\n4.  **Movement Logic:** All yellow pixels (`4`) move in the direction defined by the Key.

I've got three examples and a test input grid to work with.  My task is to move yellow pixels (labeled '4') based on some rules that depend on the surrounding colors and special \"instruction tiles.\" These tiles are rectangular, have a base color and embedded pixels of colors 1 and 2, which seem to indicate a direction of movement for the yellow pixels.\n\nThe problem seems to require: 1) Identifying and analyzing the tiles to determine the movement directions, 2) figuring out how the yellow pixels relate to the tiles and their associated regions, and 3) applying the movement rule (\"slide until collision\").\n\n**Tile Analysis and Direction Derivation**\n\nThe crucial part is the tiles. They are rectangular blocks. I need to figure out how to calculate direction from them. The problem description suggests calculating a vector from the centroid of '1' pixels to the centroid of '2' pixels. I confirmed that with the first example.  The centroid formula is (sum of x coords)/num points, (sum of y coords)/num points. I need to keep this precise, or I will get the directions wrong. It needs to be precise relative to the tile's own coordinate system.\n\n**Association Rules & Movement Logic**\n\nNext, I have to figure out how to assign directions to the yellow pixels (movers).  The prompt says \"nearest base-color region that has a tile\". It seems like each yellow pixel is *inside* a certain region. Since there is only one tile for a color, it seems all the areas that the color encompasses, share the behavior of that tile. In the examples, the yellow pixels are either inside or near a colored shape. The examples suggest that the shape's base color, and its nearest tile, determine the yellow pixel's movement direction.  If the yellow pixels are trapped in cavities defined by colored shapes, the walls seem to block movement. The \"slide until collision\" part seems straightforward. The grid boundaries are also a hard wall.\n\n**Applying the Logic - Test Input**\n\nI will now apply this process to the test input. 1) Identify the instruction tiles. 2) Determine their direction. 3)  For each yellow pixel, find the corresponding color, and move the pixel in the associated direction until a collision occurs. I'll make sure to get the 4s' coordinates correct and keep track of all moves. I'll need to reconstruct the output grid by replacing the original 4s with the new positions. It looks like the original '4' pixels are to be overwritten with '0'. Also, no collisions between 4s!\n\nLet's do this!\n\n\nTo solve this challenge, we first need to understand the function of the different objects in the grid and how they dictate the movement of the yellow (color 4) pixels.\n\n**1. Analyze the Components**\n\n*   **Instruction Tiles:** These are rectangular regions of a specific base color (like 6 or 3) containing a pattern of embedded pixels of colors 1 and 2.\n    *   **Logic:** For each tile, we calculate a movement direction vector from the centroid of the color 1 pixels toward the centroid of the color 2 pixels. This vector aligns with one of the 8 cardinal/intercardinal directions (North, North-East, East, etc.).\n*   **Movers:** These are single pixels of color 4.\n    *   **Logic:** Each mover is associated with the \"nearest\" base-color region that possesses an instruction tile. In practice, movers are usually adjacent to or enclosed by a structure of a specific color. They adopt the movement direction derived from that color's instruction tile.\n*   **Transformation:** Move each color 4 pixel in its assigned direction through empty space (color 0) until it is about to hit a non-zero pixel or the grid boundary. Place the 4 in the last empty cell before the collision.\n\n**2. Analyze the Test Input**\n\n*   **Instruction Tile 1 (Color 6 - Top Left):**\n    *   Located roughly at rows 0-4, cols 0-4.\n    *   **Pattern:** Rows 1-3 contain 1s and 2s.\n        *   1s are in rows 2 and 3. Average Row $\\approx 2.5$.\n        *   2s are in row 1. Average Row $= 1.0$.\n        *   The columns are symmetric for both, so the horizontal component is 0.\n    *   **Vector:** From 1s (Row 2.5) to 2s (Row 1.0) is Up/North.\n    *   **Direction:** **North**.\n\n*   **Instruction Tile 2 (Color 3 - Bottom Right):**\n    *   Located roughly at rows 15-18, cols 13-19.\n    *   **Pattern:**\n        *   1s are generally in the lower/right part of the tile (Rows 16-18, Cols 15-18). Centroid roughly (Row 17, Col 16.5).\n        *   2s are generally in the upper/left part of the tile (Rows 15-16, Cols 14-16). Centroid roughly (Row 15.5, Col 15).\n    *   **Vector:** From 1s to 2s involves decreasing row index (Up/North) and decreasing column index (Left/West).\n    *   **Direction:** **North-West**.\n\n**3. Move the Pixels**\n\nWe identify every color 4 pixel and move it according to the rule of its surrounding/nearest color.\n\n1.  **Mover at (5, 16):**\n    *   Surrounded by Color 6 (right-side structure).\n    *   Direction: **North**.\n    *   Path: Moves up through (4,16).

                "response": "**Audit Summary: ARC Task Candidate Solutions**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with evaluating a handful of solutions for this ARC problem. It's all about moving yellow pixels (4s) around within grids based on these rectangular key regions, each with its own color and some internal patterns of ones and twos.\n\nI dove into a detailed analysis, starting with example inputs. Example 1 showed two containers \u2013 orange and grey \u2013 and their corresponding key blocks. The patterns in the keys suggested horizontal movements: Right for the orange container, Left for the grey. I tracked the movement of the yellow pixels, making sure to account for walls. Then I got stuck on this one pixel in the grey area. It looked like the yellow one moved from (16,7) to (16,13), so I had to trace it. After checking over the example, I saw a pixel move right from 13 to 7, stopping at a wall cell. I was confident I understood what was happening.\n\nI moved on to Example 2. The diagonal arrangement of the keys and the movements of pixels in Example 2 suggested a diagonal movement (South-East), like the other examples. At first, there was some unexpected behavior, and my initial trace was incorrect. But it was only a misread. But it still seemed unclear. I had to step back and re-evaluate, especially regarding the wall behavior, to make sure I had the right interpretation of how the keys dictated the movement. A specific point had a different output point than expected. It turns out that wall behavior may be more complicated. After some testing, it seemed the wall might allow for some sliding movement.\n\nWith the first two examples analyzed, I went through the Test Input. It used different color structures. In the first part of the test data (the Magenta/6 colored region), a pixel had to move up. The second part was the opposite direction. I started listing the various candidate solutions that made various claims about this behavior, including using the direction of the keys, how they moved to the \"other\" object, by using an internal vector math, or a weird ad-hoc rule about the edge of the object. There was a lot of careful reading to do.\n\nI then did a detailed comparison of several of the candidates that seemed the most promising, checking their predictions and looking for discrepancies, and their mathematical interpretations. Many of them were quite similar, but they varied slightly in how they handled those nuanced cases of stopping before a wall and in object detection. After doing these careful line by line comparisons of a small handful of promising models, I finally came to a consensus. There were three very solid candidates, and one I thought was slightly superior. The one I preferred had the best path tracing. However, after careful review, it created a phantom yellow pixel. As I went through them, there were cases of incorrect math or objects that were not there. I have come to the final conclusion, the one I will select as the top choice.\n\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 2,\n      \"score\": 9.0,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"The candidate accurately identifies the core rule: movement vectors are derived from the centroid difference between '1' and '2' pixels in the key blocks.
