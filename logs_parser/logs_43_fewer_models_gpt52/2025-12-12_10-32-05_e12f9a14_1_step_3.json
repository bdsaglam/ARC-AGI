Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**Comprehensive Analysis of the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to tackle an ARC task using examples. Let's break this down systematically. First, I'll need to figure out the underlying logic from the provided examples. The goal here is to identify a consistent pattern that transforms an input grid into an output grid.\n\n**Example 1 Decoded**\n\nThe first example shows a teal background ('8'). Several shapes or objects are present, defined by their internal colors and borders. The key seems to be \"contained\" shapes. My initial thought was that '8's are the container, but it's the background. Non-'8' regions, or objects, are defined by their internal structure: a 4x4 block inside the grid. The object seems to consist of a central, colored, 2x2 square surrounded by a border of a different color. I see those shapes and begin focusing on how their colors are organized. Analyzing the example, I noted the following:\n\n*   **Object 1**: The center is '9' (maroon), bordered by '3' (green).\n*   **Object 2**: The center is '1' (blue), bordered by '3' (green).\n*   **Object 3**: The center is '4' (yellow), bordered by '3' (green).\n*   **Object 4**: The center is '6' (magenta), bordered by '3' (green).\n\nObserving those objects, I'm already looking for those central, inner colored squares, surrounded by a border, which seem to be the basic elements for the transformation.\n\nOkay, let's look at the \"action\" that transforms the image. In the output grid, there's a diagonal \"splash\" or \"X\" pattern radiating from the center of each object. The color of this splash matches the color of the central object. For example, the object that had a maroon color '9', now its output splashes are filled with '9'. It seems like these splashes extend from the corners or the central block in the input. Also, something important, that each splash can interact with the other splash!\n\nNow, let's zoom in on the specific geometric transformation. This seems to go back and forth (diagonally) from the center out. But those diagonal lines don't continue indefinitely; they stop when they hit the edge of the grid, or when they collide with lines from another object. It turns out that when they're about to cross, they just make the diagonal into a vertical line. I'm taking notes on how those objects interact. Now I try to see how to predict that diagonal pattern's boundaries.\n\nI need a concrete definition. \"The center of the object.\" The 2x2 grid, or an approximation of its geometric center. Let's see that geometric center's coordinates.\n\nLet's look at Example 2. It shows other shapes/objects. Example 3 and 4 show other shapes too. Let's try and extract a more general rule.\n\nIt appears that if the bounding box has a complete border (the corners and edges have border values), then we get that \"X\" diagonal splash (from each corner of the inner box). But what happens if the border has gaps? That gets more interesting. Now I see that missing border cells creates streams. These \"Streams\" are the same color as the center of the object. Where do those streams go? They shoot out in the direction of the gap.\n\nNow, if a border is broken on the right, the center color will leak out to the right. If broken at the top, a stream will go up. Those streams will either interact with streams of other objects or the grid's edge.\n\nThis is a key insight. Let's test that theory by using the examples.\n\n**Testing the Theory**\n\nBack to Example 1, object 4. I noted that its bounding box in the input *did* have a break. If a corner or side of the 4x4 bounding box is missing, it creates streams that emanate from those gaps. Now, what does it look like if an object doesn't have complete bounding boxes?\n\nIt's about *holes*! That missing box edge is the leak in the dam, and now the center color streams from there in that direction. And it turns out that stream is affected by the colors or other objects in the grid. What exactly makes that jump is difficult, and I need to come up with a simpler explanation. So, the gap means that there is a diagonal stream, if the box is not complete.\n\nIt appears that streams, and their interactions, are the central concept. So, let me formalize that.\n\n1.  **Identify objects**: 4x4 frame of a border color surrounding a 2x2 center of a different color.\n\n\nTo solve this ARC task, I have analyzed the provided examples and identified the following rules governing the transformation:\n\n1.  **Object Identification**: The grid contains \"objects\" defined by 4x4 bounding boxes. These boxes have a border made of a specific color (e.g., 3, 7, 8) and a 2x2 inner region of a different color (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9). The inner color is the \"active\" color for that object.\n\n2.  **Gap Detection**: I inspect the 12-cell border of each object for \"gaps\". A gap is defined as a cell in the border that is not the border color (usually it is the background color, 0 or 8).\n    *   **Complete Borders**: If a border is complete (no gaps), the object emits diagonal streams of its inner color from all four corners, forming an 'X' shape. (As seen in Example 1, Objects 1 and 2).\n    *   **Incomplete Borders**: If the border has gaps, streams are emitted *only* through those gaps. The direction of the stream depends on the position of the gap:\n        *   **Corner Gaps**: Produce diagonal streams (Top-Left $\\to$ Up-Left, Top-Right $\\to$ Up-Right, etc.).\n        *   **Edge Gaps**: Produce orthogonal streams (Top Edge $\\to$ Up, Bottom Edge $\\to$ Down, Right Edge $\\to$ Right, Left Edge $\\to$ Left).\n\n3.  **Stream Propagation**:\n    *   The gap cell itself is filled with the inner color.\n    *   The stream originates from the cell adjacent to the gap in the determined direction.\n    *   Streams continue in a straight line until they hit the grid boundary or interact with another stream/object.\n\n4.  **Collision/Interaction Logic**:\n    *   If two streams are on a collision course (would occupy the same cell or cross), they interact to avoid overlap.\n    *   Specifically, if a diagonal stream is about to collide with a vertical stream (or another diagonal), it turns **vertical** to run parallel to the obstacle.\n    *   From the analysis of Test Input:\n        *   The Green Top-Right diagonal stream collides with the Yellow Top vertical stream. The Green stream turns Vertical Up.\n        *   The Green Bottom-Right diagonal stream collides with the Yellow Bottom vertical stream. The Green stream turns Vertical Down.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Object 1 (Red 2)**:\n    *   Location: Rows 6-9, Cols 22-25.\n    *   Gaps: Top-Left (6,22), Top-Right (6,25), Bottom-Right (9,25).\n    *   Streams:\n        *   TL $\\to$ Up-Left (Diagonal).\n        *   TR $\\to$ Up-Right (Diagonal).\n        *   BR $\\to$ Down-Right (Diagonal).\n\n*   **Object 2 (Green 3)**:\n    *   Location: Rows 10-13, Cols 4-7.\n    *   Gaps: Top-Left (10,4), Top-Right (10,7), Bottom Edge (13,5), Bottom-Right (13,7).\n    *   Streams:\n        *   TL $\\to$ Up-Left (Diagonal).\n        *   TR $\\to$ Up-Right (Diagonal). *Collision*: Hits Yellow Up stream at Row 5. Turns Vertical Up at Col 11.\n        *   Bottom $\\to$ Down (Vertical).\n        *   BR $\\to$ Down-Right (Diagonal). *Collision*: Hits Yellow Down stream at Row 17. Turns Vertical Down at Col 10.\n\n*   **Object 3 (Yellow 4)**:\n    *   Location: Rows 10-13, Cols 10-13.\n    *   Gaps: Top Edge (10,12), Top-Right (10,13), Bottom Edge (13,11), Bottom-Right (13,13).\n    *   Streams:\n        *   Top $\\to$ Up (Vertical, Col 12).\n        *   TR $\\to$ Up-Right (Diagonal).\n        *   Bottom $\\to$ Down (Vertical, Col 11).\n        *   BR $\\to$ Down-Right (Diagonal).\n\n*   **Object 4 (Orange 7)**:\n    *   Location: Rows 24-27, Cols 23-26.\n    *   Gaps: Top-Right (24,26), Right Edge (26,26), Bottom Edge (27,24).\n    *   Streams:\n        *   TR $\\to$ Up-Right (Diagonal).\n        *   Right $\\to$ Right (Horizontal).\n        *   Bottom $\\to$ Down (Vertical).\n\nThe final grid is constructed by applying these streams and filling the gaps on the input grid.\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,8,8,2,0,0,0,0\n0,1,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,0,0\n3,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,0,0\n3,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,2,0,0,0,0\n3,0,0,0,3,8,8,3,0,0,0,8,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,3,8,0,0,8,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,3,8,0,0,8,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,8,3,0,0,8,4,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,7,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,7,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,7,7,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0",

From each gap, a line of the inner color extends outward:\n   - Corner gaps \u2192 diagonal lines away from shape\n   - Edge gaps (not corners) \u2192 perpendicular lines (horizontal/vertical)\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n\n**Shape 1** (rows 6-9, cols 22-25, inner color 2): Gaps at (6,22) top-left, (6,25) top-right, (9,25) bottom-right \u2192 diagonal lines\n\n**Shape 2** (rows 10-13, cols 4-7, inner color 3): Gaps at (10,4) top-left, (10,7) top-right, (13,5) bottom edge, (13,7) bottom-right \u2192 diagonals and vertical down\n\n**Shape 3** (rows 10-13, cols 10-13, inner color 4): Gaps at (10,10) top-left, (10,13) top-right, (13,10) bottom-left, (13,12) bottom edge \u2192 diagonals and vertical down\n\n**Shape 4** (rows 24-27, cols 23-26, inner color 7): Gaps at (24,26) top-right, (26,26) right edge, (27,24) bottom edge \u2192 diagonal up-right, horizontal right, vertical down\n\n```\n4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,2,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0\n3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,8,8,2,0,0,0,0\n0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,2,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,8,8,3,0,0,4,8,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,3,8,0,0,8,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,3,8,0,0,8,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,8,3,0,0,4,8,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7\n0,4,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,7,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,8,7,7,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,8,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,8,7,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,7,0,0,0,0,0\n```",
