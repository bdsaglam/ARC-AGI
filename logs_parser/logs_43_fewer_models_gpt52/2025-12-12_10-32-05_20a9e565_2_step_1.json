        "Full raw LLM response": "Okay, here\u2019s how I\u2019m thinking about this. The user wants me to tackle an ARC task. The input has big grids with shapes and the output is much smaller. This suggests extracting something. I need to figure out the rules by looking at the examples.\n\n**Initial Analysis & Approach:**\n\n1.  **Grid Dynamics:** Input grids are big and have mostly zeros. Output grids are much smaller. The shapes indicate extraction of some kind, either cropping, summarizing, or finding patterns.\n2.  **Colors & Structure:** The colors are represented by numbers from 0 to 9. The goal is to look at the examples to learn the rules.\n3.  **Example-Based Reasoning:** I'll analyze the patterns in the provided examples to try to find connections between the input and output.\n\n**Example 1 Breakdown:**\n*   **Initial View:** I see a large grid with shapes formed by various colored pixels. The goal is to find relationships between the shape, size, and location of various pixel formations to the resulting output. The output grid looks like it's a cropped or transformed version of the input.\n*   **Grey Pixels & Output Size:** There are grey (5) pixels in the input that seem to form a bounding box. Its dimensions are 3 rows x 6 columns.  The output grid is also 3x6. This is a very strong hint. The grey area defines the area of the output.\n*   **Shape & Color Patterns:** There are colored shapes (Blue, Red, Yellow) arranged in vertical \u201cstrips\u201d or towers in the input. The output grid's values seem to map to the input value to the input area defined by the grey boundary.\n*   **Shape Transformation:** There is a shape (Red) within the grey region. The output looks similar to this shape, but horizontally stretched. The pattern appears to stretch the Red shape.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n\n*   **Grey Region as Frame:** Grey (5) pixels, form a vertical line and appear at the bottom right. The output dimensions are smaller than the grey shape.\n*   **Column Selection:** In the input, there is a repeating pattern of colored rectangles. The output looks like a vertical slice of this pattern. It might be the content in the input at the horizontal column (or area of columns) where the vertical line of gray is located, with reversed order.\n*   **Box as a Selector:** The gray (5) pixels is just a viewfinder. It just points to the area from which to output the image.\n\n**Example 3 Insights:**\n*   **Repeating Patterns and Cropping:** A repeating pattern of shapes is shown. The output is a cropped extract from the shape. The output width is a problem for it isn't in alignment with the width.\n*   **Extracting a Pattern Column:** The pattern repeats horizontally, but the output only shows one column. There is a column, which is found using the grey markers, that the output data is located.\n*   **Box as an Extractor:** Grey box is used to select some shape in the image.\n\n**Key Hypothesis Evolution:**\n*   **Grey Box and Location:** Originally, I thought the grey pixels define a target window size.\n*   The grey boxes act as \u201cviewfinders\u201d or markers that indicate a specific region, or pattern in the input, which is where the output is derived.\n*   **The grey box just locates a shape.**\n\n**Test Input Approach:**\n*   **Two Marker Method:** The test input has two sets of grey pixels, forming a rectangle bounding box. I now believe this is indicating the crop region.\n*   **Box Dimensions:** The rectangle markers define an 8x17 area.\n*   **Pattern Finding & Extraction:** The image contains repeated patterns which are composed of green and red boxes. The pattern fits the box to produce the output.\n*   **Cyclic/Repeating Pattern (Key Insight):** There is a pattern repeating. The Grey Box height matches the pattern height. If the sequence is A-> B, the following one is A again. It\u2019s an easy-to-detect reset. The program's goal is to extract the current \"state\" of this repeating sequence, which can be interpreted based on the \"state\" of the input.\n\n**Final Solution Strategy (Test Input):**\n*   Find the pattern in the data by looking for the repetitions.\n*   Crop the pattern to fit the Grey Box dimensions.\n*   Generate the output based on a 3-frame repeating sequence within the Grey Box.\n\nSo, in essence, I'm interpreting this as a \"copy and transform\" task, where the Grey Box defines *where* and sometimes the *size*, and then you apply a pattern or transformation rule based on the examples.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid into an output grid based on the patterns inferred from the solved examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Example 1:** The input contains a complex pattern and a set of grey pixels (color 5) forming a 3x6 box. The output is a 3x6 grid. The content of the output is a stretched version of the red shape found in the input. The red shape is `2,2,2` / `2,0,0` / `2,2,2`. The output is `2,2,2,2,2,2` / `2,0,0,0,0,0` / `2,2,2,2,2,2`.\n2.  **Example 2:** The input contains a large pattern and grey pixels forming a 15x2 vertical strip. The output is a 14x2 grid containing a specific slice of the pattern found elsewhere in the grid (specifically, columns 14-15 of the pattern). Note that the output height is determined by the grey box height (roughly).\n3.  **Example 3:** The input contains a repeating vertical sequence of shapes (Orange, Red, Green). The grey pixels define a 17x2 vertical strip. The output is a 17x3 grid containing the Orange pattern sequence. The output height matches the grey box. The content is the \"first\" or \"leftmost\" pattern sequence.\n\n**General Rule:**\nThe grey pixels (color 5) define a **target bounding box** (position and dimensions). The task is to fill this bounding box with the \"next\" or \"expected\" iteration of the pattern sequence found in the grid. The pattern typically consists of vertically arranged frames. We need to identify the sequence logic and project the correct frame into the region defined by the grey markers.\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n1.  **Grey Markers:** There are grey pixels (`5`) at `(row 15, col 6)` and `(row 15, col 7)` forming the top-left corner, and at `(row 21, col 22)` and `(row 22, col 22/23)` forming the bottom-right corner.\n    *   **Vertical Span:** Rows 15 to 22. Height = 8.\n    *   **Horizontal Span:** Columns 6 to 22. Width = 17.\n    *   The output grid size should be **8 rows by 17 columns**.\n\n2.  **Pattern Sequence:** Looking at the rows above the grey box (Rows 0-14), we see a sequence of shapes:\n    *   **Frame 1 (Rows 0-7):**\n        *   Rows 0-1: A Green (`3`) hollow square top (`3,3,3,3,3` / `3,0,0,0,3`).\n        *   Row 2: Empty.\n        *   Rows 3-4: A Red (`2`) hollow square top (`2,2,2,2,2` / `2,0,0,0,2`).\n        *   Rows 5-6: Two mixed objects. Left: Green (`3,3,3`/`3,0,2`). Right: Green/Red (`3,3,3`/`2,0,3`).\n        *   Row 7: Empty.\n    *   **Frame 2 (Rows 8-15):**\n        *   Rows 8-9: Green (`3`) hollow square top. (Identical to Frame 1).\n        *   Rows 10-11: Two Red (`2`) objects (`2,2,2` left/right). This is **different** from Frame 1 (which had one central Red object).\n        *   Rows 12-13: Two mixed objects. (Identical to Frame 1).\n        *   Row 14: Empty.\n\n3.  **Prediction (Frame 3):**\n    *   The sequence is Frame 1 -> Frame 2.\n    *   The Green and Mixed objects are constant.\n    *   The Red object changes from a central block (Frame 1) to split blocks (Frame 2).\n    *   The Grey Box covers the region for **Frame 3** (Rows 15-22).\n    *   Assuming an oscillating pattern (Center -> Split -> Center), Frame 3 should be identical to Frame 1.\n\n4.  **Construction:**\n    *   We copy the content of Frame 1 (Rows 0-7) into the output grid.\n    *   We crop the content to the horizontal range defined by the grey box (Columns 6-22).\n\n**Output Grid Generation (8x17):**\n*   **Row 0:** Copy of Input Row 0, Cols 6-22.\n    *   `0,0,0,0,0,0, 3,3,3,3,3, 0,0,0,0,0,0`\n*   **Row 1:** Copy of Input Row 1, Cols 6-22.\n    *   `0,0,0,0,0,0, 3,0,0,0,3, 0,0,0,0,0,0`\n*   **Row 2:** Copy of Input Row 2 (All 0).\n    *   `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n*   **Row 3:** Copy of Input Row 3, Cols 6-22.\n    *   `0,0,0,0,0,0, 2,2,2,2,2, 0,0,0,0,0,0`\n*   **Row 4:** Copy of Input Row 4, Cols 6-22.\n    *   `0,0,0,0,0,0, 2,0,0,0,2, 0,0,0,0,0,0`\n*   **Row 5:** Copy of Input Row 5, Cols 6-22.\n    *   `0,0,0,0, 3,3,3, 0,0,0, 3,3,3, 0,0,0,0`\n*   **Row 6:** Copy of Input Row 6, Cols 6-22.\n    *   `0,0,0,0, 3,0,2, 0,0,0, 2,0,3, 0,0,0,0`\n*   **Row 7:** Copy of Input Row 7 (All 0).\n    *   `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",
