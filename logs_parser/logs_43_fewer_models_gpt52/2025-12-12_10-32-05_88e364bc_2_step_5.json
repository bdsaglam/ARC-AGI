            "Full raw LLM response": "**Solution Strategy: ARC Task Analysis**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task, likely involving a transformation rule based on a few examples. Let's break this down. It seems the core of the problem lies in understanding how the input grids are transformed into the output grids. I'm focusing on the examples provided and the test input to identify the underlying pattern.\n\n**Grid Properties and Initial Observations:**\n\n*   All grids are 20x20 in size with values from 0 to 9.\n*   I'm immediately drawn to the distinct \"objects\" or \"frames\" within the grids. These act like containers.\n*   I'm also seeing a pattern with the color yellow (4) pixels in all the examples, so these will be important. They seem to move around.\n\n**Detailed Example Analysis:**\n\n*   In example 1, I see \"control blocks,\" which appear to be the same size and color as the containers, located at the top of the grid.\n*   The \"control blocks\" seem to dictate the yellow pixel transformations. I observe that the \"pattern\" inside the control block has a correspondence to the movement of the yellow pixels within the larger container. If the control block has color 7 (orange) it has a certain value for moving the yellow pixel. The same is true for color 5, which has a different direction.\n*   The movements are relative to the \"container\" shapes. I also notice that the movements tend to involve sliding the yellow pixels until they hit a wall defined by the container's edge.\n\n**Formulating the Hypothesis:**\n\n*   **Hypothesis:** The \"Control Block\" contains a pattern of numbers. In example 1, the pattern is `1, 1, 2` for a color 7 container, which shifts the pixel to the right until it is at a wall. For color 5, the pattern is `2, 1, 1`, and the direction is to the left.\n*   If `2` indicates a target for movement or direction. The '1s' seem like empty space.\n\n**Refinement & Generalization:**\n\n*   The direction isn't exactly straight right or left in the general case.\n*   To get the direction, I can calculate the centroid of the '1's and the centroid of the '2's within the control block. The vector from the centroid of '1' to the centroid of '2' gives the movement direction.\n*   The yellow pixel slides in that calculated direction through empty space until it hits a wall of the container.\n*   Any non-zero value other than 4 acts as a stopping point.\n\n**Applying the Rules to Test Input:**\n\n*   I'll now apply my rules to the Test input, recognizing Magenta (6) and Green (3) as container colors.\n*   For each container color, I locate the control block, calculate the centroids of 1s and 2s, and determine the direction vector, which shows the direction. The yellow pixels are in this shape.\n*   Then I slide each yellow pixel in their container in the calculated direction until it hits any non-zero value, which becomes the destination.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n\n*   I'll create the output grid by making a copy of the input.\n*   Then, I'll remove all the original yellow pixels and replace the new destination positions with yellow pixels. All remaining pixels are left the same.\n\nIn summary, I understand how each colored shape's control block determines how any yellow pixels in that shape are transformed.\n\n\nThe problem involves moving yellow pixels (4) based on instructions embedded within specific \"Control Blocks\" of the same color as the shape containing the yellow pixel.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\n1.  **Object Decomposition:** The grid contains shapes of different colors (e.g., 7, 5, 6, 3). Each shape acts as a container for yellow pixels (4).\n2.  **Control Blocks:** For each color, there is a specific rectangular \"Control Block\" that defines the movement rule for yellow pixels within shapes of that color. These blocks contain a pattern of `1` (Blue) and `2` (Red) pixels.\n    *   **Vector Calculation:** Calculate the centroid (average coordinates) of all `1` pixels ($C_1$) and the centroid of all `2` pixels ($C_2$).\n    *   **Direction:** The movement direction vector $V$ is determined by the vector from the `1`s to the `2`s: $V = C_2 - C_1$.\n3.  **Movement Logic:** Each yellow pixel moves in the direction $V$ through empty space (0) until it is adjacent to a non-zero pixel (a \"wall\"). It stops at the last empty cell before the wall.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Color 6 (Magenta):**\n    *   **Control Block:** The top-left 5x5 block (Rows 0-4, Cols 0-4).\n    *   **Pattern:** `1`s are at rows 2 and 3; `2`s are at row 1.\n    *   **Direction:** The `2`s are above the `1`s. $V$ points **Up**.\n    *   **Application:** Yellow pixels inside Magenta shapes move **Up** until they hit a wall.\n\n*   **Color 3 (Green):**\n    *   **Control Block:** The region in the bottom-right (Rows 14-19, Cols 13-19).\n    *   **Pattern:** `1`s are at the bottom-right ((16,17), (17,15), etc.); `2`s are at the top-left of this cluster ((15,16), (16,14)).\n    *   **Direction:** The `2`s are up and to the left of the `1`s. $V$ points **Up-Left**.\n    *   **Application:** Yellow pixels inside Green shapes move diagonally **Up-Left** until they hit a wall.\n\n**Step-by-Step Moves:**\n\n1.  **Yellow at (5, 16) [Magenta Container]:** Moves Up.\n    *   Path: (4, 16).

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this puzzle, I need to understand how 4s (markers) move within enclosed regions.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\nIn each example, there are:\n1. Template patterns (small rectangles with colored borders containing 1s and 2s)\n2. Larger irregular enclosed regions with the same border colors\n3. 4s placed inside these irregular regions that need to be repositioned\n\n**Key Transformation Rule:**\nThe 4s move within their enclosed regions to be adjacent to the boundary that is **farther** from their current position. In other words:\n- If a 4 is closer to the left boundary, it moves to be adjacent to the right boundary\n- If a 4 is closer to the right boundary, it moves to be adjacent to the left boundary\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\nI identified these 4s and their enclosed regions:\n\n1. **4 at (5,16)** in 6-bounded region: Interior cols 15-18. Distance to 15 is 1, to 18 is 2. Closer to left \u2192 moves to col 18 \u2192 **(5,18)**\n\n2. **4 at (7,9)** in 3-bounded region: Interior cols 3-12. Distance to 3 is 6, to 12 is 3.

Closer to right \u2192 moves to col 4 \u2192 **(8,4)**\n\n4. **4 at (8,18)** in 6-bounded region: Interior cols 17-18. At col 18, move to col 17 \u2192 **(8,17)**\n\n5. **4 at (13,6)** in lower 3-bounded region: Interior cols 5-9. Distance to 5 is 1, to 9 is 3. Closer to left \u2192 moves to col 9 \u2192 **(13,9)**\n\n6. **4 at (17,5)** in lower 3-bounded region: Interior cols 4-8. Distance to 4 is 1, to 8 is 3.

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Decoding the ARC Grid: A Journey Through Visual Logic**\n\nMy task is to decipher the rules governing pixel transformations within these grids, armed with examples and a test case. Initially, I observed recurring elements: enclosed shapes, often with single \"yellow\" pixels nestled within. Corner blocks, which I intuitively called \"keys,\" seemed crucial.\n\nExample 1 was the Rosetta Stone. The key, a structured 5x5 grid, held the key to pixel movement. Two colored shapes (orange and gray) each had their own \"gravity.\" Yellow pixels in each loop would \"move\" until hitting a wall. The direction and distance of that movement was encoded in the keys. For example, the Key's placement determined movement direction: Top Left \"Orange\" pushed Right, the Top Right \"Gray\" pushed Left.\n\nI then dissected the Example 1 Keys (1s and 2s) and realized they were essentially directional vectors for moving pixels, the magnitude of the movement encoded in the structure. One `1` equaled one step and a `2` equals 2 steps. The location of the key determined the starting direction of the \"gravity.\"\n\nExample 2 showed diagonal movement, with the same \"move to the wall\" principle. The \"key\" here confirmed this direction. Again, the arrangement of 1s and 2s hinted at a vector, confirming diagonal down-right.\n\nExample 3 solidified the arrow-shaped key-logic. This revealed the principle: an arrow shape on the key defines a movement. The pixel \"falls\" towards the arrow's tail/shaft direction until encountering a \"wall\" of the color shape.\n\nThe test case presented a new challenge: one key for two shapes. Would this create global gravity? After studying the input, I concluded, that key at the top left (magenta) defines a global down \"gravity\" for any pixels not already protected by a wall and any pixel in the corresponding area will move \"up\" until hitting a 0 or other blocking wall.\n\nThe algorithm thus becomes:\n\n1.  Identify all yellow pixels.\n2.  Follow the key's arrow. All the pixels need to follow one path (up).\n3.  Move each pixel in that direction until a blocking wall is hit, in our case the other shaped areas.\n\nFinally, I carefully traced the path of each yellow pixel in the test case, mapping its starting point and final destination. The resulting output grid, with pixels moved \"up\" to the point of collision, should be the answer.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the final positions of yellow pixels (represented by the number `4`) based on a transformation rule derived from the provided examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Rules:**\n1.  **Objects:** The grid contains static structures (loops or shapes) made of colored pixels (e.g., orange `7`, grey `5`, green `3`, magenta `6`).\n2.  **Movable Agents:** The yellow pixels (`4`) are dynamic agents that move through the empty space (`0`).\n3.  **Controller (The Key):** Each puzzle contains a square \"Key\" block, often in a corner. This Key contains a pattern of Blue (`1`) and Red (`2`) pixels.\n    *   The spatial arrangement of the Blue (`1`) and Red (`2`) pixels defines a **direction vector**.\n    *   The vector points from the Blue pixels (\"tail\") towards the Red pixels (\"head\").\n    *   **Example 1:**\n        *   Left Key: `1`s on left, `2` on right. Direction: **Right**.\n        *   Right Key: `2` on left, `1`s on right. Direction: **Left**.\n    *   **Example 2:**\n        *   Key: `1`s in top-left, `2` in bottom-right. Direction: **Down-Right**.\n    *   **Example 3:**\n        *   Key: `1`s in top rows, `2`s in bottom row. Direction: **Down**.\n4.  **Movement Logic:** All yellow pixels (`4`) move in the direction defined by the Key. They travel in a straight line until they are blocked by a wall (a non-zero pixel that is part of a static structure). They stop at the last empty cell before the wall.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n1.  **Identify the Key:**\n    *   There is a Magenta (`6`) box in the top-left corner (Rows 0-4, Cols 0-4).\n    *   Content:\n        *   Row 1: `6, 2, 6, 2, 6` (Red `2`s)\n        *   Row 2: `6, 1, 6, 1, 6` (Blue `1`s)\n        *   Row 3: `6, 1, 6, 1, 6` (Blue `1`s)\n    *   **Direction:** The \"tail\" (`1`) is at the bottom (rows 2,3) and the \"head\" (`2`) is at the top (row 1). Therefore, the direction of movement is **UP**.\n\n2.  **Identify Movable Pixels (`4`) and Move Them:**\n    We scan the input grid for `4`s and trace their path upwards until they hit a non-zero pixel.\n\n    *   **Pixel 1:** At `(5, 16)`\n        *   Path Up: `(4, 16)` is `0`. `(3, 16)` is `6` (Magenta Wall).\n        *   **Final Position:** `(4, 16)`\n\n    *   **Pixel 2:** At `(7, 9)`\n        *   Path Up: `(6, 9)` to `(2, 9)` are all `0`. `(1, 9)` is `3` (Green Wall).\n        *   **Final Position:** `(2, 9)`\n\n    *   **Pixel 3:** At `(8, 11)`\n        *   Path Up: `(7, 11)` to `(2, 11)` are all `0`. `(1, 11)` is `3` (Green Wall).\n        *   **Final Position:** `(2, 11)`\n\n    *   **Pixel 4:** At `(8, 18)`\n        *   Path Up: `(7, 18)` to `(2, 18)` are all `0`. `(1, 18)` is `6` (Magenta Wall).\n        *   **Final Position:** `(2, 18)`\n\n    *   **Pixel 5:** At `(13, 6)`\n        *   Path Up: `(12, 6)` and `(11, 6)` are `0`. `(10, 6)` is `3` (Green Wall).\n        *   **Final Position:** `(11, 6)`\n\n    *   **Pixel 6:** At `(18, 5)`\n        *   Path Up: `(17, 5)` to `(11, 5)` are all `0`. `(10, 5)` is `3` (Green Wall).\n        *   **Final Position:** `(11, 5)`\n\n3.  **Construct Output:**\n    Create the output grid by copying the input, removing the original `4`s, and placing `4`s at the calculated final positions.\n\n    *   Add `4` at: `(4, 16)`, `(2, 9)`, `(2, 11)`, `(2, 18)`, `(11, 6)`, `(11, 5)`.\n    *   Remove `4` from: `(5, 16)`, `(7, 9)`, `(8, 11)`, `(8, 18)`, `(13, 6)`, `(18, 5)`.\n\n**Completed Output Grid:**\n6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,4,0,4,0,3,0,0,6,0,4,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,6,6,6,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,0,4,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,0,6\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,3,4,4,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3\n0,0,3,3,0,4,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3",

Each example has template boxes (marked by colors 5, 6, or 7) containing patterns with colors 1 and 2\n2. There are enclosed regions bounded by the same colors as the templates\n3. Yellow markers (4) are scattered inside these enclosed regions\n4. The transformation moves each 4 to be adjacent to the nearest inside corner/boundary of its enclosing region\n\nAnalyzing the movement pattern:\n- The 4s move toward the boundary of their enclosing region\n- They end up adjacent to an inside corner or wall of that boundary\n- The direction is toward the nearest boundary segment\n\nFor the test input:\n- **Blue (6) region** (right side): Contains 4s at (5,16) and (8,18)\n- **Orange (3) region** (center/left): Contains 4s at (7,9), (8,11), (13,6), and (17,5)\n\nCalculating movements:\n- (5,16) \u2192 moves left to (5,15), adjacent to boundary at (5,14)\n- (8,18) \u2192 moves down to (9,18), adjacent to corner at (9,17) and (10,18)\n- (7,9) \u2192 moves right to (7,12), adjacent to boundary at (7,13)\n- (8,11) \u2192 moves right to (8,12), adjacent to boundary at (8,13)\n- (13,6) \u2192 moves left to (13,5), adjacent to boundary at (13,4)\n- (17,5) \u2192 moves left to (17,4), adjacent to boundary at (17,3)\n\n```\n6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,6,0,0,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,6,6,6,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,4,0,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,4,6\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3\n0,0,3,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Yellow single-cell markers are the only elements that change position; walls and corner panels stay fixed.\n* The small blue/red pattern in a corner panel likely encodes a movement direction/instruction.\n* Yellow markers move within black free space and appear constrained by the gray/orange wall structures (suggesting \u201cslide/push until blocked\u201d behavior).\n* When two panels exist (different background colors), they likely control movement separately for corresponding wall-color regions.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this task:**\n\nI'm being asked to solve an ARC puzzle using these examples. I see that there are grids filled with \"rooms\" defined by colored walls. Inside, there are these yellow pixels (color 4) which are the things that need to be moved. The movement seems to be controlled by these \"key panels\" which are basically rectangular areas with a specific border color and a pattern of blue (1) and red (2) pixels.\n\n**Understanding the Movement:**\nThe key is to understand how the patterns within the key panels relate to the movement of the yellow pixels. I'm focusing on three examples to see if I can find a pattern. I think I see a link between the position of the red pixels (2) within the key panel and the direction in which the yellow pixels move.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\nIn the first example, I noticed that in an orange section, the yellow pixels moved right, and in the gray section, the yellow pixels moved left. When I looked closely at the keys, I saw that in the orange key the red pixels were on the right. In the gray key, the red pixels were on the left.\nI hypothesized that the location of the red pixels relative to the blue pixels controls the direction. In the second example, I realized that the keys could be larger than just a small block. I had to look closely at the arrangement of the 1s and 2s inside the 5-box. I found that the pattern inside corresponded to a down-right movement. I then realized, after looking at the movement in the example, that the movement could be diagonal. The yellow pixels moved diagonally down-right.\nI needed to re-evaluate the key panel and figured out that the red pixels, on average, were to the south-east of the blue pixels. I formulated the idea that the direction vector can be calculated from the center of the blue pixels to the center of the red pixels. In the third example, I saw that the direction was down, and the key panel indicated that the direction was down, matching my theory.\n\n**Hypothesis Formulation:**\nI refined my hypothesis into something I can follow:\n1.  **Locate Keys:** Identify these key panels; they are rectangular, they match wall colors in the grid, and are usually in the corners. They have pixels of colors 1 and 2 inside.\n2.  **Determine Direction:** Calculate the direction vector from the centroid of the blue pixels (1s) to the centroid of the red pixels (2s).\n3.  **Apply Movement:** Move each yellow pixel (4) inside an area with the same color walls of its key in the calculated direction. Move it step by step, stopping when it hits a wall.\n\n**Applying to the Test Input:**\nI'm ready to tackle the test input now. First, I will find these key panels. I found that there is a magenta key and a green key, each with unique patterns. The magenta key indicates an Upward movement, and the green key indicates a Up-Left movement.\n\n**Applying the Movement Logic:**\nFor each yellow pixel, I will use its wall to identify which key controls its movement. I will apply the correct direction for each. I need to be careful with paths and make sure the pixels move in parallel.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\nI'm going to carefully double-check all my calculations to make sure the movements are right. I need to make sure the new positions of all the yellow pixels are right and I am not accidentally crossing over walls. Then, I will construct my output grid with the pixels moved accordingly.\n\n\nTo solve this task, we analyze the relationship between the stationary structures (walls and \"key\" panels) and the moving elements (yellow pixels).\n\n**1. Analyzing the Examples:**\n*   **Key Panels:** In each example, there are rectangular blocks made of a specific wall color (orange, gray, magenta, etc.) located in the corners or distinct areas. Inside these blocks, there is a pattern of blue (1) and red (2) pixels.\n*   **Direction Decoding:** The relative position of the red pixels (2) to the blue pixels (1) encodes a movement direction.\n    *   **Example 1:**\n        *   Orange Key (Top-Left): Red pixels are to the *right* of blue pixels. The yellow pixels in the orange room move **Right**.\n        *   Gray Key (Top-Right): Red pixels are to the *left* of blue pixels. The yellow pixels in the gray room move **Left**.\n    *   **Example 2:**\n        *   Gray Key (Top-Right): The center of mass of the red pixels is *down-right* relative to the center of mass of the blue pixels. The yellow pixels move **Down-Right**.\n    *   **Example 3:**\n        *   Gray Key (Top-Right): The red pixels are directly *below* the blue pixels. The yellow pixels move **Down**.\n    *   **General Rule:** Calculate the vector from the centroid (average position) of the blue pixels (1) to the centroid of the red pixels (2). This vector determines the direction of movement for yellow pixels associated with that wall color.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Test Input:**\n*   **Magenta Key (Color 6):** Located in the top-left corner (Rows 0-4, Cols 0-4).\n    *   Blue pixels (1) are at rows 2 and 3. Average row $\\approx 2.5$.\n    *   Red pixels (2) are at row 1. Average row $= 1$.\n    *   Columns are symmetric around the center.\n    *   Direction Vector: From Row 2.5 to Row 1 is **Up**.\n    *   **Action:** Yellow pixels enclosed by Magenta walls move **Up**.\n\n*   **Green Key (Color 3):** Located in the bottom-right corner (Rows 14-19, Cols 13-19).\n    *   Blue pixels (1) are clustered around (Row 17, Col 16.5).\n    *   Red pixels (2) are clustered around (Row 15.5, Col 15).\n    *   Direction Vector: From (17, 16.5) to (15.5, 15) is negative in both row and column. Direction is **Up-Left**.\n    *   **Action:** Yellow pixels enclosed by Green walls move **Up-Left**.\n\n**3. applying the Transformation:**\nWe identify each yellow pixel (4) and move it in its assigned direction until it hits a wall.\n\n*   **Yellow at (5, 16) [Magenta Region]:**\n    *   Direction: Up.\n    *   Path: (5,16) $\\to$ (4,16). Position (3,16) is a wall (6).\n    *   New Position: **(4, 16)**.\n\n*   **Yellow at (8, 18) [Magenta Region]:**\n    *   Direction: Up.\n    *   Path: (8,18) $\\to$ ... $\\to$ (2,18). Position (1,18) is a wall (6).\n    *   New Position: **(2, 18)**.\n\n*   **Yellow at (7, 9) [Green Region]:**\n    *   Direction: Up-Left.\n    *   Path: (7,9) $\\to$ (6,8) $\\to$ (5,7). Position (4,6) is a wall (3).\n    *   New Position: **(5, 7)**.\n\n*   **Yellow at (8, 11) [Green Region]:**\n    *   Direction: Up-Left.\n    *   Path: (8,11) $\\to$ ... $\\to$ (4,7).

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Yellow single-cell markers are the only elements that change position; walls and corner panels stay fixed.\n* The small blue/red pattern in a corner panel likely encodes a movement direction/instruction.\n* Yellow markers move within black free space and appear constrained by the gray/orange wall structures (suggesting \u201cslide/push until blocked\u201d behavior).\n* When two panels exist (different background colors), they likely control movement separately for corresponding wall-color regions.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this puzzle, I need to understand how the yellow (4) markers move based on the corner panel patterns.\n\n## Analysis of Examples\n\n**Pattern Recognition:**\n1. Corner panels contain patterns with 1 (blue) and 2 (red) cells against a colored background\n2. The relative position of 2s compared to 1s indicates movement direction\n3. Yellow markers slide in that direction until hitting a wall of the corresponding color\n\n**Direction Rules:**\n- Example 1: Orange panel has 2 on right \u2192 markers move RIGHT; Gray panel has 2 on left \u2192 markers move LEFT\n- Example 3: Gray panel has 2 below 1s \u2192 markers move DOWN\n- Example 2: Diagonal pattern \u2192 diagonal movement (from 1s toward 2s)\n\n## Test Input Analysis\n\n**Corner Panel 1 (Magenta/6, top-left rows 0-4, cols 0-4):**\n- 2s are at row 1, 1s are at rows 2-3\n- Direction: UP (2s are above 1s)\n\n**Corner Panel 2 (Green/3, bottom-right rows 14-19, cols 13-19):**\n- 2s at positions forming upper-left diagonal\n- 1s are positioned lower-right relative to 2s\n- Direction: UP-LEFT\n\n## Marker Movements\n\n1. **(5,16)** in magenta region \u2192 UP \u2192 stops at **(4,16)** (blocked by wall at row 3)\n2. **(7,9)** in green region \u2192 UP-LEFT \u2192 (6,8)\u2192(5,7)\u2192blocked \u2192 stops at **(5,7)**\n3. **(8,11)** in green region \u2192 UP-LEFT \u2192 (7,10)\u2192(6,9)\u2192(5,8)\u2192(4,7)\u2192blocked \u2192 stops at **(4,7)**\n4. **(8,18)** in magenta region \u2192 UP \u2192 stops at **(2,18)** (blocked by wall at row 1)\n5. **(13,6)** in green region \u2192 UP-LEFT \u2192 (12,5)\u2192blocked \u2192 stops at **(12,5)**\n6. **(17,5)** in green region \u2192 UP-LEFT \u2192 (16,4)\u2192(15,3)\u2192blocked \u2192 stops at **(15,3)**\n\n```\n6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,6,0,4,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,6,6,6,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,0,4,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,0,6\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Yellow single-cell markers are the only elements that change position; walls and corner panels stay fixed.\n* The small blue/red pattern in a corner panel likely encodes a movement direction/instruction.\n* Yellow markers move within black free space and appear constrained by the gray/orange wall structures (suggesting \u201cslide/push until blocked\u201d behavior).\n* When two panels exist (different background colors), they likely control movement separately for corresponding wall-color regions.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "## 1. Describe the observable structures (literal)\n\n### Pair 1 (Input 1 \u2192 Output 1)\n- Background is predominantly **black**.\n- There are two large, thick **wall-like connected components**:\n  - One is **gray**, spanning much of the lower/right area with multiple turns and an internal small square-like enclosure.\n  - One is **orange**, a separate thick path/outline in the upper-left/middle area.\n- There are small \u201cpanel\u201d rectangles in the **top-left** and **top-right** corners:\n  - Top-left panel has **orange** background with small **blue** and **red** blocks arranged in two short horizontal bars.\n  - Top-right panel has **gray** background with small **blue** and **red** blocks arranged similarly.\n- Several **isolated yellow single cells** appear in the black interior spaces near/within the wall structures.\n- From input to output:\n  - The **gray/orange walls** and the **corner panels** appear unchanged.\n  - The **yellow cells change locations** (still isolated singletons).\n\n### Pair 2 (Input 2 \u2192 Output 2)\n- Background is **black**.\n- One large **gray** connected wall/outline forms a closed irregular loop; there is also an **internal gray vertical segment** inside it.\n- A **top-right gray panel** contains a small cluster of **blue** and **red** single cells.\n- There are **two isolated yellow single cells** inside the loop.\n- From input to output:\n  - The **walls** and the **panel** are unchanged.\n  - The **two yellow cells move** to different locations within the interior.\n\n### Pair 3 (Input 3 \u2192 Output 3)\n- Background is **black**.\n- One large **gray** connected wall/outline with an internal **horizontal gray bar** across the middle and a **vertical gray segment** near the bottom center.\n- A **top-right gray panel** contains **two vertical blue-over-red pairs** (two small columns).\n- There are **three isolated yellow single cells** in the interior black space.\n- From input to output:\n  - The **gray structure** and the **panel** are unchanged.\n  - The **yellow cells move** (remain isolated singletons).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identify transformation categories\n\n- **Object movement**: **present** (yellow markers relocate)\n- **Object recoloring**: **absent** (colors appear preserved)\n- **Bordering / outlining**: **absent**\n- **Filling holes or cavities**: **absent**\n- **Removing noise / extracting main shape**: **absent**\n- **Copying / pasting / repositioning**: **maybe** (net effect looks like repositioning; could be interpreted as \u201cmove\u201d)\n- **Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center)**: **present** (small corner panels look like control/instruction objects)\n- **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors**: **maybe** (yellow is rare and is the only color affected)\n- **Size-based filtering or selection**: **absent**\n- **Symmetry or reflection operations**: **absent**\n- **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion**: **absent**\n- **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping**: **absent**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Key non-obvious insights (crucial)\n\n1. **Only the yellow singletons are altered**; all large structural components (gray/orange walls) and the blue/red corner panels stay fixed.\n2. The yellow cells appear to be treated as **movable tokens inside a constrained environment**: they relocate *within* the black spaces bounded by walls, rather than being recolored or duplicated.\n3. The small corner panels (blue/red marks inside a colored box) look like **metadata/instructions**: they persist unchanged and are positioned at a consistent anchor (corners).\n4. In Input 1, there are **two distinct instruction panels with different background colors**, matching the two wall colors (orange vs gray), suggesting the rule can apply **separately per \u201csystem/color\u201d**.\n5. The moved yellow cells remain **single-cell objects** in the output (no merging into blobs), implying a token-like motion rule (slide/shift/snap) rather than drawing/filling.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)\n\nThe task likely interprets the **blue/red mini-pattern in a corner panel as a direction cue** (or motion instruction). Then, it **repositions yellow marker cells inside the black interior** by moving them in that instructed direction until a constraint is met (e.g., hitting a wall/boundary or reaching an extreme position within their compartment). When multiple wall colors and panels exist (as in pair 1), the movement may be **applied separately per wall-color region** using the corresponding panel.\n\n(Alternate plausible family if \u201cslide-until-blocked\u201d is wrong: apply a **fixed translation vector** to all yellow markers, where the vector is derived from the relative placement of blue vs red in the corner panel.)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Checks you would perform when solving\n\n1. **Confirm invariants**: verify gray/orange wall pixels and corner panels are identical input\u2192output; only yellow changes.\n2. **Parse direction from panel**: compute a direction vector from the blue/red arrangement (e.g., red position relative to blue bar/cluster).\n3. **Test motion model**: simulate \u201cpush/gravity\u201d of yellow pixels in that direction within black space, treating wall colors as obstacles; see if output matches \u201cslide until blocked/extreme.\u201d\n4. **Compartment check**: ensure each yellow stays within the same connected component of free space (no wall crossing).\n5. **Multi-panel behavior**: in cases like Input 1, test whether yellow tokens near/inside orange-structured areas follow the orange panel direction while those in gray areas follow the gray panel direction.\n\n---\n\nHINT_START\n* Yellow single-cell markers are the only elements that change position; walls and corner panels stay fixed.\n* The small blue/red pattern in a corner panel likely encodes a movement direction/instruction.\n* Yellow markers move within black free space and appear constrained by the gray/orange wall structures (suggesting \u201cslide/push until blocked\u201d behavior).\n* When two panels exist (different background colors), they likely control movement separately for corresponding wall-color regions.\nHINT_END",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nBackground: color 0. Foreground objects include (1) large single-color connected regions (colors 5/7/6/3) that can be rectangular, bar-like, or irregular polyominoes with possible color-0 holes; (2) patterned rectangular tiles mostly in one color (5/7/6) containing small embedded pixels of colors 1 and 2; (3) small marker objects, especially single-cell color 4 dots (and occasional tiny 1/2 marks).\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nIdentify rectangular instruction tiles (base color + embedded 1/2). For each tile, derive a movement direction from the centroid of 1 pixels toward the centroid of 2 pixels (one of 8 directions). For each 4 marker, choose the direction associated with the nearest base-color region that has a tile (if multiple). Move each 4 through 0 cells in that direction until the next step would hit a non-0 cell; place 4 in the last 0 cell before the collision and set the original 4 cell to 0. All other colors (including 1/2 and large regions) remain unchanged.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Problem Breakdown & Strategy**\n\nOkay, the goal is to solve an ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) task. I've got three examples and a test input grid to work with.  My task is to move yellow pixels (labeled '4') based on some rules that depend on the surrounding colors and special \"instruction tiles.\" These tiles are rectangular, have a base color and embedded pixels of colors 1 and 2, which seem to indicate a direction of movement for the yellow pixels.\n\nThe problem seems to require: 1) Identifying and analyzing the tiles to determine the movement directions, 2) figuring out how the yellow pixels relate to the tiles and their associated regions, and 3) applying the movement rule (\"slide until collision\").\n\n**Tile Analysis and Direction Derivation**\n\nThe crucial part is the tiles. They are rectangular blocks. I need to figure out how to calculate direction from them. The problem description suggests calculating a vector from the centroid of '1' pixels to the centroid of '2' pixels. I confirmed that with the first example.  The centroid formula is (sum of x coords)/num points, (sum of y coords)/num points. I need to keep this precise, or I will get the directions wrong. It needs to be precise relative to the tile's own coordinate system.\n\n**Association Rules & Movement Logic**\n\nNext, I have to figure out how to assign directions to the yellow pixels (movers).  The prompt says \"nearest base-color region that has a tile\". It seems like each yellow pixel is *inside* a certain region. Since there is only one tile for a color, it seems all the areas that the color encompasses, share the behavior of that tile. In the examples, the yellow pixels are either inside or near a colored shape. The examples suggest that the shape's base color, and its nearest tile, determine the yellow pixel's movement direction.  If the yellow pixels are trapped in cavities defined by colored shapes, the walls seem to block movement. The \"slide until collision\" part seems straightforward. The grid boundaries are also a hard wall.\n\n**Applying the Logic - Test Input**\n\nI will now apply this process to the test input. 1) Identify the instruction tiles. 2) Determine their direction. 3)  For each yellow pixel, find the corresponding color, and move the pixel in the associated direction until a collision occurs. I'll make sure to get the 4s' coordinates correct and keep track of all moves. I'll need to reconstruct the output grid by replacing the original 4s with the new positions. It looks like the original '4' pixels are to be overwritten with '0'. Also, no collisions between 4s!\n\nLet's do this!\n\n\nTo solve this challenge, we first need to understand the function of the different objects in the grid and how they dictate the movement of the yellow (color 4) pixels.\n\n**1. Analyze the Components**\n\n*   **Instruction Tiles:** These are rectangular regions of a specific base color (like 6 or 3) containing a pattern of embedded pixels of colors 1 and 2.\n    *   **Logic:** For each tile, we calculate a movement direction vector from the centroid of the color 1 pixels toward the centroid of the color 2 pixels. This vector aligns with one of the 8 cardinal/intercardinal directions (North, North-East, East, etc.).\n*   **Movers:** These are single pixels of color 4.\n    *   **Logic:** Each mover is associated with the \"nearest\" base-color region that possesses an instruction tile. In practice, movers are usually adjacent to or enclosed by a structure of a specific color. They adopt the movement direction derived from that color's instruction tile.\n*   **Transformation:** Move each color 4 pixel in its assigned direction through empty space (color 0) until it is about to hit a non-zero pixel or the grid boundary. Place the 4 in the last empty cell before the collision.\n\n**2. Analyze the Test Input**\n\n*   **Instruction Tile 1 (Color 6 - Top Left):**\n    *   Located roughly at rows 0-4, cols 0-4.\n    *   **Pattern:** Rows 1-3 contain 1s and 2s.\n        *   1s are in rows 2 and 3. Average Row $\\approx 2.5$.\n        *   2s are in row 1. Average Row $= 1.0$.\n        *   The columns are symmetric for both, so the horizontal component is 0.\n    *   **Vector:** From 1s (Row 2.5) to 2s (Row 1.0) is Up/North.\n    *   **Direction:** **North**.\n\n*   **Instruction Tile 2 (Color 3 - Bottom Right):**\n    *   Located roughly at rows 15-18, cols 13-19.\n    *   **Pattern:**\n        *   1s are generally in the lower/right part of the tile (Rows 16-18, Cols 15-18). Centroid roughly (Row 17, Col 16.5).\n        *   2s are generally in the upper/left part of the tile (Rows 15-16, Cols 14-16). Centroid roughly (Row 15.5, Col 15).\n    *   **Vector:** From 1s to 2s involves decreasing row index (Up/North) and decreasing column index (Left/West).\n    *   **Direction:** **North-West**.\n\n**3. Move the Pixels**\n\nWe identify every color 4 pixel and move it according to the rule of its surrounding/nearest color.\n\n1.  **Mover at (5, 16):**\n    *   Surrounded by Color 6 (right-side structure).\n    *   Direction: **North**.\n    *   Path: Moves up through (4,16). Cell (3,16) is color 6 (Wall).\n    *   **New Position:** (4, 16).\n\n2.  **Mover at (7, 9):**\n    *   Near Color 3 (left/center structure).\n    *   Direction: **North-West**.\n    *   Path: (7,9) $\\rightarrow$ (6,8)[empty] $\\rightarrow$ (5,7)[empty] $\\rightarrow$ (4,6)[Color 3 wall].\n    *   **New Position:** (5, 7).\n\n3.  **Mover at (8, 11):**\n    *   Near Color 3.\n    *   Direction: **North-West**.\n    *   Path: (8,11) $\\rightarrow$ (7,10)[empty] $\\rightarrow$ (6,9)[empty] $\\rightarrow$ (5,8)[empty] $\\rightarrow$ (4,7)[empty] $\\rightarrow$ (3,6)[Color 3 wall].\n    *   **New Position:** (4, 7).\n\n4.  **Mover at (8, 18):**\n    *   Inside Color 6 structure.\n    *   Direction: **North**.\n    *   Path: Moves up all the way to row 2. Cell (1,18) is color 6.\n    *   **New Position:** (2, 18).\n\n5.  **Mover at (13, 6):**\n    *   Inside Color 3 structure.\n    *   Direction: **North-West**.\n    *   Path: (13,6) $\\rightarrow$ (12,5)[empty] $\\rightarrow$ (11,4)[Color 3 wall].\n    *   **New Position:** (12, 5).\n\n6.  **Mover at (14, 6):**\n    *   Inside Color 3 structure.\n    *   Direction: **North-West**.\n    *   Path: (14,6) $\\rightarrow$ (13,5)[empty] $\\rightarrow$ (12,4)[Color 3 wall].\n    *   **New Position:** (13, 5).\n\n7.  **Mover at (17, 5):**\n    *   Inside Color 3 structure.\n    *   Direction: **North-West**.\n    *   Path: (17,5) $\\rightarrow$ (16,4)[0] $\\rightarrow$ (15,3)[0] $\\rightarrow$ (14,2)[0] $\\rightarrow$ (13,1)[0] $\\rightarrow$ (12,0)[0] $\\rightarrow$ (11,-1)[Grid Edge].\n    *   **New Position:** (12, 0).\n\n**4. Construct Output**\nWe start with the input grid, clear the original 4s (set them to 0), and place 4s at the calculated new positions.\n\n6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,6,0,4,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,6,6,6,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,0,4,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,0,6\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n4,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nBackground: color 0. Foreground objects include (1) large single-color connected regions (colors 5/7/6/3) that can be rectangular, bar-like, or irregular polyominoes with possible color-0 holes; (2) patterned rectangular tiles mostly in one color (5/7/6) containing small embedded pixels of colors 1 and 2; (3) small marker objects, especially single-cell color 4 dots (and occasional tiny 1/2 marks).\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nIdentify rectangular instruction tiles (base color + embedded 1/2). For each tile, derive a movement direction from the centroid of 1 pixels toward the centroid of 2 pixels (one of 8 directions). For each 4 marker, choose the direction associated with the nearest base-color region that has a tile (if multiple). Move each 4 through 0 cells in that direction until the next step would hit a non-0 cell; place 4 in the last 0 cell before the collision and set the original 4 cell to 0. All other colors (including 1/2 and large regions) remain unchanged.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nBackground: color 0. Foreground objects include (1) large single-color connected regions (colors 5/7/6/3) that can be rectangular, bar-like, or irregular polyominoes with possible color-0 holes; (2) patterned rectangular tiles mostly in one color (5/7/6) containing small embedded pixels of colors 1 and 2; (3) small marker objects, especially single-cell color 4 dots (and occasional tiny 1/2 marks).\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nIdentify rectangular instruction tiles (base color + embedded 1/2). For each tile, derive a movement direction from the centroid of 1 pixels toward the centroid of 2 pixels (one of 8 directions). For each 4 marker, choose the direction associated with the nearest base-color region that has a tile (if multiple). Move each 4 through 0 cells in that direction until the next step would hit a non-0 cell; place 4 in the last 0 cell before the collision and set the original 4 cell to 0.

Set the original 4 cell to 0.\n\nMoves:\n- (5,16) \u2192 (4,16)  (North, blocked by 6 above)\n- (8,18) \u2192 (2,18)  (North, blocked by 6 at row 1 col 18)\n- (7,9)  \u2192 (5,7)   (Northwest, blocked by 3 at (4,6))\n- (8,11) \u2192 (4,7)   (Northwest, blocked by 3 at (3,6))\n- (13,6) \u2192 (12,5)  (Northwest, blocked by 3 at (11,4))\n- (17,5) \u2192 (15,3)  (Northwest, blocked by 3 at (14,2))\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,6,0,4,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,6,6,6,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,0,4,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,0,6\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3",

Objects Description\nBackground: color 0. Foreground objects include (1) large single-color connected regions (colors 5/7/6/3) that can be rectangular, bar-like, or irregular polyominoes with possible color-0 holes; (2) patterned rectangular tiles mostly in one color (5/7/6) containing small embedded pixels of colors 1 and 2; (3) small marker objects, especially single-cell color 4 dots (and occasional tiny 1/2 marks).",
                "response": "### Observed object types\n- **Background** is `0`.\n- **Large regions** are connected components of a single nonzero color (e.g., `7`, `5`, `6`, `3`).\n- **\u201cInstruction tiles\u201d** are solid rectangular blocks of a base color (e.g., `7` or `5`) that contain a few embedded pixels of `1` and `2`.\n- **Movable markers** are single-cell dots of color `4`.\n\n---\n\n## Transformations identified (all plausible components)\n\n### 1) Detect per-color \u201cinstruction tile(s)\u201d and extract a movement direction\nFor each rectangular tile whose **base color** is a main region color (e.g., `5`, `7`, `6`, `3`) and that contains embedded `1` and `2` pixels:\n\n- Compute a **direction vector** from the `1` pixels toward the `2` pixels.\n  - A robust way consistent with the examples: use the sign of the vector from the **centroid of all `1` cells** to the **centroid of all `2` cells**.\n  - This yields one of the 8 compass directions:  \n    `(-1,0)` up, `(1,0)` down, `(0,-1)` left, `(0,1)` right, and diagonals `(-1,-1)`, `(-1,1)`, `(1,-1)`, `(1,1)`.\n- Each base color can define its **own** direction if multiple tiles of different base colors exist (Example 1 has both `7` and `5` tiles, and they imply different directions).\n\n**Examples of extracted directions from the training pairs**\n- Example 1:\n  - Tile base `7`: direction is toward the side where `2` lies relative to `1` \u2192 movement is **right**.\n  - Tile base `5`: direction is toward the side where `2` lies relative to `1` \u2192 movement is **left**.\n- Example 2:\n  - Tile base `5`: `2` is down-right of the `1` cluster \u2192 movement is **down-right**.\n- Example 3:\n  - Tile base `5`: `2` is below the `1` cluster \u2192 movement is **down**.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Assign each `4` marker to one of the base-color directions (when multiple exist)\nWhen multiple instruction tiles exist (different base colors), each `4` dot must choose which direction to follow. The examples are consistent with:\n\n- **Nearest-base-color assignment:**  \n  Assign each `4` to the direction associated with the **closest** large region color that has an instruction tile (distance measured in Manhattan steps from the `4` to the nearest cell of that base color).\n\n(Equivalent phrasing that also fits: the `4` behaves as belonging to the dominant/closest surrounding nonzero region color, then uses that color\u2019s tile-defined direction.)\n\n---\n\n### 3) Move (translate) each `4` along the chosen direction until blocked\nFor each `4` marker:\n\n- Move it step-by-step through `0` cells in its assigned direction.\n- Stop when the *next* step would enter a **non-`0`** cell (typically a cell of the associated large region color).\n- Place the `4` in the **last valid `0` cell before the collision** (so it ends up **adjacent** to the blocking non-`0` cell).\n- Set the marker\u2019s **original** position to `0` (the marker is moved, not copied).\n\nThis matches:\n- Example 1: `4` dots slide **horizontally** (left or right depending on whether they follow the `5`-tile or `7`-tile direction) until they sit just next to a `5` or `7` cell.\n- Example 2: both `4` dots slide **down-right** until the next down-right cell is `5`.\n- Example 3: `4` dots slide **down** until the cell below is `5`.\n\n---\n\n### 4) Preserve all other pixels and objects\n- All large regions (`5`, `7`, etc.) remain unchanged.\n- Embedded `1` and `2` pixels in the instruction tiles remain unchanged.\n- Only `4` positions change (old `4` \u2192 `0`, new position `0` \u2192 `4`).\n\n---\n\n### 5) (Low-confidence / formatting-dependent) Possible grid-size change\n- If Example 3\u2019s provided output truly has fewer rows than its input, an additional transformation could be **row deletion/compression** after (or unrelated to) moving `4` markers.\n- This is not supported by Examples 1\u20132 (which keep size), so treat as **uncertain** unless confirmed by consistent sizing.\n\n---\n\n<transformation_summary>\nIdentify rectangular instruction tiles (base color + embedded 1/2). For each tile, derive a movement direction from the centroid of 1 pixels toward the centroid of 2 pixels (one of 8 directions). For each 4 marker, choose the direction associated with the nearest base-color region that has a tile (if multiple). Move each 4 through 0 cells in that direction until the next step would hit a non-0 cell; place 4 in the last 0 cell before the collision and set the original 4 cell to 0.

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nBackground: color 0. Foreground objects include (1) large single-color connected regions (colors 5/7/6/3) that can be rectangular, bar-like, or irregular polyominoes with possible color-0 holes; (2) patterned rectangular tiles mostly in one color (5/7/6) containing small embedded pixels of colors 1 and 2; (3) small marker objects, especially single-cell color 4 dots (and occasional tiny 1/2 marks).\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nIdentify rectangular instruction tiles (base color + embedded 1/2). For each tile, derive a movement direction from the centroid of 1 pixels toward the centroid of 2 pixels (one of 8 directions). For each 4 marker, choose the direction associated with the nearest base-color region that has a tile (if multiple). Move each 4 through 0 cells in that direction until the next step would hit a non-0 cell; place 4 in the last 0 cell before the collision and set the original 4 cell to 0. All other colors (including 1/2 and large regions) remain unchanged.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
