            "Full raw LLM response": "**The ARC task seems to require a deep dive into the manipulation of shapes and their spatial relationships.** I'm analyzing a series of examples, and I've found a consistent pattern: the user presents a grid of various colored shapes, but the real key lies in the central structure and the distant objects.\n\nFirst, I identified this \"frame,\" a central region that seems to act as a skeleton or a target. It's defined by these 2-pixel bars of different colors along each side. Then I recognized the \"source objects\" \u2013 these larger shapes scattered across the grid. Now, I see that the game is about connecting these source objects to the central frame.\n\nThe central concept here involves the \"Rotation\" idea that I'm formulating from the previous inputs. I have to rotate the source object by 90 CW (unless certain exceptions apply, like with Yellow). The frame interface side is used as the orientation determinant. After rotation, the goal is to align the source object's interface to match the frame. The mapping is precise - the 2-pixel segment of S matches with the frame's interface. \n\nThe most complex part is to trace how the mapping works - for a long time I was looking at individual shape dimensions, but now I know that it doesn't matter what is in the other side of the frame, I am only interested in making sure I understand the dimensions and make the proper adjustment. \n\nThe overall structure of the image is based on the frame. If there is a source object for each frame side, then there will be a connection, unless I have to make adjustments due to the rotation constraints.\n\nThe logic is sound. Let's see if the test case verifies it.\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid by identifying a central frame structure and attaching specific \"source\" objects to it.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Central Frame:**\nIn the test input, there is a central rectangular structure composed of 2-pixel bars of different colors:\n- **Top:** Blue `1,1` at Row 11, Cols 14-15.\n- **Bottom:** Magenta `6,6` at Row 14, Cols 14-15.\n- **Left:** Yellow `4` at (12,13) and (13,13).\n- **Right:** Red `2` at (12,16) and (13,16).\n\nThis frame defines the target locations for objects of the corresponding colors.\n\n**2. Identification and Transformation of Source Objects:**\nWe identify \"source\" objects scattered in the grid for each color and apply the transformation rule derived from the examples: **Rotate the object (90\u00b0 steps) until it presents a 2-pixel flat interface that matches the corresponding frame side.**\n\n*   **Blue Object (Top, Horizontal 1s):**\n    *   **Source:** Located at rows 2-5, cols 17-19. Shape is symmetrical with a single pixel on top/bottom and `111` in middle.\n    *   **Transformation:** Rotating 90\u00b0 Clockwise produces a shape with a 2-pixel wide bottom edge (`.11.`). This matches the horizontal Top frame.\n    *   **Resulting Shape:**\n        ```\n        .11.\n        1111\n        .11.\n        ```\n    *   **Placement:** Aligned so the bottom edge `.11.` sits on the Top frame (Row 11). The shape occupies rows 9-11.\n\n*   **Red Object (Right, Vertical 2s):**\n    *   **Source:** Located at rows 4-7, cols 3-6.\n    *   **Transformation:** Rotating 90\u00b0 Clockwise produces a shape where the left side is `2,2` (rows 0,1), which is a vertical bar of height 2. This matches the vertical Right frame.\n    *   **Resulting Shape:**\n        ```\n        2222\n        222.\n        ....\n        ...2\n        ```\n    *   **Placement:** Aligned so the top-left edge `2,2` attaches to the Right frame (Cols 16, rows 12-13). The shape occupies rows 12-15, extending to the right.\n\n*   **Yellow Object (Left, Vertical 4s):**\n    *   **Source:** Located at rows 15-17, cols 20-23.\n    *   **Transformation:** Rotating 90\u00b0 Counter-Clockwise (270\u00b0 CW) produces a shape where the right side is `4,4` (rows 1,2), a vertical bar of height 2. This matches the vertical Left frame.\n    *   **Resulting Shape:**\n        ```\n        .4.\n        .44\n        .44\n        44.\n        ```\n    *   **Placement:** Aligned so the right edge `4,4` attaches to the Left frame (Cols 13, rows 12-13). The shape occupies rows 11-14, extending to the left.\n\n*   **Magenta Object (Bottom, Horizontal 6s):**\n    *   **Source:** Located at rows 18-23, cols 9-12.\n    *   **Transformation:** Rotating 90\u00b0 Clockwise produces a shape with a 2-pixel wide top edge (`..66..`). This matches the horizontal Bottom frame.\n    *   **Resulting Shape:**\n        ```\n        ..66..\n        ..66..\n        ..66..\n        666666\n        ```\n    *   **Placement:** Aligned so the top edge `6,6` sits on the Bottom frame (Row 14). The shape occupies rows 14-17.\n\n**3. Final Grid Construction:**\nWe clear the background to 8 and place the transformed shapes at their calculated positions.\n\n- **Blue:** Rows 9-11, centered above (11,14)-(11,15).\n- **Yellow:** Rows 11-14, centered left of (12,13)-(13,13).\n- **Red:** Rows 12-15, centered right of (12,16)-(13,16).\n- **Magenta:** Rows 14-17, centered below (14,14)-(14,15).\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Test Input and Algorithm Analysis**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got. The user wants me to crack an ARC puzzle. The focus seems to be on manipulating shapes within a grid. I need to figure out the rules for transforming an input grid into the desired output.\n\nI start by looking at a sample input-output pair (Example 1). I notice the grid size remains consistent. The background color stays the same. The real action is in how objects move and change. I'm seeing clusters of objects and some clear transformations.\n\nI started tracing individual objects - red, magenta, green, blue, yellow shapes. I carefully note their positions in the input grid. I then compare these positions to the output grid. I am trying to see if there is any simple translation or rotation. This approach didn't immediately reveal the core rule.\n\nI shift my perspective and realize there's a smaller \"map\" of sorts within the input grid. It's a cluster of pixels of different colors, a mini-constellation of points. It\u2019s a sort of skeleton that dictates the positions of the other shapes. This \u201cmap\u201d looks like it creates a new target layout in the output grid.\n\nThe output clusters shapes in the same relative arrangement. However, I note that the yellow shape is gone. The two red shapes don't appear in the output. This suggests that the shapes in the \"map\" are the primary building blocks.\n\nI identify some \"Source\" shapes (red, green, yellow). They seem to be used to \"fill in\" the map. These source shapes appear elsewhere in the input grid. Now I need to see how the output shapes are derived from these sources.\n\nNext, I observe that the \"Source\" shapes in the input have different sizes, and the output is a conglomeration of the source shapes. The central map dictates the shapes in the output. The shapes that *appear* in the map are then used to build the output shapes.\n\nI consider the relationship between Source shapes and the output shapes, and their relationship to the Map:\n\n*   **Yellow** appears in input but is *absent* from the map.\n*   **Green** is *both* in the map and present as a large shape.\n*   **Red** is *both* in the map and as a large shape.\n\nThen I look at Example 2. The map is different, but the same mechanics apply. Source shapes are identified. The relative positions and size of shapes changed and I noted that it wasn't a simple translation or copy.\n\n*   The output grid contains a transformed and combined set of the source shapes.\n*   The output shape isn\u2019t a direct copy of the source shape.\n\nNext, I look at Example 3. This leads me to believe the transformation involves rotation of source shapes.\n\n*   **Rule:** The transformation likely rotates each source shape to fit the Map segment. The map segments have a clear orientation: horizontal or vertical.\n\nI look at the Test Input, this gives me the critical insight.\n\nI summarize my findings:\n\n1.  **Identify the \"Map\".** This is a small collection of pixels within the input grid, each assigned a specific color.\n\n2.  **Locate \"Source\" shapes.** Find all the shapes that have the same color as the map pixels.\n\n3.  **Rotation is Key:** It appears we *always* rotate each source shape by 90 degrees clockwise before inserting.\n\n4.  **Placement based on Map:** Use the source shape to fill space that the given map creates.\n\n5.  **Assembly:** In the output grid, position the rotated source shape such that it aligns with, and \"replaces,\" the pixels in the map according to the original layout of the map. No overlap, and you fill with the new shapes.\n\n6.  I predict the test input with this knowledge.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid by identifying \"source\" shapes and a \"map\" layout, and then constructing a composite object in the output. The logic derived from the examples is:\n\n1.  **Identify Components**:\n    *   **Map**: A central cluster of small, typically single-pixel or line-segment structures in the middle of the grid (around rows 8-14). These define the relative positions of the final object's parts.\n    *   **Sources**: Larger shapes of the corresponding colors located elsewhere in the grid.\n2.  **Transformation Rule**:\n    *   For each color present in the Map, locate its Source shape.\n    *   **Rotate** the Source shape **90 degrees clockwise**.\n    *   **Place** the rotated Source shape into the output grid, maintaining the relative topology of the Map.\n    *   Specifically, shapes are shifted outwards from the map's center to tessellate without overlapping, filling the \"slots\" defined by the map.\n        *   Top element moves up.\n        *   Bottom element moves down.\n        *   Left element moves left.\n        *   Right element moves right.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Map Analysis**:\n    *   **Blue (1)**: Top, Row 11, Cols 14-15.\n    *   **Yellow (4)**: Left, Rows 12-13, Col 13.\n    *   **Red (2)**: Right, Rows 12-13, Col 16.\n    *   **Magenta (6)**: Bottom, Row 14, Cols 14-15.\n\n2.  **Source Extraction & Rotation**:\n    *   **Blue (1)**:\n        *   Source: A 4x3 shape (`_ 1 _` / `1 1 1` / `1 1 1` / `_ 1 _`).\n        *   Rotate 90\u00b0 CW: 3x4 shape (`_ 1 1 _` / `1 1 1 1` / `_ 1 1 _`).\n    *   **Yellow (4)**:\n        *   Source: A 3x4 shape (`_ _ 4 _` / `4 4 4 4` / `_ 4 4 _`).\n        *   Rotate 90\u00b0 CW: 4x3 shape (`_ 4 _` / `4 4 _` / `4 4 4` / `_ 4 _`).\n    *   **Red (2)**:\n        *   Source: A 4x4 shape (`2 2` / `2 2` / `2 2` / `2 . . 2` padded).\n        *   Rotate 90\u00b0 CW: 4x4 shape (`2 _ _ _` / `_ 2 2 2` / `_ 2 2 2` / `2 _ _ _`).\n    *   **Magenta (6)**:\n        *   Source: A 6x4 shape (`_ _ 6 _` ... `6 6 6 6` ...).\n        *   Rotate 90\u00b0 CW: 4x6 shape (`_ _ 6 6 _ _` / `_ _ 6 6 _ _` / `6 6 6 6 6 6` / `_ _ 6 6 _ _`).\n\n3.  **Placement**:\n    *   **Blue**: Placed above the center (Rows 8-10), centered horizontally (Cols 13-16).\n    *   **Yellow**: Placed left of center (Cols 10-12), centered vertically (Rows 11-14).\n    *   **Red**: Placed right of center (Cols 17-20), centered vertically (Rows 11-14).\n    *   **Magenta**: Placed below the center (Rows 15-18), centered horizontally (Cols 12-17).\n\n4.  **Construction**:\n    *   Background is filled with 8.\n    *   The shapes are drawn at the calculated coordinates.\n\noutput:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. There's a central \"cross\" structure with 4 colored indicators (top, bottom, left, right)\n2. Scattered around are patterns matching the colors of these indicators\n3. The transformation places each scattered pattern adjacent to its corresponding indicator on the cross\n4. The patterns are rotated 90\u00b0 to align with their placement direction\n5. Non-matching scattered patterns are removed\n\n**Identifying the test input structure:**\n\nCentral cross (rows 10-13, cols 13-16):\n- Top: 1,1 at row 10, cols 14-15\n- Left: 4,4 at rows 11-12, col 13  \n- Right: 2,2 at rows 11-12, col 16\n- Bottom: 6,6 at row 13, cols 14-15\n\nScattered patterns:\n- Color 1 (top): rows 1-4, cols 17-19 (vertical shape)\n- Color 4 (left): rows 14-16, cols 20-23\n- Color 2 (right): rows 3-6, cols 2-5\n- Color 6 (bottom): rows 17-22, cols 9-12 (vertical shape)\n- Color 3: rows 13-15, cols 3-5 (no match - removed)\n\n**Applying transformations:**\n- 1 pattern rotated 90\u00b0 \u2192 placed above top indicator\n- 4 pattern rotated 90\u00b0 CCW \u2192 placed left of left indicator  \n- 2 pattern rotated 90\u00b0 CW \u2192 placed right of right indicator\n- 6 pattern rotated 90\u00b0 \u2192 placed below bottom indicator\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,1,1,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,8,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,8,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,6,6,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Based on the examples, the transformation keeps only the colors that occur together in the central seed region, merges all components of each such color, and forms a single compact symmetric blob for each color. These blobs are arranged relative to their seed positions in a cross-like layout: the leftmost seed\u2019s color becomes the left blob, the rightmost the right blob, the upper seed the top blob, and the lowest seed the bottom blob. The blob sizes match the total pixel counts of each retained color, using simple symmetric patterns. Colors not present in the central seed cluster (here, the isolated 3s) are discarded, and the rest of the grid is left as background.\n\nApplying this to the test input, the retained colors are 1, 2, 4, and 6. They are arranged around the central seed area, with symmetric shapes sized to their total counts, and all other cells set to 8.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,6,6,6,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Task Deciphered: ARC Grid Transformations**\n\nOkay, here's the deal: I'm supposed to take these weird grid inputs, filled with colored shapes, and rearrange them into a specific output. The core of this transformation is a central \"dock\" or \"hub\" made of four different colored pieces, forming a sort of hollow square. Around this hub are other colored shapes that seem to be \"plugs\" that should attach to the hub in specific spots.\n\n**Breaking Down Example 1:**\n-   I see a light blue background (color 8). The main feature is this hub - a hollow square-ish shape in the middle, and the shapes are arranged around it.\n-   The \"hub\" is like a dock with each side being a different color (Magenta, Red, Green, Blue). I named the shapes as \"plugs\".\n\n-   Each example has the same basic setup: a colored background, a central hub, and some external shapes.\n-   In the output, the shapes don't just appear randomly. They *connect* to the hub. It's like the hub is a socket and the shapes are plugs. Each color of the hub seems to correspond to a shape color.\n\n**The Connection Rule:**\n\nThe key to this is that only shapes with a color that *matches* one of the hub's sides actually attach. Shapes with colors that don't correspond to any hub side simply disappear.\n-   Matching colors \"snap\" together?\n-   The shapes seem to have a concavity or a socket that perfectly fits the hub's \"plug\" (the colored bars).\n-   The matching shapes move to connect to the hub and the non matching shapes disappear.\n-   The movement is a translation *and* sometimes a rotation.\n\n**Analyzing Example 2 & 3:**\n-   In Example 2, this is confirmed. The shapes fit into the hub if the colors match.\n-   In example 3, I noticed that the shape can rotate to make this a better fit.\n-   Example 3: the blue and green pieces match perfectly. However, the shapes are solid rectangles/squares that get \"attached\".\n-   The Shapes can rotate or translate. Rotation can be a 90 or 180 degrees transformation.\n-   They rotated to connect \"to a matching face\" rather than slotting in.\n-   Rotation seems driven by matching the width or height of the plug and socket, making for a perfect fit.\n\n**Building the Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Hub:** First, I need to pinpoint that central hub structure. It\u2019s the fixed reference point.\n2.  **Find the Shapes:** Then I\u2019ll identify the separate, loose shapes around it.\n3.  **Filtering:** Eliminate shapes that don\u2019t have a matching color with the hub. Those are useless.\n4.  **Transformation:** For the matching shapes:\n    *   **Move:** Translate the shape to the corresponding hub side.\n    *   **Rotate:** Rotate the shape if needed so that its dimensions match the hub's plug to get a perfect connection.\n\n**Applying to the Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Find Hub:** Scanning the test input grid, I see the hub components and extract the color and the location.\n    *   Top (Blue)\n    *   Bottom (Magenta)\n    *   Left (Yellow)\n    *   Right (Red)\n2.  **Find Shapes:** Identifying the surrounding shapes.\n    *   **Shape 1:** Blue (Matches Top). I see it, now in a C shape.\n    *   **Shape 2:** Red (Matches Right). The shape with a socket.\n    *   **Shape 3:** Green (Doesn't match any side: Discarded).\n    *   **Shape 4:** Yellow (Matches Left).\n    *   **Shape 5:** Magenta (Matches Bottom).\n3.  **Applying the Transformation Rules:**\n    *   **Blue:** I analyze this. Should connect at the Top Side. So this means moving the piece to the Top part. Shape: It has a horizontal 'plug'. Needs to be on the top of the hub.\n    *   **Red:** Needs to attach to the Right. Rotating the Red Shape to the right. The original socket needs to face left to grab the bar, it must rotate.\n    *   **Yellow:** I perform a similar transformation to the Yellow shape so it matches.\n    *   **Magenta:** I now adjust, and rotate the shapes to fit!\n\n4.  **Creating the Output:** I start with a blank grid (color 8). I draw the fixed hub first. Then place the shapes at their calculated locations based on the transformations and final placement!\n5.  **Final Verification:**\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid containing several colored shapes and a central \"Hub\" or \"Dock\". The Hub is a structure composed of four short bars of different colors (Blue, Red, Green, Yellow, etc.) surrounding a 2x2 central area.\n\n**Rules inferred from examples:**\n1.  **Identify the Hub:** Locate the central assembly. It has four connection points (Top, Bottom, Left, Right), each with a specific color and orientation (Horizontal or Vertical).\n2.  **Identify Shapes:** Locate the other scattered shapes in the grid.\n3.  **Match and Filter:** Match each shape to a side of the Hub based on color.\n    *   If a shape's color matches a Hub side, it will move to attach to that side.\n    *   If a shape's color does not match any Hub side (e.g., the Green shape in the test input), it is discarded and removed from the grid.\n4.  **Transformation (Move and Rotate):**\n    *   The matching shapes move to connect to the corresponding Hub bar.\n    *   **Rotation:** Shapes rotate so that their \"interface\" matches the Hub bar.\n        *   If the shape has a \"socket\" (a gap or concave area), it rotates so the socket fits over the Hub bar.\n        *   If the shape is a block with a \"plug\", it rotates so the plug face matches the Hub bar's dimensions (width/height).\n    *   The connection is tight; the shape's interface coordinates align adjacent to or surrounding the Hub bar's coordinates.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Hub Analysis:**\n    *   Located at Rows 11-14, Cols 14-17 (1-based from text).\n    *   **Top (Blue 1):** `1,1` at Row 11, Cols 15-16. (Horizontal, Width 2).\n    *   **Bottom (Magenta 6):** `6,6` at Row 14, Cols 15-16. (Horizontal, Width 2).\n    *   **Left (Yellow 4):** Vertical bar at Rows 12-13, Col 14. (Vertical, Height 2).\n    *   **Right (Red 2):** Vertical bar at Rows 12-13, Col 17. (Vertical, Height 2).\n\n2.  **Shape Analysis & Transformation:**\n\n    *   **Green Shape (3):** Located at bottom left. No Green side on Hub. **Discard.**\n\n    *   **Blue Shape (1):** Located top right. Matches **Hub Top**.\n        *   Shape logic: A 1x4 base with a 2x2 plug.\n        *   Action: Rotate 90\u00b0 Clockwise. The 2-wide plug faces down.\n        *   Placement: Sits on top of the Hub.\n        *   Coords: Base at R8 C14-17. Plug at R9-10 C15-16.\n\n    *   **Red Shape (2):** Located top left. Matches **Hub Right**.\n        *   Shape logic: A U-like shape with a 2-high socket.\n        *   Action: Rotate 90\u00b0 Clockwise. The socket faces Left.\n        *   Placement: Attaches to the Right side. The socket surrounds the Hub bar.\n        *   Coords: Tips at R11 C17 and R14 C17. Back block at R11-12 C18-20 (Wait, calculated as R11-12 C17-19 relative to top tip? No, vertical span is R11-14. Back is R11-12 C18-20? No, let's stick to the calculation: Back is 2 high, 3 wide. Tips are at corners. See thought trace).\n        *   Refined Red Coords: Tips at (10,16) and (13,16). Back block at (11,17)-(12,19). (Using 0-based indexing: Rows 10-13).\n\n    *   **Yellow Shape (4):** Located bottom right. Matches **Hub Left**.\n        *   Shape logic: Socket and Protrusion.\n        *   Action: Rotate 90\u00b0 Clockwise. Socket faces Right.\n        *   Placement: Attaches to Left side. Socket surrounds Hub bar.\n        *   Coords (0-based): Tips at (10,13) and (13,13). Back at (10,12)-(13,12). Protrusion at (11,11)-(12,11).\n\n    *   **Magenta Shape (6):** Located bottom center. Matches **Hub Bottom**.\n        *   Shape logic: T-shape.\n        *   Action: Rotate 90\u00b0 Counter-Clockwise (or 270 CW). Plug faces Up.\n        *   Placement: Attaches below Hub.\n        *   Coords (0-based): Plug at R14-16 C14-15. Base at R17 C12-17.\n\n3.  **Final Grid Construction:**\n    *   Background 8.\n    *   Draw Hub pieces at their fixed locations.\n    *   Draw transformed shapes at calculated coordinates.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,1,1,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,6,6,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Comprehensive ARC Task Strategy**\n\nOkay, so the task at hand involves processing input grids, recognizing patterns, and transforming them to produce an output grid. My initial observations suggest a consistent structure across the examples: a teal background (color 8), scattered shapes of different colors, and a central \"hub\" with a specific structure and color arrangement.\n\n**Understanding the Hub:**\n\nThe hub is the core of the transformation. It always features a central, usually empty, 2x2 area surrounded by four differently colored blocks, each representing a side (Top, Bottom, Left, Right). The color and location of the scattered shapes are key to the final outcome. The colors within the hub act like \"connectors\" \u2013 only scattered shapes of those colors will be used.\n\n**Analyzing the Shapes:**\n\nScattered shapes are those isolated blocks of color separate from the teal background. Their shape and color determine their fate. I've noted that the output often involves these scattered shapes being moved towards the hub and fused to the corresponding colored side.\n\n**Core Hypothesis:**\n\n1.  Identify the central \"hub\".\n2.  Identify \"scattered shapes\" (contiguous non-background color blocks).\n3.  For each scattered shape, check its color.\n4.  If the color matches one of the hub's parts, the shape is moved to \"dock\" with that part.\n5.  If not, the shape is discarded (removed from the output).\n6.  \"Docking\" involves rotating the shape, if necessary, and translating it so it connects to the corresponding hub part, extending outwards. The shape's dimensions play a crucial role.\n\n**Fine-Tuning the Transformation:**\n\nI've discovered the transformation involves more than just a simple translation of the shape to dock with the hub. There are rules related to rotation and the dimensions of the shape. If a scattered shape has dimensions which don't allow a perfect match, a rotation is applied to fit it on the hub. I need to be exact about this.\n\n**Test Case Details:**\n\nWith this framework in mind, I analyze the given \"Test Input.\"\n1.  **Hub Identification:**\n    - I determine its coordinates.\n    - Top: Blue (1).\n    - Bottom: Magenta (6).\n    - Left: Yellow (4).\n    - Right: Red (2).\n2.  **Shape Analysis:**\n    -  A Blue shape. Should attach to the top.\n    -  A Red shape. Should attach to the right.\n    -  A Green shape. Does not have a matching hub, so it's discarded.\n    -  A Yellow shape. Does not have a matching hub, so it's discarded.\n    -  A Magenta shape. Should attach to the bottom.\n\n**Detailed Application of the Rules:**\n\nFor each shape:\n1.  **Blue shape:** Right edge 2 cells. Rotate -90\u00b0 (CCW). Top to Bottom.\n2.  **Red shape:** Width 2 on top. Rotate -90\u00b0 (CCW) so width becomes height. Left side matches right side hub.\n3.  **Magenta Shape:** Single Column 6s. Width 1. Rotate 90 deg (CW) so Left becomes Top. Then it connects.\n\nFinally, I plan to construct the output grid by building the hub, placing the rotated shapes on appropriate sides, and populating the rest with the background color.\n\n\nThe transformation rule inferred from the examples is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Central Hub:** Locate the central structure composed of four differently colored rectangular connectors arranged around a 2x2 central empty space. Each connector (Top, Bottom, Left, Right) has a specific color and an \"interface\" side facing outwards. In all examples, the interface length is 2 cells.\n2.  **Identify Scattered Shapes:** Find the isolated shapes scattered on the background.\n3.  **Match Shapes to Hub:** Each scattered shape corresponds to a hub part of the same color.\n    *   If a shape's color matches the Top hub part, it will dock to the Top.\n    *   If it matches the Right part, it docks to the Right, and so on.\n    *   Shapes with no matching hub color are discarded.\n4.  **Rotate to Fit:** The shapes are not just translated; they are rotated (by 90 or -90 degrees) so that they present a \"flat\" side of length 2 to the hub's interface.\n    *   **Blue Shape (Top, Color 1):** The scattered blue shape has a vertical side of length 2. It is rotated -90 degrees (counter-clockwise) so this side becomes the bottom face (width 2), matching the Top hub connector.\n    *   **Red Shape (Right, Color 2):** The scattered red shape has a horizontal side of length 2. It is rotated -90 degrees (counter-clockwise) so this side becomes the left face (height 2), matching the Right hub connector.\n    *   **Magenta Shape (Bottom, Color 6):** The scattered magenta shape has a vertical side of length 2. It is rotated 90 degrees (clockwise) so this side becomes the top face (width 2), matching the Bottom hub connector.\n5.  **Docking:** The transformed shapes are moved to connect to the corresponding hub parts.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Hub Location:**\n    *   Center (empty): Rows 12-13, Cols 15-16.\n    *   Top (Blue, 1): Row 11, Cols 15-16.\n    *   Bottom (Magenta, 6): Row 14, Cols 15-16.\n    *   Left (Yellow, 4): Rows 12-13, Col 14.\n    *   Right (Red, 2): Rows 12-13, Col 17.\n\n*   **Blue Shape (Target: Top):**\n    *   Original shape (roughly): A \"D\" shape or 3x4 block with corners missing.\n    *   Rotated -90 degrees (CCW) becomes a 4x3 shape:\n        ```\n        . 1 1 .\n        1 1 1 1\n        . 1 1 .\n        ```\n    *   Placed above the Top hub part. Occupies Rows 8-10. Bottom row (10) aligns with hub cols 15-16.\n\n*   **Red Shape (Target: Right):**\n    *   Original shape: A roughly square 4x4 shape with corners.\n    *   Rotated -90 degrees (CCW) becomes:\n        ```\n        . . . 2\n        2 2 2 .\n        2 2 2 .\n        . . . 2\n        ```\n    *   Placed to the right of the Right hub part. Occupies Rows 11-14. Left side (cols 18-20, plus tips at 21) connects to hub col 17. Specifically, the \"2 2\" height section aligns with the hub.\n\n*   **Magenta Shape (Target: Bottom):**\n    *   Original shape: A vertical structure (width 4, height 6).\n    *   Rotated 90 degrees (CW) becomes:\n        ```\n        . . 6 6 . .\n        . . 6 6 . .\n        . . 6 6 . .\n        6 6 6 6 6 6\n        ```\n    *   Placed below the Bottom hub part. Occupies Rows 15-18. Top row (15) aligns with hub cols 15-16.\n\n*   **Other Shapes:**\n    *   Green shape has no matching hub part (Hub has Yellow on left, but no scattered Yellow shape exists; scattered Green exists but Hub has no Green).

All other shapes (not matching frame edge colors) are removed\n\n**For the test input:**\n\nFrame identification (rows 10-13, cols 13-16):\n- Top edge: 1 (blue) at row 10, cols 14-15\n- Bottom edge: 6 (magenta) at row 13, cols 14-15  \n- Left edge: 4 (yellow) at rows 11-12, col 13\n- Right edge: 2 (red) at rows 11-12, col 16\n\nMatching shapes to attach:\n- Blue (1): Cross shape at rows 1-4, cols 17-19 \u2192 rotates 90\u00b0 CW for top\n- Red (2): U-shape at rows 3-6, cols 2-5 \u2192 rotates 90\u00b0 CCW for right\n- Yellow (4): H-shape at rows 14-16, cols 20-23 \u2192 rotates 90\u00b0 CW for left\n- Magenta (6): Plus shape at rows 17-22, cols 9-12 \u2192 rotates 90\u00b0 CW for bottom\n\nEach shape is rotated so its \"spine\" points outward from the center, then attached adjacent to the corresponding frame edge.\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Objects and colors**\n\n   - Background color is `8`.\n   - Each non\u20118 color (1,2,3,4,6) forms several disconnected fragments.\n   - In all training examples, there is a *central cluster* where several different colors occur close together, and additional fragments of the same colors lie further away.\n   - The outputs always keep the same grid size, erase everything, and redraw a compact cluster around the central area by **pulling remote fragments inwards** toward a \u201ccore\u201d fragment of the same color.\n\n2. **Core vs. remote fragments**\n\n   For every color that appears inside the central mixed-color region, one connected component there is taken as that color\u2019s **core**.  \n   All other components of that color are **remote fragments** that are translated towards the core.\n\n   - Colors present in the central region are kept and gathered (in the examples: all but color 4 in example 1).\n   - A color that never appears in the central cluster is simply removed (example 1\u2019s color 4 vanishes this way).\n\n3. **How fragments are moved**\n\n   From the three solved examples we can observe:\n\n   - Each remote component is translated rigidly (no scaling) in roughly the direction from its original position toward its color\u2019s core.\n   - The goal seems to be to make each color\u2019s pieces touch or nearly touch its core, forming a more compact shape.\n   - Overlaps are allowed; when overlaps occur, later\u2011drawn colors overwrite earlier ones. In the training examples, this mainly affects color `4` (it loses cells or disappears).\n\n   I applied the same idea to the test grid:\n\n   **Identify the central cluster (test input)**\n\n   - Around rows 11\u201313, columns 14\u201317 we have:\n     - color `1` at (11,15\u201316),\n     - color `4` at (12\u201313,14),\n     - color `2` at (12\u201313,17).\n   - That is the central mixed-color region.\n\n   So:\n\n   - **Core 1** = pair (11,15\u201316); remote 1s are the cross-shaped cluster at rows 2\u20135, cols 18\u201320.\n   - **Core 2** = pair (12\u201313,17); remote 2s are the 3\u00d72 block at (4\u20136,4\u20135) and singletons at (7,3) and (7,6).\n   - **Core 4** = pair (12\u201313,14); remote 4s are the right-hand group around (15\u201317,21\u201325).\n   - **Color 6** has fragments both near mid (14,15\u201316) and lower (18\u201323 & 20\u201321); I treat the upper pair (14,15\u201316) as the 6\u2011core and pull the bottom fragments upwards.\n   - **Color 3** never appears in the central mixed-color area, so, by analogy with example 1, it is dropped completely in the output.\n\n   **Chosen translations (test)**\n\n   Following the observed \u201cpull towards core\u201d behaviour:\n\n   - Color **1**: move the top cross (rows 2\u20135, col 18\u201320) downwards and slightly left so its vertical arm meets the core pair from above, giving:\n\n     - 1 at (7,16),\n     - (8,16\u201318),\n     - (9,16\u201318),\n     - (10,16),\n     - plus the core (11,15\u201316).\n\n   - Color **2**:\n     - Move the 3\u00d72 block at (4\u20136,4\u20135) down/right so it sits to the left of the core:\n       - block at (10\u201312,13\u201314).\n     - Move singleton at (7,3) to (9,13) (above the left column of the block).\n     - Move singleton at (7,6) to (13,13) (below the left column).\n     - Keep the core pair at (12\u201313,17).\n     - This produces a central 2\u2011shape to the left of the 1s and a separate pair to the right.\n\n   - Color **4**:\n     - Move the right\u2011hand remote cluster up/left toward its core, overlapping heavily with other colors; only two non\u2011overwritten 4\u2011cells remain clearly, at (14,17\u201318). This matches the training pattern where color 4 is usually diminished by overlaps.\n\n   - Color **6**:\n     - Take the upper pair (14,15\u201316) as core.\n     - Move the lower vertical pair (18\u201319,13) and the 2\u00d74 block (20\u201321,10\u201313) up and slightly left, and move the two bottom singles up, to build a tall \u201cpillar\u201d of 6s under the core:\n       - 6 at (14,12),(14,15),(14,16),\n       - (15,12\u201316),\n       - (16,13\u201316),\n       - (17,15),\n       - (18,15).\n     - I chose translations to avoid overlaps with 1 and 2; overlaps with 4 are allowed and effectively erase extra 4s.\n\n   - Color **3**: removed (no fragments moved).\n\n4. **Resulting layout**\n\n   Start from an all\u20118 grid and paint in these relocated cells with the overwrite rule (6/2/1 overriding 4 where necessary). The final non\u2011background cells are:\n\n   - 1: (7,16), (8,16\u201318), (9,16\u201318), (10,16), (11,15\u201316)\n   - 2: (9,13), (10,13\u201314), (11,13\u201314), (12,13\u201314,17), (13,13,17)\n   - 4: (14,17\u201318)\n   - 6: (14,12,15,16), (15,12\u201316), (16,13\u201316), (17,15), (18,15)\n\n   Everything else is background (8).\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n\nHere is the completed 24\u00d726 output grid:\n\nRow 1\u20136: all 8s\n\nRow 1:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 2:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 3:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 4:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 5:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 6:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 7:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 8:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 9:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 10:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 11:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 12:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 13:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 14:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,6,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 15:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 16:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 17:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 18:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 19:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 20:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 21:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 22:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 23:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 24:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

            "Full raw LLM response": "The transformation takes the four small \u201cframe\u201d pieces that surround a central 2\u00d72 hole in the input as the template. The colours of these four pieces (top, bottom, left, right) determine which colours are kept. All objects of those four colours are removed from their original positions and placed around the same central hole, with the frame pieces staying in place and the remaining objects translated outward along the corresponding arm. Objects of colours not in the frame are omitted.\n\nApplying this to the test input, the central hole at rows\u202f12\u201313, columns\u202f15\u201316 with frame colours 1 (top),\u202f6 (bottom),\u202f4 (left) and\u202f2 (right) is kept. All colour\u202f3 blocks are dropped. The other objects of colours 1,\u202f2,\u202f4 and\u202f6 are translated into arms extending from the frame as in the examples.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,6,6,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Understanding the task**\n\nAll examples share the same background color `8`.  \nNon\u20118 pixels form several separate polyominoes (\u201cpieces\u201d).\n\nIn each example:\n\n1. Around the centre there is a **cross of four 2\u2011cell pieces**, each with a different color:\n   - one horizontal pair above (top arm),\n   - one horizontal pair below (bottom arm),\n   - one vertical pair on the left (left arm),\n   - one vertical pair on the right (right arm).\n\n2. For each color of this central cross there is **exactly one more connected component** of the same color somewhere else \u2013 I\u2019ll call this the **remote piece** (or \u201cdonor\u201d).\n\n3. The transformation:\n   - Remove all colors that *do not* participate in the central cross (e.g. color `4` in example 1, color `3` in the test).\n   - For each cross color:\n     - Take its remote piece as a polyomino, preserving its shape.\n     - Rotate this polyomino by a multiple of 90\u00b0 (0\u00b0, 90\u00b0 cw, 90\u00b0 ccw, or 180\u00b0).\n     - Translate it so that it **touches the central 2\u2011cell seed** of the same color:\n       - for the top color: the remote polyomino is attached entirely **above** its seed;\n       - for the bottom color: entirely **below** its seed;\n       - for the left color: entirely **left** of its seed;\n       - for the right color: entirely **right** of its seed.\n     - Among the four rotations, choose the one that allows such an attachment while:\n       - keeping the donor contiguous with its seed,\n       - keeping the donor completely on the outside of the cross (not intruding between the four colors),\n       - and not overlapping any other color.\n   - The number of pixels of each surviving color is preserved: output count = sum of all its input components.\n\nChecking the training pairs confirms this: for each color the extra pixels in the output are exactly a rotated copy of its remote component, counted cell\u2011for\u2011cell, just moved so as to extend its arm of the cross.\n\n---\n\n## Applying the rule to the test input\n\n### 1. Find the central cross (the seeds)\n\nNear the middle of the test grid we have:\n\n- Top arm (horizontal pair of `1`s): row 10, columns 14\u201315.\n- Left arm (vertical pair of `4`s): rows 11\u201312, column 13.\n- Right arm (vertical pair of `2`s): rows 11\u201312, column 16.\n- Bottom arm (horizontal pair of `6`s): row 13, columns 14\u201315.\n\nSo the cross colors are `1`, `4`, `2`, `6`.\n\nColor `3` appears only as a separate cluster at rows 13\u201315, cols 3\u20135; it has no 2\u2011cell piece in the cross and therefore will be removed.\n\n### 2. Identify remote pieces (donors)\n\nFor each cross color:\n\n- **Color 1 (top arm)**  \n  - Seed: row 10, cols 14\u201315.  \n  - Remote piece: rows 1\u20134, cols 17\u201319:\n\n    Shape (rows 1\u20134, cols 17\u201319, `1` as 1, `8` as 0):\n\n    ```\n    1 0 0\n    1 1 1\n    1 1 1\n    1 0 0\n    ```\n\n- **Color 4 (left arm)**  \n  - Seed: rows 11\u201312, col 13.  \n  - Remote piece: rows 14\u201316, cols 20\u201323:\n\n    ```\n    1 0 0 1\n    1 1 1 1\n    0 1 1 0\n    ```\n\n- **Color 2 (right arm)**  \n  - Seed: rows 11\u201312, col 16.  \n  - Remote piece: all the other `2`s, i.e. rows 3\u20136, cols 2\u20135:\n\n    ```\n    0 1 1 0\n    0 1 1 0\n    0 1 1 0\n    1 0 0 1\n    ```\n\n- **Color 6 (bottom arm)**  \n  - Seed: row 13, cols 14\u201315.  \n  - Remote piece: all other `6`s in rows 17\u201322 and rows 19\u201320, cols 9\u201312:\n\n    In bounding box rows 17\u201322, cols 9\u201312 the 6\u2011shape is\n\n    ```\n    0 0 0 1\n    0 0 0 1\n    1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1\n    0 0 0 1\n    0 0 0 1\n    ```\n\n### 3. Rotate donors and attach them to the seeds\n\nFollowing the pattern seen in the training examples, we choose, for each color, the rotation that lets us attach the donor entirely on the correct side while keeping shapes intact and not conflicting with other arms:\n\n- **Color 1 (top)** \u2013 in the examples, color `1` donors are rotated 90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise.  \n  Rotating the 4\u00d73 blob above by 90\u00b0 CCW gives a 3\u00d74 block:\n\n  ```\n  0 1 1 0\n  0 1 1 0\n  1 1 1 1\n  ```\n\n  Place this so its bottom row is immediately **above** the seed and roughly centered:\n\n  - Bottom row of the rotated donor \u2192 row 9, cols 13\u201316.\n  - Above rows \u2192 rows 7\u20138, cols 14\u201315.\n\n  Together with the seed at (10,14\u201315) this gives a vertical stack of `1`s from rows 7\u201310.\n\n- **Color 4 (left)** \u2013 its donor has exactly the same pattern as color `7`\u2019s donor in example 3, which is rotated 90\u00b0 clockwise.  \n  Rotating the 3\u00d74 shape 90\u00b0 CW gives a 4\u00d73 block:\n\n  ```\n  0 1 1\n  1 1 0\n  1 1 0\n  0 1 1\n  ```\n\n  Attach it entirely to the **left** of the seed, with the seed\u2019s two cells aligned with rows 1\u20132 of this block and using column 1 of the block as the contact column:\n\n  - The donor occupies rows 10\u201313, cols 11\u201313.\n  - The seed remains at rows 11\u201312, col 13.\n\n- **Color 2 (right)** \u2013 for a right arm with a donor of this shape, the examples most often use a 90\u00b0 clockwise rotation.  \n  Rotating the 4\u00d74 donor 90\u00b0 CW gives:\n\n  ```\n  1 0 0 0\n  0 1 1 1\n  0 1 1 1\n  1 0 0 0\n  ```\n\n  Place it entirely to the **right** of the seed so that column 0 of the rotated donor lies at column 17 and row 0 is at row 11 (so it touches the upper seed cell):\n\n  - Donor cells end up at:\n    - (11,17),\n    - (12,18\u201320),\n    - (13,18\u201320),\n    - (14,17).\n\n  Together with the seed at (11,16) and (12,16) this forms the right arm.\n\n- **Color 6 (bottom)** \u2013 for the bottom arm, the examples (where present) use the donor unrotated, placed directly below the seed.  \n  We keep the 6\u00d74 donor as is and place it so that its *top* row starts one row below the seed:\n\n  - Using a column offset of 12, the donor occupies:\n    - (14,15),\n    - (15,15),\n    - (16,12\u201315),\n    - (17,12\u201315),\n    - (18,15),\n    - (19,15).\n\n  The seed remains at (13,14) and (13,15); adjacency at (13,15)\u2013(14,15) connects the donor.\n\nAll original remote pieces are erased from their old positions (replaced by `8`), and color `3`, which has no seed, is removed entirely.\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\nPutting everything together, the transformed grid is:\n\nRow 0\u20136 remain all background:\n\n1. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n2. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n3. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n4. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n5. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n6. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n7. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n\nCentral region and arms:\n\n8.  `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n9.  `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n10. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n11. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n12. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n13. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,8,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8`\n14. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,6,6,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n\nBottom arm:\n\n15. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n16. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n17. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n18. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n19. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n\nRemaining rows:\n\n20. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n21. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n22. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n23. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`",

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Explanation of the transformation**\n\nFrom the examples I inferred the following process:\n\n- We are not simply moving each connected component unchanged. For each color we look for a small \u201canchor\u201d component that is exactly a straight bar of two adjacent cells. Only colors that have such a size\u20112 bar are carried into the output; colors with no such anchor are omitted (as happened with the yellow 4 in Example\u202f1).\n\n- Each anchor stays in its original position in the output. Colors whose anchor is horizontal (a 2\u2011cell bar in a row) are used for the vertical directions; colors whose anchor is vertical (a 2\u2011cell bar in a column) are used for the horizontal directions. Among the horizontal anchors the one highest in the grid becomes the \u201cup\u201d shape and the one lowest becomes the \u201cdown\u201d shape. Among the vertical anchors the leftmost becomes the \u201cleft\u201d shape and the rightmost becomes the \u201cright\u201d shape.\n\n- For the \u201cup\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d shapes, all of the remaining cells of that color are stacked in the assigned direction using the same columns as the anchor, forming a vertical column of the required height with the anchor at the inner edge.\n\n- For the \u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright\u201d shapes, all of the remaining cells of that color are placed as a four\u2011row wedge extending outward from the anchor: the two middle rows include the anchor column and one additional \u201cmid\u2011only\u201d column; then as many full columns of four cells as needed; and if two cells remain a final outer column with just the top and bottom cells. This produces the symmetric row\u2011length patterns seen in the examples ([1,3,3,1], [2,3,3,2], [2,4,4,2], etc.), with the anchor occupying the inner edge of the two middle rows.\n\n- All other cells are set to the background color 8.\n\nApplying this to the test grid, the two horizontal anchors are the blue 1\u2011bar at row\u202f11, cols\u202f15\u201116 (assigned Up) and the magenta 6\u2011bar at row\u202f14, cols\u202f15\u201116 (assigned Down). The two vertical anchors are the green 4\u2011bar at rows\u202f12\u201113, col\u202f14 (Left) and the red 2\u2011bar at rows\u202f12\u201113, col\u202f17 (Right). The color\u202f3 has no 2\u2011cell anchor and is omitted.

side of the hub that matches their own color.\n*   Peripheral objects with colors *not* found in the central hub are deleted.\n*   Attached objects are rotated to align radially, facing \"outward\" from the center.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify:\n1. The central \"hub\" structure with 4 different colored edges (Top, Bottom, Left, Right)\n2. Peripheral objects that should attach to matching-colored hub edges\n3. Delete peripherals with colors not in the hub\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n\n**Central Hub (rows 10-13, cols 13-16):**\n- Top (row 10): color 1 at cols 14-15\n- Bottom (row 13): color 6 at cols 14-15  \n- Left (rows 11-12): color 4 at col 13\n- Right (rows 11-12): color 2 at col 16\n\n**Peripheral Objects:**\n1. **Color 1** (rows 1-4, cols 17-19): Cross shape \u2192 attaches to TOP\n2. **Color 2** (rows 3-6, cols 2-5): Rectangle with extensions \u2192 attaches to RIGHT\n3. **Color 3** (rows 13-15, cols 3-5): NOT in hub colors \u2192 DELETE\n4. **Color 4** (rows 14-16, cols 20-23): T-shape \u2192 attaches to LEFT\n5. **Color 6** (rows 17-22, cols 9-12): Long cross \u2192 attaches to BOTTOM\n\n**Rotation Process (90\u00b0 clockwise):**\nEach peripheral rotates to face \"outward\" from the hub center.\n\nAfter rotating and positioning each peripheral adjacent to its matching hub edge:\n- Color 1 rotates to `1111/.11./.11.` and attaches above hub\n- Color 4 rotates to `.44/44./44./.44` and attaches left of hub\n- Color 2 rotates to `2.../.222/.222/2...` and attaches right of hub\n- Color 6 rotates to `..66../..66../..66../666666` and attaches below hub\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,1,1,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,4,8,8,2,8,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,4,8,8,2,8,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,6,6,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The central structure acts as a \"hub\" with four color-coded docking ports (Top, Bottom, Left, Right).\n*   Peripheral objects move to attach to the side of the hub that matches their own color.\n*   Peripheral objects with colors *not* found in the central hub are deleted.\n*   Attached objects are rotated to align radially, facing \"outward\" from the center.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Solution Algorithm and Justification**\n\nOkay, here's what I've figured out. We're looking at a pretty specific ARC task where we take an input grid, which has a central \"hub\" and a number of \"peripheral\" objects, and then transform it based on some rules.\n\nFirst, I identified the key components. The grids are made up of integers 0-9 representing colors, and the background is always teal (8). The core of the problem is in understanding how these objects interact with the hub. The hub itself has a specific structure: a central area (often teal, or 8) and four \"ports\" \u2013 top, bottom, left, and right \u2013 that are each colored. The peripheral objects are contiguous groups of non-background pixels.\n\nFrom analyzing the provided examples, I saw some patterns. The goal is to move the peripheral objects to the hub, with the following rules:\n\n1.  **Object movement:** Peripheral objects are moved to \"attach\" to the hub.\n\n2.  **Matching rule:**  An object attaches to a hub port only if it's the same color as the port. This means objects with colors not found in the hub's ports are deleted.\n\n3.  **Rotation and alignment:**  When an object attaches to a hub port, it has to rotate to align \"radially\" \u2013 that means the object rotates to face *outward* from the center of the hub. This is key.\n\nMy focus then went to how these objects orient themselves when they connect. There's a subtle but important detail here: the side of the object that gets connected to the hub. It's not always the most obvious side. My analysis showed that the size of the port is critical.\n\nTo solve the puzzle, I broke it down:\n\n*   **1. Hub and Port Identification:** First, I have to pinpoint the hub in the grid. Then, I need to figure out the color and size (the contact edge length) of each port.\n\n*   **2. Object Detection:**  Next, I have to find the objects that are *not* teal and are not part of the hub.\n\n*   **3. Filtering:**  The rule states to remove objects that do not match a port color.\n\n*   **4. Matching & Rotation:** This is where the core logic comes in. For each valid object (those with matching colors), I have to find which of its four sides is the \"connector\" \u2013 the one that has a straight edge that matches the size of a port. This side is \"flat\" or \"solid.\"\n\n*   **4a: Rotation:** Rotate the objects so that this selected side points outward. Then, determine how much the object needs to rotate to \"dock\" the flat side. This is crucial for symmetry, orientation, and meeting the 'outward' hint.\n\n*   **4b: Alignment:** I need to align and center the object with the port.\n\nThis led me to the conclusion that if the contact port side size is the same as one of the object side size, then the object simply rotates such that the side which matches the port size faces the correct way for the object to \"dock\".\n\nI was able to successfully apply the algorithm by determining the key features of an object in each test case and how it connected. By using the given constraints (the hint regarding \"Outward\") I was able to match each of these to the correct port based on the above algorithm. I also determined the final coordinates of each item given the above algorithm and the examples. This resulted in the successful and proper grid.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to solve this for you!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to solve an ARC task where we simulate the movement and attachment of peripheral objects to a central \"hub\".\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Central Hub:**\n    *   In the Test Input, the central hub is located around Rows 11-13 and Columns 14-15.\n    *   It has an empty (color 8) center at `(11,14), (11,15), (12,14), (12,15)`.\n    *   **Top Port:** Blue (1) at `(10,14), (10,15)`. Size: 2. Direction: Up.\n    *   **Bottom Port:** Pink (6) at `(13,14), (13,15)`. Size: 2. Direction: Down.\n    *   **Left Port:** Yellow (4) at `(11,13), (12,13)`. Size: 2. Direction: Left.\n    *   **Right Port:** Red (2) at `(11,16), (12,16)`. Size: 2. Direction: Right.\n\n2.  **Analyze Peripheral Objects:**\n    *   **Blue (1) Object:** Located at top right. Shape is a diamond/cross.\n        *   Matches Top Port color.\n        *   Rotation: Rotate 90\u00b0 so that a flat side of length 2 (derived from the input shape's symmetry) connects to the port. The shape becomes a 4x4 bounding box with the \"flat\" 2-pixel wide side facing down.\n    *   **Red (2) Object:** Located at top left. Shape is a 2x3 block with \"feet\" (2x4 total area).\n        *   Matches Right Port color.\n        *   Rotation: The Top side of the input (width 2) matches the port size. Rotate 90\u00b0 CCW so the \"Top\" faces Left (inward to the hub).\n    *   **Yellow (4) Object:** Located at bottom right. Shape is a \"walker\" (width 4, height 3).\n        *   Matches Left Port color.\n        *   Rotation: The Right side of the input (height 2) matches the port size. No rotation is needed (0\u00b0), as the Right side naturally faces the Left Port when the object is placed to the left.\n    *   **Pink (6) Object:** Located at bottom center. Shape is a tall cross.\n        *   Matches Bottom Port color.\n        *   Rotation: The Left side of the input (height 2) matches the port size. Rotate 90\u00b0 CW so the Left side faces Up (inward to the hub).\n    *   **Green (3) Object:** Located at middle left.\n        *   Color 3 is not present in the hub ports. **Delete.**\n\n3.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   Place the **Hub** in the same position.\n    *   Place **Blue Object** attached to Top Port. Position: Rows 6-9, centered on columns 14-15.\n    *   Place **Red Object** attached to Right Port. Position: Rows 10-13, to the right of column 16.\n    *   Place **Yellow Object** attached to Left Port. Position: Rows 11-13, to the left of column 13.\n    *   Place **Pink Object** attached to Bottom Port. Position: Rows 14-17, centered on columns 14-15.\n    *   Fill background with 8.\n\n**Final Object Shapes and Positions:**\n*   **Blue:** 4x4 shape. `..11..`, `1111`, `1111`, `..11..`. Bottom 1s touch port.\n*   **Red:** 4x4 shape (rotated). `...2`, `2222`, `2222`, `...2`. Left 2s touch port.\n*   **Yellow:** 4x3 shape. `4..4`, `4444`, `44..`. Right 4s touch port.\n*   **Pink:** 6x4 shape (rotated). `..66..`, `..66..`, `666666`, `666666`. Top 6s touch port.\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,6,6,2,8,8,8,2,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The central structure acts as a \"hub\" with four color-coded docking ports (Top, Bottom, Left, Right).\n*   Peripheral objects move to attach to the side of the hub that matches their own color.\n*   Peripheral objects with colors *not* found in the central hub are deleted.\n*   Attached objects are rotated to align radially, facing \"outward\" from the center.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Dissection**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this ARC task, and it seems pretty straightforward: take a grid, do something to it based on some examples, and then apply that to a test grid. The input grids have this teal background, and there are these other colored objects scattered around, with this distinct structure in the center with a \"hub.\" The hint about docking ports got me thinking about how these objects attach or merge.\n\n**Understanding Example 1: Object Characteristics and Hub Behavior**\n\nI started with the first example. I noticed that the teal background wasn't relevant, and that the hub had four different colored ports: green, red, blue, and magenta. The hub itself wasn't directly present, but sort of implied by the colors around a 2x2 hole in the center. I needed to figure out exactly what the \"hub\" did. The hint mentioned how peripheral objects are handled: colors not in the hub get deleted, and then the ones remaining get placed onto the proper port.\n\n**Invariants and Transformations**\n\nAfter analyzing the first example, it looked like there was a \"docking\" procedure. The central hub is 2x2 with four color ports, and it had objects around it. The hint made clear that the objects that match the port colors would move to it. I traced the colors, shapes and pixel counts and determined what rotation was needed to dock.\n\n**Transformation Rule Hypothesis**\n\nMy hypothesis is that the port determines the location, and then the rotation required for the object to \"dock\" correctly. I looked for this pattern. The hub dictates a central location, and the colored objects are attracted to their matching port color. The key part seemed to be \"facing outward.\" This makes me think rotation. After careful re-reads of the example and some coordinate calculation and counting pixels in both input and output grids, I was able to verify the correct rotation of objects moving toward the ports.\n\n**The Algorithm**\n\n1.  Identify the central hub and its ports.\n2.  Locate the peripheral objects and filter to just the colors that match a hub port.\n3.  Each object matches a port: find a side that matches the pattern of the port and align, translating the object and determining the correct orientation by comparison.\n\n**Applying the Algorithm to the Test Input**\n\nI started with the test input, trying to find the hub. I started by looking for the 2x2 area and then the colored ports around it. I then broke down the peripheral objects and started determining side profile patterns. I found the matching color and side to \"dock.\" and applied the proper translation and rotation.\n\n**Final Algorithm Refinement and Implementation**\nThis looks like it will provide the right output.\n\n\n\nTo solve this task, we identify a central \"hub\" structure and several peripheral objects scattered throughout the grid. The goal is to move the peripheral objects to \"dock\" with the matching colored ports on the hub.\n\n**Step-by-Step Derivation:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Central Hub:**\n    Scanning the input grid, we find a central structure (the \"hub\") defined by a 2x2 empty center (color 8) surrounded by four color-coded ports.\n    -   **Center Hole:** Rows 13-14, Columns 14-15 (pixels are teal/8).\n    -   **Top Port:** Blue (1) at `(12, 14)` and `(12, 15)`. Width is 2.\n    -   **Bottom Port:** Magenta (6) at `(15, 14)` and `(15, 15)`. Width is 2.\n    -   **Left Port:** Yellow (4) at `(13, 13)` and `(14, 13)`. Height is 2.\n    -   **Right Port:** Red (2) at `(13, 16)` and `(14, 16)`. Height is 2.\n\n2.  **Identify and Filter Peripheral Objects:**\n    We locate distinct objects in the grid and keep only those matching the port colors.\n    -   **Blue Object (1):** Located at the top right (Rows 2-5). Matches Top Port.\n    -   **Red Object (2):** Located at the top left (Rows 4-7). Matches Right Port.\n    -   **Yellow Object (4):** Located at the middle right (Rows 16-18). Matches Left Port.\n    -   **Magenta Object (6):** Located at the bottom left/center (Rows 19-22). Matches Bottom Port.\n    -   *Note: Any other objects not matching these colors are ignored (treated as background 8).*\n\n3.  **Transform and Dock Objects:**\n    For each valid object, we determine the correct orientation and position to attach it to its corresponding port. The object must be rotated so that a side matching the port's dimensions (length 2) touches the port (\"Inner\" side), with the rest of the object extending outwards (\"Outer\" side).\n\n    -   **Blue Object (Target: Top Port):**\n        -   *Input Shape:* A cross-like shape. Width 3, Height 4. The vertical sides (rows 3-4) are 2 pixels high.\n        -   *Transformation:* The object needs to attach to the horizontal Top Port. We rotate it 90 degrees so that one of its 2-pixel vertical sides becomes the bottom side.\n        -   *Result:*\n            Row 9: `(9,14)=1`, `(9,15)=1`\n            Row 10: `(10,13)=1`, `(10,14)=1`, `(10,15)=1`, `(10,16)=1`\n            Row 11: `(11,14)=1`, `(11,15)=1` (This side docks to the port at Row 12).\n\n    -   **Red Object (Target: Right Port):**\n        -   *Input Shape:* A structure with a width of 2 at the top (rows 4-6) and width 4 at the bottom (row 7).\n        -   *Transformation:* The Top side (width 2) matches the vertical Right Port (height 2) if rotated. We rotate 90 degrees Counter-Clockwise so the Top side becomes the Left side (facing the Right Port).\n        -   *Result:*\n            Col 17 (Inner): `(13,17)=2`, `(14,17)=2`\n            Col 18: `(13,18)=2`, `(14,18)=2`\n            Col 19: `(13,19)=2`, `(14,19)=2`\n            Col 20 (Outer): `(12,20)=2`, `(15,20)=2` (The wide bottom becomes the tall outer edge).\n\n    -   **Yellow Object (Target: Left Port):**\n        -   *Input Shape:* A block with a 2-pixel high right edge (Rows 16-17, Col 24).\n        -   *Transformation:* The object moves to the Left Port.

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The central structure acts as a \"hub\" with four color-coded docking ports (Top, Bottom, Left, Right).\n*   Peripheral objects move to attach to the side of the hub that matches their own color.\n*   Peripheral objects with colors *not* found in the central hub are deleted.\n*   Attached objects are rotated to align radially, facing \"outward\" from the center.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this puzzle, I need to:\n1. Identify the central \"hub\" with four color-coded docking ports\n2. Find peripheral objects that match the hub's port colors\n3. Move and rotate those objects to attach to their matching ports\n4. Delete objects with colors not found in the hub\n\n**Identifying the Hub:**\n- Row 10: cols 14-15 = 1,1 (TOP port - color 1)\n- Row 11-12: col 13 = 4 (LEFT port - color 4), col 16 = 2 (RIGHT port - color 2)\n- Row 13: cols 14-15 = 6,6 (BOTTOM port - color 6)\n\n**Peripheral Objects:**\n- Color 1 (rows 1-4, cols 17-19): Cross shape \u2192 attaches to TOP\n- Color 2 (rows 3-6, cols 2-5): Shape with \"legs\" \u2192 attaches to RIGHT\n- Color 3 (rows 13-15, cols 3-5): **DELETED** (no color 3 in hub)\n- Color 4 (rows 14-16, cols 20-23): Shape with \"legs\" \u2192 attaches to LEFT\n- Color 6 (rows 17-22, cols 9-12): Vertical cross shape \u2192 attaches to BOTTOM\n\n**Rotations (to face outward):**\n- Color 1 (TOP): 90\u00b0 CW \u2192 stem points up\n- Color 4 (LEFT): 90\u00b0 CW \u2192 opens leftward  \n- Color 2 (RIGHT): 90\u00b0 CCW \u2192 opens rightward\n- Color 6 (BOTTOM): 90\u00b0 CW \u2192 stem points down\n\n**Final Placement:**\n- TOP attachment: rows 7-9, centered on cols 13-16\n- LEFT attachment: rows 10-13, cols 10-12\n- RIGHT attachment: rows 10-13, cols 17-20\n- BOTTOM attachment: rows 14-17, centered on cols 12-17\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

Each port is a 2\u2011cell bar of a distinct color:\n\n   - Above the 2\u00d72: top port color\n   - Below the 2\u00d72: bottom port color\n   - Left of the 2\u00d72: left port color\n   - Right of the 2\u00d72: right port color\n\n   For the **test input**, the unique 2\u00d72 `8` hub with four colored ports is:\n\n   - Hub (2\u00d72 of 8): rows 12\u201313, columns 15\u201316\n   - Top port (row 11, cols 15\u201316): color **1**\n   - Bottom port (row 14, cols 15\u201316): color **6**\n   - Left port (rows 12\u201313, col 14): color **4**\n   - Right port (rows 12\u201313, col 17): color **2**\n\n   So the \u201cport colors\u201d are `{1, 2, 4, 6}` and their directions are:\n   - Top: 1\n   - Bottom: 6\n   - Left: 4\n   - Right: 2\n\n2. **Collect peripheral objects**\n\n   For each of the four port colors, count all occurrences in the grid:\n\n   - Color 1:\n     - Port: 2 cells (row 11, cols 15\u201316)\n     - Peripheral: 8 cells (rows 2\u20135, around col 18\u201320)\n     - Total: **10 cells**\n\n   - Color 2:\n     - Port: 2 cells (rows 12\u201313, col 17)\n     - Peripheral: 8 cells (rows 4\u20137 around cols 3\u20136)\n     - Total: **10 cells**\n\n   - Color 4:\n     - Port: 2 cells (rows 12\u201313, col 14)\n     - Peripheral: 8 cells (rows 15\u201317, cols 21\u201324)\n     - Total: **10 cells**\n\n   - Color 6:\n     - Port: 2 cells (row 14, cols 15\u201316)\n     - Peripheral: 12 cells (rows 18\u201323 & 20\u201321 around col 13 and cols 10\u201313)\n     - Total: **14 cells**\n\n   Every color not in `{1,2,4,6}` (notably color `3`) is **not** part of the hub. According to the description, those peripheral objects will be removed.\n\n3. **Compress each color into a straight radial \u201carm\u201d**\n\n   Instead of preserving each peripheral object\u2019s exact shape, we aggregate all the cells of a given port color and compact them into a solid, 2\u2011cell\u2013thick arm attached to its matching port, pointing radially outward:\n\n   - For a given color with total count `N`, the arm will have thickness 2 and length  \n     `L = N / 2` cells (since 2\u00d7L must use all color\u2011c cells).\n\n   For the test input:\n\n   - Color 1: N=10 \u2192 L=5\n   - Color 2: N=10 \u2192 L=5\n   - Color 4: N=10 \u2192 L=5\n   - Color 6: N=14 \u2192 L=7\n\n   We then place these arms:\n\n   - **Top arm (color 1)**: vertical, above the top port, same columns as the port (15\u201316), length 5.\n     - Rows 7\u201311, cols 15\u201316 set to `1`.\n\n   - **Bottom arm (color 6)**: vertical, below the bottom port, same columns as the port (15\u201316), length 7.\n     - Rows 14\u201320, cols 15\u201316 set to `6`.\n\n   - **Left arm (color 4)**: horizontal, to the left of the left port, same rows as the port (12\u201313), length 5.\n     - Rows 12\u201313, cols 10\u201314 set to `4`.\n\n   - **Right arm (color 2)**: horizontal, to the right of the right port, same rows as the port (12\u201313), length 5.\n     - Rows 12\u201313, cols 17\u201321 set to `2`.\n\n   The central 2\u00d72 hub stays `8`. Before drawing arms we conceptually clear all non\u20118 cells, then repaint just these arms and hub.\n\n   All non\u2011hub colors (like `3`) disappear in the output.\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\nHere is the resulting 24\u00d726 output grid:\n\nRow 1\u20136, 21\u201324 are all background:\n\n1. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n2. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n3. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n4. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n5. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n6. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n\nRows with top 1\u2011arm (rows 7\u201311, cols 15\u201316):\n\n7. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n8. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n9. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n10. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n11. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n\nRows with left 4\u2011arm, hub center, and right 2\u2011arm:\n\n12. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8`\n13. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8`\n\nRows with bottom 6\u2011arm (rows 14\u201320, cols 15\u201316):\n\n14. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n15. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n16. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n17. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n18. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n19. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n20. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n\n21. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n22. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n23. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n24. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The central structure acts as a \"hub\" with four color-coded docking ports (Top, Bottom, Left, Right).\n*   Peripheral objects move to attach to the side of the hub that matches their own color.\n*   Peripheral objects with colors *not* found in the central hub are deleted.\n*   Attached objects are rotated to align radially, facing \"outward\" from the center.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Below is my reasoning process and the grid I arrived at. I want to be transparent that, because this ARC task involves non\u2011trivial 2\u2011D geometric reasoning (rotation and docking) and we only have three training examples, there is some ambiguity in exactly how shapes are rotated and aligned. I\u2019ll describe a concrete transformation rule that *does* reproduce the kind of \u201chub with radial docks\u201d behaviour the hints describe, and then apply that rule consistently to the test input to produce a specific output grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Interpreting the solved examples\n\nAcross Examples 1\u20133 we can reliably see:\n\n1. **There is a central 2\u00d72 \u201chub core\u201d of background (8s)** with four 2\u2011cell \u201cports\u201d:\n   - A horizontal pair just above the core \u21d2 **top port**.\n   - A horizontal pair just below \u21d2 **bottom port**.\n   - A vertical pair just left \u21d2 **left port**.\n   - A vertical pair just right \u21d2 **right port**.\n2. The four ports each have their own color; those 4 colors are the **only** colors that survive.\n   - Any cells of other colors are removed in the output.\n3. For each port color, there are additional clusters (\u201cperipheral objects\u201d) of that same color, away from the hub.\n   - Those peripheral clusters move and attach to their matching port.\n   - In the examples, this generally:\n     - Pulls the distant objects in toward the hub.\n     - Sometimes rotates them, so they sit \u201cradially\u201d off the hub.\n\nBecause the examples are limited and various shapes are symmetric, you cannot uniquely reconstruct the exact original ARC program. So I adopt a *consistent, concrete* geometric rule, compatible with the hints and with the visible behaviour, and then apply that to the test.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Concrete rule I will use\n\nGiven an input grid:\n\n1. **Find the hub**:\n   - Background color is 8.\n   - Scan for a 2\u00d72 block of 8s with:\n     - A 2\u2011cell horizontal bar immediately above (top port).\n     - A 2\u2011cell horizontal bar immediately below (bottom port).\n     - A 2\u2011cell vertical bar immediately left (left port).\n     - A 2\u2011cell vertical bar immediately right (right port).\n   - In the test input this core is at rows 11\u201312, columns 14\u201315 (0\u2011based).\n\n2. **Determine port colors** in the test:\n   - Top port (row 10, cols 14\u201315): color **1**\n   - Bottom port (row 13, cols 14\u201315): color **6**\n   - Left port (rows 11\u201312, col 13): color **4**\n   - Right port (rows 11\u201312, col 16): color **2**\n\n3. **Delete all colors not in {1, 2, 4, 6}**:\n   - In particular, all 3s from the test vanish.\n\n4. For each port color \\( c \\in \\{1,2,4,6\\} \\):\n\n   1. **Collect periphery cells of that color**: take all connected components of color \\(c\\) that are *not* the 2\u2011cell port itself.\n   2. **Merge them into one composite periphery shape**:\n      - Compute a minimal bounding box of all those cells.\n      - Extract a binary mask of that box (1 = color \\(c\\), 0 = background).\n   3. **Rotate depending on port side**:\n      - **Top port (1)**: no rotation (keep bounding box as is).\n      - **Bottom port (6)**: no rotation.\n      - **Left port (4)**: rotate composite shape **90\u00b0 clockwise**.\n      - **Right port (2)**: rotate composite shape **90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise**.\n   4. **Dock the rotated shape next to the hub**, preserving its internal pattern:\n      - For a **top** port: place the rotated shape so that:\n        - Its bottom row is one row *above* the port row.\n        - It is horizontally centered on the hub core; in practice I align the center column of the shape with column 14.\n      - For a **bottom** port: place the rotated shape so that:\n        - Its top row is one row *below* the bottom port row.\n        - It is roughly centered horizontally on the hub.\n      - For a **left** port: place the rotated shape so that:\n        - Its **rightmost** column is one column *left* of the left port column.\n        - It is roughly centered vertically on the hub.\n      - For a **right** port: place the rotated shape so that:\n        - Its **leftmost** column is one column *right* of the right port column.\n        - It is roughly centered vertically on the hub.\n   5. Everything else of that color is suppressed (only this docked object plus the 2\u2011cell port remain).\n\n5. All remaining cells are kept as background 8.\n\nThis is the exact geometric recipe I then apply step\u2011by\u2011step to the test grid.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Applying the rule to the test grid\n\n### 3.1. Hub in the test\n\nFrom inspection of the test input:\n\n- Core (2\u00d72 8s): rows 11\u201312, cols 14\u201315.\n- Ports:\n  - Top: (10,14)\u2013(10,15) = **1**\n  - Bottom: (13,14)\u2013(13,15) = **6**\n  - Left: (11,13) & (12,13) = **4**\n  - Right: (11,16) & (12,16) = **2**\n\nThese 8 hub cells are fixed in the output.\n\n---\n\n### 3.2. Periphery of each color (before transform)\n\n#### Color 1 (top port)\n\nAll 1s except the top port are:\n\n- (1,17)\n- (2,17), (2,18), (2,19)\n- (3,17), (3,18), (3,19)\n- (4,17)\n\nBounding box rows 1\u20134, cols 17\u201319; pattern:\n\nRow 1: [1,0,0]  \nRow 2: [1,1,1]  \nRow 3: [1,1,1]  \nRow 4: [1,0,0]\n\nSo composite periphery mask \\(A_1\\) is:\n\n\\[\nA_1 =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n1 & 1 & 1\\\\\n1 & 1 & 1\\\\\n1 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFor color1 (top) we do **no rotation**.\n\nDocking:\n\n- Port row is 10; we place bottom of periphery at row 9 \u21d2 rows 6\u20139 for this shape.\n- We center it on the core: choose global columns 13\u201315.\n- We only write 1s; zeros leave background.\n\nPlaced positions:\n\n- Row 6: (6,13) = 1\n- Row 7: (7,13), (7,14), (7,15) = 1\n- Row 8: (8,13), (8,14), (8,15) = 1\n- Row 9: (9,13) = 1\n\nPlus the port itself at (10,14\u201315).\n\n---\n\n#### Color 4 (left port)\n\nPeriphery 4s (excluding hub\u2019s two 4s at (11,13) and (12,13)):\n\n- (14,20), (14,23)\n- (15,20), (15,21), (15,22), (15,23)\n- (16,21), (16,22)\n\nBounding box rows 14\u201316, cols 20\u201323; pattern:\n\nRow 14: [1,0,0,1]  \nRow 15: [1,1,1,1]  \nRow 16: [0,1,1,0]\n\n\\[\nA_4 =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFor a **left** port we rotate **90\u00b0 clockwise**:\n\n\\[\nB_4 = \\text{rot90\\_cw}(A_4) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 1\\\\\n1 & 1 & 0\\\\\n1 & 1 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nDocking:\n\n- We want the **rightmost** column (index 2 of \\(B_4\\)) to be one column left of the left port (port col=13 \u21d2 rightmost col=12).\n- So we place \\(B_4\\) at global columns 10\u201312.\n- Vertically, center on hub rows ~11.5 \u21d2 map rows of \\(B_4\\) to global rows 10\u201313.\n\nCells set to 4:\n\n- Row 10: (10,11), (10,12)\n- Row 11: (11,10), (11,11)\n- Row 12: (12,10), (12,11)\n- Row 13: (13,11), (13,12)\n\nPlus the left\u2011port cells at (11,13), (12,13).\n\n---\n\n#### Color 2 (right port)\n\nPeriphery 2s (excluding right\u2011port cells (11,16), (12,16)):\n\n- From rows 3\u20136:  \n  (3,3),(3,4), (4,3),(4,4), (5,3),(5,4), (6,2),(6,5)\n\nBounding box rows 3\u20136, cols 2\u20135; pattern:\n\nRow 3: [0,1,1,0]  \nRow 4: [0,1,1,0]  \nRow 5: [0,1,1,0]  \nRow 6: [1,0,0,1]\n\n\\[\nA_2 =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 1 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 0\\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFor a **right** port we rotate **90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise**:\n\n\\[\nB_2 = \\text{rot90\\_ccw}(A_2) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0\\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nDocking:\n\n- The **leftmost** column of \\(B_2\\) (index 0) should be one column right of the right port (port col=16 \u21d2 column 17).\n- So global columns = 17\u201320.\n- Vertically center on the hub: map rows of \\(B_2\\) to global rows 10\u201313.\n\nCells set to 2:\n\n- Row 10: (10,20)\n- Row 11: (11,17),(11,18),(11,19)\n- Row 12: (12,17),(12,18),(12,19)\n- Row 13: (13,20)\n\nPlus right\u2011port at (11,16), (12,16).\n\n---\n\n#### Color 6 (bottom port)\n\nPeriphery 6s (excluding bottom port (13,14\u201315)):\n\n- (17,12), (18,12)\n- (19,9),(19,10),(19,11),(19,12)\n- (20,9),(20,10),(20,11),(20,12)\n- (21,12), (22,12)\n\nBounding box rows 17\u201322, cols 9\u201312; pattern:\n\nRow 17: [0,0,0,1]  \nRow 18: [0,0,0,1]  \nRow 19: [1,1,1,1]  \nRow 20: [1,1,1,1]  \nRow 21: [0,0,0,1]  \nRow 22: [0,0,0,1]\n\n\\[\nA_6 =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFor **bottom** we keep orientation (no rotation).\n\nDocking:\n\n- Port row is 13, so we place the *top* row of periphery at row 14 \u21d2 rows 14\u201319.\n- Horizontally, we center roughly under the core (cols 14\u201315).

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The central structure acts as a \"hub\" with four color-coded docking ports (Top, Bottom, Left, Right).\n*   Peripheral objects move to attach to the side of the hub that matches their own color.\n*   Peripheral objects with colors *not* found in the central hub are deleted.\n*   Attached objects are rotated to align radially, facing \"outward\" from the center.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "The first step was to identify the little four\u2011armed \u201chub\u201d in the input. In all of the examples the hub consists of four two\u2011cell arms around a 2\u00d72 block of background: a two\u2011cell horizontal arm one row above the empty block (top port), a two\u2011cell horizontal arm one row below (bottom port), and two vertical two\u2011cell arms one column to the left and right (left and right ports). In the test grid that configuration occurs at rows\u00a011\u201314 and columns\u00a014\u201317:\n\n- top arm: row\u00a011, cols\u00a015\u201316 are `1`\n- bottom arm: row\u00a014, cols\u00a015\u201316 are `6`\n- left arm: col\u00a014, rows\u00a012\u201313 are `4`\n- right arm: col\u00a017, rows\u00a012\u201313 are `2`\n- the 2\u00d72 centre at rows\u00a012\u201313, cols\u00a015\u201316 is `8`\n\nThe colours present in the hub are therefore {1,2,4,6}; all `3`s are deleted.\n\nFor each hub colour, all other cells of that colour were collected, their pattern rotated so that the side adjacent to the hub port has two filled cells aligned with the port, and the pattern placed flush against the appropriate side of the hub. For rotation selection, only orientations with the correct aspect (vertical for left/right ports, horizontal for top/bottom) are considered; among them the rotation that gives full contact with the two port cells and the fewest extra filled cells on the facing side is chosen.\n\nApplying this to the test grid:\n\n- Colour\u202f1 peripheral object (rows\u00a02\u20135, cols\u00a018\u201320) is rotated 90\u00b0 clockwise and attached above the top port.\n- Colour\u202f2 peripheral objects (rows\u00a04\u20137, cols\u00a03\u20136) are rotated 90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise and attached to the right of the right port.\n- Colour\u202f4 peripheral object (rows\u00a015\u201317, cols\u00a021\u201324) is rotated 90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise and attached to the left of the left port.\n- Colour\u202f6 peripheral object (rows\u00a018\u201323, cols\u00a010\u201313) is rotated 90\u00b0 clockwise and attached below the bottom port.\n\nAll other non\u2011hub coloured cells are removed, the hub arms remain in place, and the background stays `8`.\n\nThe resulting 24\u00d726 output grid is:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The central structure acts as a \"hub\" with four color-coded docking ports (Top, Bottom, Left, Right).\n*   Peripheral objects move to attach to the side of the hub that matches their own color.\n*   Peripheral objects with colors *not* found in the central hub are deleted.\n*   Attached objects are rotated to align radially, facing \"outward\" from the center.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Based on the three solved examples, the key observation is the presence of a small four\u2011port \u201chub\u201d composed of four different colours. The ports are always two cells long and arranged as a cross around a 2\u00d72 empty centre. The colours present on these four ports determine which peripheral objects are kept; any colour not present on the hub is discarded. Peripheral objects are the union of all other cells of a given hub colour outside the hub area. These are moved in one piece and attached adjacent to the matching port. When attaching, the object is centred on the port along the perpendicular axis. For vertical ports (left/right) the object is rotated by 90\u00b0 if it is wider than it is tall, otherwise it is left unrotated; for horizontal ports (top/bottom) it is rotated here so that the top object (colour\u202f1) is turned through 180\u00b0 and the bottom object (colour\u202f6) likewise, placing their bottoms immediately above or their tops immediately below the port row. The hub itself remains in place; all other cells are reset to 8.\n\nApplying this to the test grid, the hub is at rows\u202f11\u201314 and columns\u202f13\u201316 with colours top\u202f1, bottom\u202f6, left\u202f4 and right\u202f2. The peripheral shapes are collected, rotated as described, and placed adjacent to their ports. The resulting 24\u00d726 output grid is:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,1,1,8,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,4,8,8,2,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,4,8,8,2,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,6,6,8,2,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

(locations, orientations, bounding boxes)\n* What changes from input to output? (additions, removals, movements)\n* What stays the same?

            "Full raw LLM response": "**My analysis focuses on a set of visual examples showcasing a rule-based transformation.**  The primary goal is to extract generalizable insights, categorize the transformations, pinpoint non-obvious details, hypothesize the underlying rule, propose algorithmic checks to validate the rule, and summarize the key findings.\n\nI began by visually inspecting the provided input-output grid pairs.  The central structure in each case is a multi-colored \"hub\" with four distinct colored segments.  Surrounding this hub are various monochromatic shapes. The rule seems to be based on color matching: peripheral objects \"dock\" with the hub segment of the same color.  Objects lacking a matching colored segment in the hub are deleted, effectively acting as \"noise removal\".  The position of a peripheral object in the output is determined by the location of its matching color segment in the hub, implying a spatial mapping based on the cardinal directions (North, South, East, West).\n\nI've categorized the transformations as object movement, noise removal, and the introduction of an anchor location (the central hub).  No recoloring, bordering, or size-based filtering are observed.  There may be a form of rotation to consider.\n\nA crucial insight emerged: the orientation of the objects changes during the transformation.  They don't just translate; they also rotate to align with the hub. It appears the rotation aligns an object to \"face outwards\" or have its flattest edge in contact with the central hub.\n\nThe non-obvious insights highlight the role of the central hub as a multi-port receiver, color-matching as the decision filter, and the strict spatial mapping. The rule itself can be generalized as follows: identify the central multi-colored hub, then move all matching-color objects to touch the corresponding-color hub segment, rotating the object to align outwards.\n\nTo validate this rule algorithmically, several checks are proposed: identifying the central hub as the largest connected component, enumerating the colors to check for a 1-to-1 mapping logic, verifying the removal of unmatched objects, analyzing the contact points for snapping alignment, and checking object rotation against input object masks.\n\nThe summary of final insights emphasizes the hub's role as a color-based dock, the snapping nature of the movement, the color-matching rule as a validity filter, and the object rotation to align with the dock direction.\n\n\nBased on the visual analysis of the provided training examples, here is the breakdown of the transformation logic.\n\n### **1. Describe the observable structures**\n\n*   **Objects:**\n    *   **Central Hub:** In every input, there is a centrally located, multi-colored composite shape. It appears to be constructed of four distinct colored segments arranged around a center point (or forming a ring/cross). The colors of these segments vary between examples.\n    *   **Peripheral Shapes:** Scattered around the background are various smaller, monochromatic shapes (T-shapes, C-shapes, U-shapes, rectangles).\n    *   **Background:** A solid light blue color.\n*   **Arrangement:** The central hub is fixed in the middle. The peripheral shapes are placed randomly in the surrounding space, not aligned with the hub initially.\n*   **Changes:**\n    *   Some peripheral shapes move from their original positions to touch the central hub.\n    *   Some peripheral shapes disappear entirely.\n    *   The orientation (rotation) of the moving shapes changes in the output.\n*   **Stays the same:** The central hub remains in the center, and its internal color arrangement is preserved (it acts as an anchor). The background color is constant.\n\n### **2. Identify transformation categories**\n\n*   **Object movement:** **Present** (This is the primary mechanic).\n*   **Object recoloring:** **Absent** (Colors are preserved and used for matching).\n*   **Bordering / outlining:** **Absent**.\n*   **Filling holes or cavities:** **Absent**.\n*   **Removing noise / extracting main shape:** **Present** (Unmatched shapes are removed).\n*   **Copying / pasting / repositioning:** **Present**.\n*   **Using a key anchor location:** **Present** (The central hub is the anchor).\n*   **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors:** **Absent**.\n*   **Size-based filtering or selection:** **Absent**.\n*   **Symmetry or reflection operations:** **Maybe** (Rotation/orientation adjustment occurs).\n*   **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion:** **Absent**.\n*   **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping:** **Absent**.\n\n### **3. Extract the key non-obvious insights**\n\n*   **Color-Coded Docking:** The transformation is driven entirely by **color matching**. A peripheral object only moves if its color matches one of the four segments of the central hub.\n*   **Directional Mapping:** The destination of a moving object is determined by the *position* of the matching color in the hub. If the blue segment of the hub is on the *left* (Input 2), the blue object moves to the *left*. If the blue segment is on the *bottom* (Input 3), the blue object moves to the *bottom*.\n*   **Filtering Mechanism:** Objects that do not possess a color present in the central hub are treated as \"distractions\" or \"noise\" and are deleted (e.g., the yellow shape in Input 1).\n*   **Radial Alignment/Rotation:** Objects do not just translate; they rotate to align with the hub. Specifically, they seem to rotate so that their \"top\" or dominant feature faces **outwards**, away from the center. (Example: In Input 2, the upright Blue 'T' moves to the left and rotates 90\u00b0 counter-clockwise so the top of the 'T' points left, away from the hub).\n\n### **4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)**\n\nThe task acts as a **color-based magnetic docking system**. The central object serves as a multi-port \"hub\" where each side (Top, Bottom, Left, Right) defines a specific receptor color. The system scans the surrounding area for objects matching these receptor colors.\n1.  If a surrounding object matches a hub color, it is \"snapped\" to the corresponding side of the hub.\n2.  During the snap, the object is rotated so that it faces outward relative to the center (radial orientation).\n3.  Any surrounding objects whose colors do not match any segment of the hub are discarded/erased.\n\n### **5. List checks you would perform when solving**\n\n*   **Check Hub Colors:** Identify the distinct colors in the central cluster and their relative cardinal directions (N, S, E, W).\n*   **Verify Candidates:** List all other objects and check if their single color exists in the Hub's color set.\n*   **Confirm Deletion:** Ensure that in the training examples, *every* removed object had a color completely absent from the central hub.\n*   **Determine Attachment Logic:** Does the object simply touch the hub, or does it overlap? (Visuals suggest touching/adjacent).\n*   **Analyze Rotation:** Compare the input mask of a shape to its output mask to determine if it consistently rotates 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, or 270\u00b0 based on which side of the hub it attaches to (e.g., Left attachment = -90\u00b0 rotation).\n\n### **6. Summarize final insights**\n\nHINT_START\n*   The central structure acts as a \"hub\" with four color-coded docking ports (Top, Bottom, Left, Right).\n*   Peripheral objects move to attach to the side of the hub that matches their own color.\n*   Peripheral objects with colors *not* found in the central hub are deleted.\n*   Attached objects are rotated to align radially, facing \"outward\" from the center.\nHINT_END",

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task Solution: Deep Dive**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of this ARC problem. I'm seeing three examples and a test input \u2013 the usual routine. My goal is to figure out the transformation and then apply it.\n\n**Initial Assessment:**\n\n*   **Input**: It's a grid of numbers from 0 to 9.\n*   **Task**:  I need to decode a pattern from the examples and apply that to the new input.\n\nThere's this XML snippet with objects. The description of these \"objects\" (cross\\_plus, etc) doesn't seem directly relevant, based on a preliminary glance. The hint talks about a \"Central 4x4 hollow frame,\" and a specific transformation based on that. I'm going to *verify* this hint against what I actually see in the examples.  I have to rely on the data first, and if there is conflict I trust the data.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\n*   **Input**: I see a grid with scattered colored objects and this central area. There's a set of colored \"bars\" forming something like a square.\n    *   The coordinates indicate a structure.\n    *   It looks like the central setup is `6,6` at the top, `1,1` at the bottom, `3,3` on the left and `2,2` on the right.\n*   **Output**: The external colored objects appear to have moved towards the center and reshaped.\n    *   That central structure is the 4 colored sides, `6,6` top, `1,1` bottom, `3,3` left, `2,2` right, around a 2x2 empty space.\n    *   The text describes something like a \"Filter\" to remove objects.\n    *   I see a central 4x4 with the colors being pulled in from other objects.\n    *   It matches. If the outer objects' colors are not in the list of frame colors, they get filtered out.\n    *   I also see what the hint calls \"Vertical growth... reshape into a rectangle of width 2\".\n    *   I observe the horizontal sides of the frame: top(6) and bottom(1).\n    *   I observe what the hint calls \"Horizontal Growth... reshape into a 4-row high symmetric polygon\".\n    *   I see the vertical sides: left(3) and right(2).\n*   **Transformation**: The objects are being \"merged\" with the frame. Non-matching objects are removed.\n    *   The \"frame\" is indeed a central 4x4 area with colored sides and a 2x2 hole in the middle.\n    *   The Green (3) object on the left, now forms a shape left of the frame.\n        *   It turns into a symmetric polygon with a height of 4 rows and the same mass.\n    *   The Red (2) object on the right, also grows/transforms.\n    *   The hint is pretty spot on.\n    *   The magenta and blue frame sides (6 and 1) remain unchanged.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n\n*   **Input**: Another grid.\n    *   I am looking for the \"frame\".\n    *   I locate the \"frame\" (rows 7-10, cols 7-10).\n    *   The colors are Green(3), Yellow(4), Blue(1), and Red(2).\n    *   I've located some objects too.\n*   **Output**:\n    *   The central 4x4 frame remains.\n    *   The top (Green) object is now a width 2, height 3 rectangle *above* the frame top side, and the bottom (Yellow) isn't.\n    *   The Blue object to the left: A 4-row symmetric polygon.\n    *   The Red to the right: Another 4-row symmetric shape.\n*   **Observations**:\n    *   The hint's \"vertical growth\" is confirmed: it looks like rectangles, not random placements.\n\n**Example 3 Analysis:**\n\n*   **Input**: The frame, this time with top Blue, bottom Green, left Red, right Orange.\n    *   Objects: a Blue cluster, a Green cluster, a Red cluster, and an Orange cluster.\n*   **Output**:  The transformation is repeated again!\n    *   The Blue (top) and Green (bottom) objects transform into vertical rectangles of mass equal the sum of their mass and the frame side mass.\n    *   The Red and Orange transform into symmetrical polygons (height 4).\n    *   My mass calculations match up.\n\n**Pattern Emerges: Transformation Logic**\n\n1\n\nTo solve this challenge, I will first analyze the provided examples to reverse-engineer the transformation logic, focusing on how objects in the grid are processed relative to a central structure.\n\n### Analysis of Logic\n\n1.  **Identify the Frame**: In every example, there is a central 4x4 bounding box composed of colored \"sides\" enclosing a 2x2 empty (background color 8) hole.\n    *   The frame consists of four segments:\n        *   **Top Side**: A horizontal pair (width 2) at row $r$, columns $c+1, c+2$.\n        *   **Bottom Side**: A horizontal pair (width 2) at row $r+3$, columns $c+1, c+2$.\n        *   **Left Side**: A vertical pair (height 2) at rows $r+1, r+2$, column $c$.\n        *   **Right Side**: A vertical pair (height 2) at rows $r+1, r+2$, column $c+3$.\n    *   The corners $(r, c), (r, c+3), (r+3, c), (r+3, c+3)$ are typically background.\n\n2.  **Filter and Merge Objects**:\n    *   The transformation looks for objects scattered in the grid that match the color of one of the frame's sides.\n    *   If an object matches a frame side's color, its \"mass\" (number of pixels) is calculated.\n    *   This object mass is added to the mass of the corresponding frame side (which is always 2 pixels).\n    *   Objects that do not match any frame side color are removed (replaced with background).\n\n3.  **Reshape and Grow**:\n    *   The merged mass (Object Mass + 2) is reshaped into a new geometric form attached to the central hole (i.e., replacing the frame side and growing outwards).\n    *   **Top/Bottom Sides (Vertical Growth)**:\n        *   The total mass $M$ is reshaped into a **vertical rectangle of width 2**.\n        *   The height $H$ is calculated as $H = M / 2$.\n        *   The rectangle is placed covering the frame side's columns ($c+1, c+2$) and extending outwards (Up for Top, Down for Bottom) from the hole.\n    *   **Left/Right Sides (Horizontal Growth)**:\n        *   The total mass $M$ is reshaped into a **symmetric polygon of height 4**, spanning the full vertical extent of the frame ($r$ to $r+3$).\n        *   The shape is defined by widths for each row: $w_1, w_2, w_2, w_1$ (top to bottom).\n        *   Based on examples:\n            *   Mass 10 implies widths 2, 3 ($2+3+3+2=10$).\n            *   Mass 12 implies widths 2, 4 ($2+4+4+2=12$).\n        *   The shape is placed covering the frame side's vertical span and extending outwards (Left for Left, Right for Right) from the hole. The frame side column becomes the \"base\" of the new shape.\n\n### Application to Test Input\n\n1.  **Locate Frame**:\n    *   Scanning the input grid, we find a frame structure centered around rows 12-13 and columns 14-15 (0-indexed).\n    *   **Top Side**: Row 11, Cols 14-15. Color **1 (Blue)**.\n    *   **Bottom Side**: Row 14, Cols 14-15. Color **6 (Magenta)**.\n    *   **Left Side**: Rows 12-13, Col 13. Color **4 (Yellow)**.\n    *   **Right Side**: Rows 12-13, Col 16. Color **2 (Red)**.\n    *   **Hole**: Rows 12-13, Cols 14-15 (Background 8).\n\n2.  **Process Objects**:\n    *   **Blue Object (Top Match)**: Located at top right. Mass count: Row 1(1) + Row 2(3) + Row 3(3) + Row 4(1) = 8.\n        *   Total Mass = 8 (Object) + 2 (Frame) = **10**.\n        *   Shape: Vertical Rectangle, Width 2. Height = 10 / 2 = **5**.\n        *   Position: Extends Up from Row 11. Rows 7-11, Cols 14-15.\n    *   **Magenta Object (Bottom Match)**: Located at bottom. Mass count: Row 18(1) + 19(1) + 20(4) + 21(4) + 22(1) + 23(1) = 12.\n        *   Total Mass = 12 (Object) + 2 (Frame) = **14**.\n        *   Shape: Vertical Rectangle, Width 2. Height = 14 / 2 = **7**.\n        *   Position: Extends Down from Row 14. Rows 14-20, Cols 14-15.\n    *   **Yellow Object (Left Match)**: Located at right (matches Left frame color).

 <object type=\"cross_plus\" colors=\"1,2,4,6,7\"/>\n    <object type=\"square_2x2\" colors=\"1,4,6\"/>\n    <object type=\"irregular_polyamino\" colors=\"1,2,3\"/>\n  </objects>\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1.  **Locate Frame**: Identify the central 4x4 hollow frame composed of four colored sides.\n2.  **Filter Objects**: Remove any objects whose color does not match one of the frame's sides.\n3.  **Merge & Reshape**: For each remaining object, merge it with the corresponding colored frame side.\n    *   **Vertical Growth**: For objects matching the Top/Bottom sides, reshape the total mass (object + frame side) into a rectangle of width 2 extending vertically outwards from the frame.\n    *   **Horizontal Growth**: For objects matching the Left/Right sides, reshape the total mass into a 4-row high symmetric polygon (e.g., widths 2-3-3-2 for mass 10) extending horizontally outwards from the frame.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that

sides.\n3.  **Merge & Reshape**: For each remaining object, merge it with the corresponding colored frame side.\n    *   **Vertical Growth**: For objects matching the Top/Bottom sides, reshape the total mass (object + frame side) into a rectangle of width 2 extending vertically outwards from the frame.\n    *   **Horizontal Growth**: For objects matching the Left/Right sides, reshape the total mass into a 4-row high symmetric polygon (e.g., widths 2-3-3-2 for mass 10) extending horizontally outwards from the frame.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Find the 4\u00d74 colored frame**\n\n   In all examples there is a single 4\u00d74 \u201chollow\u201d frame:  \n   a 4\u00d74 block whose corners and center are background (8), but whose four sides are colored:\n\n   ```\n   [8, T, T, 8]\n   [L, 8, 8, R]\n   [L, 8, 8, R]\n   [8, B, B, 8]\n   ```\n\n   For the test input, scanning for this pattern gives:\n\n   - Rows 10\u201313 (0\u2011based) and columns 13\u201316:\n\n     ```\n     r10: [8,1,1,8]\n     r11: [4,8,8,2]\n     r12: [4,8,8,2]\n     r13: [8,6,6,8]\n     ```\n\n   Thus:\n   - Top side (T): color **1** at (10,14\u201315)\n   - Left side (L): color **4** at (11\u201312,13)\n   - Right side (R): color **2** at (11\u201312,16)\n   - Bottom side (B): color **6** at (13,14\u201315)\n\n   The frame colors are `{1,2,4,6}`.\n\n2. **Filter objects by color**\n\n   All cells of colors not in `{1,2,4,6}` are removed.  \n   Here, that means all **3**s disappear.\n\n   For the frame colors, we **do not** keep the original shapes from the input; instead we:\n   - combine each color\u2019s side segment of the frame with\n   - all other cells of that same color elsewhere in the grid,\n   then reshape that total mass into a canonical shape attached to the frame.\n\n3. **Count total mass per frame color**\n\n   Including frame sides:\n\n   - Color 1:\n     - Remote: r1 c17 (1), r2 c17\u201319 (3), r3 c17\u201319 (3), r4 c17 (1) => 8 cells\n     - Frame top side: r10 c14\u201315 => 2 cells  \n     - **Total T\u2081 = 10**\n\n   - Color 2:\n     - Remote: r3 c3\u20134 (2), r4 c3\u20134 (2), r5 c3\u20134 (2), r6 c2 & c5 (2) => 8 cells\n     - Frame right side: r11 c16, r12 c16 => 2 cells  \n     - **Total T\u2082 = 10**\n\n   - Color 4:\n     - Remote: r14 c20 & c23 (2), r15 c20\u201323 (4), r16 c22\u201323 (2) => 8 cells\n     - Frame left side: r11\u201312 c13 => 2 cells  \n     - **Total T\u2084 = 10**\n\n   - Color 6:\n     - Remote: r17 c12, r18 c12, r19 c9\u201312 (4), r20 c9\u201312 (4), r21 c12, r22 c12 => 12 cells\n     - Frame bottom side: r13 c14\u201315 => 2 cells  \n     - **Total T\u2086 = 14**\n\n4. **Vertical reshaping for top/bottom sides (colors 1 and 6)**\n\n   From examples, top and bottom sides are reshaped into **vertical rectangles of width 2**, with height equal to total_mass / 2, attached to the frame side and extending outward.\n\n   - **Top (color 1)**  \n     Side: row 10, cols 14\u201315.  \n     Total T\u2081 = 10 \u21d2 height H\u2081 = 10 / 2 = 5.\n\n     So we make a 2\u2011wide vertical bar from row 6 up to row 10:\n\n     - Rows 6\u201310, columns 14\u201315 = 1.\n\n   - **Bottom (color 6)**  \n     Side: row 13, cols 14\u201315.  \n     Total T\u2086 = 14 \u21d2 height H\u2086 = 14 / 2 = 7.\n\n     So we make a 2\u2011wide vertical bar from row 13 down to row 19:\n\n     - Rows 13\u201319, columns 14\u201315 = 6.\n\n5. **Horizontal reshaping for left/right sides (colors 4 and 2)**\n\n   Left and right sides become **4\u2011row\u2011high symmetric horizontal polygons**, attached to their respective sides and extending outward.\n\n   The vertical span for both left and right polygons is:\n   - Side rows are 11 and 12, so span is rows 10\u201313.\n\n   Total mass for each: T\u2082 = 10, T\u2084 = 10.\n\n   From the training tasks, for T = 10 there are two observed symmetric patterns over 4 rows:\n   - widths 2\u20133\u20133\u20132\n   - widths 1\u20134\u20134\u20131\n\n   The choice depends on the remote object\u2019s shape. For the test:\n   - Remote 4\u2019s form a 3\u00d74 \u201cplus\u201d-like shape (height 3), resembling the 10\u2011cell cases that use widths **2\u20133\u20133\u20132**.\n   - Remote 2\u2019s span 4 rows (taller cluster), matching the case that used widths **1\u20134\u20134\u20131**.\n\n   So:\n\n   - **Left side (color 4)**, column c\u2084 = 13, rows 11\u201312:\n     - Pattern widths (top to bottom over rows 10\u201313): 2, 3, 3, 2.\n\n     For left\u2011side polygons, from the examples:\n     - mid rows (rows 11\u201312) include the side column and extend left,\n       with offsets from the side column: `[-(w\u2081-1) .. 0]`.\n     - outer rows (rows 10 and 13) occupy w\u2080 cells starting at offset \u22123.\n\n     Here w\u2080 = 2, w\u2081 = 3.\n\n     So columns:\n\n     - Row 10: offsets \u22123, \u22122 \u2192 columns 10,11 = 4\n     - Row 11: offsets \u22122, \u22121, 0 \u2192 columns 11,12,13 = 4\n     - Row 12: same as row 11 \u2192 columns 11,12,13 = 4\n     - Row 13: offsets \u22123, \u22122 \u2192 columns 10,11 = 4\n\n   - **Right side (color 2)**, column c\u2082 = 16, rows 11\u201312:\n     - Pattern widths: 1, 4, 4, 1 (top to bottom over rows 10\u201313).\n       So w\u2080 = 1, w\u2081 = 4.\n\n     For right\u2011side polygons, examples show:\n     - mid rows (11\u201312): offsets 0..(w\u2081\u22121)\n     - outer rows (10 and 13): offsets (w\u2081\u22121) .. (w\u2081\u22121 + w\u2080\u22121)\n\n     Hence:\n\n     - Row 10: offset +3 \u2192 column 16+3 = 19 = 2\n     - Row 11: offsets 0..3 \u2192 columns 16,17,18,19 = 2\n     - Row 12: same as row 11 \u2192 columns 16,17,18,19 = 2\n     - Row 13: offset +3 \u2192 column 19 = 2\n\n6. **Everything else**\n\n   - All original objects with colors not in `{1,2,4,6}` (i.e. all 3\u2019s) are deleted.\n   - All original 1,2,4,6 cells *outside* these new shapes are deleted.\n   - The background 8 remains elsewhere.\n\n   So the output is a blank 8\u2011grid with these four reshaped objects drawn in.\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\nHere is the completed 24\u00d726 output grid:\n\nRow 0\u20135 and 20\u201323 are all 8.\n\n```text\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

                "response": "**Analysis and Synthesis of Grid Data**\n\nOkay, so the task is to describe the objects within these grids, and I need to avoid inferring any kind of rules or relationships. It's just a straightforward description of what's there, focusing on object types and attributes, with a specific output format. Good. Let's dig in.\n\nThe first thing I notice is that the background in every grid is color 8. That's consistent. Now, for the objects themselves, it's clear that they are distinct clusters of non-8 pixels against this uniform background. Looking at each grid, I'm seeing a range of shapes. It appears that the shapes are isolated; they aren't touching or overlapping. This means that each colored cluster is a discrete object.\n\nI'm starting to see some patterns emerge. There's a common shape that I'm calling a \"cross\" or \"plus\" sign. It's got a central pixel and four arms, going up, down, left, and right. Sometimes these crosses are extended, forming what look like lines of three pixels. Color 2 seems to like this cross shape, but I've also observed it in colors 7, 6, and even 4 and 1.\n\nAnother common shape is a small, compact 2x2 square. It's often color 1, but I've also seen it in color 4 and 6. Then there are these irregular shapes, blobs and polyominoes, they don't have perfect symmetry. They look like \"L\" shapes, \"T\" shapes, or random-looking clusters. Color 3 appears quite frequently in these irregular forms, but I've seen them with other colors too, like 1 and 2. Sometimes they look like glider shapes from some well-known games.\n\nSo, it's pretty simple actually. We have a background color (8) and various isolated, multi-pixel shapes. The colors used for these shapes are limited to 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7. The shapes themselves break down into a few categories: compact 2x2 squares, cross or plus shapes, and irregular blobs. It\u2019s pretty straightforward, nothing terribly complex. These should be easily describable with the provided numeric color values and shape categories.\n\nOkay, let me craft that `<objects_summary>` now.\n\n```xml\n<objects_summary>\n  <background color=\"8\"/>\n  <objects>\n    <object type=\"cross_plus\" colors=\"1,2,4,6,7\"/>\n    <object type=\"square_2x2\" colors=\"1,4,6\"/>\n    <object type=\"irregular_polyamino\" colors=\"1,2,3\"/>\n  </objects>\n</objects_summary>\n```\n\n\nThe grids generally depict a sparse arrangement of distinct, colored geometric shapes set against a uniform background.\n\n**Background:**\nThe entire field of every grid is filled with **color 8** (teal). This serves as the canvas upon which other objects are placed.\n\n**Foreground Objects:**\nScattered throughout the background are isolated clusters of pixels in various colors. These objects do not touch each other and act as independent entities. They can be categorized by their shapes:\n\n1.  **Crosses or Plus Signs:** Many objects are shaped like a 'plus' sign (+) or a diamond. These usually consist of a central pixel with arms extending up, down, left, and right. This shape appears frequently in **color 2**, **color 6**, **color 7**, and sometimes **color 4**.\n2.  **Compact Squares:** Several objects appear as small, solid 2x2 pixel blocks. This morphology is commonly seen with **color 1**, **color 4**, and **color 6**.\n3.  **Irregular Polyaminoes:** Some objects are asymmetrical or form shapes resembling letters (like 'L' or 'T') or small amorphous blobs. **Color 3** frequently appears as these irregular, small clusters. Larger irregular shapes are also seen in **color 1** and **color 2** in specific instances.\n\n**Attributes:**\n*   **Colors involved:** The foreground objects utilize **color 1**, **color 2**, **color 3**, **color 4**, **color 6**, and **color 7**.\n*   **Positioning:** The objects are placed at various coordinates across the grid, with no immediately obvious alignment pattern (some are central, some distinct, some near edges).\n\n<objects_summary>\n1.

                "response": "**Here's my thought process as I tackled this challenge:**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to break down these grid transformations. They're an expert, so I need to provide a very detailed and accurate description of the underlying logic. I see a pattern of input grids and output grids, and the user likely wants me to identify the rules. The user also gave me a hint `<objects_summary>` so I'll keep that in mind.\n\n**Initial Assessment:**\n\nI need to analyze the input grids to see what kinds of objects they contain and how these objects are changed (or removed) in the output. I can't just jump in and describe a single transformation, I need a comprehensive process that takes all of the examples into account. I should also note that the prompt is structured in a similar way to past prompts, with initial information followed by more specific examples.\n\n**Going Deep into the First Example:**\n\nI'll start with the first example, carefully examining the initial input grid to identify shapes, their colors, and their positions. I'll note how the colors are numerically represented. This includes finding the \"background\" color as well. I'll need to look at both the overall grid and at the prompt description of the objects.  The description is a bit unfinished, but I should be able to finish it if I can figure out the shapes. I realize the user is likely guiding me toward an analysis. It\u2019s useful to see the structure of the input, the shape and size of each object, the numeric representation of the objects and the background and the relationship between each of the shapes in the grid.\n\n**Uncovering the Objects and the Pattern:**\n\nI need to meticulously identify all the objects:  their shape, color, location in the grid.  I need to classify these objects and relate this to the XML hint. I'm noting the positions of each distinct, colored object, which I'll call shapes. I'm realizing that not all the objects will stay put. It's a combination of shape identification, location, and color in the process.\n\n**Hypothesis: Frame and Aggregation**\n\nMy hypothesis so far is that there's a specific pattern, possibly involving some objects disappearing, while others combine. I think the examples are leading to this insight. It feels like some objects are \"attracted\" to a frame.\n\n**Verifying with the Second Example:**\n\nTo test this hypothesis, I'll go through the second example, which includes more elements and different colored objects. I'll check my assumptions.\n\n**Expanding the Analysis and Finding the \"Rule\":**\n\nI need to figure out how each input element is transformed (moved, rotated, changed in form). The process is like a jigsaw puzzle, and the rules are the pieces. What is the relation between the input shape and the output? This is where I go deeper and I will need to look closely at the positions and shapes of each of the colors. I will compare each example to each other to see how they change the shapes, while maintaining the overall layout of the input.\n\n**A Refined Transformation Rule:**\n\nThe transformation has two parts. The first part is an alignment, where everything moves to a specific location. The second part is a deformation, where the new location changes the way the input is organized. The objects are first, brought together, the changed into a specific shape.\n\n**Test Input Analysis and Predictions:**\n\nI am now using the test input. It's time to refine the pattern: to identify the \"frame\" and the objects. This is when I use the \"expert\" knowledge, to find the \"best guess\" or explanation. I make predictions of the output, based on my understanding of the rule.\n\n**The Object Description XML:**\n\nI will now create the XML-formatted description of objects, based on my findings. It's critical to capture the key features, size, and positions of the objects that will affect the transformations. This also is a test of my understanding. I have to make my description specific.\n\n**Final Summary and Detailed Description**\n\nAfter I create the XML format, I provide a clear, concise summary of the entire transformation process. The goal is to provide a complete understanding of the steps. The user is familiar with these transformations, so my explanation must be precise and efficient. I have to avoid unnecessary details and repetition, but also make sure that nothing is lost. I must make sure it is not missing any details about the objects, how they move and how they change.\n\n\nThe provided examples illustrate a transformation where scattered objects of specific colors are moved and reshaped to attach to a central multicolor \"frame\".\n\nHere are the identified transformations:\n\n1.  **Frame Identification**: In each input grid, there is a central 4x4 hollow square structure (the \"frame\") composed of four colored bars (sides), each 2 pixels long.\n    *   **Test Input Frame**:\n        *   Top side (Row 11): Blue (1), width 2.\n        *   Bottom side (Row 14): Magenta (6), width 2.\n        *   Left side (Rows 12-13): Yellow (4), height 2.\n        *   Right side (Rows 12-13): Red (2), height 2.\n\n2.  **Object Association & Movement**: Other independent objects in the grid are identified. Objects that share a color with one of the frame's sides are moved to attach to that corresponding side.\n    *   The Blue object (1) moves to the Top side.\n    *   The Magenta object (6) moves to the Bottom side.\n    *   The Yellow object (4) moves to the Left side.\n    *   The Red object (2) moves to the Right side.\n\n3.  **Object Removal**: Objects that do not match the color of any frame side are removed from the grid.\n    *   In Example 1, the Yellow object was removed because the frame had no Yellow side.\n    *   In the Test Input, the Green object (3) will be removed as the frame has no Green side.\n\n4.  **Mass Aggregation**: The total \"mass\" (number of pixels) of the resulting attached shape is the sum of the original object's pixels and the frame side's pixels. Mass is conserved.\n    *   **Blue**: Input (8 pixels) + Frame (2 pixels) = 10 pixels.\n    *   **Magenta**: Input (12 pixels) + Frame (2 pixels) = 14 pixels.\n    *   **Yellow**: Input (8 pixels) + Frame (2 pixels) = 10 pixels.\n    *   **Red**: Input (8 pixels) + Frame (2 pixels) = 10 pixels.\n\n5.  **Reshaping & Docking**: The aggregated mass is reshaped into a symmetric structure extending outwards from the frame side.\n    *   **Top/Bottom Sides (Horizontal)**: The mass forms a solid vertical rectangle of **width 2** (matching the frame side).\n        *   Blue (Top, Mass 10): Forms a 2x5 rectangle extending upwards from the frame.\n        *   Magenta (Bottom, Mass 14): Forms a 2x7 rectangle extending downwards from the frame.\n    *   **Left/Right Sides (Vertical)**: The mass forms a symmetric 4-row high \"gem\" or trapezoidal shape attached to the vertical frame side.\n        *   The shape is vertically symmetric. The two middle rows correspond to the frame side rows, and one row is added above and below.\n        *   **Yellow (Left, Mass 10)**: Likely forms a 2-3-3-2 width pattern (or similar compact symmetric shape like 2-3-3-2), extending to the left.\n        *   **Red (Right, Mass 10)**: Likely forms a 2-3-3-2 width pattern, extending to the right. The \"tips\" (top and bottom rows of the shape) are often positioned at the outer edge of the shape (furthest from the frame).\n\n<transformation_summary>\n1.  **Locate Frame**: Identify the central 4x4 hollow frame composed of four colored sides.\n2.  **Filter Objects**: Remove any objects whose color does not match one of the frame's sides.\n3.  **Merge & Reshape**: For each remaining object, merge it with the corresponding colored frame side.\n    *   **Vertical Growth**: For objects matching the Top/Bottom sides, reshape the total mass (object + frame side) into a rectangle of width 2 extending vertically outwards from the frame.\n    *   **Horizontal Growth**: For objects matching the Left/Right sides, reshape the total mass into a 4-row high symmetric polygon (e.g., widths 2-3-3-2 for mass 10) extending horizontally outwards from the frame.\n</transformation_summary>",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n` now.\n\n```xml\n<objects_summary>\n  <background color=\"8\"/>\n  <objects>\n    <object type=\"cross_plus\" colors=\"1,2,4,6,7\"/>\n    <object type=\"square_2x2\" colors=\"1,4,6\"/>\n    <object type=\"irregular_polyamino\" colors=\"1,2,3\"/>\n  </objects>\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1.  **Locate Frame**: Identify the central 4x4 hollow frame composed of four colored sides.\n2.  **Filter Objects**: Remove any objects whose color does not match one of the frame's sides.\n3.  **Merge & Reshape**: For each remaining object, merge it with the corresponding colored frame side.\n    *   **Vertical Growth**: For objects matching the Top/Bottom sides, reshape the total mass (object + frame side) into a rectangle of width 2 extending vertically outwards from the frame.\n    *   **Horizontal Growth**: For objects matching the Left/Right sides, reshape the total mass into a 4-row high symmetric polygon (e.g., widths 2-3-3-2 for mass 10) extending horizontally outwards from the frame.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain two main object types against a color 8 background: (1) A central directional marker composed of four separate 2-cell line segments arranged in cardinal directions around a gap, each segment a different color from {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}; and (2) Standalone irregular shapes including plus/cross shapes, T-shapes (various orientations), L-shapes, rectangular blocks, and short line segments. All objects are contiguous single-color regions ranging from 2-12 cells, using colors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Identify the central directional marker with 4 colored segments (colors vary: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7)\n2. For each standalone shape in the grid:\n   - If its color matches the TOP segment color \u2192 rotate 90\u00b0 CCW and place above the marker\n   - If its color matches the BOTTOM segment color \u2192 rotate 90\u00b0 CCW and place below the marker\n   - If its color matches the LEFT segment color \u2192 rotate 90\u00b0 CW and place left of the marker\n   - If its color matches the RIGHT segment color \u2192 rotate 90\u00b0 CCW and place right of the marker\n   - If its color doesn't match any marker segment \u2192 remove it\n3. Shapes are positioned adjacent to their corresponding marker segment, extending outward\n4. The central marker segments (4 separate 2-cell colored segments) remain in their original positions\n5. All other cells become background color 8\n6. Shapes may overlap/merge with their corresponding marker segment since they share the same color\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Problem Decomposition and Solution Strategy**\n\nThe user has given me an ARC task involving transforming shapes based on a central directional marker. My first step is to carefully analyze the input, breaking it down into its core components: the background color, the marker, and the standalone shapes. I must establish the color values for the directions (Top, Bottom, Left, Right).  The description says there are four separate two-cell line segments. I'll need to figure out the rule for their arrangement and what the central gap or center is.\n\nMy primary focus then shifts to the transformation rules. For each standalone shape, there's a rotation and placement based on the color match with a marker segment. A key thing I need to do is to figure out the rotation direction (CW or CCW) and what it means to \"place\" a shape (placement means touching the marker). There could also be changes to the shape that are not explicitly stated.\n\n**In-Depth Analysis and Rule Extraction**\n\nI begin by examining example 1, meticulously tracing the coordinates of the shapes and segments and the changes between input and output. I determine the colors assigned to the top, bottom, left, and right segments of the marker. The marker essentially looks like a box with empty corners. The color of a shape determines which marker segment it interacts with and how it is transformed. If the color doesn't match a marker segment color, the standalone shape is removed.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing Example 1, and reviewing Example 2 (especially the blue shape), I hypothesized that the description might not be entirely accurate about the rotations. It became apparent that the \"rotation\" involves not just a simple geometric transformation but also a change in the shape itself. I have to find this rule. I see that the width or height of the transformed shapes may change.\n\nI then focus on the details of the transformation. I discover the transformation rules. If the shape color matches the left segment, rotate 90 degrees CW and place left of the marker. If the color matches the right, rotate 90 degrees CCW and place right. The top is 90 CCW and above. I have to confirm.\n\n**Addressing the \"Filling\" and \"Padding\" Pattern**\n\nI carefully examined example grids, and the fact that pixel counts weren't staying the same, as would be expected for simple rotations. The shapes are \"filled\" or \"modified.\" The \"filling\" involves extending the shape's side to meet or merge with the marker, effectively \"connecting\" the shape to the marker. I come up with the hypothesis: if there are gaps in the rotated shape, they are filled in.  The core rule is: After rotation, any row/col that touches the marker segment is made \"solid\".\n\nI test the \"filling\" hypothesis by checking different examples, including those with holes in the shape. I confirm that the holes are filled and that the width or height is adjusted. I have to think of the rule for extending those rows to the center, so it is just one solid block attached to the marker.\n\n**Finalizing the Transformation Logic**\n\nThe core rule is: After the described rotation, modify the shape (rows/cols) that aligns with the marker segment to make them \"solid.\"\n\nMy approach will be:\n\n1.  **Identify the Marker:** Locate the central marker within the grid.\n2.  **Color Mapping:** Map each marker segment color to its direction.\n3.  **Standalone Shape Detection:** Locate standalone shapes and compare their colors to the marker segment colors.\n4.  **Rotation:** Perform the appropriate rotation (CW or CCW) based on the color match.\n5.  **Placement and Filling:** Place the rotated shape adjacent to the marker in the correct direction, and fill the rows or columns connecting to the marker.\n6.  **Output Generation:** Construct the output grid by placing the transformed shapes and marker on a background.\n\n**Test Case Application**\n\nTo finalize my logic, I apply the extracted rules to generate output for the Test Input. I perform the rotations, placement and fill in the pixels. I double-check the coordinate math and make sure that the shapes are aligned correctly with the marker and the output grid size constraints. The grid coordinates (row/col) need to be adjusted by my rotation and fill rules.\n\n\nTo solve this task, we identify a central directional marker and several standalone shapes. We transform the shapes based on their color matching the segments of the marker.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Central Marker (Test Input):**\nThe marker is located centrally in the grid.\n- **Center Gap:** Rows 12-13, Cols 15-16.\n- **Top Segment (Color 1 - Blue):** Row 11, Cols 16-17.\n- **Left Segment (Color 4 - Yellow):** Rows 12-13, Col 14.\n- **Right Segment (Color 2 - Red):** Rows 12-13, Col 17.\n- **Bottom Segment (Color 6 - Magenta):** Row 14, Cols 15-16.\n\n**2. Analysis and Transformation of Standalone Shapes:**\n\n*   **Blue Shape (Color 1):**\n    *   **Original:** Located at top right. Shape is a 3x4 block with corners missing (rounded rectangle).\n    *   **Match:** Matches **TOP** segment.\n    *   **Transformation:** Rotate 90\u00b0 CCW and place above the marker.\n    *   **Rotated Shape:** The vertical rounded rectangle becomes a horizontal rounded rectangle (4x3).\n        ```\n        .11.\n        1111\n        .11.\n        ```\n    *   **Placement:** Above the top segment (Row 11). Centered horizontally.\n        *   Rows 8-10.\n        *   Cols 15-18. (Connects to marker at cols 16-17).\n\n*   **Yellow Shape (Color 4):**\n    *   **Original:** Bottom right. Shape like an 'H' or box with gaps.\n    *   **Match:** Matches **LEFT** segment.\n    *   **Transformation:** Rotate 90\u00b0 CW and place left of the marker.\n    *   **Rotated Shape:**\n        ```\n        .44\n        .44\n        44.\n        44.\n        ```\n    *   **Refinement (Filling):** The rows connecting to the marker (middle two) must be solid/connected. The gap in the second row of the rotated shape is filled to ensure connection.\n        *   Row 1: `.44` -> `444`\n        *   Row 2: `44.` -> `444`\n    *   **Final Shape:**\n        ```\n        .44\n        444\n        444\n        44.\n        ```\n    *   **Placement:** Left of the left segment (Col 14). Centered vertically.\n        *   Rows 11-14.\n        *   Cols 11-13.\n\n*   **Red Shape (Color 2):**\n    *   **Original:** Left side. Shape is a tall 'U' or bracket.\n    *   **Match:** Matches **RIGHT** segment.\n    *   **Transformation:** Rotate 90\u00b0 CCW and place right of the marker.\n    *   **Rotated Shape:**\n        ```\n        ...2\n        222.\n        222.\n        ...2\n        ```\n    *   **Refinement:** The connecting side (Left) is already solid (222.), so no filling needed.\n    *   **Placement:** Right of the right segment (Col 17). Centered vertically.\n        *   Rows 11-14.\n        *   Cols 18-21.\n\n*   **Magenta Shape (Color 6):**\n    *   **Original:** Bottom middle. Shape is a tall 'I' with a wide center.\n    *   **Match:** Matches **BOTTOM** segment.\n    *   **Transformation:** Rotate 90\u00b0 CCW and place below the marker.\n    *   **Rotated Shape:** Becomes a wide horizontal 'I'.\n        ```\n        ..66..\n        666666\n        666666\n        ..66..\n        ```\n    *   **Placement:** Below the bottom segment (Row 14). Centered horizontally.\n        *   Rows 15-18.\n        *   Cols 13-18.\n\n*   **Green Shape (Color 3):**\n    *   Matches no marker segment. **Removed.**\n\n**3. Construction of Output Grid:**\n*   Start with background color 8.\n*   Draw the central marker segments at their original positions.\n*   Draw the transformed shapes at their calculated positions.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,1,1,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain two main object types against a color 8 background: (1) A central directional marker composed of four separate 2-cell line segments arranged in cardinal directions around a gap, each segment a different color from {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}; and (2) Standalone irregular shapes including plus/cross shapes, T-shapes (various orientations), L-shapes, rectangular blocks, and short line segments. All objects are contiguous single-color regions ranging from 2-12 cells, using colors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Identify the central directional marker with 4 colored segments (colors vary: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7)\n2. For each standalone shape in the grid:\n   - If its color matches the TOP segment color \u2192 rotate 90\u00b0 CCW and place above the marker\n   - If its color matches the BOTTOM segment color \u2192 rotate 90\u00b0 CCW and place below the marker\n   - If its color matches the LEFT segment color \u2192 rotate 90\u00b0 CW and place left of the marker\n   - If its color matches the RIGHT segment color \u2192 rotate 90\u00b0 CCW and place right of the marker\n   - If its color doesn't match any marker segment \u2192 remove it\n3. Shapes are positioned adjacent to their corresponding marker segment, extending outward\n4. The central marker segments (4 separate 2-cell colored segments) remain in their original positions\n5. All other cells become background color 8\n6. Shapes may overlap/merge with their corresponding marker segment since they share the same color\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to:\n1. Identify the central directional marker with 4 colored 2-cell segments\n2. Identify standalone shapes matching each segment color\n3. Apply rotations and place them around the marker\n4. Remove shapes that don't match any segment color\n\n**Identifying the central marker in the test input:**\n- TOP (color 1): row 10, cols 14-15 (horizontal)\n- LEFT (color 4): rows 11-12, col 13 (vertical)\n- RIGHT (color 2): rows 11-12, col 16 (vertical)\n- BOTTOM (color 6): row 13, cols 14-15 (horizontal)\n\n**Identifying standalone shapes:**\n- Color 1 shape (rows 1-4, cols 17-19): Plus/cross shape \u2192 matches TOP\n- Color 4 shape (rows 14-16, cols 20-23): T-shape \u2192 matches LEFT\n- Color 2 shape (rows 3-6, cols 2-5): Complex shape \u2192 matches RIGHT\n- Color 6 shape (rows 17-22, cols 9-12): Cross shape \u2192 matches BOTTOM\n- Color 3 shape (rows 13-15, cols 3-5): No match \u2192 REMOVE\n\n**Applying transformations:**\n- **TOP (1)**: Rotate 90\u00b0 CCW, place above marker\n- **LEFT (4)**: Rotate 90\u00b0 CW, place left of marker  \n- **RIGHT (2)**: Rotate 90\u00b0 CW, place right of marker\n- **BOTTOM (6)**: Rotate 90\u00b0 CCW, place below marker\n\nAfter rotating and positioning each shape adjacent to its corresponding marker segment (shapes connect to/merge with markers of same color), the output is:\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,1,1,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,4,8,8,2,8,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,4,8,8,2,8,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,6,6,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain two main object types against a color 8 background: (1) A central directional marker composed of four separate 2-cell line segments arranged in cardinal directions around a gap, each segment a different color from {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}; and (2) Standalone irregular shapes including plus/cross shapes, T-shapes (various orientations), L-shapes, rectangular blocks, and short line segments. All objects are contiguous single-color regions ranging from 2-12 cells, using colors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Identify the central directional marker with 4 colored segments (colors vary: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7)\n2. For each standalone shape in the grid:\n   - If its color matches the TOP segment color \u2192 rotate 90\u00b0 CCW and place above the marker\n   - If its color matches the BOTTOM segment color \u2192 rotate 90\u00b0 CCW and place below the marker\n   - If its color matches the LEFT segment color \u2192 rotate 90\u00b0 CW and place left of the marker\n   - If its color matches the RIGHT segment color \u2192 rotate 90\u00b0 CCW and place right of the marker\n   - If its color doesn't match any marker segment \u2192 remove it\n3. Shapes are positioned adjacent to their corresponding marker segment, extending outward\n4. The central marker segments (4 separate 2-cell colored segments) remain in their original positions\n5. All other cells become background color 8\n6. Shapes may overlap/merge with their corresponding marker segment since they share the same color\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Transformation summary:\n\n- First, locate the central \u201cmarker\u201d: a 2\u00d72 hole of color 8 with four 2-cell arms (top, bottom, left, right) of different colors.  \n  In the test grid this marker is:\n\n  - Top arm (color 1): row 11, columns 15\u201316  \n  - Bottom arm (color 6): row 14, columns 15\u201316  \n  - Left arm (color 4): rows 12\u201313, column 14  \n  - Right arm (color 2): rows 12\u201313, column 17  \n  - The 2\u00d72 center (rows 12\u201313, cols 15\u201316) is all 8s.\n\n- For each color matching one of these four arm colors, collect all other cells of that color (excluding the marker arms). Treat the union for each color as one shape.\n\n- From the examples, the rotations inferred are:\n  - Shapes of the **top-arm color** (1) are rotated **180\u00b0** and placed directly above the top arm, centered horizontally over it, with the shape\u2019s bottom row touching the row immediately above the top arm.\n  - Shapes of the **bottom-arm color** (6) are rotated **90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise** and placed directly below the bottom arm, centered horizontally, with the shape\u2019s top row touching the row immediately below the bottom arm.\n  - Shapes of the **left-arm color** (4) are rotated **90\u00b0 clockwise** and placed to the left of the left arm, vertically centered, with the shape\u2019s rightmost column touching the column immediately left of the left arm.\n  - Shapes of the **right-arm color** (2) are rotated **90\u00b0 clockwise** and placed to the right of the right arm, vertically centered, with the shape\u2019s leftmost column touching the column immediately right of the right arm.\n\n- Colors not used in the marker (e.g. 3 in the test) are entirely removed.\n\n- The marker itself stays in place. The final grid is otherwise background color 8, with only:\n  - The unchanged marker arms.\n  - The four relocated, rotated shapes of colors 1, 2, 4, 6.\n\nApplying this to the test grid yields the following output.\n\n---\n\noutput:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain two main object types against a color 8 background: (1) A central directional marker composed of four separate 2-cell line segments arranged in cardinal directions around a gap, each segment a different color from {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}; and (2) Standalone irregular shapes including plus/cross shapes, T-shapes (various orientations), L-shapes, rectangular blocks, and short line segments. All objects are contiguous single-color regions ranging from 2-12 cells, using colors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Identify the central directional marker with 4 colored segments (colors vary: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7)\n2. For each standalone shape in the grid:\n   - If its color matches the TOP segment color \u2192 rotate 90\u00b0 CCW and place above the marker\n   - If its color matches the BOTTOM segment color \u2192 rotate 90\u00b0 CCW and place below the marker\n   - If its color matches the LEFT segment color \u2192 rotate 90\u00b0 CW and place left of the marker\n   - If its color matches the RIGHT segment color \u2192 rotate 90\u00b0 CCW and place right of the marker\n   - If its color doesn't match any marker segment \u2192 remove it\n3. Shapes are positioned adjacent to their corresponding marker segment, extending outward\n4. The central marker segments (4 separate 2-cell colored segments) remain in their original positions\n5. All other cells become background color 8\n6.

These include:\n- **Plus/Cross shapes**: Four arms extending from a central region\n- **T-shapes**: Three arms arranged in a T configuration (appearing in various rotations - upright, inverted, sideways)\n- **L-shapes**: Two perpendicular segments forming an L pattern\n- **Rectangular blocks**: Solid 2\u00d72, 2\u00d73, or 2\u00d74 regions\n- **Short line segments**: Horizontal or vertical pairs of 2 cells\n\n### Colors Used\nObjects use colors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7. Color 8 serves exclusively as the background.\n\n### Size and Connectivity\nIndividual shapes range from 2 cells (simple pairs) to approximately 8-12 cells for larger composite shapes. All shapes are contiguous (connected) regions of uniform color.\n\n<objects_summary>\nThe grids contain two main object types against a color 8 background: (1) A central directional marker composed of four separate 2-cell line segments arranged in cardinal directions around a gap, each segment a different color from {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}; and (2) Standalone irregular shapes including plus/cross shapes, T-shapes (various orientations), L-shapes, rectangular blocks, and short line segments. All objects are contiguous single-color regions ranging from 2-12 cells, using colors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7.\n</objects_summary>",

Objects Description\nThe grids contain two main object types against a color 8 background: (1) A central directional marker composed of four separate 2-cell line segments arranged in cardinal directions around a gap, each segment a different color from {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}; and (2) Standalone irregular shapes including plus/cross shapes, T-shapes (various orientations), L-shapes, rectangular blocks, and short line segments. All objects are contiguous single-color regions ranging from 2-12 cells, using colors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7.",
                "response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation rules.\n\n## Analysis\n\n### Central Directional Marker\nEach input has a central cross-shaped marker made of four 2-cell segments in cardinal directions, each a different color:\n- Top segment (horizontal)\n- Bottom segment (horizontal)  \n- Left segment (vertical)\n- Right segment (vertical)\n\n### Standalone Shapes\nVarious colored shapes exist elsewhere in the grid.\n\n## Transformation Rules Identified\n\n1. **Color-Direction Mapping**: Each standalone shape's color determines its destination direction based on the central marker:\n   - Shape with color matching TOP segment \u2192 placed above marker\n   - Shape with color matching BOTTOM segment \u2192 placed below marker\n   - Shape with color matching LEFT segment \u2192 placed to the left of marker\n   - Shape with color matching RIGHT segment \u2192 placed to the right of marker\n\n2. **Shape Rotation**: Shapes are rotated (typically 90\u00b0) so they extend outward from the marker:\n   - TOP shapes: rotated so wide part is at bottom (adjacent to marker), narrow part extends upward\n   - BOTTOM shapes: rotated so wide part is at top (adjacent to marker), narrow part extends downward\n   - LEFT shapes: rotated 90\u00b0 CW so extension points leftward\n   - RIGHT shapes: rotated 90\u00b0 CCW so extension points rightward\n\n3. **Positioning**: Shapes are placed adjacent to their corresponding marker segment, with alignment centered on the marker's position\n\n4. **Shape Removal**: Shapes whose color doesn't match any segment of the central marker are removed from the output\n\n5. **Marker Preservation**: The central marker's four segments remain in place\n\n6. **Background Preservation**: The center gap and all other areas remain as background color (8)\n\n<transformation_summary>\n1. Identify the central directional marker with 4 colored segments (colors vary: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7)\n2. For each standalone shape in the grid:\n   - If its color matches the TOP segment color \u2192 rotate 90\u00b0 CCW and place above the marker\n   - If its color matches the BOTTOM segment color \u2192 rotate 90\u00b0 CCW and place below the marker\n   - If its color matches the LEFT segment color \u2192 rotate 90\u00b0 CW and place left of the marker\n   - If its color matches the RIGHT segment color \u2192 rotate 90\u00b0 CCW and place right of the marker\n   - If its color doesn't match any marker segment \u2192 remove it\n3. Shapes are positioned adjacent to their corresponding marker segment, extending outward\n4. The central marker segments (4 separate 2-cell colored segments) remain in their original positions\n5. All other cells become background color 8\n6. Shapes may overlap/merge with their corresponding marker segment since they share the same color\n</transformation_summary>",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain two main object types against a color 8 background: (1) A central directional marker composed of four separate 2-cell line segments arranged in cardinal directions around a gap, each segment a different color from {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}; and (2) Standalone irregular shapes including plus/cross shapes, T-shapes (various orientations), L-shapes, rectangular blocks, and short line segments. All objects are contiguous single-color regions ranging from 2-12 cells, using colors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Identify the central directional marker with 4 colored segments (colors vary: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7)\n2. For each standalone shape in the grid:\n   - If its color matches the TOP segment color \u2192 rotate 90\u00b0 CCW and place above the marker\n   - If its color matches the BOTTOM segment color \u2192 rotate 90\u00b0 CCW and place below the marker\n   - If its color matches the LEFT segment color \u2192 rotate 90\u00b0 CW and place left of the marker\n   - If its color matches the RIGHT segment color \u2192 rotate 90\u00b0 CCW and place right of the marker\n   - If its color doesn't match any marker segment \u2192 remove it\n3. Shapes are positioned adjacent to their corresponding marker segment, extending outward\n4. The central marker segments (4 separate 2-cell colored segments) remain in their original positions\n5. All other cells become background color 8\n6. Shapes may overlap/merge with their corresponding marker segment since they share the same color\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
