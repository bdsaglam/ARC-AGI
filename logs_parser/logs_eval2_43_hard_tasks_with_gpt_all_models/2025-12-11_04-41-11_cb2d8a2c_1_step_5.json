            "Full raw LLM response": "**My analysis of this ARC task is as follows:**\n\nI'm presented with an ARC problem requiring me to analyze examples to discern the underlying logic. The goal is to figure out how a specific pixel (the \"agent,\" marked as a '3') moves within a grid, interacting with \"walls\" comprised of alternating '1' and '2' values. The task seems to involve pathfinding, where the agent navigates around these walls, which themselves undergo a transformation (the 1s turn into 2s).\n\nLet me break down my thought process:\n\n**1. Example Analysis:**\n\n*   **Initial Observations:** I begin by examining the grid size, the initial position of the '3', and the structure of the walls. I try to understand the movement patterns and how they relate to the walls.\n*   **Example 1 Decoded:** I try tracing the agent's path, noting its interaction with a horizontal wall. The agent, starting at (0,8), seems to move downwards, then left, around a horizontal wall that blocks its path.\n*   **Wall Transformations:** A key observation is that the walls, initially alternating '1' and '2', become solid '2' lines in the output. This suggests that the color change is tied to the pathfinding.\n*   **Example 2 Pattern:** I scrutinize Example 2, looking at the paths around two vertical walls. The agent starts on the edge and moves to the right, creating a rectangular loop shape around the walls.\n*   **General Movement:** I start to see a recurring pattern. The agent moves downwards from a top edge, the agent move to the right from the left edge. The walls block the direct path and the agent avoids that.\n*   **Pathing Rules:** Walls are like obstacles, the agent follows an inertial course (vertical if from a top or bottom boundary or horizontal if from a left or right). If a wall blocks the current flow, it diverts in the perpendicular axis.\n\n**2. Forming Hypotheses and Refinement:**\n\n*   **Inertial Coordinate:** My early hypothesis revolves around an \"inertial coordinate\" (row or column) that the agent tries to maintain. When a wall obstructs this line, the agent diverts.\n*   **Clearance and Margins:** I start thinking about the distance the agent maintains from the walls as a key factor. \"End + 2\" or \"-3\" margins emerge as potential rules for the agent's movement, determining which side to pass on and the turning points.\n*   **Midpoint Logic:** I consider a \"midpoint\" rule for the turns, where the agent turns at the halfway point between obstacles. This seems relevant in Ex 3.\n*   **Distance to next obstacle:** I hypothesize that it may be a standard \"lookahead\" process which helps to set the margin distance.\n*   **Diverting Path:** \"Inertial Coordinate\" + \"Clearance Coordinate (end+2 or end-3)\" is my initial plan.\n*   **Edge Cases:** I recognize that edges (grid boundaries) also play a role and that the agent prefers returning to the original starting row/column (the inertial coordinate) when possible.\n\n**3. Test Input & Generalization:**\n\n*   **Test Input Evaluation:** I attempt to apply the derived rules to a test input. I look for the 3s (agent location), find the direction of movement, and define the inertial line.\n*   **Test Path Trace:** I trace the path of the agent through the test grid, step-by-step applying the rules (obstacle detection, diversion coordinate calculation, turning point selection, and wall color change).\n*   **Refinement with New Wall:** I discover that the turn point is based on where the turn is *needed* to clear the wall.\n*   **Row 6 vs Row 8:** I realize that the algorithm requires an empty pixel of space around the walls, requiring me to select a safe row by calculating its distance.\n*   **Final Path Coordinates:** I'm constructing a final list of (row, col) coordinates.\n\n**4. Final Checks and Output:**\n\n*   **Robustness Checks:** I perform sanity checks, reviewing my logic, validating the paths against the obstacle locations and the grid size.\n*   **Wall Color Mapping:** I am clear that 1s become 2s in the entire grid.\n*   **Output Strategy:** I know how to prepare the final output in the required format.\n\nI am now ready to provide the solution. I know how the agent works with walls.\n\n\nThe goal is to determine the transformation rule from the examples and apply it to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Objects:** The grid contains a \"background\" of 8 (teal). There are \"walls\" formed by vertical or horizontal lines of 1s (blue) and 2s (red). There is a single \"agent\" pixel of color 3 (green).\n2.  **Transformation:**\n    *   **Walls:** All pixels in the walls (1s and 2s) become 2s (red) in the output.\n    *   **Path:** The agent (3) moves from its starting position to the opposite edge of the grid (or continues its trajectory). It leaves a trail of 3s.\n    *   **Obstacle Avoidance:** The agent moves in a primary cardinal direction (Down or Right, depending on start position). When it encounters a wall perpendicular to its path, it diverts:\n        *   It turns at a \"Midpoint\" or a safe distance before the wall.\n        *   It moves perpendicular to the flow to a new \"Inertial Line\" (Row/Col) that clears the wall (passing through a gap or around the end).\n        *   It calculates the safe line based on the wall's extent (e.g., `Wall_End + Margin` or `Gap_Center`).\n        *   After passing the obstacle, it continues. It may return to the original line if possible, or stay on the new line, or divert again for the next obstacle.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Input State:**\n    *   **Grid Size:** 14 rows x 26 columns.\n    *   **Agent (3):** Located at `(6, 25)` (Row 6, rightmost column). Flow direction is **Left**.\n    *   **Walls:** Vertical walls at Column 17, Column 7, and Column 1.\n        *   **Col 17:** Blocked Rows 0-9. Gap 10-13.\n        *   **Col 7:** Blocked Rows 5-10. Gap 0-4, 11-13.\n        *   **Col 1:** Blocked Rows 0-5, 11-13. Gap 6-10.\n\n2.  **Path Calculation (Right to Left):**\n    *   **Start:** `(6, 25)`.

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Lines with 1s and 2s**: These are vertical or horizontal line patterns where 1s act as \"markers\" or \"endpoints\". In the output, all 1s are converted to 2s.\n\n2. **The 3 marker**: Creates an L-shaped or rectangular bracket path. The bracket's offset from each line is determined by: **(number of 1s in that line) + 1**\n\n3. **Bracket formation**: The 3 creates a connected path that \"brackets\" or encloses the region around the lines, with the offset applied perpendicular to each line.\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n- **3 marker** at position (row 6, column 25)\n- **Line 1** (column 1, rows 0-5): Has 1 one \u2192 offset = 2 \u2192 bracket at column 3\n- **Line 2** (column 7, rows 5-13): Has 2 ones \u2192 offset = 3 \u2192 bracket at column 10  \n- **Line 3** (column 17, rows 0-9): Has 3 ones \u2192 offset = 4 \u2192 bracket at column 21\n\n**Applying the transformation:**\n- Replace all 1s with 2s in the three vertical lines\n- Draw the 3-bracket path: Starting from the 3 at (6,25), extending left to column 21, then down to row 13, then left to column 10, then up to row 2, then left to column 3, then down to row 7, then left to column 0\n\n```\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,3,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analyzing and Solving the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with solving an ARC problem, and the goal seems to involve manipulating a grid based on some visual patterns. Let's break this down.\n\n**Initial Assessment:**\n\n*   **Background:** The background is a teal color, represented by the value '8'.\n*   **Objects:** I see vertical segments made of alternating colors ('1' and '2'), single pixels ('3'), and the output appears to be 'paths' formed by the '3' pixels connecting things or growing from a seed '3' pixel.\n\nI need to figure out the rules governing how these elements interact to transform the input into the output. I'll examine the provided examples to discern these rules.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\nI start with the first example, carefully noting the positions and colors in both the input and output grids.\n\n*   The input has a horizontal segment of alternating '1' and '2' and a single '3'.\n*   The output seems to involve expanding that starting '3' into a connected path of '3's, and the input line changes to become entirely '2's.\n*   I see the path '3' starts at a certain column in the row where the '1,2' segment exists. Then goes down, and then goes horizontally.\n*   This suggests some kind of influence from the input segment, and the '1,2' segment \"activates\" into all '2's.\n*   I note the path \"bypasses\" the horizontal '1,2' segment. It has to go around it.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n\nMoving on to the second example:\n\n*   I see vertical lines, one containing '1' at the top and '2's below, and another containing '2's and '1's.\n*   The '3' seed is at a corner of the grid, and the path of '3's again looks like it is weaving around these vertical lines.\n*   Again the vertical lines of '1,2' change to only '2'.\n*   The path seems to be changing directions at the \"end\" of an obstacle.\n*   Again, it is avoiding obstacles.\n*   I see the path goes right, down, right, up, right. A \"wave\" pattern.\n\n**Formulating a Hypothesis:**\n\nBased on these two examples, I'm starting to form a hypothesis.\n\n*   **Goal:** The primary goal is to move a 'beam' or path of '3's from an origin point to an edge, or more generally to extend the '3' path.\n*   **Obstacles:** Obstacles are represented by lines of '1' and '2' pixels. These obstacles \"activate\" and turn into '2's in the output, essentially becoming \"walls.\"\n*   **Navigation:** The '3' path navigates around these walls, maintaining a 'main direction' (right, down, etc.) while deviating perpendicularly to avoid obstructions. It tries to stay on the same row or column as the start location, but if there are problems the path finds a suitable 'detour'.\n*   **'1' Significance:**  The '1' might indicate the \"open\" end or some kind of start to the obstacle, but it might not.\n*   The '1' becomes '2', meaning it gets \"energized\".\n\n**Refining the Hypothesis:**\n\nI need to understand how the navigation specifically works. Does it route greedily, or is there some more sophisticated pathfinding? And how does the initial orientation of the '3' change? Is the direction always towards an edge?\n\n**Example 3 Analysis:**\n\nExamining the third example helps to refine my understanding.\n\n*   I now see horizontal obstacles blocking a path, requiring the '3' path to shift around, alternating between rows.\n*   There are a few horizontal '1,2' lines that change to '2,2' in the end.\n*   Now there are multiple obstacles with the same effect.\n*   Again, the goal appears to be expanding a '3' path, and avoiding 'walls'.\n\n**Generalizing the Rules:**\n\nThe path seems to \"shift\" its position (to a different row or column) a few steps *before* it directly hits the obstacle. It doesn't deviate only at the \"end\" of a obstacle, but \"sees\" it coming.\n\n*   The path changes rows/columns a few steps before the obstacle. It has to make a calculation.\n\n**Looking for a 'Detour' Rule:**\n\nI need to figure out *why* the path takes that specific detour. I start to analyze this:\n\n*   **Ex 3:**  Obstacles are at row 4, \n\nThe goal is to navigate a path of green `3`s from the starting point to the opposite side of the grid, avoiding obstacles. The obstacles are vertical lines composed of `1`s (blue) and `2`s (red). In the output, all `1`s in the obstacles are transformed into `2`s.\n\n**Rule Inference:**\n1.  **Obstacle Transformation**: Change all `1`s in the grid to `2`s.\n2.  **Path Navigation**:\n    *   **Start Point**: Identify the starting `3`. In the test input, it is at `(6, 25)` (Row 6, Column 25). The path propagates to the left.\n    *   **Strategy**: The path tries to stay on the starting row (Row 6). If an obstacle blocks the current row, the path detours to a \"safe\" row that clears the obstacle.\n    *   **Turn Points**: The path switches rows at the midpoint of the free space between obstacles.\n        *   Space between Start (Col 25) and Obstacle 2 (Col 17) is 8. Midpoint is $25 - 4 = 21$.\n        *   Space between Obstacle 2 (Col 17) and Obstacle 3 (Col 7) is 10. Midpoint is $17 - 5 = 12$.\n        *   Space between Obstacle 3 (Col 7) and Obstacle 1 (Col 1) is 6. Midpoint is $7 - 3 = 4$.\n    *   **Row Selection**:\n        *   **Start**: Row 6. Blocked by Obstacle 2 (Rows 0-9).\n        *   **Detour 1**: Move to a row $> 9$. **Row 11** is selected (consistent with canonical spacing and safety).\n        *   **Detour 2**: Approaching Obstacle 3 (Rows 5-13), Row 11 is blocked. Move to a row $< 5$. **Row 3** is selected.\n        *   **Detour 3 (Return)**: Approaching Obstacle 1 (Rows 0-5), Row 3 is blocked. Move to a row $> 5$.

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to analyze the transformation pattern from the examples:\n\n**Key observations:**\n1. Each example has a \"3\" marker on an edge and lines containing patterns of 1s and 2s\n2. The transformation replaces all 1s in patterns with 2s\n3. L-shaped paths of 3s are drawn from the 3 marker, wrapping around the pattern areas\n4. The L-path turns are positioned at offsets from the patterns based on distances to the 1s\n\n**Test input analysis:**\n- 3 marker at position (6, 25) - right edge\n- Pattern 1: column 1, rows 0-5, with 1 at row 0\n- Pattern 2: column 7, rows 5-13, with 1s at rows 11, 13  \n- Pattern 3: column 17, rows 0-9, with 1s at rows 0, 2, 4\n\n**Transformation applied:**\n1. Replace all 1s with 2s in the three patterns\n2. Draw L-shaped 3-path from (6, 25):\n   - Horizontal at row 6 from columns 0-3 and 19-25\n   - Vertical segments at columns 3 and 19 from rows 6-10\n   - Horizontal at row 10 connecting columns 3-19 (skipping pattern column 7)\n\n```\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n8,8,8,3,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "The transformation first normalizes the two signal colours by turning every `1` into `2`. For grids where the non\u2011background values are arranged as vertical columns, a rectangular frame of `3` is added around them. For each column containing `2`s, compute an offset as the number of `1`s in that column plus one; subtracting this from the column index gives a candidate rail position. Take the minimum and maximum valid rail positions as the left and right rails. The vertical extent of the frame runs from the row of the existing `3` down for `min_height\u00a0\u2212\u00a01` rows, where `min_height` is the smallest height of the pattern columns. On the top frame row, fill from the left edge to the left rail and from the right rail to the right edge with `3`s; on the bottom frame row, fill between the rails. Fill the rails themselves with `3`s down the frame height. Existing non\u2011background values are left intact except for the `1\u21922` conversion.\n\nIn the test grid, the pattern columns are at 2,\u202f8,\u202f18. Their `1` counts give rail candidates 0 (discarded),\u00a04 and\u00a014, so the rails are at columns\u00a04 and\u00a014. The smallest column height is\u00a06, so with the existing `3` at row\u00a07 the frame spans rows\u00a07\u201311. Applying the frame and converting `1` to `2` yields:\n\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n8,8,8,3,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**My Process for Solving the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm thinking about this ARC problem. The goal is to transform a grid based on some examples. It's all about colored cells (integers 0-9), with 8 being the background, and 1, 2, and 3 representing different colors.\n\nFirst, I'm analyzing the provided examples. I'm focusing on how the objects (colored regions) behave in each example. It looks like the main action is a single green pixel (3) somehow growing into a path. There are also red/blue obstacles (mixed 1s and 2s) that become solid red (2) in the output. I'm carefully tracing the start and end points of the green path in each example, noting how it navigates around the obstacles.\n\nAfter examining the provided examples, I'm forming a hypothesis.\n\n*   Find the green pixel - this is the start.\n*   The path connects to the opposite edge (top-bottom or left-right)\n*   The obstacles:  blocks of 1s and 2s. These become solid red.\n*   The path avoids obstacles with 90 degree turns.\n\nI notice that the green path always seems to choose to go to a location that's not directly blocked. The examples show that path turns happen at specific columns or rows. I'm working to figure out what controls where this turning takes place:\nIt looks like they use a position that's not completely blocked by the obstacle. It is maybe a safe distance from it.\n\nNow I'm creating a plan based on this.\n\n1.  **Parse the input grid**: identify the start and obstacles. Convert the obstacles to red.\n2.  **Determine Path Segments**: Plan a path from the start to the opposite edge by considering the obstacles' location.\n\nI'm thinking about these details as I work:\n*   **Bypass Level:** This is where the path moves parallel to the obstacle. Is the new position the midpoint between the obstacle's start and the start point, or a bit further.\n*   **Switch Points:** This is where the path changes direction to avoid an obstacle. This looks like the midpoint between the obstacles.\n\nFinally, I'm testing my logic with the provided test input. I'm meticulously tracing the path on the grid, calculating the bypass levels and switch points, and constructing the output grid step by step, which I then create. I've re-verified my output after my generation and made sure the path never hits an obstacle. I'm confident that this final grid accurately represents the solution.",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Colours and objects**\n\n   - `8` is background.\n   - `1` and `2` together form the \u201cred bar\u201d obstacles in the image; in all examples every `1` in the output has been changed to `2`.  \n     So first, **globally replace all `1` with `2`**.\n   - `3` is the \u201cgreen path\u201d. There is one initial `3` in the input; in the output this grows into a single monotone polyline that goes from the starting edge to another edge while avoiding the red bars.\n\n2. **Qualitative path rule from examples**\n\n   From the four training pairs:\n\n   - The path always starts from the existing `3`.\n   - It is **monotone away from the starting edge**:\n     - If the start is on the top edge: path\u2019s row index only increases (goes downward).\n     - If the start is on the left edge: column index only increases (goes right).\n   - It avoids all red bars, weaving around them by axis-aligned segments (rectangles/U\u2011turns) while never stepping on a `1`/`2`.\n   - Around a sequence of vertical bars (examples 2 and 4), the path goes left\u2013right but steps vertically to pass **below one bar, then above the next, etc.**, always staying in free background.\n\n3. **Applying to the test**\n\n   Test layout (after 1\u21922 replacement):\n\n   - Vertical bar A at column 2, rows 1\u20136.\n   - Vertical bar C at column 8, rows 6\u201314.\n   - Vertical bar B at column 18, rows 1\u201310.\n   - Start `3` at row 7, column 26 (right edge).\n\n   We need a monotone **leftward** path from the start to the left side that never touches columns 2, 8 or 18 where the bars sit.\n\n   Following the behaviour from examples, we construct a leftward zig\u2011zag:\n\n   1. Go left from the starting cell along row 7 until we are in the middle of the free corridor between the right boundary and bar B: stop at column 22.  \n      Cells: (7,26\u201322).\n   2. To get **under bar B** (which ends at row 10), go down to the middle of the free space between its bottom and the grid\u2019s bottom: row 12.  \n      Cells: (8\u201312,22).\n   3. Move left on row 12, staying under bar B but to the right of bar C, until just right of bar C: column 9.  \n      Cells: (12,21\u20139).\n   4. Go up along column 9 to row 5 to be **above bar C** (whose top is at row 6).  \n      Cells: (11\u20135,9).\n   5. Move left on row 5 until just right of bar A at column 2: reach column 3.  \n      Cells: (5,8\u20133).\n   6. Go down along column 3 to get **below bar A** (which ends at row 6). Choose the midpoint between its bottom and the grid\u2019s bottom: row 10.  \n      Cells: (6\u201310,3).\n   7. Finally, go left on row 10 to the left boundary (column 1).  \n      Cells: (10,2\u20131).\n\n   All these cells are originally background `8`, so we paint them `3`. No red bar is touched and the x\u2011coordinate never increases (monotone leftwards).\n\n4. **Final step**\n\n   Combine:\n   - All `1` \u2192 `2`.\n   - All path cells above \u2192 `3`.\n   - Everything else stays as is.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\nRow by row:\n\n1. `8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \n2. `8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \n3. `8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \n4. `8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \n5. `8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \n6. `8,2,3,8,8,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \n7. `8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3`  \n8. `8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8`  \n9. `8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8`  \n10. `3,3,3,8,8,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8`  \n11. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8`  \n12. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8`  \n13. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \n14. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Below is how I constructed a transformation consistent with the examples and then applied it to the test input.\n\n---\n\n### 1. What the transformation does in the examples\n\nFrom the four examples we can see two consistent behaviours:\n\n1. **All cells of color `1` are recolored to `2`.**  \n   In every output there are no `1` cells; every place that was `1` in the input becomes `2`.\n\n2. **A single continuous path of `3`s is drawn through background (`8`) cells.**  \n   - The input always contains exactly one `3`, on the border.  \n   - In the output this `3` is extended into a one\u2011cell\u2013wide orthogonal polyline of 3\u2019s; the path never overwrites any 1/2 cells (it only uses 8\u2011cells).  \n   - The 1/2 structures (vertical or horizontal \u201cbars\u201d) act as obstacles that determine how the green path snakes across the grid.\n\nFor the vertical\u2011bar examples (2 and 4), the path essentially starts at the border 3 and then travels horizontally, weaving between top\u2011anchored and bottom\u2011anchored vertical bars.\n\nThe test case has exactly this \u201cthree vertical bars, alternating top\u2013bottom\u2013top anchoring, and a border 3 on the right\u201d configuration, analogous to example 3 (which has three horizontal bars, alternating left\u2013right\u2013left, and a top border 3). So we:\n- Treat all 1/2 cells as obstacles.\n- Start from the single `3` on the border.\n- Trace a continuous path through 8\u2011cells that weaves between the three bars in an S\u2011like way, never touching the bars, until we reach the opposite side of the grid.\n\nConcretely for this test:\n\n- Vertical bars (after recoloring 1\u21922) are at:\n  - Column 1, rows 0\u20135 (top\u2011anchored).\n  - Column 7, rows 5\u201313 (bottom\u2011anchored).\n  - Column 17, rows 0\u20139 (top\u2011anchored).\n- Single starting `3` is at (row 6, col 25).\n\nWe draw the path of `3`s as:\n\n1. From the start, go **left along row 6** until just to the right of the rightmost bar:\n   - Cells: (6,25), (6,24), (6,23), (6,22), (6,21), (6,20), (6,19), (6,18).\n2. Go **down below** the bottom of that rightmost bar:\n   - Cells: (7,18), (8,18), (9,18), (10,18).\n3. From there go **left across row 10** until just to the right of the middle bar:\n   - Cells: (10,17), (10,16), (10,15), (10,14), (10,13), (10,12), (10,11), (10,10), (10,9), (10,8).\n4. Go **up above** the top of the middle bar:\n   - Cells: (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8).\n5. From there go **left across row 4** until just to the right of the leftmost bar:\n   - Cells: (4,7), (4,6), (4,5), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2).\n6. Go **down below** the leftmost bar:\n   - Cells: (5,2), (6,2).\n7. Finally, go **left along row 6** to the opposite edge:\n   - Cells: (6,1), (6,0).\n\nAll these cells were `8` originally (except the initial 3), so we can safely recolor them to `3`. All `1`s are recolored to `2`, and everything else stays as it was.\n\n---\n\n### 2.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**My Pathfinding Strategy**\n\nI've been tasked with mapping out a path on a grid, navigating around obstacles, and I've boiled down a clear strategy based on analyzing several examples. Here's my thought process:\n\n**Identifying the Playing Field:**\n\n*   I've noticed that colors `1` (blue) and `2` (red) always become `2` (Red) in the output. These represent walls and blockages, essentially making the grid dynamic. The background is a harmless `8` (light blue) and my path can't overwrite `2` pixels (walls).\n\n**The Path's Objective:**\n\n*   The start pixel, color `3` (green), indicates a starting point and I need to plot a route from the start pixel to the opposing edge of the grid. If it starts at the top/bottom I end up at bottom/top, or if it is at the left/right, I aim at the right/left edges.\n\n**Guiding Principles:**\n\n*   **Preferred Lanes:** Initially, the path prefers to stay on the same row or column as the start point and the basic segments are horizontal or vertical.\n*   **Navigating Obstacles:** When a wall is in the way, I need to get out of its way.\n\n**The Decision-Making Process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Obstacles:** Project the walls onto the main path axis to reveal \"zones\" of free space.\n2.  **Turning Point:** I turn in each zone to bypass the wall.\n3.  **Target Lanes:** The path moves to a safe row/column (the 'Target Lane') to avoid the wall. The target row is found from the \"center\" of a wall's gap on the opposite side of the turn axis (y for x-axis path, x for y-axis path). If the starting point is in the gap, I prefer to return to the starting line.\n4.  **Midpoint Logic:** The turns occur at the *midpoint* between previous and next obstacles. This midpoint is defined along the path's principal direction.\n5.  **Re-assess.** After I pass an obstacle, I re-evaluate the next obstacle.\n\n**Putting It Together:**\n\n*   To get the desired output grid, I simply transform any input `1` (blue) to `2` (red). Then, I construct the path segments of color `3` (green) based on my calculations.\n\nBy applying these principles, I can find a path, turn, and avoid the obstacles. I can draw a path from the start to an opposite edge avoiding the \"2\" pixels.",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Identify elements**: Each grid has:\n   - A green marker (3) indicating the starting point\n   - Barriers made of red (2) cells with blue (1) markers indicating endpoints/gates\n   - Background is cyan (8)\n\n2. **Transformation rules**:\n   - All blue (1) markers in barriers are converted to red (2)\n   - A green (3) path is drawn from the green marker to the opposite edge\n   - The path navigates around barriers by making turns to avoid them\n\n3. **Path navigation strategy**:\n   - The path travels in one direction until it would hit a barrier\n   - It then turns perpendicular to go around the barrier\n   - This creates a zigzag pattern through the gaps between barriers\n\n**For the test input**:\n- Green marker at position (6, 25) - right edge\n- Barrier 1 at column 1, rows 0-5\n- Barrier 2 at column 7, rows 5-13\n- Barrier 3 at column 17, rows 0-9\n\n**Path construction** (right to left):\n1. From (6,25), go left to column 18 (before barrier 3)\n2. Go down to row 10 (below barrier 3 which ends at row 9)\n3. Go left to column 8 (before barrier 2)\n4. Go up to row 4 (above barrier 2 which starts at row 5)\n5. Go left to column 2 (before barrier 1)\n6. Go down to row 6 (below barrier 1 which ends at row 5)\n7.

            "Full raw LLM response": "To solve these tasks I first normalised the input by turning all `1` cells in the \u201cbrick\u201d structures into `2`, as is done in every example. The lone `3` on a border is the start of a green path.\n\nThe path always runs from the starting edge to the opposite edge, moving monotonically in the main direction (downwards from the top, rightwards from the left, and in this test leftwards from the right). The red bars act as obstacles; for bars touching the top you cross them below, for bars touching the bottom you cross them above, and you make vertical adjustments in the gaps between obstacle columns. For this test the right\u2011edge start runs leftwards: first drop below the top\u2011anchored bar at column\u202f18, then rise above the bottom\u2011anchored bar at column\u202f8, then drop again to pass below the top\u2011anchored bar at column\u202f2, finally reaching the left edge.\n\nOverlaying this planned path of `3`s on the converted grid yields:\n\n```\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,3,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The goal is to draw a continuous Green path from the starting pixel to the opposite side of the grid.\n*   The mixed Red and Blue blocks are treated as solid obstacles and must be recolored to uniform Red in the output.\n*   The path navigates through gaps in the obstacles, changing direction only to avoid collision.\n*   Blue pixels in the input act as \"noise\" within the obstacles and lose their distinct identity.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's a breakdown of my thought process for solving this ARC task:**\n\nI started by carefully examining the input/output pairs, noting the colors used (teal, green, blue, and red) and how they corresponded to different elements in the grid (background, start/path, noise/obstacle, obstacle).  I observed that obstacles, initially a mix of blue and red, became solid red in the output. A single green pixel always marked a start point, and the goal was to create a path that extended from it.\n\nThen, I analyzed Example 1, meticulously tracing the path's movement and where it turned to avoid the obstacle. I realized the path wasn't a simple \"move until hit\" algorithm; it seemed to strategize its route. I noticed that it turned *before* hitting the obstacle, and the turn seemed related to the obstacle's position and the grid's boundaries. Example 1 showed a horizontal line at row 7. It then goes to row 2 and makes a vertical turn at col 1.\n\nI moved on to Example 2 and noticed a \"detour\" behavior around two vertical obstacles. The path turned right, went down, and then up to avoid them, almost as if it were trying to maintain its original direction but also find a safe route. Example 2 shows gaps on top and bottom of obstacles.\n\nExample 3 presented a more complex scenario with multiple obstacles at different locations.  I took extra care to check row/col indices. I realized that the path seems to be blocked by each obstacle and then makes adjustments to traverse the space. The path turns to the side of the obstacle, so that it can continue traveling in the main direction.\n\nFinally, Example 4 demonstrated an interesting return-to-axis behavior, where the path, after being diverted, returned to its initial \"line.\"\n\nThis process led me to form a hypothesis that the pathfinding algorithm would prioritize remaining on the original vertical/horizontal start plane and avoid a collision. It needs to keep a distance to the obstacles of 2 pixels. It can move to \"a parallel axis\", where it bypasses the obstacles (the axis doesn't always have to be col 1 if there are no obstacles). I was convinced I was onto something.\n\nI proposed an algorithm that identifies the start direction, converts all \"noise\" blue pixels to obstacles (red), and then uses a \"Move Forward with Avoidance\" strategy. Crucially, the algorithm had a \"Line of Sight\" approach.\n\nI saw there was an implicit \"buffer\" of pixels when the path makes a turn. From there, I tried to deduce the spacing rule. I then came up with the idea of returning to the original axis/row, once the obstacles were avoided. I analyzed the test input and formed a plan to test if the rules were consistently.\n\nI then went through a set of logical steps to construct the test solution using coordinates and by inspecting the outputs. I made a final check of the grid dimensions, path, obstacle placement.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to solve an ARC task where we need to draw a continuous green path (color 3) from a starting pixel to the opposite side of the grid. The grid contains obstacles made of red (2) and blue (1) pixels. In the output, these obstacles become solid red (2), and the blue pixels are effectively noise that gets consolidated into the red obstacles. The path must navigate around these obstacles.\n\n**Analysis of the Rules:**\n1.  **Start and Direction:** The path begins at the single green pixel (3) present in the input. Its initial direction is determined by the edge it is on (e.g., if on the right edge, it moves Left/West).\n2.  **Obstacles:** All pixels with value 1 or 2 in the input are treated as solid obstacles (value 2 in output).\n3.  **Navigation Logic:**\n    - The path moves in its primary direction (the \"Axis\") until it encounters an obstacle.\n    - Upon detecting an obstacle blocking the path ahead, the path diverts.\n    - **Diversion Logic:** The path turns 90 degrees to bypass the obstacle. Based on the solved examples, the path maintains a specific buffer distance from the obstacle:\n        - It turns **3 pixels** before the obstacle's position (or 2 empty pixels of gap).\n        - It moves to a parallel row/column that clears the obstacle by **3 pixels** (or 2 empty pixels of gap).\n        - After clearing the obstacle, it turns back towards the original axis. It attempts to return to the original axis if possible, or to the nearest valid row/column that maintains the safety buffer (Gap $\\ge$ 1 pixel).\n    - **Return to Axis:** In Example 4, the path returns to the start row. In Example 2, the path returns to the start row. This suggests a preference for the original axis.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n- **Grid Size:** 14 rows x 26 columns.\n- **Start:** Pixel (6, 25) with value 3.\n- **Primary Direction:** Left (West) along Row 6.\n\n**Step-by-Step Path Planning:**\n\n1.  **Obstacle Identification:**\n    - **Obstacle A (Right):** Vertical bar at Column 17, spanning Rows 0-9.\n    - **Obstacle B (Middle):** Vertical bar at Column 7, spanning Rows 5-13.\n    - **Obstacle C (Left):** Vertical bar at Column 1, spanning Rows 0-5.\n\n2.  **Path Segment 1 (Bypass Obstacle A):**\n    - Current Position: (6, 25). Moving Left along Row 6.\n    - Blocked by Obstacle A (Col 17, Rows 0-9).\n    - **Turn Column:** `Obstacle_Col (17) + 3 = 20`.\n    - **Target Row:** Obstacle A ends at Row 9. To pass below, target `Obstacle_End (9) + 3 = 12`.\n    - **Action:** Draw line (6, 25) -> (6, 20). Turn Down. Draw line (6, 20) -> (12, 20).\n\n3.  **Path Segment 2 (Bypass Obstacle B):**\n    - Current Position: (12, 20). Moving Left along Row 12.\n    - Blocked by Obstacle B (Col 7, Rows 5-13). Note: We are at Row 12, which is blocked.\n    - **Turn Column:** `Obstacle_Col (7) + 3 = 10`.\n    - **Target Row:** Obstacle B starts at Row 5. To pass above, target `Obstacle_Start (5) - 3 = 2`.\n    - **Action:** Draw line (12, 20) -> (12, 10). Turn Up. Draw line (12, 10) -> (2, 10).\n\n4.  **Path Segment 3 (Bypass Obstacle C):**\n    - Current Position: (2, 10). Moving Left along Row 2.\n    - Blocked by Obstacle C (Col 1, Rows 0-5).\n    - **Turn Column:** `Obstacle_Col (1) + 3 = 4`.\n    - **Target Row:** Obstacle C ends at Row 5. The original axis is Row 6.\n        - Returning to Row 6 leaves a gap of 0 pixels (Row 6 vs Row 5). While Ex 4 showed a return to axis with a 1-pixel gap, a 0-pixel gap might be too tight compared to the 2-pixel gaps used elsewhere.\n        - However, Row 7 provides a 1-pixel gap (Row 6 is empty) and is the closest valid path to the axis that maintains a gap. Looking at the \"2-pixel margin\" preference in the turn logic (`Obs+3`), going to `Obs_End (5) + 3 = 8` is also a candidate.\n        - But Example 4 suggests prioritizing the return to the axis or as close as possible (Gap $\\ge$ 1). Row 7 fits the \"Gap 1\" pattern seen in Examples 2 and 4.\n    - **Decision:** Go to Row 7.\n    - **Action:** Draw line (2, 10) -> (2, 4). Turn Down. Draw line (2, 4) -> (7, 4).\n\n5.  **Final Segment:**\n    - Current Position: (7, 4).\n    - Obstacle C is at Col 1. We are at Row 7. Obstacle C ends at Row 5.

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The goal is to draw a continuous Green path from the starting pixel to the opposite side of the grid.\n*   The mixed Red and Blue blocks are treated as solid obstacles and must be recolored to uniform Red in the output.\n*   The path navigates through gaps in the obstacles, changing direction only to avoid collision.\n*   Blue pixels in the input

            "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task: Pathfinding with Obstacle Avoidance**\n\nOkay, so I've got this ARC task. The goal is to figure out how to navigate a path on a grid, dodging obstacles and starting from a single green pixel. The inputs are these grids, where each cell represents a color. Teal (8) is the background. The obstacles are lines of blue (1) and red (2) pixels. The task is to transform these grids such that all obstacle pixels are red, and a green path extends from the start pixel.\n\nI've been analyzing a few examples to see how the system is working. My initial thoughts are all over the place, but after a deep dive, here's what I've figured out.\n\nThe primary goal is to find this continuous path.  The path needs to avoid any obstacles, which are the lines mixed with blue and red pixels. The blue pixels are \"noise\", in a way. I noticed, too, that the direction is important because the start can be on any edge.\n\nSo, here is what I know: The obstacles are made up of Blue and Red. I need to convert all the Blue to Red, so it's a solid Red block. The start pixel is also important. I need to make a path from that. It seems that the green path \"bounces\" off the obstacles, creating these 90-degree turns. The output path, in the test, is a mix of horizontal and vertical segments. They seem to hug the edge of an obstacle, then turn to move horizontally or vertically.\n\nFrom the example, it appears that the \"pathfinding\" or navigation part is the heart of the task.  Here's how I think the pathing works: the path starts from the start pixel and tries to move in that direction until it detects an obstacle in its path. At that point, the system makes a 90-degree turn before actually hitting the obstacle. The \"turn\" point is critical. It determines a new \"lane\" (row or column) where to move, which is at a certain distance before the obstacle. It moves in this direction until it clears the obstacle, and then, if necessary, makes another turn to avoid the next one. After exploring the examples in depth, I have some solid clues now: I need to check the distance between the starting location to where the obstacle sits. Also, I see that the turns usually take place about two or three pixels away from an obstacle. It looks like it prefers specific lanes or directions (col 1, col 8). I figured that I have to find a way to get past the obstacle. Then, if an obstacle in front, turn!\n\nI think a decent approach would be: determine the starting point and direction. Then, it would move in that direction. And then, check to see if there is an obstacle in the way. If there is, turn before that. Pick a new lane to go in that will avoid that block. Then, move to it. Next, find the next obstacle and repeat the process, until finished.\n\nI am feeling confident.\n\n\nTo solve this challenge, I analyzed the provided examples to reverse-engineer the logic governing the path generation and obstacle handling.\n\n**1. Obstacle Identification & Processing**\n*   **Observation:** In the input grids, obstacles are represented by lines of mixed Blue (1) and Red (2) pixels. In the output, these obstacles are solidified into uniform Red (2) blocks.\n*   **Rule:** Identify all vertical and horizontal lines containing 1s and 2s. Convert every pixel in these lines to Red (2).\n\n**2. Pathfinding Logic**\n*   **Goal:** Draw a continuous Green (3) path from the starting Green pixel to the opposite side of the grid.\n*   **Movement:** The path starts moving in the direction perpendicular to the edge where the start pixel is located.\n*   **Collision Avoidance:**\n    *   The path moves straight until it detects an upcoming obstacle in its lane.\n    *   **Turn Point:** Before hitting the obstacle, the path turns 90 degrees. The examples suggest a \"buffer\" or gap of approximately **3 pixels** before the obstacle where this turn occurs.\n    *   **Lane Selection:** To bypass the obstacle, the path shifts to a new parallel lane. The choice of this lane is determined by finding a clear path that extends past the obstacle's limit.\n        *   If the obstacle blocks the \"top\" or \"left\" side, the path shifts to a coordinate calculated as `Obstacle_End + Margin` (typically +2).\n        *   If the obstacle blocks the \"bottom\" or \"right\" side, the path shifts to `Obstacle_Start - Margin` (typically -3).\n        *   Critically, if the **original start lane** becomes clear again after the obstacle, the path prefers to return to that lane (as seen in Examples 2 and 4).\n*   **Sequence:** This process repeats (Move -> Detect -> Turn -> Shift -> Resume) until the path reaches the edge of the grid.\n\n**3. Applying Logic to Test Input**\n*   **Grid Dimensions:** 26 columns x 14 rows.\n*   **Obstacles Identified:**\n    1.  **Column 1:** Rows 0-5.\n    2.  **Column 17:** Rows 0-9.\n    3.  **Column 7:** Rows 5-13.\n*   **Start:** Green pixel at **(6, 25)** (Row 6, Col 25). Direction: **Left**.\n\n**Step-by-Step Path Execution:**\n1.  **Move Left on Row 6:**\n    *   Path starts at (6, 25) moving left.\n    *   **Conflict:** Obstacle at **Column 17** (Rows 0-9).\n    *   **Turn:** Maintain a buffer of ~3 pixels. Turn at **Column 20**.\n    *   **Bypass Strategy:** Obstacle covers rows 0-9. We need a row > 9. Using the margin logic (+2), we target **Row 11** (9 + 2).\n    *   *Path Segment:* (6, 25) to (6, 20) -> Turn Down -> (11, 20).\n\n2.  **Move Left on Row 11:**\n    *   Current position: (11, 20). Direction: Left.\n    *   **Conflict:** Obstacle at **Column 7** (Rows 5-13).\n    *   **Turn:** Buffer of 3 pixels. Turn at **Column 10** (7 + 3).\n    *   **Bypass Strategy:** Obstacle covers rows 5-13. We need a row < 5. Using the margin logic (-3), we target **Row 2** (5 - 3).\n    *   *Path Segment:* (11, 20) to (11, 10) -> Turn Up -> (2, 10).\n\n3.  **Move Left on Row 2:**\n    *   Current position: (2, 10). Direction: Left.\n    *   **Conflict:** Obstacle at **Column 1** (Rows 0-5).\n    *   **Turn:** Buffer of 3 pixels. Turn at **Column 4** (1 + 3).\n    *   **Bypass Strategy:** Obstacle covers rows 0-5. We need a row > 5. The original **Row 6** is now clear (Obstacle 1 ends at row 5). The algorithm prefers returning to the start lane.\n    *   *Path Segment:* (2, 10) to (2, 4) -> Turn Down -> (6, 4).\n\n4.  **Final Approach:**\n    *   Current position: (6, 4). Direction: Left.\n    *   No further obstacles exist to the left of Column 1.\n    *   *Path Segment:* (6, 4) to edge (6, 0).\n\n**Final Output Construction:**\n*   **Background:** 8 (Teal).\n*   **Obstacles (Red/2):** Col 1 (rows 0-5), Col 17 (rows 0-9), Col 7 (rows 5-13).\n*   **Path (Green/3):**\n    *   Row 6: Cols 0-4 and 20-25.\n    *   Row 2: Cols 4-10.\n    *   Row 11: Cols 10-20.\n    *   Col 4: Rows 2-6.\n    *   Col 10: Rows 2-11.\n    *   Col 20: Rows 6-11.\n\n8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,3,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The goal is to draw a continuous Green path from the starting pixel to the opposite side of the grid.\n*   The mixed Red and Blue blocks are treated as solid obstacles and must be recolored to uniform Red in the output.\n*   The path navigates through gaps in the obstacles, changing direction only to avoid collision.\n*   Blue pixels in the input act as \"noise\" within the obstacles and lose their distinct identity.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to:\n1. Find the green starting pixel (3)\n2. Identify obstacles (mixed red/blue vertical or horizontal lines with both 1s and 2s)\n3. Convert all 1s in obstacles to 2s (uniform red)\n4. Draw a green path from the starting pixel to the opposite side, navigating around obstacles\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n- Green (3) starting pixel: row 6, column 25 (right side)\n- Target: left side (column 0)\n\n**Obstacles identified:**\n- Column 1, rows 0-5: mixed (1 at row 0, rest 2s)\n- Column 7, rows 5-13: mixed (1s at rows 11, 13, rest 2s)  \n- Column 17, rows 0-9: mixed (1s at rows 0, 2, 4, rest 2s)\n\n**Path planning:**\nStarting at (6, 25), going left:\n1. Column 17 obstacle blocks rows 0-9. At row 6, must go down to row 10 first\n2. Column 7 obstacle blocks rows 5-13. At row 10, must go up to row 4 first\n3. Column 1 obstacle blocks rows 0-5. At row 4, must go down to row 6 first\n4. Then continue to column 0\n\n**Path segments:**\n- (6, 25) \u2192 (6, 18): horizontal left\n- (6, 18) \u2192 (10, 18): vertical down\n- (10, 18) \u2192 (10, 8): horizontal left  \n- (10, 8) \u2192 (4, 8): vertical up\n- (4, 8) \u2192 (4, 2): horizontal left\n- (4, 2) \u2192 (6, 2): vertical down\n- (6, 2) \u2192 (6, 0): horizontal left to edge\n\n**Output grid:**\n\n```\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,3,8,8,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The goal is to draw a continuous Green path from the starting pixel to the opposite side of the grid.\n*   The mixed Red and Blue blocks are treated as solid obstacles and must be recolored to uniform Red in the output.\n*   The path navigates through gaps in the obstacles, changing direction only to avoid collision.\n*   Blue pixels in the input act as \"noise\" within the obstacles and lose their distinct identity.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Colors / semantics (from the examples and hints)**  \n   - `8` = background (empty space).  \n   - `1` and `2` together form *obstacles* (a \u201cmixed red/blue block\u201d).  \n   - `3` = the green *path*.  \n   - In every example, any connected region of `{1,2}` in the input is recolored to a uniform color in the output; looking at the outputs, that uniform color is `2`. So all `1`s turn into `2`s, and existing `2`s stay `2`.\n\n2. **Global rule deduced from examples + hints**  \n   From the four examples and the textual hints, the transformation is:\n\n   - Treat any cell with value `1` or `2` as part of an obstacle.\n   - In the output, recolor all those obstacle cells to `2`.\n   - There is exactly one starting green cell (`3`) on a border of the grid.\n   - Draw a single 4-connected path of `3`s from that starting cell to *the opposite side of the grid*:\n     - If the start is on the top or bottom edge, the path goes vertically to the opposite edge, bending left/right only to avoid obstacles.\n     - If the start is on the left or right edge, the path goes horizontally to the opposite edge, bending up/down only to avoid obstacles.\n   - The path never goes through any obstacle cell (values `1` or `2` in the input) and only traverses cells that were `8` originally.\n   - The \u201cmixed red and blue\u201d inside each obstacle (1s and 2s) are all recolored to `2`; the precise pattern of 1/2 inside the block is lost.\n\n   In the test grid:\n   - The single starting `3` is at row 7, column 26 (right border).  \n     \u2192 So we must connect it with a path of `3`s to the **left border**.\n   - Obstacles are three vertical columns:\n     - Column 2: rows 1\u20136 contain `{1,2}` \u2192 obstacle O1, recolor to all `2`.\n     - Column 8: rows 6\u201314 contain `{1,2}` \u2192 obstacle O2, recolor to all `2`.\n     - Column 18: rows 1\u201310 contain `{1,2}` \u2192 obstacle O3, recolor to all `2`.\n\n3. **Strategy for this particular grid**\n\n   We build a leftward path from `(7,26)` to the left border, making turns only when necessary to stay in free (`8`) cells, and respecting the obstacle extents:\n\n   - **Step 1 \u2013 Recolor obstacles:**\n     - Turn every `1` into `2`. Now O1 (col. 2), O2 (col. 8), O3 (col. 18) are solid columns of `2`s in the ranges noted above.\n\n   - **Step 2 \u2013 From start toward the first obstacle (O3 at col. 18):**\n     - Start at `(7,26)` (already `3`).\n     - Go left along row 7 until just before column 18:\n       - Cells `(7,25) \u2026 (7,19)` become `3`.\n       - Cell `(7,18)` is obstacle `2`, so we must not enter it.\n\n   - **Step 3 \u2013 Go *below* obstacle O3 (col. 18, rows 1\u201310):**\n     - Still at column 19, go downward until we are just below that column\u2019s obstacle:\n       - Column 19 has no obstacles; O3 is only at column 18.\n       - O3 ends at row 10, so we go down from row 7 to row 11:\n         - `(8,19)`, `(9,19)`, `(10,19)`, `(11,19)` become `3`.\n     - Now at `(11,19)` we are \u201cbehind\u201d O3 (below it), free to move leftwards into the middle region.\n\n   - **Step 4 \u2013 Move left towards column 8 (O2) while staying right of it:**\n     - From `(11,19)` move left along row 11 until just to the right of column 8:\n       - `(11,18) \u2026 (11,9)` become `3`.\n       - `(11,8)` is obstacle `2`, so we stop at column 9.\n\n   - **Step 5 \u2013 Go *above* obstacle O2 (col. 8, rows 6\u201314):**\n     - O2 starts at row 6; its top is at row 6. To pass above it, we must move to row 5 or higher.\n     - From `(11,9)` go straight up column 9 to row 5:\n       - `(10,9)`, `(9,9)`, `(8,9)`, `(7,9)`, `(6,9)`, `(5,9)` become `3`.\n\n   - **Step 6 \u2013 Move left between O2 and O1:**\n     - At row 5, column 9, O2 is *below* us (its top at row 6), and O1 (col. 2, rows 1\u20136) is at the far left.\n     - Row 5 has obstacle only at column 2; columns 3\u20139 are free.\n     - Move left from `(5,9)` to `(5,3)`:\n       - `(5,8)`, `(5,7)`, `(5,6)`, `(5,5)`, `(5,4)`, `(5,3)` become `3`.\n       - We stop at column 3 so as not to step into column 2\u2019s obstacle.\n\n   - **Step 7 \u2013 Go *below* obstacle O1 (col. 2, rows 1\u20136):**\n     - O1 ends at row 6. To pass left of it, we must be below row 6.\n     - From `(5,3)` go down to row 7 along column 3:\n       - `(6,3)`, `(7,3)` become `3`.\n     - Now at row 7, column 3, the obstacle at column 2 is above us (it ends at row 6).\n\n   - **Step 8 \u2013 Final move to the left border:**\n     - From `(7,3)` move left to column 1 along row 7:\n       - `(7,2)`, `(7,1)` become `3`.\n     - `(7,1)` lies on the left edge, so we\u2019ve connected the start (right edge) to the opposite side.\n\n   Throughout, we only placed `3`s on cells that were originally `8` (background), and we did not enter any cell that was `1` or `2` in the input.\n\n4. **Apply recoloring + path overlay**\n\n   - All `1`s have been recolored to `2`.\n   - All coordinates listed in the path above have been set to `3`.\n\nBelow is the resulting output grid.\n\n---\n\n**Output grid**\n\nRow 1:  \n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 2:  \n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 3:  \n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 4:  \n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 5:  \n8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 6:  \n8,2,3,8,8,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 7:  \n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3  \n\nRow 8:  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 9:  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 10:  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 11:  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 12:  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 13:  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 14:  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The goal is to draw a continuous Green path from the starting pixel to the opposite side of the grid.\n*   The mixed Red and Blue blocks are treated as solid obstacles and must be recolored to uniform Red in the output.\n*   The path navigates through gaps in the obstacles, changing direction only to avoid collision.\n*   Blue pixels in the input act as \"noise\" within the obstacles and lose their distinct identity.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The goal is to draw a continuous Green path from the starting pixel to the opposite side of the grid.\n*   The mixed Red and Blue blocks are treated as solid obstacles and must be recolored to uniform Red in the output.\n*   The path navigates through gaps in the obstacles, changing direction only to avoid collision.\n*   Blue pixels in the input act as \"noise\" within the obstacles and lose their distinct identity.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning and inferred rule**\n\nFrom the examples (and the textual hints), I inferred the following transformation:\n\n1. **Obstacle unification**\n   - Colors `1` (blue) and `2` (red) are both part of \u201csolid obstacles\u201d.\n   - In the output, every obstacle cell is recolored to **red** (`2`), so:\n     - All `1`s become `2`.\n     - Any existing `2`s remain `2`.\n   - Obstacles are not allowed to be part of the green path.\n\n2. **Path behavior**\n   - Color `3` is the **green path**.\n   - There is a single starting green pixel on the **border** of the grid.\n   - The path must form a **4-connected continuous line of 3s** from that starting pixel to the **opposite side** of the grid.\n   - The path must not pass through obstacles (cells with final color `2`).\n   - The path runs through empty cells (`8`) only, and turns only when needed to get around vertical/horizontal obstacle bands.\n\n3. **How I constructed the path for the test input**\n\n   For the test grid:\n\n   - Size: 14 rows \u00d7 26 columns.\n   - Start pixel: `3` at row 7, column 26 \u2192 `(7,26)` on the **right edge**.\n   - Opposite side: the **left edge** (column 1).  \n     I choose a target cell on that side that yields a shortest path while respecting obstacle bands.\n\n   After recoloring `1 \u2192 2`, the obstacle stripes are:\n\n   - Column 2, rows 1\u20136 (vertical stripe A).\n   - Column 8, rows 6\u201314 (vertical stripe C).\n   - Column 18, rows 1\u201310 (vertical stripe B).\n\n   So to go from `(7,26)` to the left edge, the path must:\n\n   - **Cross stripe B** (column 18) at some row where column 18 is free.  \n     Since B occupies rows 1\u201310, we must cross at row \u2265 11.  \n     I choose to first go **down to row 11**, then move left across column 18 at row 11.\n\n   - **Cross stripe C** (column 8) at some row where column 8 is free.  \n     C occupies rows 6\u201314, so we must cross above it, at row \u2264 5.  \n     After going under B (to row 11) and to the left side of B (column 17), I go **up to row 5**, then left across column 8 at row 5 (where it\u2019s free).\n\n   - **Cross stripe A** (column 2) at some row where column 2 is free.  \n     A occupies rows 1\u20136, so we must cross at row \u2265 7.  \n     From row 5 column 3, I go **down to row 7**, then left across column 2 at row 7 (column 2 is free there), reaching the left edge.\n\n   This yields a shortest-length path under these band constraints, and the path is 4-connected and never steps on any obstacle.\n\n   Concretely, the path cells are:\n\n   - Start and downward leg:\n     - `(7,26)` (start)\n     - `(8,26)`, `(9,26)`, `(10,26)`, `(11,26)`\n   - Left across bottom of B:\n     - `(11,25)`, `(11,24)`, `(11,23)`, `(11,22)`, `(11,21)`, `(11,20)`, `(11,19)`, `(11,18)`, `(11,17)`\n   - Up between B and C:\n     - `(10,17)`, `(9,17)`, `(8,17)`, `(7,17)`, `(6,17)`, `(5,17)`\n   - Left across above C and toward A:\n     - `(5,16)`, `(5,15)`, `(5,14)`, `(5,13)`, `(5,12)`, `(5,11)`, `(5,10)`, `(5,9)`, `(5,8)`,\n     - `(5,7)`, `(5,6)`, `(5,5)`, `(5,4)`, `(5,3)`\n   - Down to cross A:\n     - `(6,3)`, `(7,3)`\n   - Final leg to the left edge:\n     - `(7,2)`, `(7,1)`\n\n   All these cells were originally `8` (except the starting `(7,26)` which was already `3`), so turning them to `3` produces a continuous green path.\n\n   Meanwhile, every `1` in the input is recolored to `2`, and all original `2`s are left as `2`. No obstacle cell is recolored to `3`.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n\nHere is the complete transformed grid (19= no, 14 rows \u00d7 26 columns), with all obstacles unified to `2` and the green path inserted:\n\nRow 1:\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 2:\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 3:\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 4:\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 5:\n8,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 6:\n8,2,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 7:\n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3\n\nRow 8:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3\n\nRow 9:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3\n\nRow 10:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3\n\nRow 11:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n\nRow 12:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 13:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 14:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The goal is to draw a continuous Green path from the starting pixel to the opposite side of the grid.\n*   The mixed Red and Blue blocks are treated as solid obstacles and must be recolored to uniform Red in the output.\n*   The path navigates through gaps in the obstacles, changing direction only to avoid collision.\n*   Blue pixels in the input act as \"noise\" within the obstacles and lose their distinct identity.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "To solve the task I first treat all cells with values\u202f1 or\u202f2 as solid obstacles and recolor them to a uniform\u202f2. The single non\u2011background 3 on the border is the starting point. Since the start is on the right edge, the goal is to reach the left edge, drawing a continuous path of 3s that avoids the obstacle columns.\n\nMoving left from the start row\u202f7, the first blocking obstacle column is\u202f18 (blocking rows\u202f1\u201310), so I drop down in the middle of the interval to column\u202f22 and go to the first free band below it (row\u202f12). Continuing left on that row, the next blocking obstacle is column\u202f8 (rows\u202f6\u201314), so midway between columns\u202f18 and\u202f8 at column\u202f13 I climb up into the free band above it (row\u202f2). Still moving left, column\u202f2 blocks row\u202f2, so halfway between columns\u202f8 and\u202f2 at column\u202f5 I descend back to the original safe band (row\u202f7) and finish to the left border. All obstacle cells remain 2, and the traced path is marked with 3.\n\nThe resulting grid is:\n\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,3,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The goal is to draw a continuous Green path from the starting pixel to the opposite side of the grid.\n*   The mixed Red and Blue blocks are treated as solid obstacles and must be recolored to uniform Red in the output.\n*   The path navigates through gaps in the obstacles, changing direction only to avoid collision.\n*   Blue pixels in the input

            "Full raw LLM response": "I looked at the four worked examples and extracted the following consistent behaviour:\n\n- Colours 1 and 2 are treated as a single obstacle colour; in the output all such cells are recoloured to 2.\n- The single 3 in the input marks the start point on one edge of the grid; the green path of 3s must reach the opposite edge.\n- Obstacles come as mixed 1/2 bars anchored to one side, leaving a clear \u201cgap\u201d on the opposite side. When moving horizontally across vertical bars, you must be in a low enough row for a top\u2011anchored bar, or a high enough row for a bottom\u2011anchored bar.\n- The path is drawn as axis\u2011aligned segments, changing direction only when needed to thread through the available gaps. For a sequence of alternating top/bottom anchored vertical bars, two anchor rows are fixed: one low enough to clear all top\u2011anchored bars (chosen just inside the lowest gap), and one high enough to clear bottom\u2011anchored bars (chosen just inside the top gap). These anchors are reused each time that type of gap is encountered.\n- Vertical segments are placed in the free corridors between successive obstacle columns (and the borders), roughly centred in each corridor, and horizontal segments run along the chosen anchor rows.\n\nIn the test, the start is at row\u202f7 on the right border. Vertical bars are at columns 18 (top\u2011anchored rows\u202f1\u201310), 8 (bottom\u2011anchored rows\u202f6\u201314) and 2 (top\u2011anchored rows\u202f1\u20136). The low anchor row to clear top\u2011anchored bars is 12 (just inside the 11\u201314 gap), the high anchor to clear the bottom\u2011anchored bar is 4 (just below the 1\u20135 gap). Vertical moves are made in the mid\u2011corridors at columns 22,\u202f13 and\u202f5. The resulting path runs leftwards at row\u202f7 to col\u202f22, down to row\u202f12, left to col\u202f13, up to row\u202f4, left to col\u202f5, down to row\u202f12 and left to the left edge. All original 1s/2s are recoloured to 2.\n\nThe completed output grid is:\n\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,3,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,3,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,3,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,3,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,3,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,3,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this ARC-AGI image:**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC-AGI image and the task is to *analyze*, not solve.  First, the image is parsed into 4 input-output pairs.  Each pair shares a similar structure: a light blue background, a green pixel, and some red/blue bars that act as obstacles. The output always features a green path, and the bars become solid red.\n\n**Initial Impressions and Visual Analysis:** I'm seeing a clear *pathfinding* problem.  The green pixel expands into a line.  The obstacles force this path to navigate around them. The color changes suggest a two-fold rule: obstacle color consolidation and path creation.\n\n**Diving Deeper:** My primary focus is on how the path is constructed.  Is it just the shortest path? No. It's more strategic. It seems to go straight as far as possible, then shift laterally to find the *gaps* in the obstacles.  The blue pixels within the obstacles are irrelevant. They become a homogenous red.\n\n**Categorization:** This is definitely \"pathfinding/maze solving\" with a bit of \"noise removal\" (the blue pixels) and \"object recoloring\" (the obstacles).  The green line is also a form of \"growth.\"\n\n**Key Insights:** The key is this: the green path *seeks the openings*.  It's not just a shortest path, it's a greedy algorithm, attempting to move toward the opposite wall and \"sliding\" around barriers.  The blue pixels within the obstacle act like filler that gets cleaned up.\n\n**Hypothesizing the Rule:** The core rule seems to be: 1) Consolidate the obstacles to red. 2) The green pixel becomes a path to the opposite side of the grid. 3) The path avoids the obstacles by flowing into the gaps.\n\n**Testing the Hypothesis:** I'll verify if all non-background pixels become red, if the path follows the green start pixel to the other side, and if it consistently utilizes gaps. I'll see if the blue pixels position matters.\n\n**Final Thoughts:** This is all about pathfinding and obstacle navigation. Obstacles are essentially red walls. The path finds the gaps.  The color changes are secondary.\n\n\nBased on the provided image containing four training examples, here is the analysis:\n\n### **1. Describe the observable structures**\n*   **Background:** A solid light blue field.\n*   **Key Agent:** A single Green pixel appearing on one of the perimeter edges (Top or Left).\n*   **Obstacles:** Rectangular bars extending from the grid edges into the center. These bars are composed of Red and Blue pixels mixed together.\n    *   In Example 1: One horizontal bar from the right.\n    *   In Example 2: Two vertical bars (one from top, one from bottom).\n    *   In Example 3: Three horizontal bars from the left.\n    *   In Example 4: Two vertical bars (similar to Example 2).\n*   **Output Changes:**\n    *   **Path Generation:** The single Green pixel expands into a continuous Green line (path) that traverses the grid to reach the opposite side (Top \u2192 Bottom, or Left \u2192 Right).\n    *   **Obstacle Unification:** The mixed Red/Blue bars become solid Red. The Blue pixels are effectively recolored to Red.\n    *   **Path Geometry:** The Green path navigates around the obstacles, passing through the gaps.\n\n### **2. Identify transformation categories**\n*   **Object movement:** Absent (Objects don't move; they are static obstacles).\n*   **Object recoloring:** **Present** (Red/Blue mixed objects become solid Red).\n*   **Bordering / outlining:** Absent.\n*   **Filling holes or cavities:** Absent.\n*   **Removing noise / extracting main shape:** **Present** (Blue pixels within obstacles are treated as noise and unified).\n*   **Copying / pasting / repositioning:** Absent.\n*   **Using a key anchor location:** **Present** (The Green pixel anchors the start of the path).\n*   **Pathfinding / Maze Solving:** **Present** (This is the primary mechanic).\n*   **Growth:** **Present** (The single pixel grows into a full path).\n\n### **3. Extract the key non-obvious insights**\n*   **Obstacle Homogeneity:** The specific arrangement of Blue pixels within the Red bars is irrelevant. The transformation treats any Red or Blue pixel as a solid \"wall\" and unifies them into Red in the output.\n*   **Direction of Flow:** The direction of the path is determined by the starting position of the Green pixel. If it starts on the Top/Bottom, the flow is vertical. If it starts on the Left/Right, the flow is horizontal.\n*   **Gap Navigation:** The path does not simply trace the shortest Euclidean distance. It acts like a flow or a greedy algorithm: it moves in the primary direction until blocked, slides along the obstacle face to find the gap, and passes through.\n*   **Path Thickness:** The path is consistently 1 pixel wide.\n*   **Adjacency:** The path moves adjacent to obstacles (touching them) rather than maintaining a buffer zone.\n\n### **4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)**\nThe transformation simulates a pathfinding agent or fluid flow. It begins at the single Green pixel (the \"source\") and seeks to reach the directly opposite edge of the grid.\n1.  **Normalize Environment:** All mixed Red/Blue structures are treated as solid, impassable Red obstacles.\n2.  **Generate Path:** A 1-pixel wide Green path grows from the source. It moves primarily in the cardinal direction opposite to its starting wall (e.g., if start is Top, move Down).\n3.  **Navigate Obstacles:** When the direct path is blocked by a Red obstacle, the path shifts laterally (perpendicular to the flow) to find the nearest opening/gap, passes through, and resumes its primary direction.\n\n### **5. List checks you would perform when solving**\n*   **Check Input Colors:** Verify if the obstacles always contain Blue and Red, and if the output is always purely Red.\n*   **Check Connectivity:** Confirm the Green output is always a single connected component (4-way connected).\n*   **Check Start/End:** Verify the path always connects the side containing the input Green pixel to the geometrically opposite side.\n*   **Check Path Logic:** Test if the path takes the \"first available gap\" or if it centers itself in the gap. (Looking at Ex 2, it seems to hug the obstacle edge rather than centering in the white space, suggesting a \"wall following\" or greedy heuristic).\n\n### **6. Summarize final insights**\nHINT_START\n*   The goal is to draw a continuous Green path from the starting pixel to the opposite side of the grid.\n*   The mixed Red and Blue blocks are treated as solid obstacles and must be recolored to uniform Red in the output.\n*   The path navigates through gaps in the obstacles, changing direction only to avoid collision.\n*   Blue pixels in the input act as \"noise\" within the obstacles and lose their distinct identity.\nHINT_END",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nBackground of color 8. Straight linear objects (horizontal or vertical) primarily of color 2, sometimes featuring color 1 at endpoints or alternating. Irregular, winding path-like objects composed of color 3.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1.  **Color Consolidation:** Change all instances of color 1 to color 2 within linear objects.\n2.  **Pathfinding:** Expand the object of color 3 into a path that attempts to connect the start point to the farthest linear object (color 2).\n3.  **Navigation Rules:** The path moves horizontally and vertically. When encountering a linear object perpendicular to its path, it stops with a 1-pixel buffer, moves perpendicular to the obstacle to bypass it (clearing its endpoint), and then resumes its trajectory towards the destination line to make a connection.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**I've got this!**  The user has thrown me a classic ARC puzzle, and I'm ready to tackle it. My brain is buzzing, so let's break it down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the data: grids of numbers 0-9. Color 8 is the background, like a light blue sky.  The important stuff: lines, which are straight runs of pixels \u2013 mostly color 2 (red), but with hints of color 1 (blue) at the ends or mixed in. Also, green \"starts\" (color 3), usually a single pixel, mark the beginning of something.\n\nThe main transformation is about making these colored lines and then generating a path for the green.  Rule 1 is simple: swap all the 1s inside lines with 2s. That consolidates the color. Rule 2 is the interesting part \u2013 making a path that uses those green markers to find a destination based on some sort of rules.\n\nIt appears the paths are trying to go around obstacles.  I started by looking at the examples and was thinking the path would try to go to the \"farthest\" line, but that might be leading me astray as it might depend on the current scanline. I tried to figure out if it was going to that specific line, but now I know that may be a red herring. It's more about \"bypassing\" and \"connecting\" to the closest point instead. It's not connecting, it's about going around in a specific direction!  I think I've figured out the general algorithm:\n\n1. **Preprocessing:** Change all the 1s in the lines to 2s.\n2. **Setup:**\n   - Find the start point `S` and the primary direction of movement based on the object layout.  If there are horizontal lines (\"barriers\"), the path goes vertically. If there are vertical lines (\"barriers\"), the path goes horizontally. The perpendicular direction to the lines are what the Path is going!\n   - Identify which main path scanline is being used - this should be simple as the objects should be clear on which direction is being followed based on the rules.\n3. **Navigation Loop:**\n   -  Find the nearest barrier object intersecting current trajectory based on primary direction of movement.\n   -  Stop at a \"buffer\" 2 pixels before hitting the object. It's always a buffer of two, which makes things simple to find the route.\n    - If no obstacle, go to the edge.\n   -  Make a \"Bypass Route\" using the midpoint. It turns at midpoint, then goes the perpendicular axis based on \"distance-to-original-trajectery\"\n   -  Go to the destination.\n4. **Final Check:** Confirm the paths bypass obstacles at the proper distance, and then head to the edges of the grid.\n\nNow, let's test this logic on the new test input. The test input, thankfully, just has straight lines in its path.  The key is to remember which direction, and what coordinates need to be updated. Now it's time to build this final test case and deliver the correct solution.\n\n\nThe transformation follows these steps based on the examples and description:\n\n1.  **Color Consolidation:** Identify all linear objects (vertical or horizontal lines formed mostly by color 2). Convert any pixels of color 1 within these lines to color 2.\n2.  **Pathfinding:** Start from the single pixel of color 3.\n    *   Determine the **Primary Direction** of movement. Since the obstacles in the test input are vertical lines, the movement is horizontal (West/Left, as the start is at the right edge).\n    *   Determine the **Original Trajectory** line (Scanline) extending from the start point in the primary direction. Here, Start is `(6, 25)`, so the Original Trajectory is Row 6.\n3.  **Navigation Logic:**\n    *   Move along the trajectory until an obstacle intersects the path.\n    *   **Turn Point:** Determine the \"turn\" column as the midpoint between the current position (or previous obstacle) and the upcoming obstacle.\n    *   **Bypass Decision:** Calculate which endpoint of the obstacle is closer to the **Original Trajectory** (Row 6).\n        *   Navigate to that endpoint plus a 2-pixel buffer/margin.\n        *   Move perpendicular to the Original Trajectory to reach this bypass coordinate.\n    *   **Resume Decision:** After passing the obstacle, move back towards the Original Trajectory for the next segment, specifically aiming for the midpoint before the next obstacle or the grid edge.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Grid Size:** 14 rows x 26 columns.\n*   **Objects:**\n    *   Line 1: Col 1, Rows 0-5. (Consolidated to 2s).\n    *   Line 2: Col 17, Rows 0-9. (Consolidated to 2s).\n    *   Line 3: Col 7, Rows 5-13. (Consolidated to 2s).\n    *   Start: (6, 25).\n\n*   **Path Trace:**\n    1.  **Start at (6, 25)**. Moving Left.\n    2.  **Encounter Line 2 (Col 17, Rows 0-9):**\n        *   Turn Point: Midpoint between 25 and 17 is 21. Path: `(6,25) -> (6,21)`.\n        *   Bypass: Ends at 0 and 9. Distance from Original Y=6 to 0 is 6; to 9 is 3. 9 is closer.\n        *   Target Y = 9 + 2 = 11.\n        *   Path: `(6,21) -> (11,21)`.\n    3.  **Encounter Line 3 (Col 7, Rows 5-13):**\n        *   Moving Left from x=21 to x=7. Turn Point: Midpoint between 17 and 7 is 12.\n        *   Path: `(11,21) -> (11,12)`.\n        *   Bypass: Ends at 5 and 13.

Irregular, winding path-like objects composed of color 3.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1.  **Color Consolidation:** Change all instances of color 1 to color 2 within linear objects.\n2.  **Pathfinding:** Expand the object of color 3 into a path that attempts to connect the start point to the farthest linear object (color 2).\n3.  **Navigation Rules:** The path moves horizontally and vertically. When encountering a linear object perpendicular to its path, it stops with a 1-pixel buffer, moves perpendicular to the obstacle to bypass it (clearing its endpoint), and then resumes its trajectory towards the destination line to make a connection.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Below is how I interpreted and applied the transformation.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Consolidate the linear objects (1 \u2192 2)\n\nFrom all examples it is consistent that every pixel of color `1` that sits on a straight linear object is converted to `2`, and `2`-pixels are never changed or overwritten by the path.\n\nIn the test input, all `1`s occur on vertical straight lines, so we simply change them all to `2`:\n\n- Column 2: row 1 had `1` \u2192 `2`.\n- Column 18: rows 1, 3, 5 had `1` \u2192 `2`.\n- Column 8: rows 12 and 14 had `1` \u2192 `2`.\n\nAfter this step, the vertical 2-lines are:\n\n- Left line: column 2, rows 1\u20136.\n- Middle line: column 8, rows 6\u201314.\n- Right line: column 18, rows 1\u201310.\n\nThe starting 3-pixel is at row 7, column 26.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Extending the 3-path\n\nFrom the examples, the 3-path:\n\n- Starts from the original 3.\n- Moves only horizontally and vertically.\n- Avoids writing on any `2` cells.\n- Weaves around vertical or horizontal 2-lines by going around their endpoints, typically leaving some horizontal/vertical clearance.\n\nIn the test, the 3 is on the far right, and all 2-lines are to its left. So I extend the 3 into a continuous path that threads from the starting 3 at (7,26) leftwards across the grid, going around the vertical lines at columns 18, 8, and 2 by going below the first, then above the second, then below the third, ending at the far left side.\n\nConcretely, the 3-path I construct is:\n\n1. **From the start leftwards to just before the rightmost 2-line**  \n   On row 7 (the row of the starting 3), move left from column 26 to column 20:\n   - Row 7, columns 20\u201326 become 3.\n\n2. **Go down to pass under the rightmost vertical line (col 18, rows 1\u201310)**  \n   At column 20, go downward from row 7 to row 11:\n   - Column 20, rows 7\u201311 become 3.\n\n   Row 11 is below the bottom of that vertical line (bottom at row 10), so we are underneath it.\n\n3. **Move left toward the middle vertical line, staying clear of it**  \n   On row 11, go left from column 20 to column 10:\n   - Row 11, columns 10\u201320 become 3.\n\n   This keeps a horizontal gap from the middle line at column 8.\n\n4. **Go up to get above the middle vertical line (col 8, rows 6\u201314)**  \n   At column 10, go upward from row 11 to row 5:\n   - Column 10, rows 5\u201311 become 3.\n\n   Row 5 is above the top of the middle vertical line (top at row 6).\n\n5. **Move left toward the left vertical line (col 2, rows 1\u20136), still keeping a gap**  \n   On row 5, go left from column 10 to column 4:\n   - Row 5, columns 4\u201310 become 3.\n\n   This keeps a gap from the line at column 2.\n\n6. **Go down to pass under the left vertical line (col 2, bottom at row 6)**  \n   At column 4, go downward from row 5 to row 7:\n   - Column 4, rows 5\u20137 become 3.\n\n   Row 7 is below the bottom of that left vertical line.\n\n7. **Finally, sweep left to the far boundary**  \n   On row 7, go left from column 4 to column 1:\n   - Row 7, columns 1\u20134 become 3.\n\nCombining all of this yields a single connected 3-path that starts at the original 3, weaves around each vertical 2-line, and ends on the far left side. No 3 overwrites any 2; all 2s (including former 1s) remain.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nBackground of color 8. Straight linear objects (horizontal or vertical) primarily of color 2, sometimes featuring color 1 at endpoints or alternating. Irregular, winding path-like objects composed of color 3.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1.  **Color Consolidation:** Change all instances of color 1 to color 2 within linear objects.\n2.  **Pathfinding:** Expand the object of color 3 into a path that attempts to connect the start point to the farthest linear object (color 2).\n3.  **Navigation Rules:** The path moves horizontally and vertically. When encountering a linear object perpendicular to its path, it stops with a 1-pixel buffer, moves perpendicular to the obstacle to bypass it (clearing its endpoint), and then resumes its trajectory towards the destination line to make a connection.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation:\n\n1. **Color Consolidation**: Change all 1s to 2s within the linear objects\n2. **Pathfinding**: Create a path from the 3 that navigates around vertical/horizontal line obstacles\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n- The 3 is located at position (5, 25)\n- Line A: Column 17, rows 0-9 (with 1s at rows 0, 2, 4)\n- Line B: Column 7, rows 5-13 (with 1s at rows 11, 13)  \n- Line C: Column 1, rows 0-5 (with 1 at row 0)\n\n**Path construction:**\nThe path starts at (5, 25) and must navigate left toward the farthest line (column 1), stopping 2 columns before each obstacle with a 1-pixel buffer:\n\n1. Go left from (5, 25) to (5, 19) - stops before Line A at column 17\n2. Turn down to (10, 19) - clears Line A's bottom (row 9)\n3. Go left to (10, 9) - stops before Line B at column 7\n4. Turn up to (4, 9) - clears Line B's top (row 5)\n5. Go left to (4, 3) - stops before Line C at column 1\n6. Turn down to (6, 3) - clears Line C's bottom (row 5)\n7. Go left to (6, 0) - reaches the left edge\n8. Continue down from (6, 0) to (13, 0) - extends to bottom\n\n**Output grid:**\n\n```\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,3,8,8,8,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nBackground of color 8. Straight linear objects (horizontal or vertical) primarily of color 2, sometimes featuring color 1 at endpoints or alternating. Irregular, winding path-like objects composed of color 3.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1.  **Color Consolidation:** Change all instances of color 1 to color 2 within linear objects.\n2.  **Pathfinding:** Expand the object of color 3 into a path that attempts to connect the start point to the farthest linear object (color 2).\n3.  **Navigation Rules:** The path moves horizontally and vertically. When encountering a linear object perpendicular to its path, it stops with a 1-pixel buffer, moves perpendicular to the obstacle to bypass it (clearing its endpoint), and then resumes its trajectory towards the destination line to make a connection.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "I first converted every cell of colour\u202f1 into colour\u202f2, as in all of the training examples.\n\nThe remaining task is to extend the lone 3 in the input into a continuous, orthogonal path to the edge of the grid that is farthest from the starting 3. In this test the 3 is on the right\u2011hand edge, so the farthest edge is the left. The colour\u202f2 lines act as obstacles; when approaching one of these vertical lines along a row that would intersect it, the path stops with a one\u2011cell buffer, moves vertically to clear the end of the line plus a buffer, then resumes leftward. This yields a zig\u2011zagging route that stays one cell clear of the lines at columns\u202f17,\u202f7, and\u202f1.\n\nApplying this to the test grid produces the following output:\n\n```\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,3,8,8,8,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,8,8,8,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

                "response": "**Analysis and Synthesis of Grid Objects**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at these grids, and I've got a pretty good understanding of what's going on. First things first, the *vast* majority of the grid is filled with the number 8. So I'll treat that as the background, the empty space, the canvas if you will.\n\nNow, let's get into the interesting stuff. I see these straight lines, vertical and horizontal, composed mainly of the color 2. But they aren't *always* just color 2. Sometimes I see color 1 bits at the endpoints. In some instances, it's an alternating pattern of 1s and 2s along the line. So the linear structures are mainly 2, but can include 1.\n\nThen there's the color 3. This one's interesting, because they aren't straight. They're these winding shapes, almost like paths or snakes, that twist and turn through the grid. They're composed of a contiguous line of cells. They're a single connected object that winds through the space.\n\nPutting it all together, I see: a background color 8, straight linear objects (horizontal or vertical) with colors 2 and sometimes 1, and irregular winding objects made of color 3.\n\n**Here's the concise summary:**\n```\n<objects_summary>\nBackground of color 8. Straight linear objects (horizontal or vertical) primarily of color 2, sometimes featuring color 1 at endpoints or alternating. Irregular, winding path-like objects composed of color 3.\n</objects_summary>\n```\n\n\nBased on the provided grids, the objects can be categorized into three distinct types based on their color, shape, and arrangement attributes.\n\n**1. The Background Field**\nThe most prevalent object is the background, which fills the entire grid space not occupied by other distinct objects.\n*   **Color:** 8.\n*   **Attributes:** Acts as a continuous canvas or empty space surrounding the other structures.\n\n**2. Straight Linear Structures**\nThese objects appear as straight lines spanning varying lengths across the grid.\n*   **Color:** Primarily color 2, with occasional instances of color 1.\n*   **Orientation:** These lines are strictly linear, oriented either vertically or horizontally.\n*   **Composition:**\n    *   Many of these lines are solid color 2.\n    *   Some lines feature color 1 specifically at the endpoints (tips).\n    *   Some lines exhibit an alternating pattern of color 1 and color 2 (e.g., 1, 2, 1, 2...).\n*   **Attributes:** They appear as rigid, bar-like barriers or dividers.\n\n**3. Winding Path Structures**\nThese objects are contiguous shapes that bend and turn, distinguishing them from the straight linear structures.\n*   **Color:** 3.\n*   **Shape:** These form irregular, snake-like paths or conduits. Unlike the linear structures, they make 90-degree turns and wind through the grid.\n*   **Attributes:** They are continuous and connected, often traversing large sections of the grid and crossing over or under the linear structures.\n\n<objects_summary>\n1. Background field of color 8.\n2. Straight vertical or horizontal linear structures primarily of color 2, sometimes containing color 1 at endpoints or in alternating patterns.\n3. Winding, contiguous path-like structures composed of color 3.\n</objects_summary>",

Objects Description\nBackground of color 8. Straight linear objects (horizontal or vertical) primarily of color 2, sometimes featuring color 1 at endpoints or alternating. Irregular, winding path-like objects composed of color 3.",
                "response": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this task:**\n\nOkay, so I've got this set of input grids, output grids, and object descriptions, and my job is to figure out the rules that describe the transformations. Specifically, I need to focus on how the \"winding paths\" (color 3) interact with the \"linear objects\" (colors 1 and 2). The core challenge is to define a system using strict numeric color values.\n\nMy first thought is to dig into the examples provided and understand the core mechanics of how the input becomes the output. I need to break down the steps, object by object. It looks like the main things happening are: some pixels are changing colors, and the single pixel of color 3 is transforming.\n\nI\u2019m seeing that the \"linear objects\" are always vertical lines. Sometimes they are mixed with color 1, but these become solid 2s in the output. The 'path' (color 3) is a single starting point that turns into an extended line. I need to determine the rule that defines its shape and movement.\n\nI notice this path is connecting at endpoints for several examples, and it seems to avoid obstacles (linear lines). One hypothesis that starts to stick is that the 1s act as \"connectors\" - it's the 3 that goes to those connection points. Looking at Ex. 1, I observe the path is changing direction, which suggests it is not a direct line to the endpoint.\n\nEx 2 has this interesting path of 3s that connect two lines - an interesting case to trace. It's almost like a route-finding algorithm. The path is not exactly *touching* the line, it seems. There is a distance, so let's call it a buffer.\n\nNow, Ex. 3. Interesting. The single path is linking two horizontal lines. Ex. 4 is the same, now with lines on a side. Okay, so now I start to formulate a refined model:\n1. Linear normalization: Convert mixed colors to 2s.\n2. Path connection: The object connects at 1s or the line end to other lines. The path (color 3) acts like a source and expands to connect.\n3. Path movement: Starts from the given coordinate, connects to obstacles at ends using an algorithm.\n4. If objects are horizontal, the path will also go horizontal or vertical to move around or to other segments and will connect to them.\n\nI can test these theories. I see that there must be an algorithm here for path creation, and I need to figure it out by studying more examples or looking at the data for patterns. Looking at Ex. 4, it's clear the shape of the path is key.\n\nIn Ex. 2, the buffer is not at the *start* of the line. So what decides the turn row, and path-end?\n\nBased on Ex. 2 and Ex. 4, I realize I need to refine the path behavior. There seems to be a rule of alignment.\n\nIt appears the object (3) generates a path that navigates toward the target objects (vertical lines, then horizontal lines). I need a solid rule for this navigation, but the buffer/gap is present in all the examples, so it can't be just random. It is based on relative position. It seems the target objects are the lines with mixed values, but the buffer defines a separation.\n\nNow, for any point (3), I can determine the relative direction, and move with a buffer to move and connect to segments. The \"routing\" part: move towards closest. The \"blocking object\" (the lines) creates a turning point. If the path reaches or blocks, the path bypasses and stops at the next target line with the same rules.\n\nI'm thinking about the Test Input. Based on this, there is now a plan. Let's see if this rule fits well:\n\n1.  Identify the lines with 1s and normalize (1->2).\n2.  Start at given point.\n3.  Go toward nearest target objects and keep to the rule (bypass, buffer, horizontal/vertical and stop).\n\nI'll build the Test Input path now. The goal is to describe each step of the Test Input as a clear route.\n\nI can make the output based on this sequence, and the plan seems valid. Now, I have to test it using the other inputs. If I check for 1s for the buffer/alignment, I have a working system for the outputs. The details need work - the description of each route and transformation. The color for the linear objects is fixed, the color of the path remains unchanged.\n\nI'm feeling good about this solution. I'll summarize it and confirm this in my mind with an overview of the Test Input, which requires detailed coordinate transformations.\n\n\nBased on the provided examples and input/output pairs, here are the identified transformations:\n\n1.  **Homogenization of Linear Objects:**\n    *   All pixels of color **1** located within or at the endpoints of the linear objects are transformed into color **2**. This results in solid lines of color 2 in the output.\n\n2.  **Path Generation (Color 3):**\n    *   The single starting pixel of color **3** expands into a continuous winding path of color **3**.\n    *   **Targeting:** The path appears to seek a connection to the furthest available linear object (color 2) or the edge of the grid, navigating from its starting position.\n    *   **Routing Logic:**\n        *   The path moves primarily in cardinal directions (horizontal and vertical).\n        *   It prioritizes moving along the axis towards the destination.\n        *   **Obstacle Avoidance:** When the path encounters a linear object (color 2) that blocks its trajectory (or is the intermediate target):\n            *   It stops **2 pixels** away from the object (leaving a 1-pixel gap of background color 8).\n            *   It turns 90 degrees (vertically if moving horizontally, or vice versa) to bypass the object.\n            *   The bypass continues until it clears the obstacle's length (typically moving to the row/column immediately past the obstacle's end).\n        *   **Connection:** Upon reaching the final destination line (or after bypassing obstacles to align with it), the path moves directly adjacent to the line (or connects to it), often aligning with the center or a valid segment of the target line.\n        *   In Example 1, the path starts aligned with the obstacle. It moves slightly, shifts laterally to the side (column 1) to avoid the vertical line at column 8, and continues to the bottom.\n        *   In Example 4 and Test Input logic, the path navigates around intermediate lines to reach the furthest line.\n\n3.  **Layering:**\n    *   The path of color **3** does not overwrite the finalized linear objects of color **2**. It connects to them or stops adjacent to them.\n\n<transformation_summary>\n1.  **Color Consolidation:** Change all instances of color 1 to color 2 within linear objects.\n2.  **Pathfinding:** Expand the object of color 3 into a path that attempts to connect the start point to the farthest linear object (color 2).\n3.  **Navigation Rules:** The path moves horizontally and vertically. When encountering a linear object perpendicular to its path, it stops with a 1-pixel buffer, moves perpendicular to the obstacle to bypass it (clearing its endpoint), and then resumes its trajectory towards the destination line to make a connection.\n</transformation_summary>",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nBackground of color 8. Straight linear objects (horizontal or vertical) primarily of color 2, sometimes featuring color 1 at endpoints or alternating. Irregular, winding path-like objects composed of color 3.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1.  **Color Consolidation:** Change all instances of color 1 to color 2 within linear objects.\n2.  **Pathfinding:** Expand the object of color 3 into a path that attempts to connect the start point to the farthest linear object (color 2).\n3.  **Navigation Rules:** The path moves horizontally and vertically. When encountering a linear object perpendicular to its path, it stops with a 1-pixel buffer, moves perpendicular to the obstacle to bypass it (clearing its endpoint), and then resumes its trajectory towards the destination line to make a connection.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain: (1) a uniform color 8 background; (2) straight horizontal and vertical lines of color 2, varying in length; (3) L-shaped or rectangular outline fragments of color 3; (4) isolated single-cell markers of color 3; (5) single-cell markers of color 1, often appearing at line endpoints or embedded within color 2 lines; (6) composite lines mixing colors 1 and 2, sometimes in alternating patterns. All linear objects are 1 cell thick.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. **Replace all 1s with 2s** in line patterns\n2. **Calculate offsets** for each line: offset = (number of 1s) + 1\n3. **For vertical lines sharing the 3 marker's row**: Create a rectangular 3-boundary where:\n   - Edges are offset from line positions toward the 3 marker\n   - Top is at the 3 marker's row\n   - Bottom is at (inside line's end row + offset)\n4. **For horizontal lines**: Create L-shaped 3-boundaries where:\n   - Turn row = line row - offset\n   - Direction depends on 1s position (left\u2192right, right\u2192left)\n   - Extent = offset past the line's end\n5. **The 3-path forms connected boundaries** around line regions, with lines (now all 2s) remaining visible where they cross the boundary path\n6. **Lines not sharing the 3 marker's row/column** are converted (1\u21922) without additional 3 boundaries\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Alright, here's the plan. The user wants me to solve an ARC task, and I'm on it. \n\n**Initial Understanding:** The gist is to take an input grid with some lines (colors 1 and 2), a background (color 8), and a green pixel (color 3), then spit out a modified grid. The lines seem to be guides, and I need to draw a green path related to the position of the green pixel and the lines.\n\n**Deconstructing the Clues:** I've carefully analyzed the provided examples. The red (2) and blue (1) lines are key. These lines are made of alternating colors, and the count of '1' pixels within each line seems to influence the offset of my green path. The green path isn't a random thing, it makes specific rectangular/L-shaped connections.\n\n**Formalizing the Process:**\nI've broken it down step by step:\n\n1.  **Identify**: Find the green marker and the lines. Extract the relevant properties of the lines: orientation, position, count of '1' pixels.\n2.  **Transformation**: Replace all '1' pixels in the lines with '2' pixels. This'll be straightforward, a quick pixel swap.\n3.  **Offset Calculation**: For each line, count the number of '1's to derive an offset equal to `count_of_1s + 1`. This offset will determine how far the green path 'avoids' the lines.\n4.  **Path generation**: The tricky part: Create a green path. This green path forms a rectangular boundary around the lines. It looks like it moves from a source (green marker), goes to a nearby line and \"hugs\" around that line, then to the next.\n    *   **\"Go around the closest valid endpoint\"**: I figured out that, in the \"hugging\" part, the green path turns at the nearest valid endpoint of the line. If the green path is at some column 'c', and the line has start at column 's' and end column 'e'. If distance abs(c - s) is smaller than abs(c - e) then path goes towards s, otherwise to e.\n\n**Testing the Logic**: I rigorously checked my understanding by meticulously comparing the transformation rules with example grids and test input and the generated output. I validated the concept of path generation against the edge cases and test inputs.\n\n**Putting It All Together:** The core algorithm should be:\n\n1.  **Parse**: Process the input grid.\n2.  **Change `1` to `2`**.\n3.  **Path tracing**: The algorithm \"traces\" a path based on the line position, offsets and direction (left or right). The green path avoids the lines based on the calculated offset.\n4.  **Draw the Green Boundary**: Actually set the cells in the grid to the green color. Avoid overwriting 2s.\n\nWith this knowledge and a solid algorithm, I'm ready to tackle this task.\n\n\nTo solve this challenge, I will apply the transformation rules inferred from the solved examples and the problem description.\n\n### Analysis of the Task\n\nThe input grids contain vertical or horizontal lines composed of color 2 (red) and color 1 (blue) on a color 8 (teal) background. There is also a single marker of color 3 (green). The goal is to transform the grid by:\n1.  **Converting all 1s to 2s** within the lines.\n2.  **Generating a boundary path of color 3** that starts from the original color 3 marker and \"wraps\" around the lines. The distance of the boundary from each line is determined by an **offset** calculated from the number of 1s in that line.\n\n### Logic and Rules\n\n1.  **Line Identification**:\n    *   **Line 1 (Leftmost)**: Vertical line at **Column 1**, spanning **Rows 0-5**.\n        *   Contains one `1` (at Row 0).\n        *   **Offset** = (Count of 1s) + 1 = 1 + 1 = **2**.\n    *   **Line 2 (Middle)**: Vertical line at **Column 7**, spanning **Rows 5-13**.\n        *   Contains two `1`s (at Rows 11, 13).\n        *   **Offset** = (Count of 1s) + 1 = 2 + 1 = **3**.\n    *   **Line 3 (Rightmost)**: Vertical line at **Column 17**, spanning **Rows 0-9**.\n        *   Contains three `1`s (at Rows 0, 2, 4).\n        *   **Offset** = (Count of 1s) + 1 = 3 + 1 = **4**.\n\n2.  **Path Generation**:\n    *   **Start**: The Source 3 is at **(Row 6, Column 25)**.\n    *   Since the lines are vertical and arranged horizontally (columns 1, 7, 17), and the source is at the far right (col 25), the path traverses from **Right to Left**.\n    *   **Step 1 (Wrap Line 3)**:\n        *   Move Left from (6, 25) to a buffer distance from Line 3 (Col 17).\n        *   Target Column = $17 + \\text{Offset} = 17 + 4 = 21$.\n        *   At **(6, 21)**, decide vertical direction. Line 3 spans 0-9. Current Row is 6.\n        *   Distance to top (0) is 6. Distance to bottom (9) is 3. Bottom is closer.\n        *   Target Row = $9 + \\text{Offset} = 9 + 4 = 13$.\n        *   **Path**: Horizontal to (6, 21), then Vertical down to **(13, 21)**.\n    *   **Step 2 (Wrap Line 2)**:\n        *   Move Left from (13, 21) to buffer distance from Line 2 (Col 7).\n        *   Target Column = $7 + \\text{Offset} = 7 + 3 = 10$.\n        *   At **(13, 10)**, decide vertical direction. Line 2 spans 5-13. Current Row is 13.\n        *   Distance to bottom (13) is 0. However, going down ($13+3=16$) is out of bounds.\n        *   Must go Up towards top (5). Target Row = $5 - \\text{Offset} = 5 - 3 = 2$.\n        *   **Path**: Horizontal to (13, 10), then Vertical up to **(2, 10)**.\n    *   **Step 3 (Wrap Line 1)**:\n        *   Move Left from (2, 10) to buffer distance from Line 1 (Col 1).\n        *   Target Column = $1 + \\text{Offset} = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n        *   At **(2, 3)**, decide vertical direction.

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain: (1) a uniform color 8 background; (2) straight horizontal and vertical lines of color 2, varying in length; (3) L-shaped or rectangular outline fragments of color 3; (4) isolated single-cell markers of color 3; (5) single-cell markers of color 1, often appearing at line endpoints or embedded within color 2 lines; (6) composite lines mixing colors 1 and 2, sometimes in alternating patterns. All linear objects are 1 cell thick.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. **Replace all 1s with 2s** in line patterns\n2. **Calculate offsets** for each line: offset = (number of 1s) + 1\n3. **For vertical lines sharing the 3 marker's row**: Create a rectangular 3-boundary where:\n   - Edges are offset from line positions toward the 3 marker\n   - Top is at the 3 marker's row\n   - Bottom is at (inside line's end row + offset)\n4. **For horizontal lines**: Create L-shaped 3-boundaries where:\n   - Turn row = line row - offset\n   - Direction depends on 1s position (left\u2192right, right\u2192left)\n   - Extent = offset past the line's end\n5. **The 3-path forms connected boundaries** around line regions, with lines (now all 2s) remaining visible where they cross the boundary path\n6. **Lines not sharing the 3 marker's row/column** are converted (1\u21922) without additional 3 boundaries\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand the transformation from the examples:\n\n1. **Replace all 1s with 2s** in the line patterns\n2. **Calculate offsets**: offset = (number of 1s in the line) + 1\n3. **For vertical lines sharing the 3 marker's row**: Create 3-boundaries with:\n   - Boundary columns at (line position + offset) toward the 3 marker\n   - Horizontal 3s at the 3's row connecting boundaries\n   - Vertical 3s from the 3's row downward to (line end + offset)\n   - Bottom horizontal connecting the boundary columns\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n- 3 marker at position (row 6, column 25)\n- Line at column 1 (rows 0-5): 1 one \u2192 offset = 2, does NOT share row 6\n- Line at column 7 (rows 5-13): 2 ones at rows 11,13 \u2192 offset = 3, shares row 6\n- Line at column 17 (rows 0-9): 3 ones at rows 0,2,4 \u2192 offset = 4, shares row 6\n\n**Calculating boundaries:**\n- Column 7 line: boundary at column 7+3 = 10 (toward 3 at col 25)\n- Column 17 line: boundary at column 17+4 = 21 (toward 3 at col 25)\n- Bottom row: max(9+4, capped at 13) = row 13\n\n**Constructing 3-boundaries:**\n- Row 6: 3s from column 0-10 (skipping line at col 7) and columns 21-25\n- Vertical at column 10: rows 6-13\n- Vertical at column 21: rows 6-13\n- Bottom horizontal at row 13: columns 10-21\n\n**Output:**\n```\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8\n```",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain: (1) a uniform color 8 background; (2) straight horizontal and vertical lines of color 2, varying in length; (3) L-shaped or rectangular outline fragments of color 3; (4) isolated single-cell markers of color 3; (5) single-cell markers of color 1, often appearing at line endpoints or embedded within color 2 lines; (6) composite lines mixing colors 1 and 2, sometimes in alternating patterns. All linear objects are 1 cell thick.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. **Replace all 1s with 2s** in line patterns\n2. **Calculate offsets** for each line: offset = (number of 1s) + 1\n3. **For vertical lines sharing the 3 marker's row**: Create a rectangular 3-boundary where:\n   - Edges are offset from line positions toward the 3 marker\n   - Top is at the 3 marker's row\n   - Bottom is at (inside line's end row + offset)\n4. **For horizontal lines**: Create L-shaped 3-boundaries where:\n   - Turn row = line row - offset\n   - Direction depends on 1s position (left\u2192right, right\u2192left)\n   - Extent = offset past the line's end\n5. **The 3-path forms connected boundaries** around line regions, with lines (now all 2s) remaining visible where they cross the boundary path\n6. **Lines not sharing the 3 marker's row/column** are converted (1\u21922) without additional 3 boundaries\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Below is how I inferred the rule and applied it to the test case.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Observed behavior in the examples\n\nAcross the four examples:\n\n1. **All 1s become 2s** in the output. No 1 remains anywhere.\n2. There is exactly **one 3 in the input**, which becomes the **anchor** for a larger connected path of 3s in the output.\n3. Depending on where this 3 lies:\n   - If it\u2019s on the **top border** (Examples 1 and 3), the transformation is built around **horizontal lines**.\n   - If it\u2019s on the **left border** (Examples 2 and 4), the transformation is built around **vertical lines**.\n4. For the **vertical\u2013line cases** (Examples 2 & 4, 3 at left edge):\n   - Collect all vertical columns containing 1s or 2s.\n   - For each such column \\(c_j\\):\n     - Count how many 1s it has: \\(n_j\\).\n     - Let the **offset** be \\(o_j = n_j + 1\\).\n     - Let the line\u2019s **last row** (its lowest 1/2) be \\(r^{\\text{end}}_j\\).\n     - Compute a **boundary column** \\(B_j = c_j - o_j\\) (towards the 3, which is at the left).\n     - Compute a candidate **bottom row** \\(H_j = \\min(r^{\\text{end}}_j + o_j,\\; \\text{grid height})\\).\n   - Let:\n     - \\(H = \\min_j H_j\\) (global bottom for the 3 path),\n     - \\(B_{\\min} = \\min_j B_j\\),\n     - \\(B_{\\max} = \\max_j B_j\\).\n   - Then draw 3s as:\n     - Vertical segments at each \\(B_j\\) from the 3\u2019s row \\(r_0\\) down to \\(H\\).\n     - On the 3\u2019s row \\(r_0\\): 3s from the **left edge** to \\(B_{\\min}\\), and from \\(B_{\\max}\\) to the **right edge**.\n     - On the bottom row \\(H\\): 3s from \\(B_{\\min}\\) to \\(B_{\\max}\\).\n   - This exactly reproduces the 3-shapes in Examples 2 and 4.\n\n5. For our **test input**, the 3 is on the **right edge** (not top), and the structure is clearly dominated by **vertical lines**. This is the horizontal mirror of the \u201c3 on left + vertical lines\u201d situation, so we can mirror that vertical\u2013case rule.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Adapting the vertical-line rule to \u201c3 on the right\u201d\n\nGiven:\n- Grid width \\(W\\),\n- 3 marker at row \\(r_0\\), column \\(c_0 = W\\) (right edge),\n- Vertical lines at columns \\(c_j\\) with 1s/2s.\n\nWe:\n\n1. For each vertical line at column \\(c_j\\):\n   - Count 1s: \\(n_j\\),\n   - Offset: \\(o_j = n_j + 1\\),\n   - Last row with 1/2: \\(r^{\\text{end}}_j\\),\n   - **Boundary column** (towards the 3, i.e. to the right):\n     \\[\n     B_j = c_j + o_j\n     \\]\n   - Candidate bottom row:\n     \\[\n     H_j = \\min(r^{\\text{end}}_j + o_j,\\; \\text{grid height})\n     \\]\n2. Let:\n   - \\(H = \\min_j H_j\\),\n   - \\(B_{\\min} = \\min_j B_j\\),\n   - \\(B_{\\max} = \\max_j B_j\\).\n3. Draw 3s:\n   - Vertically at each column \\(B_j\\) from row \\(r_0\\) to row \\(H\\).\n   - On row \\(r_0\\): 3s at columns:\n     - \\(1 \\dots B_{\\min}\\),\n     - \\(B_{\\max} \\dots W\\).\n   - On row \\(H\\): 3s at columns \\(B_{\\min} \\dots B_{\\max}\\).\n4.

Identify vertical lines and compute offsets\n\nNon-8 columns (vertical lines):\n\n- **Column 2**: rows 1\u20136 have 2s / 1; so:\n  - 1s in original: at row 1 \u2192 \\(n_2 = 1\\),\n  - offset \\(o_2 = 1 + 1 = 2\\),\n  - last row with 1/2: \\(r^{\\text{end}}_2 = 6\\).\n- **Column 8**: rows 6\u201314 have 1/2; original 1s at rows 12, 14:\n  - \\(n_8 = 2\\),\n  - \\(o_8 = 2 + 1 = 3\\),\n  - \\(r^{\\text{end}}_8 = 14\\).\n- **Column 18**: rows 1\u201310 have 1/2; original 1s at rows 1, 3, 5:\n  - \\(n_{18} = 3\\),\n  - \\(o_{18} = 3 + 1 = 4\\),\n  - \\(r^{\\text{end}}_{18} = 10\\).\n\nMarker is at column \\(c_0 = 26\\) (right edge), so **boundary columns** go to the right:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nB_2   &= 2 + o_2   = 2 + 2 = 4,\\\\\nB_8   &= 8 + o_8   = 8 + 3 = 11,\\\\\nB_{18}&=18 + o_{18}=18 + 4=22.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nCandidate bottom rows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nH_2   &= \\min(6+2,\\;14) = 8,\\\\\nH_8   &= \\min(14+3,\\;14)=14,\\\\\nH_{18}&= \\min(10+4,\\;14)=14.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nGlobal bottom:\n\n\\[\nH = \\min(H_2, H_8, H_{18}) = \\min(8,14,14) = 8.\n\\]\n\nAnd:\n\n\\[\nB_{\\min} = 4,\\quad B_{\\max} = 22.\n\\]\n\n### 3.3. Place the 3s\n\n- **Vertical boundaries**: at columns 4, 11, 22 from row 7 down to row 8.\n\n- **Top (marker row 7)**:\n  - 3s at columns \\(1..B_{\\min} = 1..4\\),\n  - and at columns \\(B_{\\max}..W = 22..26\\).\n\n- **Bottom row \\(H = 8\\)**:\n  - 3s at columns \\(4..22\\).\n\nAll other cells remain as in the 1\u21922-converted grid.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain: (1) a uniform color 8 background; (2) straight horizontal and vertical lines of color 2, varying in length; (3) L-shaped or rectangular outline fragments of color 3; (4) isolated single-cell markers of color 3; (5) single-cell markers of color 1, often appearing at line endpoints or embedded within color 2 lines; (6) composite lines mixing colors 1 and 2, sometimes in alternating patterns. All linear objects are 1 cell thick.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. **Replace all 1s with 2s** in line patterns\n2. **Calculate offsets** for each line: offset = (number of 1s) + 1\n3. **For vertical lines sharing the 3 marker's row**: Create a rectangular 3-boundary where:\n   - Edges are offset from line positions toward the 3 marker\n   - Top is at the 3 marker's row\n   - Bottom is at (inside line's end row + offset)\n4. **For horizontal lines**: Create L-shaped 3-boundaries where:\n   - Turn row = line row - offset\n   - Direction depends on 1s position (left\u2192right, right\u2192left)\n   - Extent = offset past the line's end\n5. **The 3-path forms connected boundaries** around line regions, with lines (now all 2s) remaining visible where they cross the boundary path\n6. **Lines not sharing the 3 marker's row/column** are converted (1\u21922) without additional 3 boundaries\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

Objects Description\nThe grids contain: (1) a uniform color 8 background; (2) straight horizontal and vertical lines of color 2, varying in length; (3) L-shaped or rectangular outline fragments of color 3; (4) isolated single-cell markers of color 3; (5) single-cell markers of color 1, often appearing at line endpoints or embedded within color 2 lines; (6) composite lines mixing colors 1 and 2, sometimes in alternating patterns. All linear objects are 1 cell thick.",
                "response": "Looking at the examples, I can identify the following transformations:\n\n## Transformation Analysis\n\n### 1. Color 1 Replacement\nIn all examples, cells containing color 1 within the line patterns are replaced with color 2. The mixed patterns (1,2,1,2...) become uniform color 2 lines.\n\n### 2. Single Color 3 Marker Acting as Anchor Point\nThe isolated color 3 marker serves as a starting/reference point for generating new color 3 boundary shapes.\n\n### 3. L-shaped or Rectangular Boundary Generation\nColor 3 boundaries are created based on the line configurations:\n- **For horizontal lines** (Examples 1, 3): L-shaped paths of 3s are created\n- **For vertical lines** (Examples 2, 4): Rectangular/U-shaped boundaries of 3s are created\n\n### 4. Offset Calculation Based on Count of 1s\nThe number of 1s in each line determines the offset distance:\n- **Offset = (count of 1s in line) + 1**\n- This offset determines:\n  - Turn row for horizontal lines: line_row - offset\n  - Edge positions for vertical lines: line_column - offset (toward the 3 marker)\n  - Vertical extent: inside_line_end_row + offset\n\n### 5. Direction Determination\n- For horizontal lines: If 1s are at the left end, the L-shape extends right; if at the right end, it extends left\n- For vertical lines: Boundaries extend toward the 3 marker position\n\n### 6. Boundary Shape Structure\n- The 3-boundaries connect the marker to the lines\n- For rectangles: top row extends from marker to rectangle edges and beyond, vertical edges on both sides, horizontal bottom edge\n- Lines remain visible (as 2s) where they intersect the boundary path\n\n<transformation_summary>\n1. **Replace all 1s with 2s** in line patterns\n2. **Calculate offsets** for each line: offset = (number of 1s) + 1\n3. **For vertical lines sharing the 3 marker's row**: Create a rectangular 3-boundary where:\n   - Edges are offset from line positions toward the 3 marker\n   - Top is at the 3 marker's row\n   - Bottom is at (inside line's end row + offset)\n4. **For horizontal lines**: Create L-shaped 3-boundaries where:\n   - Turn row = line row - offset\n   - Direction depends on 1s position (left\u2192right, right\u2192left)\n   - Extent = offset past the line's end\n5. **The 3-path forms connected boundaries** around line regions, with lines (now all 2s) remaining visible where they cross the boundary path\n6. **Lines not sharing the 3 marker's row/column** are converted (1\u21922) without additional 3 boundaries\n</transformation_summary>",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain: (1) a uniform color 8 background; (2) straight horizontal and vertical lines of color 2, varying in length; (3) L-shaped or rectangular outline fragments of color 3; (4) isolated single-cell markers of color 3; (5) single-cell markers of color 1, often appearing at line endpoints or embedded within color 2 lines; (6) composite lines mixing colors 1 and 2, sometimes in alternating patterns. All linear objects are 1 cell thick.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. **Replace all 1s with 2s** in line patterns\n2. **Calculate offsets** for each line: offset = (number of 1s) + 1\n3. **For vertical lines sharing the 3 marker's row**: Create a rectangular 3-boundary where:\n   - Edges are offset from line positions toward the 3 marker\n   - Top is at the 3 marker's row\n   - Bottom is at (inside line's end row + offset)\n4. **For horizontal lines**: Create L-shaped 3-boundaries where:\n   - Turn row = line row - offset\n   - Direction depends on 1s position (left\u2192right, right\u2192left)\n   - Extent = offset past the line's end\n5. **The 3-path forms connected boundaries** around line regions, with lines (now all 2s) remaining visible where they cross the boundary path\n6. **Lines not sharing the 3 marker's row/column** are converted (1\u21922) without additional 3 boundaries\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
