        "Full raw LLM response": "**Final Solution: ARC Task - Test Input**\n\nOkay, so I've been given this ARC task, and I need to figure out how to generate the output for this specific test input based on what I've learned from three examples. I've broken down the examples and analyzed them to understand the underlying logic. Here's how my brain is working through this:\n\n1.  **Understand the Basics**:  The goal is to transform an input grid to an output grid. The Grey (5) shapes in each example seem to act as key indicators, defining the region of interest for the output. The output's dimensions are almost always determined by a bounding box defined by the grey shapes.  I've noted the output is always related to elements found to the left of these gray zones.\n\n2.  **Uncovering the Pattern** I'm seeing a pattern in the horizontal arrangement of the shapes, they have width, they have a color, and they seem to be repeating. Specifically in example 1 there is an underlying increasing series of widths (2, 3, 4, 5, 6), with the Grey marking the next element.\n\n3.  **Color Magic**: The color of the output somehow relates to the sequence of colors in the input. In example 1 this was a repeating 1, 2, 4 scheme. \n\n4.  **Geometry Generation:** Shapes are generated according to the horizontal arrangement. They are made by the color and width, with the specific pattern being extrapolated.\n\n5.  **Examine the Test Input**: So, let's zoom in on the test input. There are two grey boxes, and it seems the output needs to cover these. I noted an almost hierarchical tree-like structure, with branching lines.\n    *   The Tree: It seems the shapes on the test input grow according to the fractal pattern I observed.\n    *   Target is 16-23 (rows). Width = (22-6)+1=17 (cols).\n    *   I've tried different approaches here, by first thinking that there were two outputs (one per Grey Box), but as I have learnt previously there is just a single output grid.\n    *   I then deduced there should be vertical expansion or extrapolation.\n    *   With that, and my learning from previous examples, I have determined the shape to be a \"split\" which means bars at the left and the right.\n    *   The Green color (3), and the width 2 of bars, came according to the geometric constraints.\n    *   Now, I have to determine if these bars are solid, if they alternate, etc. By referencing Ex1 and Ex3, I determined a solid bar for this pattern. The color should be Green (3).\n\n6.  **The Answer:** From my analysis, the output grid should be 8 rows and 17 columns.  Columns 0 and 1 are green (3), and columns 15 and 16 are green (3). All other cells should be black (0).\n\n\nThe problem involves identifying a pattern in a sequence of shapes and extrapolating it to a target region defined by grey (5) markers.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Example 1:** A horizontal sequence of colored shapes with increasing widths (2, 3, 4, 5). The target is a grey box of width 6. The output is a shape of width 6 filled with the next color in the cycle (Red) and following the geometric pattern of the sequence (solid top/bottom, left-pixel only middle).\n2.  **Example 2:** A complex texture where the grey box marks a region. The output is a direct copy of the texture immediately to the left of the marker, preserving the local pattern.\n3.  **Example 3:** A horizontal sequence of 3x3 shapes with alternating colors (Orange, Red, Green...). The target grey markers define a region. The output follows the color sequence (skipping one step due to position) and copies the geometric pattern (solid rows alternating with hollow rows).\n\n**Analysis of Test Input:**\n1.  **Structure:** The input shows a hierarchical \"tree\" structure growing downwards.\n    *   Level 1 (Rows 0-1): Green trunk (Width 5).\n    *   Level 2 (Rows 3-4): Red trunk (Width 5).\n    *   Level 3 (Rows 5-6): Green split (Two branches of width 3).\n    *   Level 4 (Rows 8-9): Green trunk (Width 5).\n    *   Level 5 (Rows 10-11): Red split (Two branches of width 3).\n    *   Level 6 (Rows 12-13): Green split (Two branches of width 3).\n2.  **Sequence Logic:**\n    *   **Geometry:** The sequence of shapes is Trunk, Trunk, Split, Trunk, Split, Split. The number of \"Splits\" appears to be increasing. The next logical shape is a **Split**.\n    *   **Color:** The sequence is Green, Red, Green, Green, Red, Green. Mapping Green=G, Red=R, the pattern is G, R, G repeating (modulo 3). The next term (7th) corresponds to **Green** (3).\n    *   **Expansion:** The \"Split\" shapes move outwards. Level 3 centers are at +/- 3 from middle. Level 6 centers are at +/- 5. The grey markers at Rows 16 and 22-23 are at columns 6-7 and 21-22, which corresponds to an even wider split (Radius ~7-8).\n3.  **Target Region:**\n    *   The grey (5) markers are located at the corners of a bounding box: Row 16 (Top-Left 5s) and Row 22-23 (Bottom-Right 5s).\n    *   Top-Left coords: (16, 6).\n    *   Bottom-Right coords: (23, 22).\n    *   This defines an output grid of height 8 (16 to 23) and width 17 (6 to 22).\n4.  **Content Generation:**\n    *   We need to generate a \"Green Split\" shape within this 8x17 grid.\n    *   \"Split\" implies vertical bars at the left and right edges.\n    *   The markers themselves are width 2 (`5,5`). This indicates the width of the split branches should be 2.\n    *   **Pattern:** The previous shapes followed a pattern of \"Solid Row\" followed by \"Ends-Only Row\". For a width of 2, \"Ends-Only\" (pixels 0 and 1) is identical to \"Solid\". Thus, the bars will be solid blocks.\n    *   **Result:** Two vertical green bars of width 2 at the far left (cols 0-1) and far right (cols 15-16) of the output grid. The center is empty.\n\n**Output Generation:**\n*   Grid size: 8x17.\n*   Color: 3 (Green).\n*   Pattern: Columns 0, 1, 15, 16 are filled with 3. All other cells are 0.\n\n3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3\n3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3\n3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3\n3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3\n3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3\n3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3\n3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3\n3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3\n\noutput:\n3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3\n3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3\n3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3\n3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3\n3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3\n3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3\n3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3\n3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3",

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**The core idea here is that the Grey Box acts like a \"viewport\" into a repeating or evolving structure, and the output is a piece of that structure fitted to the viewport.**  I'm presented with an ARC problem and I'm tasked with figuring out what rules connect the input and output. I'm focusing on three examples, each containing a grid, and I'm looking for consistent relationships that can generalize to the test input.\n\nFirst, I closely examine the first example. I start by parsing the input, seeing shapes made by colored pixels, the main colors being Blue, Red, Yellow and Grey. I carefully look for recognizable geometric shapes within the grid, and I note the coordinates and dimensions of these shapes by looking at the value of each cell. In Example 1, I find a kind of upside-down 'T', a red rectangular frame or 'C', and a yellow shape that is a '4', and notice the specific location of the Grey values.  I see that the output is a small grid of a repeating color (Red in the first example). I try to connect the patterns in the input to the output.\n\nI observe that the Grey pixels seem to define a region within the input. I look at their bounding box, noting its dimensions and the size of the output. I hypothesize that the Grey pixels act as a \"mask\" or a \"window\" or a \"code\". The key insight is that the dimensions of the output are always the same as the dimensions of the Grey bounding box. I then shift to Example 2 and verify that the grey bounding box defines the grid size in that example also.\n\nNow, with this understanding of the Grey Box's role, I shift to the content of the output. I start to wonder if the color and pattern in the output is linked to other shapes in the input. In Example 1, the red shape is not the same as the output color, and the patterns of the Grey pixels (5s) don't obviously map onto the output pattern. I need to figure out where the output pattern is coming from.\n\nI look closely at Example 2. There are repeating column-like structures to the left, and I notice that the output almost seems like a cutout from the input, but the placement is what\u2019s perplexing. This leads me to examine the repeating patterns. I have a hunch that the Grey Box is selecting *some* part of the repeating pattern and that those values are transferred to the output.\n\nNext, I return to Example 3 and see if the hypothesis holds.  I find the Grey pixels determine the output grid, which turns out to be a portion of the \"7\" colored structure. This is where I start to see a general pattern: **The Grey Box defines the output size, and the Grey Box points to a structure in the input.**  In this example, the position of the Grey Box, and the color \u201c7\u201d are from an earlier object.  I now have a clearer idea that the \"source\" or object for the output comes from somewhere relative to the Grey Box, and is also controlled by a sequence. The task seems to involve a repeating cycle of objects and colors, and the Grey box \"selects\" the next color.\n\nNow, I revisit the initial example with this framework in mind. I see now that the Grey Box defines an object (Obj 5), which is related to the sequence of objects, and is colored by the cycle of colors, and the next object, which is \"Red\" is used.  The sequence is: Object (sequence), Color and shape. This is where I understand that objects evolve with growing sizes and changing patterns. The Grey box indicates where to create the *next* object of a certain series and it should be cropped in that particular size. This explains the output that is a \"C\" made from 2's, even though no red objects have that shape initially.\n\nMoving on, I create a generalized set of rules: I need to identify objects in a repeating sequence, figure out the rules of their evolution (size, and color). Then, I create the next object, and *then* crop it to the size of the Grey box.\n\nArmed with this, I turn to the final test input. I see the input structure is different. It is not as simple as the previous examples, and there are more colored blocks, that are not as organized as the earlier examples. I scan the input, trying to identify and classify the \"objects\" as they go down the column.  These objects are now organized as groups of blocks (Green, Red). The test input contains two Grey Boxes. The combined Grey Bounding Box is the size of the output grid. The objects now form vertically-aligned groups and the boxes or shapes change as we travel down the column. After that, I hypothesize the existence of a split or growing behavior, as I saw in earlier examples, where parts of shapes grow.\n\nI go\n\nTo solve this challenge, I analyzed the input patterns and the solved examples to understand the transformation logic.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Grid Analysis:** The input grids contain sequences of objects arranged in a pattern. There is also a distinct set of grey pixels (color 5) that forms a bounding box.\n2.  **The Grey Box:** In all examples, the output grid's dimensions match the bounding box defined by the grey pixels (min x to max x, min y to max y). The output content is a specific \"object\" or pattern that corresponds to that location or sequence.\n3.  **Sequence Logic:**\n    *   **Example 1:** Objects are shapes of increasing width (2, 3, 4, 5, ...). The grey box is at the position of the 5th object. The output is a generated shape (width 6) matching the sequence's growth pattern (growing 'E' shapes becoming a 'C' or box shape).\n    *   **Example 3:** Objects are vertical columns repeating in a cycle of colors/shapes (7, 2, 3, ...). The grey box is at the position of the 7th object. The output matches the 1st object (color 7), consistent with a cycle of 3.\n    *   **Example 2:** Similar to Example 3, the grey box selects a position in a sequence, and the output is the pattern corresponding to that position in the cycle.\n4.  **Test Input Analysis:**\n    *   **Groups:** The objects in the test input are arranged vertically in groups.\n        *   **Group 1 (Rows 0-6):** Green Box (5x2), Red Box (5x2), Split Object (Green/Red).\n        *   **Group 2 (Rows 8-13):** Green Box (5x2), Red Box (5x2), Split Object.\n    *   **Progression:**\n        *   The \"Split Object\" consists of two 3x2 chunks moving apart.\n        *   Group 1 distance from center: 3 (centers at 11, 17).\n        *   Group 2 distance from center: 5 (centers at 9, 19).\n        *   The progression of distance is 3, 5, so the next (Group 3) should be 7.\n        *   This implies Group 3's Split Object will have centers at $14-7=7$ and $14+7=21$.\n        *   The chunks are 3 wide, so the left chunk spans columns 6-8, and the right chunk spans 20-22. Total extent is from column 6 to 22 (Width 17).\n    *   **The Grey Box:** The grey pixels in the test input define a bounding box from **Row 15 to 22** and **Column 6 to 22**.\n        *   This height (8 rows) and width (17 columns) corresponds to the predicted **Group 3**.\n    *   **Constructing Group 3:**\n        *   **Objects:** Green Box, Red Box, Split Object (just like previous groups).\n        *   **Width:** The bounding box width is 17. The Split Object naturally spans width 17. The Green and Red boxes should also scale to fill the width of the group (Width 17).\n        *   **Vertical Spacing:** The bounding box is 8 rows high. We have 3 objects of 2 rows each. To fit 6 rows of content into 8 rows, we introduce gaps of 1 row between objects (2+1+2+1+2 = 8).\n    *   **Object Details:**\n        *   **Object 7 (Green Box):** Rows 0-1 of output. Color 3. Dimensions 17x2. Hollow rectangle.\n        *   **Gap:** Row 2. Empty.\n        *   **Object 8 (Red Box):** Rows 3-4 of output. Color 2. Dimensions 17x2. Hollow rectangle.\n        *   **Gap:** Row 5. Empty.\n        *   **Object 9 (Split Object):** Rows 6-7 of output. Two 3x2 chunks at the far ends.\n            *   Top row (Row 6): `3,3,3` ... `3,3,3`\n            *   Bottom row (Row 7): `3,0,2` ... `2,0,3` (Pattern taken from previous split objects).\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\n*   Dimensions: 17 width, 8 height.\n*   Row 0: 17 '3's.\n*   Row 1: '3', 15 '0's, '3'.\n*   Row 2: 17 '0's.\n*   Row 3: 17 '2's.\n*   Row 4: '2', 15 '0's, '2'.\n*   Row 5: 17 '0's.\n*   Row 6: '3,3,3', 11 '0's, '3,3,3'.\n*   Row 7: '3,0,2', 11 '0's, '2,0,3'.\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3\n3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this puzzle, I need to understand the transformation from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1. **Example 1**: Two 5-shaped markers define a 3\u00d76 output region. The output shows the \"2\" pattern (3\u00d73 base unit) extended horizontally.\n\n2. **Example 2**: Two 5-markers define a 14\u00d72 output region. The output extracts/extends a 2-column pattern.\n\n3. **Example 3**: Two 5-markers define a 17\u00d73 output region. The output shows the \"7\" pattern repeated vertically.\n\n**Key Pattern**: The two 5-shaped markers (L-shapes) define the output dimensions. The main pattern in the input is then extracted/extended to fill those dimensions.\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\nFinding the 5 markers:\n- First L-shape: rows 15-16, cols 6-7\n- Second L-shape: rows 21-22, cols 21-22\n\nThis defines an **8 rows \u00d7 17 columns** output region.\n\nThe main pattern shows nested rectangles using colors 2 and 3:\n- Each level is a 2-row block with pattern: `X X X ... X X X` on top, `X 0 0 ... 0 0 X` on bottom\n- Colors alternate: innermost uses 3, then 2, then 3, then 2 (from inside out)\n\nFor 8 rows (4 nested levels) and 17 columns:\n- **Innermost (rows 6-7)**: 5 columns wide, color 3\n- **Level 2 (rows 4-5)**: 9 columns wide, color 2  \n- **Level 3 (rows 2-3)**: 13 columns wide, color 3\n- **Outermost (rows 0-1)**: 17 columns wide, color 2\n\nEach level follows the frame pattern with 3-wide borders on each side.\n\n**Constructing the output:**\n\n```\n2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2\n2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,2\n0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0\n0,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,0\n0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

Note that ARC puzzles are under\u2011specified and multiple different abstractions can often explain the same few examples; the one I describe here is one such coherent abstraction.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Common structure in the training examples\n\nAcross all three solved examples we have:\n\n- A large mostly\u2010zero grid.\n- Three \u201cmain\u201d colors making up distinctive shapes (in Example 1: 1,2,4; Example 2: 4,8,9; Example 3: 7,2,3).\n- Color `5` occurs only in a small area (or two small areas). It does *not* appear in the outputs.\n- The output grid is much smaller and always has height equal to the vertical span (bounding box height) of all the `5` cells.\n\nConcretely:\n\n- **Example 1**\n  - 5\u2019s bounding box: rows 26\u201328, columns 19\u201324 \u2192 size **3\u00d76**.\n  - Output size: **3\u00d76**.\n  - Output is a \u201cU\u201d or \u0393\u2011shaped frame in color `2`:\n    - Full top and bottom rows in color `2`;\n    - Leftmost column in color `2`;\n    - Interior zeros.\n\n- **Example 2**\n  - 5\u2019s bounding box: rows 15\u201328, columns 19\u201320 \u2192 size **14\u00d72**.\n  - Output size: **14\u00d72**.\n  - Output is a 2\u2011column pattern copied from the main pattern immediately to the left of the 5\u2011region (columns 16\u201317), without any use of color `5`, only the three main colors and background.\n\n- **Example 3**\n  - 5\u2019s bounding box: rows 1\u201317 (top cluster) to 16\u201317 (bottom cluster) \u2192 height **17**.\n  - The columns of 5\u2019s span only a few columns, but the *vertical* span is 17 rows.\n  - Output size: **17\u00d73** (height matches 5\u2019s vertical span).\n  - The output is a vertical repetition of a simple \u201cring\u201d glyph in color `7`: rows alternate between:\n    - `[7,7,7]` (full row of 7s),\n    - `[7,0,7]` (7s on the sides, 0 in the middle).\n  - This can be seen as a canonical frame\u2011like shape, applied over a rectangle whose height is set by the 5\u2011region.\n\nSummarizing the structural pattern:\n\n1. **The output\u2019s height is the height of the bounding box of color 5**.\n2. **The output\u2019s width is the width of that same bounding box, or a small fixed width reflecting a canonical shape.**\n3. **The output is a simple frame\u2011like canonical glyph, drawn using one of the main non\u20115 colors.**\n   - In Example 1, that glyph is a \u0393/U shape (left column + top and bottom rows).\n   - In Example 3, it is a full rectangular border in color `7`, but expressed as alternating full and hollow rows.\n   - In all cases, color `5` itself is *not* used in the output.\n\nThe choice of the drawing color:\n\n- In Example 1, the chosen color is `2`, which is the color that clearly forms strong horizontal \u201cbars\u201d near the 5\u2011region.\n- In Example 3, the chosen color is `7`, which is the dominant \u201cbar\u201d color in the repeated 3\u00d73 ring motifs.\n- In Example 2, the output directly copies the colors from the main pattern; there is no frame, but again color `5` is not used.\n\nSo a coherent abstraction is:\n\n> Use the **5\u2011bounding box** as the *size* of the output, and fill that rectangle with a **canonical simple frame** made from the main \u201cbar\u201d color (never 5). In the ambiguous Example 2, the rectangle is so narrow that the \u201cframe\u201d degenerates to just copying the nearby two\u2011column strip.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Applying this to the test input\n\n#### 2.1. Find the 5\u2011bounding box\n\nLocate all cells with value `5` in the test grid.\n\nThey appear at:\n\n- Top cluster: rows 15\u201316, columns 6\u20137.\n- Bottom cluster: rows 21\u201322, columns 21\u201322.\n\nThus the bounding box over all `5`s is:\n\n- **Row range**: 15 to 22 \u2192 height = 22 \u2212 15 + 1 = **8**.\n- **Column range**: 6 to 22 \u2192 width = 22 \u2212 6 + 1 = **17**.\n\nSo the output grid must be **8 rows by 17 columns**.\n\n#### 2.2. Choose the drawing color\n\nThe non\u20115 colors in the test are `2` and `3`.\n\nExamining the main pattern in the upper half:\n\n- Color `3` forms the prominent horizontal bars:\n  - Rows 0\u20131: a 5\u2011wide bar of 3s,\n  - Rows 5, 8, 12: 3\u00d73 and 5\u2011wide groups of 3s,\n- Color `2` is more involved in vertical and mixed interactions.\n\nIn the training set, when a single color must be chosen for a frame, it tends to be the one that most clearly forms **horizontal \u201cbars\u201d** (Example 1: `2`; Example 3: `7`). Here, that role is played by **3**.\n\nSo, for the test, we take **color 3** as the frame color.\n\n#### 2.3. Construct the canonical frame for an 8\u00d717 box\n\nFollowing the simplest and most consistent frame behavior:\n\n- First row: all 3\u2019s.\n- Last row: all 3\u2019s.\n- Leftmost column: all 3\u2019s.\n- Other cells: 0.\n\n(That is, a \u0393/U\u2011shaped frame similar to Example 1, generalized to the 8\u00d717 size.)\n\nSo for an 8\u00d717 grid:\n\n- Row 0: 17 copies of 3.\n- Rows 1\u20136: a 3 in column 0, zeros in columns 1\u201316.\n- Row 7: 17 copies of 3.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Final output grid\n\nPutting that together, the output is:\n\nRow 0 (top border):\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n\nRow 1:\n\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 2:\n\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 3:\n\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 4:\n\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 5:\n\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 6:\n\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 7 (bottom border):\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n\nSo the completed output grid is:\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3",

with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "I'll first explain the pattern I inferred from the training examples, then apply it to the test input.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the training examples show\n\n### 1.1. Role of color `5`: it defines the output size\n\nIn all three training examples, color `5` appears in two small clusters separated vertically. If you take the **bounding box of all cells with color `5`**, its dimensions (height and width) **exactly match the dimensions of the output grid**:\n\n- **Example 1**\n  - 5\u2019s occur from rows 26\u201328 and columns 19\u201324.\n  - Bounding box = 3 rows \u00d7 6 columns.\n  - Output = 3 rows \u00d7 6 columns.\n\n- **Example 2**\n  - 5\u2019s occur from rows 14\u201327 and columns 19\u201320.\n  - Bounding box = 14 rows \u00d7 2 columns.\n  - Output = 14 rows \u00d7 2 columns.\n\n- **Example 3**\n  - 5\u2019s occur from rows 1\u20132 and 16\u201317, columns 25\u201327 (in 0-based indexing), so overall from rows 1\u201317, columns 25\u201327.\n  - Bounding box = 17 rows \u00d7 3 columns.\n  - Output = 17 rows \u00d7 3 columns.\n\nSo: **the 5\u2019s determine the output grid size** (height = vertical span of all 5\u2019s, width = horizontal span of all 5\u2019s).\n\n### 1.2. Using a rectangle to the left of the 5\u2019s (\u201canchor patch\u201d)\n\nFor each training example, if you look at the **top row of the 5-bounding-box**, and scan **leftwards** from the left edge of the 5s, the first non-zero, non-5 pixel you hit gives you a reference column. From this, you can define an \u201canchor\u201d rectangle, same size as the 5-bounding-box, placed to the left. That anchor rectangle is what is essentially copied (often with simple recoloring and/or small extrapolation) into the output.\n\nLet\u2019s formalize that:\n\n- Let the 5-bounding-box have:\n  - top row `R_top`\n  - bottom row `R_bot`\n  - left column `C_left`\n  - right column `C_right`\n  - height `H = R_bot - R_top + 1`\n  - width `W = C_right - C_left + 1`\n\n- On row `R_top`, scan columns `C_left-1, C_left-2, \u2026` leftwards until you find the first cell that is:\n  - non-zero, and\n  - not color 5.\n  Call its column index `j_top`.\n\n- Define the **anchor rectangle** `A` as:\n  - rows `R_top .. R_bot` (same height as the 5 box),\n  - columns `j_top - (W-1) .. j_top` (so it has width `W`, and its **right edge** lines up with that first non-zero to the left).\n\nEmpirically:\n\n- **Example 2**\n  - 5-bbox: rows 14\u201327, cols 19\u201320 \u2192 H = 14, W = 2.\n  - On row 14, scanning left from col 18:\n    - first non-zero \u22605 is at col 17.\n    - So `j_top = 17`.\n  - Anchor columns = `17 - (2-1) .. 17` \u2192 cols 16\u201317.\n  - The 14\u00d72 patch at rows 14\u201327, columns 16\u201317 has exactly the color pairs that appear in the output, except for a few trailing zeros at the bottom where the pattern dies out in the input; the output \u201cfills\u201d those trailing zeros with the dominant color (9) in the appropriate positions.\n\n- **Example 3**\n  - 5-bbox: rows 1\u201317, cols 25\u201327 \u2192 H = 17, W = 3.\n  - On row 1, scanning left from col 24:\n    - first non-zero \u22605 is at col 19 (color 2).\n    - So `j_top = 19`.\n  - Anchor columns = `19 - (3-1) .. 19` \u2192 cols 17\u201319.\n  - The 17\u00d73 patch at rows 1\u201317, columns 17\u201319 consists of a vertical pattern using color 2:\n    - rows alternate `[2,2,2]` and `[2,0,2]` for a while,\n    - then become all zeros in the lower rows where the pattern ends.\n  - The output is exactly this anchor pattern, but recoloring `2`\u2192`7`, and **extending** the `[full row of color][center zero row]` alternation down into the rows where the anchor patch had become entirely zero.\n\n- **Example 1**\n  - 5-bbox: rows 26\u201328, cols 19\u201324 \u2192 H = 3, W = 6.\n  - On row 26, scanning left from col 18:\n    - first non-zero \u22605 is at col 17 (color 1).\n    - So `j_top = 17`.\n  - Anchor columns = `17 - (6-1) .. 17` \u2192 cols 12\u201317.\n  - The 3\u00d76 patch at rows 26\u201328, columns 12\u201317 is mostly color 1 with some zeros.\n  - The output is essentially this anchor patch with 1\u21922, plus a simple \u201ccompletion\u201d so that top and bottom rows are entirely filled with the chosen color along their width, and the leftmost column is full, giving the \u0393-like shape of 2\u2019s.\n\nSo the consistent, interpretable core behavior is:\n\n> **Step 1**: Find bounding box of all 5\u2019s \u2192 defines output size H\u00d7W.  \n> **Step 2**: From the top row of that box, find the first non-zero, non-5 to the left; use it to define an H\u00d7W \u201canchor\u201d patch to the left.  \n> **Step 3**: Use that anchor patch, with simple recoloring and possibly extending its local vertical pattern into trailing zero rows, to fill the output.\n\nThe exact recoloring / extension details differ slightly per example, but structurally the output always comes from an anchor patch of size equal to the 5-bounding-box, placed directly to the left and vertically aligned with it.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying that to the test input\n\n### 2.1. Find the bounding box of all 5\u2019s\n\nIn the test input, the 5\u2019s are at:\n\n- Top cluster:\n  - Row 15: cols 6, 7\n  - Row 16: col 6\n- Bottom cluster:\n  - Row 22: col 22\n  - Row 23: cols 21, 22\n\n(Here rows and columns are 0-based.)\n\nThus:\n\n- `R_top = 15`\n- `R_bot = 23`\n- `C_left = 6`\n- `C_right = 22`\n\nSo:\n\n- Height `H = 23 - 15 + 1 = 9`\n- Width `W = 22 - 6 + 1 = 17`\n\nTherefore, the **output must be a 9\u00d717 grid**.\n\n### 2.2. Determine the anchor patch\n\nWe now look at the **top row of the 5-bbox**, which is row 15, and scan left from `C_left - 1 = 5`:\n\nRow 15 is:\n`0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\nAll entries from col 5 down to col 0 are zero. There is **no non-zero, non-5** to the left of the 5\u2019s on that row.\n\nIn other words:\n\n- For the top row of the 5-bounding-box, **no anchor column `j_top` exists** (there is nothing but 0\u2019s before the 5\u2019s in that row).\n\nIn the training examples, `j_top` always existed, because there was some non-zero pattern of the main colors on that row to the left. Here, for this test, that is not the case: the decorative pattern of 2\u2019s and 3\u2019s lies entirely **above** the rows where the 5\u2019s live; rows 15\u201323 themselves contain only 5\u2019s and 0\u2019s.\n\nIf we strictly follow the \u201canchor to the left of the 5s, on the same rows\u201d rule, we have **no non-zero patch to copy**: the entire hypothetical anchor rectangle is just zeros.\n\nGiven that:\n\n- Taking the H\u00d7W anchor patch to the left (aligned with rows 15\u201323) yields only zeros,\n- There is no evidence in the training that the procedure ever \u201cjumps upward\u201d to grab a pattern from other rows when the immediate row under consideration lacks non-5 colors,\n\nthe consistent extrapolation is:\n\n> The anchor patch is a 9\u00d717 block of zeros, so the output is a 9\u00d717 grid of zeros.\n\nNo recoloring or pattern extension occurs because there is no initial non-zero structure in the anchor to extend.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Final output grid\n\nHence the output is a 9-row by 17-column grid, all zeros:\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",
