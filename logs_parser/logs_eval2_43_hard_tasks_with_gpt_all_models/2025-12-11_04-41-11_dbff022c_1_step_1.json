        "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, let's break down this ARC problem. The user wants me to identify a pattern in several examples, then apply that rule to a test input.**\n\nI start by thoroughly examining the first example. It's a 12x12 grid with shapes, and a \"noise\" block on the right. My initial thought is that the colors in the \"noise\" are somehow key, but it's not immediately obvious how they relate to the hollow shapes.\n\nI notice a yellow frame is filled with magenta, a green shape is filled with green, and an orange shape remains unchanged. This leads me to think the noise block acts as a palette or key, where the enclosed 0s of a shape will get filled with the color from the noise block, corresponding to the original shape color. \n\nExample 2 reinforces the hypothesis. A teal frame gets filled, a yellow shape gets filled with grey, and a grey shape goes unchanged. Analyzing the noise block reveals that the colours are paired in rows - `Border -> Fill`. This leads to the rule: \"Find a corresponding color in the small rectangular noise block: Top pixel to bottom\" (In example 2, it's oriented with Left -> Right, though, but it's consistent within each pair).\n\nExample 3 solidifies this. A yellow rectangle remains unchanged, but a red shape is filled with a colour from the \"Key\".\n\nThis leads me to the rule:\n1.  **Identify the \"Key\" block:** It's a small rectangle of non-zero colors, distinct from the shapes. Each column maps a \"TopPixel\" to a \"BottomPixel\".\n2.  **Identify \"Hollow Shapes\":** These are closed loops enclosing 0s.\n3.  **For each hollow shape, find the border colour and look it up in the Top Row of the Key.**\n4.  **If a match is found, fill the empty interior with the color underneath in the Key Block.**\n5.  **If there is no match, the interior is not changed.**\n\nI apply this to a test input. I Identify a blue, a green, two red and a grey shape in a 13x13 grid, and I find a Key block. Upon mapping the Key block, only the grey shape (border 5) fills, becoming maroon (9).\n\nI carefully check that the 0s inside the grey shape are correctly filled with 9, in the correct locations (indices 8-11 in row 6 and 8-11 in row 7).\n\nAs expected, all other shapes are unchanged, consistent with observations and examples. So I am confident.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to identify a transformation rule from the solved examples and apply it to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Grid Components**: The grids contain \"hollow shapes\" (closed loops of a single color enclosing empty space/0s) and a \"key block\" (a small, solid rectangular block of colors).\n2.  **The Key**: In all examples, the key block consists of two rows (or two columns in Example 2) that define a color mapping.\n    *   Example 1: Top-right block. Top row `{3,4,6,9,5}` maps to Bottom row `{3,6,7,2,9}`. This defines a mapping `Border Color -> Fill Color`.\n    *   Example 2: Top-left block. Vertical pairs define the mapping `Left Color -> Right Color`.\n    *   Example 3: Top-left block. Top row maps to Bottom row.\n3.  **The Transformation**:\n    *   Identify the border color ($C_{border}$) of each hollow shape.\n    *   Look for $C_{border}$ in the \"Source\" row/column of the key (Top row for Ex 1 & 3, Left column for Ex 2).\n    *   If found, identify the corresponding \"Target\" color ($C_{fill}$) from the \"Target\" row/column of the key (Bottom row for Ex 1 & 3, Right column for Ex 2).\n    *   Fill the interior 0s of that shape with $C_{fill}$.\n    *   If the border color is not in the Source part of the key, the shape's interior remains unchanged (0).\n    *   Crucially, even if the border color appears in the *Target* part of the key (as seen with the orange shape in Ex 1 and the grey shape in Ex 2), it does not trigger a fill unless it also appears in the Source part.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Identify Key**: Located at the bottom-left (Rows 11-12, Cols 0-4).\n    *   Row 11 (Source): `5, 4, 6, 7, 8`\n    *   Row 12 (Target): `9, 8, 3, 1, 2`\n    *   Mapping pairs: $5 \\to 9$, $4 \\to 8$, $6 \\to 3$, $7 \\to 1$, $8 \\to 2$.\n\n2.  **Identify Shapes and Apply Mapping**:\n    *   **Blue Shape (Color 1)**: Located at Top-Left. Border color is 1. Check Source row: 1 is not in `{5, 4, 6, 7, 8}`. (It is in the Target row, but that doesn't count). -> **Unchanged**.\n    *   **Green Shape (Color 3)**: Located at Top-Right. Border color is 3. Check Source row: 3 is not present. -> **Unchanged**.\n    *   **Red Shapes (Color 2)**: Located at Middle-Left and Bottom-Right. Border color is 2. Check Source row: 2 is not present. -> **Unchanged**.\n    *   **Grey Shape (Color 5)**: Located at Middle-Right (spanning rows 5-9). Border color is 5. Check Source row: 5 is present at index 0. The corresponding Target color is **9**. -> **Fill with 9**.\n\n3.  **Execution**:\n    *   The Grey shape encloses empty space (0s) at:\n        *   Row 6: Columns 8, 9, 10.\n        *   Row 7: Columns 8, 9, 10, 11.\n    *   We change these specific 0s to 9s. All other cells remain identical to the input.\n\n**Output Generation:**\n- Rows 0-5: Unchanged.\n- Row 6: Change `0,0,0` at indices 8-10 inside the 5-border to `9,9,9`.\n- Row 7: Change `0,0,0,0` at indices 8-11 inside the 5-border to `9,9,9,9`.\n- Rows 8-12: Unchanged.\n\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,5,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,9,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's how I cracked this ARC puzzle:**\n\nThe user threw a challenging ARC task at me: transform an input grid to an output grid based on a few examples. My main goal was to figure out the underlying pattern and apply it to a new test grid.\n\nFirst, I carefully analyzed the provided examples. I noticed some consistent elements: the presence of \"hollow\" shapes (frames) and a separate \"key\" or \"noise\" block. These frames were the main focus of the transformation. They contained areas that needed to be filled with color.\n\nAfter extensive analysis, it seemed that the key block held the key to the solution (pun intended). The solution lay in establishing connections between colors in the frame and pixels in this key block. My hypothesis solidified: the color of the fill area depended on the key's color.\n\nThe rule became clearer:\n\n1.  Identify those hollow frame objects that have internal empty space.\n2.  Next, identify the key or \"noise\" block that does not form a complete object and only contains distinct color pixels.\n3.  Each frame has a specific color. Look for that color within the key block.\n4.  Once the frame color is found in the key block, look at the color directly below it (in that same column, on the next row). Use that color to fill the frame.\n\nI tested this with various examples. It passed all tests, and I felt confident. To be sure, I carefully double-checked all those steps with the new test input grid, making sure to apply the new solution consistently.\n\nFinally, I presented the output grid.",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning**\n\n1. **What is happening in the examples**\n\n   In all three training examples there are two key structures:\n\n   - A small, thin **\u201clegend\u201d block** of mixed colors with thickness 2 (either 2\u00d7N or N\u00d72), separate from the main shapes.\n   - Larger **single\u2011color shapes** that form *closed loops* (donuts / frames) around regions of 0s.\n\n   The transformation:\n\n   1. Use the legend block to build a **color mapping** from \u201cframe colors\u201d to \u201cfill colors\u201d.\n   2. For each mapped frame color, find its shapes that enclose 0\u2011regions (holes) and **fill those interior 0s** with the mapped color.\n\n   Details:\n\n   ### 1. Detecting the legend and extracting the mapping\n\n   Look at connected components of **non\u2011zero** cells (ignoring color):\n\n   - In each training grid there is exactly one multi\u2011cell component whose **bounding box has min(height, width) = 2** and both height and width > 1.  \n     That thin component is the **legend**.\n\n   Orientation rule:\n\n   - If legend height = 2 \u2192 it\u2019s a 2\u00d7N block \u2192 use it **vertically**: map from the first row to the second row, columnwise.\n   - If legend width = 2 and height > 2 \u2192 it\u2019s an N\u00d72 block \u2192 use it **horizontally**: map from the first column to the second column, rowwise.\n\n   Then for each aligned pair of legend cells `(from, to)` we create a mapping `M[from] = to`.\n\n   Applied to training examples:\n\n   - **Example 1**  \n     Legend = rows 0\u20131, cols 7\u201311 (2\u00d75), so vertical orientation.  \n     Row 0: 3,4,6,9,5  \n     Row 1: 3,6,7,2,9  \n     \u21d2 Mapping:\n       - 3 \u2192 3\n       - 4 \u2192 6\n       - 6 \u2192 7\n       - 9 \u2192 2\n       - 5 \u2192 9\n\n   - **Example 2**  \n     Legend = rows 0\u20133, cols 0\u20131 (4\u00d72), so horizontal orientation.  \n     Col 0: 2,4,6,8  \n     Col 1: 6,5,8,1  \n     \u21d2 Mapping:\n       - 2 \u2192 6\n       - 4 \u2192 5\n       - 6 \u2192 8\n       - 8 \u2192 1\n\n   - **Example 3**  \n     Legend = rows 0\u20131, cols 1\u20132 (2\u00d72), so vertical orientation.  \n     Row 0: 2,6  \n     Row 1: 7,1  \n     \u21d2 Mapping:\n       - 2 \u2192 7\n       - 6 \u2192 1\n\n   ### 2. Finding and filling holes for mapped colors\n\n   For each color `c` that appears as a key in the mapping `M`:\n\n   1. Find each **connected component** of cells of color `c` (4\u2011connected).\n   2. Inside its **bounding box**, treat `c` as walls; treat `0` cells as empty space; other colors (if any inside that box) are treated like background (here, effectively all non\u2011zero inside the frames are just the frame color).\n   3. Perform a flood fill of zeros from the **outside** of that bounding box (or from any zero on the box boundary). Zeros reachable from the outside are *not* holes.\n   4. Any remaining 0\u2011regions that are **not reachable** from outside are enclosed **holes**.\n   5. Fill all those hole cells with color `M[c]`.\n\n   This exactly matches the examples:\n\n   - **Example 1**\n     - Legend mapping includes 3 \u2192 3 and 4 \u2192 6, etc.\n     - The 4\u2011rectangle at the top\u2011left has a small interior 0\u2011region \u2192 filled with 6.\n     - The irregular 3\u2011shape at mid\u2011left has a closed cavity of 0s \u2192 filled with 3.\n     - The 7\u2011shape has no mapping in `M` \u2192 its internal 0s (if any) are left unchanged.\n\n   - **Example 2**\n     - Legend mapping includes 8 \u2192 1 and 4 \u2192 5, but not 5.\n     - 8\u2011frame (4\u00d74 rectangle) encloses a 2\u00d72 hole \u2192 filled with 1.\n     - 4\u2011frame at bottom\u2011right encloses two single\u2011cell holes \u2192 each filled with 5.\n     - 5\u2011frame in the middle **also** encloses an interior 0\u2011region, but color 5 is not mapped \u2192 it is left unfilled.\n\n   - **Example 3**\n     - Legend mapping includes 2 \u2192 7, 6 \u2192 1.\n     - Right\u2011hand 2\u2011rectangle (4\u00d74) has two interior 0 cells fully surrounded by 2s \u2192 filled with 7.\n     - Left 4\u2011rectangle has an interior 0\u2011region but color 4 is not mapped \u2192 unchanged.\n\n   So the rule is consistent across all given examples.\n\n---\n\n2. **Applying the rule to the test input**\n\n   #### 2.1. Find the legend and mapping\n\n   Test grid bottom rows:\n\n   Row 11: `5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0`  \n   Row 12: `9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0`\n\n   The connected component of non\u2011zero cells in rows 11\u201312, cols 0\u20134 is a 2\u00d75 block:\n\n   ```\n   5 4 6 7 8\n   9 8 3 1 2\n   ```\n\n   - Its bounding box has height 2, width 5 \u2192 legend, vertical orientation.\n   - Mapping from row 11 (top of legend) to row 12 (bottom):\n\n     - 5 \u2192 9\n     - 4 \u2192 8\n     - 6 \u2192 3\n     - 7 \u2192 1\n     - 8 \u2192 2\n\n   So `M = {5:9, 4:8, 6:3, 7:1, 8:2}`.\n\n   #### 2.2. Find shapes of mapped colors with holes\n\n   We only need to inspect colors in `M`\u2019s domain: `{5,4,6,7,8}`.\n\n   - Color 4: only at (11,1), a single cell \u2192 no hole.\n   - Color 6: only at (11,2), single cell \u2192 no hole.\n   - Color 7: only at (11,3), single cell \u2192 no hole.\n   - Color 8: at (11,4) and (12,1), both isolated singletons \u2192 no holes.\n   - **Color 5**: one large cluster in the middle plus the single legend 5 at (11,0).\n\n     The large 5\u2011cluster (central) has bounding box rows 5\u20139, cols 7\u201312. In that box, using `#` for 5 and `.` for 0:\n\n     ```\n     r5: . # # # . .\n     r6: # . . . # .\n     r7: # . . . . #\n     r8: . # # # # #\n     r9: . # . . . .\n     ```\n\n     Now detect 0\u2011regions:\n\n     - Boundary zeros (touching the box edge) include cells like (5,7), (5,11), (5,12), (9,7), (9,9\u201312), (8,7), (6,12).\n     - Starting flood fill from these boundary zeros, we can reach all \u201coutside\u201d 0s but **cannot reach** the interior cluster:\n\n       Interior zero cells (not connected to boundary through zeros):  \n       `(6,8), (6,9), (6,10), (7,8), (7,9), (7,10), (7,11)`\n\n     These 7 cells form a closed cavity fully enclosed by 5s. Thus they are a **hole inside the 5\u2011shape**.\n\n     The isolated 5 at (11,0) is a 1\u00d71 component \u2192 no interior.\n\n   So only one hole region must be filled: the 7 cells above, inside the central 5\u2011shape.\n\n   #### 2.3. Fill holes using the legend mapping\n\n   From the legend we have: `5 \u2192 9`.\n\n   Therefore we change all hole cells inside the 5\u2011component from 0 to 9:\n\n   - (6,8) \u2192 9\n   - (6,9) \u2192 9\n   - (6,10) \u2192 9\n   - (7,8) \u2192 9\n   - (7,9) \u2192 9\n   - (7,10) \u2192 9\n   - (7,11) \u2192 9\n\n   All other cells remain exactly as in the input.\n\n---\n\n**Final output grid**\n\nRow by row:\n\n0. `0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0`  \n1. `0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0`  \n2. `0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0`  \n3. `0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0`  \n4. `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \n5. `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0`  \n6. `0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,5,0`  \n7. `0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,9,5`  \n8. `0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5`  \n9. `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0`  \n10.`0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0`  \n11.`5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0`  \n12.`9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0`",

        "Full raw LLM response": "The grids in the examples are split into independent regions by full\u2011zero rows and columns. Within each band, if there is a small hollow rectangle (a 1\u2011pixel thick border of a single colour with an interior of area at most four), the holes are filled using a colour taken from the adjacent region across the zero separator. Existing non\u2011zero interior pixels are left as they are.\n\nIn the test grid row\u202f5 and column\u202f7 are all zero, so the top band is divided into a left and a right part. The top\u2011right part contains a 3\u2011coloured frame at rows\u202f1\u20134, columns\u202f9\u201312 with a 2\u00d72 interior of zeros. The frame colour (3) does not occur in the adjacent left region, whose only non\u2011zero colour is 1, so the interior is filled with 1s. No other small hollow frames appear, so the rest of the grid stays the same.\n\nApplying this gives:\n\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,1,1,3,0\n0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,1,1,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "In the solved cases the changes always occur in \u201chollow\u201d components: areas of a single colour that enclose a pocket of background cells not connected to the outside. Not all colours are processed; only those colours that are present in more than one connected component are. For such a colour there is a small \u201cindicator\u201d component sitting on the outer border of the grid; that indicator tells you what colour to use to fill the holes of the other, larger component(s) of the same colour. The fill colour is simply the colour of the cell immediately inward from the indicator: for indicators on the top edge look one cell below, for indicators on the left edge one cell to the right, etc. If the indicator\u2019s inward neighbour is the same colour, you end up filling holes with the original colour; otherwise you fill with that neighbour colour. All other cells remain unchanged.\n\nApplying this to the test grid, the colour\u202f1 has two components (a hollow shape at the top and a single pixel at the bottom edge). The bottom pixel serves as the indicator, its inward neighbour above is colour\u202f7, so the five enclosed zeros in the top\u2011left 1\u2011shape are filled with 7. The colour\u202f3 likewise has a hollow frame at the top and a single pixel on the bottom edge; the inward neighbour above that indicator is colour\u202f6, so the four enclosed zeros in the 3\u2011frame are filled with 6. No other components have enclosed holes, so nothing else changes.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,7,7,7,1,0,0,3,6,6,3,0\n0,1,1,7,7,1,0,0,3,6,6,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "First, I'll describe the pattern I inferred from the solved examples, then apply it to the test grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the transformation does (inferred rule)\n\nAcross the examples, the only cells that change are zeros that lie *inside a closed rectangular frame* of a single color. Those internal zeros get filled with a new, non\u2011zero color. The frame color and the fill color are usually *different*, and the fill color is determined by a small \u201clegend\u201d adjacency somewhere else in the grid:\n\n- Find a color pair `(C, D)` such that a cell of color `C` is immediately adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a cell of color `D`.\n- That adjacency acts as a legend saying: \u201cinside rectangles framed by color `C`, use fill color `D`.\u201d\n- Then, for any closed rectangular frame entirely made of color `C` (1\u2011cell thick border, interior all zeros), all interior zeros become color `D`.\n\nExamples:\n\n- **Example 1**  \n  - There is a 3\u00d75 hollow rectangle of `4`s at the top\u2011left with two internal zeros.  \n  - Elsewhere in the grid we see `4` immediately adjacent to `6` (pattern `4 6` on the first row).  \n  - So for frames of `4`, the fill color is `6`. The two internal zeros become `6`.\n\n- **Example 2**  \n  - A 4\u00d74 hollow square of `8`s at the top with a 2\u00d72 block of internal zeros.  \n    - Legend: `8` is adjacent to `1` (vertical pair `8` over `1` on the left).  \n    - Interior zeros become `1`.  \n  - A 5\u00d73 hollow rectangle of `4`s at the bottom\u2011right with two internal zeros.  \n    - Legend: `4` is adjacent horizontally to `5` (`4 5` near the top\u2011left).  \n    - Interior zeros become `5`.\n\n- **Example 3**  \n  - A 4\u00d74 hollow square of `2`s on the right with two diagonal internal zeros.  \n    - Legend: `2` is above `7` (vertical pair `2` over `7` at the top\u2011left).  \n    - Internal zeros become `7`.  \n  - A 5\u00d75 frame of `4`s in the middle also has zeros inside, but there is *no clear legend pair* that uses `4` as the \u201csource color\u201d for this rectangle (no suitable `4`\u2013something pair used as a legend for it), so those zeros are left unchanged in the examples.\n\nThere is some extra behavior in Example 1 (the `3` region being completed with `3`s), but that does not show up in the test and is not needed to determine the test output. The consistent behavior across all three examples, and the part clearly relevant to the test, is:\n\n> **Main rule used for the test:**  \n> For each color `C`, if there is a clear adjacency `(C, D)` in the grid that we can read as a legend, then for any hollow rectangular frame of color `C`, fill all interior zero cells with color `D`.\n\nWe now apply this idea to the test grid.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Analyse the test input\n\nTest input:\n\n```\nr1:  0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\nr2:  0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\nr3:  0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\nr4:  0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\nr5:  0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\nr6:  0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\nr7:  0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\nr8:  0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\nr9:  0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\nr10: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\nr11: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\nr12: 5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\nr13: 9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n```\n\n### 2.1. Find hollow rectangular frames\n\nLook for 1\u2011pixel\u2011thick rectangles of a uniform color with zeros inside:\n\n- **Top\u2011right 3\u2011frame**\n\n  Subgrid rows 1\u20134, cols 9\u201312:\n\n  ```\n  r1 c9\u201312: 3 3 3 3\n  r2 c9\u201312: 3 0 0 3\n  r3 c9\u201312: 3 0 0 3\n  r4 c9\u201312: 3 3 3 3\n  ```\n\n  This is a classic 4\u00d74 hollow square of `3`s with a 2\u00d72 interior of zeros at:\n\n  - (r2,c10), (r2,c11), (r3,c10), (r3,c11)\n\n- **Top\u2011left 1\u2011region**\n\n  Rows 1\u20134, cols 2\u20136:\n\n  ```\n  r1: 1 1 1 1 1\n  r2: 1 0 0 0 1\n  r3: 1 1 0 0 1\n  r4: 0 1 1 1 1\n  ```\n\n  This region has an internal 2\u00d72 zero block, but its boundary is *not* a clean rectangle of `1`s: the bottom\u2011left corner (r4,c2) is 0, so the 1\u2011boundary is broken. In the training data, only *proper rectangular frames* are guaranteed to have their insides recolored; \u201cbroken\u201d or irregular shapes are not consistently filled. So we **do not** treat this as a rectangular frame under the learned rule.\n\n- **The 5\u2011region around the middle\u2011right**\n\n  The `5`s in rows 6\u201310, cols 8\u201313 form a complex shape, not a simple rectangular frame. There is no well\u2011defined 1\u2011cell\u2011thick border surrounding a rectangle of zeros. No clean hollow rectangle here; we leave it.\n\n- **The 2\u2011plus shape near rows 7\u20139**\n\n  Rows 7\u20139, cols 2\u20134:\n\n  ```\n  r7: 0 2 0\n  r8: 2 0 2\n  r9: 0 2 0\n  ```\n\n  That\u2019s a plus shape of `2`s with a single central 0. It is not a rectangular frame; in the training tasks, such plus shapes were not the ones receiving the \u201cforeign\u201d fill color (and even for more complex shapes behavior was inconsistent). Under the consistent \u201crectangular frame\u201d rule, we do not process it.\n\nSo the **only** unambiguous rectangular frame of the type seen in the examples is the 3\u2011frame at the top\u2011right.\n\n### 2.2. Determine the legend mapping for color 3\n\nWe now need the fill color `D` for frames of `3`.\n\nScan the grid for an adjacency where a `3` is immediately next to another nonzero color \u2014 this serves as the legend for `3`.\n\nLook at row 13:\n\n`r13: 9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0`\n\nHere, at columns 3\u20134 we have:\n\n- (r13,c3) = 3\n- (r13,c4) = 1\n\nSo there is a horizontal adjacency `3 1`, i.e.:\n\n- **Legend pair:** `3 \u2192 1`\n\nBy analogy with the examples:\n\n- Example 1: legend `4 6` \u21d2 fill frames of `4` with `6`.\n- Example 2: legend `4 5` \u21d2 fill frames of `4` with `5`; legend vertical `8` over `1` \u21d2 fill frames of `8` with `1`.\n- Example 3: legend vertical `2` over `7` \u21d2 fill frames of `2` with `7`.\n\nIn the test, `3` is the frame color and we have an explicit `3 1` adjacency. So:\n\n> For hollow rectangles of `3`s in this test, the interior zeros are filled with `1`.\n\nThere is no need (and no solid training support) to apply similar foreign\u2011color filling to the irregular `1` or `5` or `2` shapes, since those are not clean rectangular frames.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Apply the rule to the test grid\n\nWe modify only the interior of the 3\u2011frame (rows 2\u20133, columns 10\u201311):\n\n- (r2,c10): 0 \u2192 1  \n- (r2,c11): 0 \u2192 1  \n- (r3,c10): 0 \u2192 1  \n- (r3,c11): 0 \u2192 1  \n\nAll other cells stay the same.\n\nSo the completed **output grid** is:\n\n```\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,1,1,3,0\n0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,1,1,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n```",
