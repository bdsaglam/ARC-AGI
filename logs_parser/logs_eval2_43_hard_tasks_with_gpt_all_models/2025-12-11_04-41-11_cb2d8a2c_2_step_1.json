        "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Strategy for ARC Task: Pathfinding with Obstacles**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking about this ARC task. I've got to find a way to make sense of these examples and figure out the general rule. The goal is to get a \"beam\" or path started from a single colored pixel (3, specifically) and have it \"draw\" a path on the grid, avoiding obstacles along the way.\n\n**Initial Assessment:**  The background is always a light blue (8), there are lines made of blue (1) and red (2) \u2013 these are the obstacles. Green pixels (3) are the starting points.  The tasks seems to be transforming an input grid into an output grid with a green path drawn.\n\n**Diving into the Examples:**\n\n*   **Example 1:** Here, I see the green pixel at (0,8) and a horizontal obstacle. The output has a green vertical line going down from the green start point.  It looks like the path *avoids* the obstacle, not intersect it. The path also creates red-colored segment, not an green line like I expected. Okay, so in the output it shows green segment on top. Then there's some kind of bend - the green line starts at column 1 before bending down, even though there's an obstacle. It looks like the green line is going down and turning LEFT before the obstacle, then going down the path and intersecting with the obstacle. Also, the obstacle's changing to all 2s.\n\n*   **Example 2:** A green start at (3,0). It goes right, then down, then right again. There are vertical obstacles here. The green line has to bend around the obstacle too. I see a little \"jump\" or a split in the green path in the example, and some color changes to red.  The most important part I see from the examples, the obstacles are *always* changing color to just red in the output.\n\n**Generalizing the Behavior:**\n\n*   **Goal:** Draw a path starting from a single 3-colored cell.\n*   **Initial Direction:**  Based on the start location (top or side) the beam either goes down (top start) or right (side start).\n*   **Collision Detection and Bypassing:**  This is key. If the path \"collides\" with an obstacle (a line of 1s/2s), it needs to reroute:\n    1.  The path stops just *before* the collision point.\n    2.  The path shifts, making a right-angle turn, to move around (parallel to the obstacles)\n    3.  It follows this new direction until the obstacle's \"extent\" is clear.\n    4.  Then... Here is the important part: The Path goes back on the line it was traveling on originally (or goes back on a similar position).\n\n**Key Rules Emerging:**\n\n*   **Margin (Buffer):**  The path *doesn't* hit the obstacle directly. It seems to keep a buffer of *2 cells* from the obstacle.\n*   **Bypass Lane:** When bypassing,  it seems to pick a row/col that is a consistent number of spaces away (2?) from the closest edge of the obstacle. The bypass path will attempt to stay on the same row or column as the start node. This can vary by 2. It's almost \"centering\" the bypath path on empty cell space.\n*   **Midpoint of Gaps:** The turn from going down/right/left. This seems to be at the midpoint of the available space, the empty area (2-gap, or 3-gap from the last point).\n*   **The path goes *through* the obstacle**  Obstacles become all 2s. The final solution only creates a *green* path in the solution.\n\n**Test Case Prediction:**\n\nGiven the test input, I can apply these rules step-by-step to predict the output grid.\n1. All 1s get changed to 2s.\n2. Initial Start Point: (0, 8), downwards direction.\n3. Apply Margin.\n4. Calculate midpoints.\n\nThe test's result will have the path-colored segments. I will need to generate the resulting grid row by row.\n\n\nThe problem requires analyzing the transformation of a grid where a \"beam\" or path (represented by color 3) navigates through obstacles (represented by colors 1 and 2).\n\n**Analysis of the Rules:**\n\n1.  **Obstacles:** Lines of mixed colors 1 and 2 act as obstacles. In the output, all obstacle pixels are converted to color 2 (red).\n2.  **Path Generation:** The input contains a single starting pixel of color 3 (green). This pixel initiates a path of color 3. The path extends in a primary direction (Down in Examples 1 and 3; Right in Examples 2 and 4).\n3.  **Path Logic:**\n    *   The path travels in the primary direction until it detects an obstacle ahead.\n    *   To avoid the obstacle, the path turns perpendicular to the primary direction *before* reaching the obstacle row/col.\n    *   The **Turn Coordinate** (row or column where the turn happens) appears to be the **midpoint** of the gap between the previous \"event\" (start of grid or previous obstacle) and the current obstacle.\n    *   The **Target Lane** (the column/row chosen to bypass the obstacle) is determined by finding the nearest edge of the obstacle and adding a margin of 2 units.\n        *   If `Limit - 2` is valid and closer, it goes there.\n        *   If `Limit + 2` is valid and closer, it goes there.\n        *   If one side is blocked (e.g., by grid boundary), it chooses the valid side.\n    *   The path travels in the bypass lane until it clears the obstacle, then calculates the next move based on the *next* obstacle ahead.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Grid Size:** 29 rows x 16 columns.\n*   **Start:** (0, 8) with primary direction **Down**.\n*   **Obstacles:**\n    1.  Row 3: Cols 4-15.\n    2.  Row 9: Cols 0-6.\n    3.  Row 17: Cols 6-15.\n    4.  Row 27: Cols 0-8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Path Calculation:**\n\n1.  **Segment 1 (Start to Obs 1):**\n    *   Start at (0, 8). Obs 1 is at Row 3.\n    *   Gap: Rows 0 to 3. Midpoint $\\approx$ Row 1.\n    *   Turn at **Row 1**.\n    *   Direction: At Col 8. Obs 1 covers [4, 15]. Distance to 4 is 4. Distance to 15 is 7. Go Left.\n    *   Target Col: $4 - 2 = 2$.\n    *   **Path:** Vertical (0,8)-(1,8), Horizontal (1,8)-(1,2).\n\n2.  **Segment 2 (Obs 1 to Obs 2):**\n    *   Travel Down at Col 2.\n    *   Obs 1 (Row 3) is passed. Next is Obs 2 (Row 9).\n    *   Gap: Rows 3 to 9. Midpoint: $(3+9)/2 = 6$.\n    *   Turn at **Row 6**.\n    *   Direction: At Col 2. Obs 2 covers [0, 6]. Left ($0-2=-2$) is invalid.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Detailed Approach to Solving the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I'm given examples and a test input. It's about drawing paths based on walls.  Here's my thought process:\n\n**1.  Initial Analysis and Pattern Recognition:**\n\n*   **Inputs are Grids:** The input data is basically grids filled with teal (8s), with lines or shapes of other colors.\n*   **Key Elements:** There's a background (teal), seed points (single green pixels - value 3), and \"wall\" structures composed of blue (1) and red (2). These walls look like boundaries.\n*   **Wall Characteristics:**  They appear to be horizontal or vertical lines.  Example 1 has a vertical line at the bottom.\n*   **Analyzing Examples is Crucial:** Looking closely at the example inputs and outputs, I notice:\n    *   The \"seed\" pixel gets expanded to form a green (3) path.\n    *   The walls turn solid red (2).\n    *   The green path connects the seed to the walls, or *avoids* them.\n\n**2.  Forming a Hypothesis:**\n\n*   **Pathfinding/Flow Problem:** This looks like a pathfinding or \"water flow\" type problem. The seed is the source, the walls are obstacles, and the goal is to find a path to the walls.\n*   **Key Actions:**\n    1.  Convert the walls (lines of 1s and 2s) to solid red (2).\n    2.  Expand the source (green 3) to reach the walls, based on some rules.\n    3.  The flow seems to avoid the walls.\n*   **Specific Rules to Check:**\n    *   Is it based on gravity or Manhattan distance?\n    *   Does it minimize turns?\n    *   Does it bounce off the walls?\n\n**3.  Deep Dive into Examples and Refinement of the Algorithm:**\n\n*   **Re-examining Ex 1:** Input has seed at (0, 8), and a horizontal wall at row 7. Output shows the path goes down, *then* turns left to avoid the wall. The path goes to Col 1 and down.\n*   **Ex 2 Analysis:** The input seed is at (3,0). There are two vertical walls (Col 6 and Col 16). The output path goes around the first wall and then *connects* with the second wall. In other words, the path \"maintains direction\" unless a detour is required to avoid an obstacle. It looks like it wants to reach the final edge.\n*   **Ex 3:** This one has several walls.  Path makes turns *before* hitting the walls.\n    *   Turn is at a fixed row before.\n*   **Ex 4:** Path is from the left edge (rightwards). One vertical wall blocks the path. The path goes to avoid the wall.\n*   **Synthesizing the Logic:**\n    *   **Seed and Direction:** Determine seed location (value 3) and direction (Right/Down based on the edge). Create a projected \"ray\" path.\n    *   **Obstacle Conversion:** Convert lines of 1s to solid red 2s.\n    *   **Pathfinding with Obstacle Avoidance:**\n        *   Project the beam and stop before the wall is hit. Calculate a margin.\n        *   The margin should be about 2 or 3 pixels and it is not random. It is based on gap and distance.\n    *   **Detour Logic:**\n        *   Create a \"Gap\" to slide perpendicular to the current trajectory towards the \"Open Space.\"\n        *   Direction of Detour depends. If the target is above then below, otherwise use below.\n        *   In this case, stay at the previous level.\n    *   **Detour Distance:** Move sideways to clear the obstacle. This can have a margin too, and go 2 or 3 past the obstacle.\n    *   **Detour stop point**: Turn to \"new target\".\n    *   If not, find \"Midpoint\" or \"Closest Point\" logic to maximize the straight path.\n*   **Examine Ex 2 and 4:**  It's \"Stay on the detour path until you hit the next obstacle, then get to where you must go.\"\n*   **If There's a block on a detour, a return to \"midpoint\" may make sense**\n\n**4.  Applying the Algorithm to the Test Input:**\n\n*   **Input Parsing:** I need to analyze the test input text, recognize the grid size (29x16), seed, and map out the wall positions.\n*   \n\nThe goal of this task is to simulate a \"fluid\" or \"ray\" of green (color 3) pixels originating from a seed point, flowing through a field of teal (8) empty space, and navigating around obstacles made of blue (1) and red (2) pixels. The obstacles themselves turn into solid red (2) walls in the output.\n\n**Rules inferred from examples:**\n1.  **Obstacle Transformation**: All pixels with value 1 are converted to 2. Contiguous horizontal or vertical lines of 1s and 2s form \"walls\".\n2.  **Source & Direction**: The seed (3) is a single pixel on the edge of the grid. Its position implies an initial direction of flow (e.g., a seed on the top row flows Down).\n3.  **Flow Logic**:\n    *   The green path extends in its current direction until it encounters an obstacle (a wall of 2s).\n    *   It stops at a **margin** of 2 pixels before the obstacle (based on consistent spacing in examples).\n    *   **Turning**: The path turns 90 degrees to bypass the obstacle. It chooses the direction with the closer or only available \"gap\" (open space).\n    *   **Detour Target**: The path travels sideways until it clears the obstacle's edge, plus a margin of 2 pixels.\n    *   **Resuming**: Once clear, the path turns back to the primary direction (Down in this case). If possible, it aligns with the original path (column) or simply continues from the new column if returning isn't viable or efficient before the next obstacle.\n4.  **Path Continuity**: The path is drawn as a continuous line of 3s connecting the start to the end of the grid.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Grid Size**: 29 rows (0-28) x 16 columns (0-15).\n*   **Seed**: `(0, 8)` is 3. Direction is **Down** along Column 8.\n*   **Obstacles**:\n    1.  **Row 3**: Wall spans Cols 4-15.\n    2.  **Row 9**: Wall spans Cols 0-6.\n    3.  **Row 17**: Wall spans Cols 6-15.\n    4.  **Row 27**: Wall spans Cols 0-8.\n\n**Path Tracing:**\n1.  **Start at `(0, 8)`**: Flow Down.\n    *   Hit Wall 1 (Row 3) at Col 8.\n    *   Stop at **Row 1** (Margin 2). Path: `(0,8)` to `(1,8)`.\n    *   Turn: Wall covers Right side (up to edge). Gap is Left.\n    *   Detour Left to **Col 2** (Wall Start 4 - Margin 2). Path: `(1,8)` to `(1,2)`.\n2.  **From `(1, 2)`**: Flow Down.\n    *   Hit Wall 2 (Row 9) at Col 2.\n    *   Stop at **Row 7** (Margin 2). Path: `(1,2)` to `(7,2)`.\n    *   Turn: Wall covers Left side. Gap is Right.\n    *   Detour Right to **Col 8** (Wall End 6 + Margin 2). This returns us to the original column. Path: `(7,2)` to `(7,8)`.\n3.  **From `(7, 8)`**: Flow Down.\n    *   Hit Wall 3 (Row 17) at Col 8.\n    *   Stop at **Row 15** (Margin 2). Path: `(7,8)` to `(15,8)`.\n    *   Turn: Wall covers Right side. Gap is Left.\n    *   Detour Left to **Col 4** (Wall Start 6 - Margin 2). Path: `(15,8)` to `(15,4)`.\n4.  **From `(15, 4)`**: Flow Down.\n    *   Hit Wall 4 (Row 27) at Col 4.\n    *   Stop at **Row 25** (Margin 2).

There are horizontal/vertical line patterns containing \"1\"s and \"2\"s\n3. The transformation:\n   - Replaces all \"1\"s in the patterns with \"2\"s\n   - Creates a path of \"3\"s that zigzags between patterns\n   - The path alternates direction based on where the \"1\"s are located relative to the \"3\" marker\n   - Turn points occur at midpoints between consecutive patterns\n\nFor the test input:\n- \"3\" marker at (0, 8)\n- Pattern 1 at row 3: 1 at column 15 (right of marker)\n- Pattern 2 at row 9: 1s at columns 0, 2 (left of marker)  \n- Pattern 3 at row 17: 1s at columns 11, 13, 15 (right of marker)\n- Pattern 4 at row 27: 1s at columns 0, 2, 4, 6 (left of marker)\n\nThe path turns at rows 1, 6, 13, and 22 (midpoints), alternating between left extent (column 1) and right extent (column 15).\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "First I\u2019ll describe the transformation I inferred and the concrete procedure I used on the test input. Then I\u2019ll give the final output grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Common pattern from the training examples\n\nFrom Examples 1\u20134 I extracted two clear and consistent behaviors:\n\n1. **All `1`-pixels that are part of the 1/2 structures are turned into `2`.**  \n   - Example 1: the alternating `1,2,1,2,...` row becomes all `2`s.\n   - Example 2: all `1`s in the vertical columns are turned into `2`s.\n   - Example 3: all `1`s in the horizontal stripes become `2`s.\n   - Example 4: all vertical `1`s become `2`s.\n\n2. **New `3`-pixels are drawn on originally-`8` cells, forming a rectilinear path (\u201csnake\u201d) from the existing `3` anchor to weave around the rows/columns that contain 2\u2011structures, without overwriting the 2\u2011structures.**\n   - This path:\n     - Starts from the original `3` in the input.\n     - Makes only horizontal and vertical moves.\n     - Runs between \u201cbands\u201d of rows (or columns) that contain the 2\u2011structures.\n     - Never overwrites any non\u20118 input pixel (no 3 placed where 1 or 2 originally were).\n\nThe *exact* shape of the snake differs between examples, but these constraints are consistent. I reconstructed a deterministic way to generate such a path on the test grid that obeys the same constraints.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Detailed procedure used on the test input\n\n### 2.1. Step 1: Convert all `1` to `2`\n\nStarting from the test input, I first replaced every `1` with `2`, leaving `3` unchanged and leaving all `2` and `8` as they were.\n\nSo the 2\u2011structures become:\n\n- Row 4: columns 5\u201316 \u2192 all `2`\n- Row 10: columns 1\u20137 \u2192 all `2`\n- Row 18: columns 7\u201316 \u2192 all `2`\n- Row 27: columns 1\u20139 \u2192 all `2`\n\nEverywhere else is `8`, except for the original single `3` at (row 1, col 9).\n\nAfter this step, the grid (before drawing any new 3s) is:\n\n- R1:  `8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 8`\n- R2:  `8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8`\n- R3:  `8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8`\n- R4:  `8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2`\n- R5\u2013R9: all `8`\n- R10: `2 2 2 2 2 2 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8`\n- R11\u2013R17: all `8`\n- R18: `8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2`\n- R19\u2013R26: all `8`\n- R27: `2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8`\n- R28: all `8`\n\n### 2.2. Step 2: Identify the \u201cdata rows\u201d and their intervals\n\nThe rows that contain non\u20118 (i.e. 2) after the 1\u21922 step are:\n\n- r\u2081 = 4, interval [5,16]\n- r\u2082 = 10, interval [1,7]\n- r\u2083 = 18, interval [7,16]\n- r\u2084 = 27, interval [1,9]\n\nThese play the same role as the 2\u2011bands in the examples.\n\nThe single existing `3` is at row r\u2080 = 1, column C\u2080 = 9.\n\n### 2.3. Step 3: Choose horizontal \u201cswitch rows\u201d between bands\n\nFollowing the pattern in Example 3, I place horizontal turning segments at the midpoints between successive \u201creference rows\u201d: the anchor row r\u2080 and each 2\u2011row r\u1d62.\n\nUsing integer floor midpoints:\n\n- y\u2081 = \u230a(r\u2080 + r\u2081)/2\u230b = \u230a(1 + 4)/2\u230b = 2\n- y\u2082 = \u230a(r\u2081 + r\u2082)/2\u230b = \u230a(4 + 10)/2\u230b = 7\n- y\u2083 = \u230a(r\u2082 + r\u2083)/2\u230b = \u230a(10 + 18)/2\u230b = 14\n- y\u2084 = \u230a(r\u2083 + r\u2084)/2\u230b = \u230a(18 + 27)/2\u230b = 22\n\nSo the grid is partitioned vertically into these regions:\n\n- S\u2080: rows 1\u20132\n- S\u2081: rows 3\u20137\n- S\u2082: rows 8\u201314\n- S\u2083: rows 15\u201322\n- S\u2084: rows 23\u201328\n\nEach S\u1d62 (for i \u2265 1) contains the corresponding 2\u2011row r\u1d62.\n\n### 2.4. Step 4: Choose safe corridor columns for vertical segments\n\nFor each 2\u2011row r\u1d62 with interval [L\u1d62,R\u1d62], I choose a column C\u1d62 in that row\u2019s region that is *outside* [L\u1d62,R\u1d62], and as *close as possible* (in horizontal distance) to C\u1d62\u208b\u2081, so that the path:\n\n- never overwrites any `2` (since C\u1d62 \u2209 [L\u1d62,R\u1d62]), and\n- keeps total horizontal travel reasonably small.\n\nWidth W = 16.\n\nIntervals:\n- i=1: [L\u2081,R\u2081] = [5,16]  \u2192 safe columns S\u2081 = {1,2,3,4}\n- i=2: [L\u2082,R\u2082] = [1,7]   \u2192 safe S\u2082 = {8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16}\n- i=3: [L\u2083,R\u2083] = [7,16]  \u2192 safe S\u2083 = {1,2,3,4,5,6}\n- i=4: [L\u2084,R\u2084] = [1,9]   \u2192 safe S\u2084 = {10,11,12,13,14,15,16}\n\nGreedy selection:\n\n- Start: C\u2080 = 9 (column of original 3).\n\n1. Cluster 1 (row 4, [5,16]), safe S\u2081 = {1,2,3,4}.  \n   Nearest to C\u2080=9 is 4 (distance 5).  \n   \u2192 C\u2081 = 4.\n\n2. Cluster 2 (row 10, [1,7]), safe S\u2082 = {8\u202616}.  \n   Nearest to C\u2081=4 is 8 (distance 4).  \n   \u2192 C\u2082 = 8.\n\n3. Cluster 3 (row 18, [7,16]), safe S\u2083 = {1\u20266}.  \n   Nearest to C\u2082=8 is 6 (distance 2).  \n   \u2192 C\u2083 = 6.\n\n4. Cluster 4 (row 27, [1,9]), safe S\u2084 = {10\u202616}.  \n   Nearest to C\u2083=6 is 10 (distance 4).  \n   \u2192 C\u2084 = 10.\n\nThus vertical corridor columns by region:\n\n- S\u2080 (rows 1\u20132): C\u2080 = 9\n- S\u2081 (rows 3\u20137): C\u2081 = 4\n- S\u2082 (rows 8\u201314): C\u2082 = 8\n- S\u2083 (rows 15\u201322): C\u2083 = 6\n- S\u2084 (rows 23\u201328): C\u2084 = 10\n\nEach C\u1d62 is outside that cluster\u2019s [L\u1d62,R\u1d62], so no new `3` overwrites a `2`.\n\n### 2.5. Step 5: Draw the 3\u2011path\n\nNow I actually draw the snake of 3s on the (so far) {2,3,8} grid.\n\nRules:\n\n- Keep existing `3` at (1,9).\n- For each region S\u1d62:\n  - Vertical segment in its corridor column C\u1d62.\n- At each switch row y\u1d62, draw a horizontal 3\u2011segment from C\u1d62\u208b\u2081 to C\u1d62.\n\nConcretely:\n\n- **Rows 1\u20132 (S\u2080), corridor column 9**  \n  - Row 1: already has `3` at col 9.  \n  - Row 2: set col 9 to `3`.\n\n- **Switch at y\u2081 = 2: from C\u2080=9 to C\u2081=4**  \n  - Row 2: 3s at columns 4,5,6,7,8,9 (continuous segment).\n\n- **Rows 3\u20137 (S\u2081), corridor column 4**  \n  - Rows 3,4,5,6,7: set col 4 to `3`.\n\n- **Switch at y\u2082 = 7: from C\u2081=4 to C\u2082=8**  \n  - Row 7: 3s at columns 4,5,6,7,8.\n\n- **Rows 8\u201314 (S\u2082), corridor column 8**  \n  - Rows 8,9,10,11,12,13,14: set col 8 to `3`.\n\n- **Switch at y\u2083 = 14: from C\u2082=8 to C\u2083=6**  \n  - Row 14: 3s at columns 6,7,8.\n\n- **Rows 15\u201322 (S\u2083), corridor column 6**  \n  - Rows 15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22: set col 6 to `3`.\n\n- **Switch at y\u2084 = 22: from C\u2083=6 to C\u2084=10**  \n  - Row 22: 3s at columns 6,7,8,9,10.\n\n- **Rows 23\u201328 (S\u2084), corridor column 10**  \n  - Rows 23,24,25,26,27,28: set col 10 to `3`.\n\nAt every one of these positions, the original cell was `8`, so we never overwrite any of the 2\u2011structures.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "First I\u2019ll summarize the pattern seen in the examples, then I\u2019ll explain exactly how I constructed the path of 3s for the test, and finally I\u2019ll give the completed grid.\n\n---\n\n## What the transformation does (from the examples)\n\nFrom the four training pairs we can reliably infer two things:\n\n1. **All 1s become 2s.**  \n   - In every example, every cell that is 1 in the input becomes 2 in the output.\n   - Cells that are already 2 stay 2.\n   - The 3s added in the output never overwrite 2s (or 1s): the new 3s always lie on cells that were 8.\n\n2. **A single continuous path of 3s is drawn starting from the unique 3 in the input, staying on 8s, and avoiding the 2-bars.**  \n   - In each example there is exactly one 3 in the input.\n   - In the output there is a single continuous 4-connected polyline of 3s (no branches), beginning at that original 3.\n   - The \u201cobstacles\u201d are the bars of 2s (horizontally or vertically oriented runs). The 3-path winds between/around those bars, never touching them (always at least one full cell of 8 between any 3 and any 2).\n   - For examples where all bars are horizontal (Examples 1 and 3), the path essentially runs from the initial 3 downwards toward the bottom, zig-zagging left and right between horizontal bars.  \n   - For examples where all bars are vertical (Examples 2 and 4), the path runs from the initial 3 toward the right boundary, zig-zagging up and down between vertical bars.\n\nFor the test input, **all the non-8 structures made of 1s/2s are horizontal bars**, so we follow the \u201chorizontal-bars pattern\u201d: run a zig-zagging path downward from the starting 3 to the bottom, keeping clear of the 2-bars.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Convert all 1s to 2s\n\nI rewrote the test grid, replacing each 1 by 2 and leaving 0/2/3/8 unchanged.\n\nKey affected rows:\n\n- Row 4: last 1 at col 16 \u2192 2  \n  Original: `8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1`  \n  Becomes:  `8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2`\n- Row 10: `1,2,1,2,2,2,2,...` \u2192 `2,2,2,2,2,2,2,...`\n- Row 18: `...,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,1,2,1` \u2192 `...,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2`\n- Row 27: `1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,...` \u2192 `2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,...`\n\nAfter this, the 2-bars are:\n\n- B1: row 4, cols 5\u201316 (a long horizontal bar)\n- B2: row 10, cols 1\u20137\n- B3: row 18, cols 7\u201316\n- B4: row 27, cols 1\u20139\n\nThe only 3 in the input is at **row 1, col 9**; I keep that as the starting point.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Design a 3-path threading between the horizontal 2-bars\n\nWe want a continuous 3-path from (1,9) down to the bottom, satisfying:\n\n- Only traverse cells that are 8 in the \u201cbase\u201d grid (after 1\u21922).\n- Never step onto a 2.\n- Prefer to stay at least 1 cell away (in Manhattan distance) from any 2; i.e. no 3 should be directly adjacent (up/down/left/right) to a 2.\n- Follow a zig-zagging pattern similar to Example 3: alternating left and right as we pass successive bars.\n\nThe bars\u2019 rows are: 4, 10, 18, 27, and the starting 3 is on row 1. I choose \u201cturn rows\u201d between these so the path can snake between bars while keeping at least one empty row from each bar:\n\n- Between start row 1 and first bar row 4 \u2192 pick row 2 (so there\u2019s row 3 between this turn and row 4).\n- Between bars at rows 4 and 10 \u2192 pick row 7.\n- Between bars at rows 10 and 18 \u2192 pick row 14.\n- Between rows 18 and 27 \u2192 pick row 23.\n\nThat gives turn-rows: **2, 7, 14, 23**.\n\nNext, we decide **which side of each bar** to pass on. For the first bar B1 (row 4, cols 5\u201316), the starting 3 is at column 9, slightly left of the bar\u2019s center (center ~10.5), so we choose to go around B1 on the **left**. After that, we alternate sides, like in the multi-bar example:\n\n- B1: pass on left\n- B2: pass on right\n- B3: pass on left\n- B4: pass on right\n\nNow I choose specific columns that respect \u201cstay away from the bars\u201d:\n\n- To pass **left** of B1 (cols 5\u201316), and have at least one empty column between path and bar, I pick **col 2**.  \n  (At row 4, B1 starts at col 5 \u2192 cols 3\u20134 are buffer between col2 and the bar.)\n- To pass **right** of B2 (cols 1\u20137), I pick **col 9**.  \n  (At row 10, B2 ends at col7, col8 is buffer, col9 is the path.)\n- To pass **left** of B3 (cols 7\u201316), I pick **col 3**.  \n  (At row 18, we have cols4\u20136 as buffer.)\n- To pass **right** of B4 (cols 1\u20139), I pick **col 11**.  \n  (At row 27, col10 is buffer, col11 is path.)\n\nThese choices keep the path at least one cell away from every 2.\n\n### Concrete path segments\n\nUsing those rows and columns, I lay down these segments of 3s (always on original 8s):\n\n1. **From the initial 3 down to row 2:**\n\n   - Already have 3 at (1,9).\n   - Make (2,9) a 3.\n\n2. **Row 2, go left to column 2 (to get left of B1):**\n\n   - Set row 2, cols 2\u20139 to 3.\n\n3. **Down column 2 from row 2 to row 7 (between B1 and B2), staying left of both:**\n\n   - Set column 2, rows 3\u20137 to 3.\n\n4. **Row 7, go right to column 9 (to get right of B2, but still above B3):**\n\n   - Set row 7, cols 2\u20139 to 3.\n\n5. **Down column 9 from row 7 to row 14 (between B2 and B3):**\n\n   - Set column 9, rows 8\u201314 to 3.\n\n6. **Row 14, go left to column 3 (to get left of B3):**\n\n   - Set row 14, cols 3\u20139 to 3.\n\n7. **Down column 3 from row 14 to row 23 (between B3 and B4):**\n\n   - Set column 3, rows 15\u201323 to 3.\n\n8. **Row 23, go right to column 11 (to get right of B4):**\n\n   - Set row 23, cols 3\u201311 to 3.\n\n9. **Down column 11 from row 23 to bottom row 28:**\n\n   - Set column 11, rows 24\u201328 to 3.\n\nAll of these cells were 8 in the base grid, and by construction they are never adjacent (up/down/left/right) to any 2-bar cell.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Combine: base grid (with 1\u21922) plus 3-path\n\nStarting from the base (all 1\u21922) and overlaying the above 3s, the final output grid is:\n\nRow 1: `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow 2: `8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow 3: `8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow 4: `8,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2`  \nRow 5: `8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow 6: `8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow 7: `8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow 8: `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow 9: `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow10: `2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow11: `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow12: `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow13: `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow14: `8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow15: `8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow16: `8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow17: `8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow18: `8,8,3,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2`  \nRow19: `8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow20: `8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow21: `8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow22: `8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow23: `8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow24: `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow25: `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow26: `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow27: `2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow28: `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8`",

        "Full raw LLM response": "To transform the test grid I first treat the colours: every `1` is turned into `2`, all other colours are left unchanged unless changed to `3` as part of the drawing step.\n\nLooking at the worked examples, each puzzle has a single `3` that acts as a seed at the top of the grid. When there is only one row of non\u20118 values, the seed sprouts an L\u2011shaped path: it drops down two rows, runs horizontally to a target column based on the cluster of 2s, then runs vertically down the grid on that target column. When there is more than one horizontal cluster of 1/2s, a rectangular frame of 3s is drawn around the top two clusters: the top of the rectangle is three rows below the first cluster, the bottom is three rows below the second, the left edge is one column to the right of the leftmost of the two clusters and the right edge is four columns to the right of the rightmost of them. The seed\u2019s path then runs down to row\u00a03 on its own column, across row\u00a03 to the rectangle\u2019s right edge, and then vertically down that column. Existing non\u20118 values are never overwritten by 3s.\n\nIn the test case all four clusters of 2s are single rows at rows\u00a04,\u00a010,\u00a018 and\u00a027. I use only the top two to place a rectangle from rows\u00a07\u201313, columns\u00a02\u20139. The seed at (1,9) runs down to row\u00a03 on column\u00a09, across to column\u00a09 (degenerate horizontal), then straight down to the bottom on column\u00a09, with any collisions left as 2s. Applying this gives the following output:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "To solve these tasks I first reduced all the 1s to 2s, because that happens consistently in every example.\n\nThe remaining non\u20118 cells form \u201cobstacles\u201d on a few specific rows. For a single starting 3 on the border the examples all draw a rectilinear path of 3s that weaves around those obstacle rows: you move vertically down through the grid, turning on horizontal lines placed midway between successive obstacle rows (starting from the top), and on each turn you switch to a column that lies just outside the occupied span on the upcoming obstacle row, usually taking the second free column in that clear region. This produces a zig\u2011zag of alternating vertical and horizontal segments; with four obstacle rows there are four horizontal turn lines and five vertical runs.\n\nFor the test grid the rows with non\u20118 values are 4,\u202f10,\u202f18 and\u202f28, so the turn rows are at 2,\u202f7,\u202f14 and\u202f23. The free regions force the path alternately to the left and right of each span, giving x positions at columns 9\u21922\u21929\u21922\u219211. Drawing the 3s along those segments on top of the converted grid yields:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8",
