            "Full raw LLM response": "Alright, let's see. The task before me seems to be an ARC problem. The goal is to figure out the rule that transforms a given grid, right?\n\n**Analyzing the Grid Transformations**\n\nFrom the first example, it looks like there are \"objects\" - basically, 3x3 (but sometimes more like a cross shape in the test input) blocks of a specific color, with a central pixel of another color. The main action is a color swap within these objects and, sometimes, deleting them entirely. The core concept seems to be that certain objects \"transfer\" their central color to another.\n\nLet's break down the logic:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Look for 3x3 regions with distinct inner and outer colors. The inner color is the center pixel's color, and the outer is the surrounding color of a cross or square in these test inputs.\n2.  **Potential Links:** Create a connection between two objects if the outer color of one object matches the inner color of another. This could be thought of as `Object A -> Object B` when `A.outer == B.inner`.\n3.  **Resolve Conflicts:** The tricky part: If there's a chain of these potential links, we need to determine the final state. Turns out, it's not simply following the chain, more like a \"greedy\" approach from the sink. Start from objects that have no outgoing connection - their \"destinations\".\n    *   **Prioritize from the End:** Start from any \"sink\" object (object with no out-links).\n    *   **Activate Links:** Work backwards in the identified chains. If it's the final link, make it active, marking the destination as \"keep\".\n    *   **Keep and Delete:**  If an object acts as an \"active destination\" it keeps the object (and updates the inner color) . If an object is just a source (and *not* a destination), then delete it from the final result. In the case of multiple destinations, pick the source connection that produces the longest chain or makes the \"best\" fit with objects.\n4.  **Execute Transformations:** If an object is an Active Destination, update its inner color to the inner color of its associated source. If an object is a Source (and does not match a destination), then delete this object (fill with zeroes). If it is a potential source but not connected anywhere, it also becomes deleted! All the rest are the static background and remain the same.\n\nIn essence, color \"flows\" from source to destination, and the final state depends on how these transfers are established, which determines the final grid.\n\n\nThe problem involves identifying \"source\" and \"destination\" relationships between objects based on their color properties, transferring information (the inner color) from source to destination, and managing the deletion of used or failed sources.\n\n**Logic Derivation:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:**\n    -   The grid contains background structures (typically color 5, grey) and foreground objects.\n    -   Foreground objects are 3x3 shapes (either solid squares or cross/diamond shapes) consisting of an \"Outer\" color forming the boundary and an \"Inner\" color at the single center pixel.\n    -   In the test input, the objects are diamond-shaped:\n        -   **Object A:** Center at (2,2), Inner=2 (Red), Outer=4 (Yellow).\n        -   **Object B:** Center at (1,7), Inner=3 (Green), Outer=2 (Red).\n        -   **Object C:** Center at (6,4), Inner=9 (Maroon), Outer=1 (Blue).\n        -   **Object D:** Center at (7,1), Inner=1 (Blue), Outer=7 (Orange).\n        -   **Object E:** Center at (6,8), Inner=3 (Green), Outer=3 (Green).\n\n2.  **Determining Relationships (Chains):**\n    -   A potential link exists from Object X to Object Y if **X.Outer Color == Y.Inner Color**. This implies X can feed into Y.\n    -   We build chains of these links.\n    -   **Chain 1:**\n        -   Object E (Outer 3) matches Object B (Inner 3). Link: **E -> B**.\n        -   Object B (Outer 2) matches Object A (Inner 2). Link: **B -> A**.\n        -   Chain: **E -> B -> A**.\n    -   **Chain 2:**\n        -   Object C (Outer 1) matches Object D (Inner 1). Link: **C -> D**.\n        -   Chain: **C -> D**.\n\n3.  **Resolving Conflicts and Executing Actions:**\n    -   Rule: An object cannot simultaneously act as a Source and a Destination. Priority is given to the end of the chain (the Sink).\n    -   **Chain 1 (E -> B -> A):**\n        -   **A** is the Sink. It acts as the Destination.\n        -   **B** feeds A. Link **B -> A** is active. B acts as the Source.\n        -   Since B is now an active Source, it cannot be a Destination. The link **E -> B** is blocked.\n        -   **E** is a \"Candidate Source\" that failed to act (neither active Dest nor active Source).\n    -   **Chain 2 (C -> D):**\n        -   **D** is the Sink. It acts as the Destination.\n        -   **C** feeds D. Link **C -> D** is active. C acts as the Source.\n\n4.  **Transformation Rules:**\n    -   **Active Destination:** The object remains. Its Inner color is updated to the Inner color of its Source.\n        -   **A** stays. New Center = B.Inner (3).\n        -   **D** stays. New Center = C.Inner (9).\n    -   **Active Source:** The object is deleted (pixels cleared to 0).\n        -   **B** is deleted.\n        -   **C** is deleted.\n    -   **Failed/Unused Candidate Source:** The object is deleted.\n        -   **E** is deleted.\n    -   **Background:** Static pixels (color 5) remain unchanged.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n-   **Object A** (Top-Left) remains. Center changes from 2 to 3.\n-   **Object D** (Bottom-Left) remains. Center changes from 1 to 9.\n-   **Object B** (Top-Right), **Object C** (Middle), and **Object E** (Middle-Right) are deleted.\n-   Background (grey 5s) is preserved.\n\n**Final Output Grid:**\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,4,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,5,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n7,9,7,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,7,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**I've got this!** The user wants me to solve an ARC task and I'm ready to dive in. From what I can see, it looks like I'm dealing with a grid and some geometric shapes with specific colors. The goal is to figure out how these shapes transform based on their relationships.\n\n**Here's my thought process:**\n\nI'm starting by analyzing some example inputs and outputs. It seems that there are \"key\" or \"target\" objects. In these examples, there are shapes that have a color in the center that is important. These center colors have to match the outer color of a different shape to trigger a transfer.\n\nFor example, I identified \"Sender\" objects, these are 3x3 colored squares or rings with a distinct center color. If another object's outer color is the same as the \"sender's\" center color, then a transfer occurs. The \"receiver's\" center is updated with the \"sender's\" center color. The Sender object is then removed.\n\nI'm thinking that I need to establish a rule around finding these matching objects. Let's call them \"Keyed Objects\".\n\nHere are the parts:\n- **Identification:** I need to identify the objects. These are usually 3x3 blocks, although the shape doesn't matter too much (they could be crosses)\n- **Connections:** If object A's center color is the same as object B's outer color, that creates a connection A --> B. A \"attacks\" B.\n- **Rules:** The \"Targeted\" object (B) will have its center color updated with the \"Source\" center.\n\nI'm using this \"Key/Lock\" approach:\nIf there is a link, the target object gets updated with the source's center color. Then source object is removed.\n\nA critical point: I think the connections are chain-like. It goes in one direction. I'm calling it Eat or Die. An object has to \"eat\" before it can survive. The end of the chain starves to death and gets removed. Any target object is removed.\n\nHere's my refined algorithm:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Find the 3x3 keyed objects (blocks or crosses), and ignore any \"background\" pixels.\n2.  **Build a Graph:** Create a graph where nodes are objects. An edge A --> B exists if A.center\\_color == B.outer\\_color.\n3.  **Process Chains:**\n    -   Find the chains, the ones where the object doesn't have an incoming link. It's the \"head\" of the chain. If a chain ends in a loop, it \"eats\" itself and disappears.\n    -   Process these chains based on the rule \"Eat or Die\": Starting from the head, objects are eaten and then removed if they are targets.\n\nNow, let's take a look at the \"test input.\" I need to find the objects in the test input. There are no perfect squares. There are some \"cross\" shapes with a center. Let's treat them as 3x3 objects. I need to make the connections between the \"crosses\" to figure out the chain(s). After that, the objects \"eat\" each other until there are survivors and a final result. The background stuff is just the background and it is not changed.\n\nOnce I have the new grid, I can answer the user's request.\n\nTo solve this task, we identify a system of interacting objects based on the examples.\n\n### Logic Derivation\n\n1.  **Object Identification**: The grid contains distinct 3x3 objects. In the examples, these were solid 3x3 squares, but in the test input, they are 3x3 \"cross\" shapes (a center pixel and 4 orthogonal neighbors). Each object is defined by an **Outer Color** and a **Center Color**. Background pixels (like the gray wires/dots of color 5) are inert and persist unchanged unless occluded.\n\n2.  **Interaction Rule (Feeding Chain)**:\n    *   Objects form directed relationships. An object `Source` targets an object `Target` if `Source.Center_Color == Target.Outer_Color`.\n    *   This forms chains of interactions (e.g., A targets B, B targets C).\n    *   The interactions are resolved sequentially starting from the \"Head\" of a chain (an object that is not targeted by any other object).\n\n3.  **Resolution Mechanism**:\n    *   **Consumption**: If object X targets object Y, X \"consumes\" Y.\n        *   X survives and updates its center color to match Y's center color.\n        *   Y is removed (its pixels are cleared to 0).\n    *   **Starvation**: If an object X does not target any valid object (and was not eaten by a predator), it \"dies of starvation\" and is removed.\n    *   **Chain Reaction**: Since a consumed object is removed, it cannot perform its own targeting action. Thus, if A targets B, and B targets C:\n        *   A eats B. A survives (updated). B is removed.\n        *   Since B is removed, it cannot eat C.\n        *   C is now left as the head of the remainder. If C targets nothing, C dies.\n\n### Application to Test Input\n\nWe identify the objects in the test grid (ignoring the background 5s):\n*   **Object A (Top Left)**: Yellow (4) cross, Center Red (2). Targets Outer 2.\n*   **Object B (Top Right)**: Red (2) cross, Center Green (3). Targets Outer 3.\n*   **Object E (Right Middle)**: Green (3) cross, Center Green (3). Targets Outer 3 (Itself? or Nothing distinct).\n*   **Object D (Bottom Left)**: Orange (7) cross, Center Blue (1). Targets Outer 1.\n*   **Object C (Bottom Middle)**: Blue (1) cross, Center Maroon (9). Targets Outer 9 (None).\n\n**Chains**:\n1.  **Chain 1**: A (Center 2) $\\rightarrow$ B (Outer 2).\n    *   B (Center 3) $\\rightarrow$ E (Outer 3).\n    *   Structure: A $\\rightarrow$ B $\\rightarrow$ E.\n    *   **Execution**:\n        *   A is the head. A targets B.\n        *   A eats B. A's center becomes B's center (**3**). A survives.\n        *   B is removed.\n        *   Now E is isolated. E targets nothing (or itself, which implies deletion). E is removed.\n    *   **Result**: Object A remains with new center 3. Objects B and E are cleared.\n\n2.  **Chain 2**: D (Center 1) $\\rightarrow$ C (Outer 1).\n    *   C (Center 9) $\\rightarrow$ None.\n    *   Structure: D $\\rightarrow$ C.\n    *   **Execution**:\n        *   D is the head. D targets C.\n        *   D eats C. D's center becomes C's center (**9**). D survives.\n        *   C is removed.\n    *   **Result**: Object D remains with new center 9. Object C is cleared.\n\n**Background**: The gray (5) pixels are not part of any object and persist.\n\n### Final Grid Construction\n*   **Row 0**: Cleared (B removed).\n*   **Row 1**: A's top (4) remains. B's parts cleared.\n*   **Row 2**: A's middle (4,3,4) remains (Center updated to 3). B's parts cleared.\n*   **Row 3**: A's bottom (4) remains. Background 5 remains.\n*   **Row 4-5**: C and E parts cleared. Background 5s remain.\n*   **Row 6**: D's top (7) remains. C and E parts cleared. Background 5 remains.\n*   **Row 7**: D's middle (7,9,7) remains (Center updated to 9). C and E parts cleared. Background 5 remains.\n*   **Row 8**: D's bottom (7) remains. Background 5s remain.\n*   **Row 9**: Background 5s remain.\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,4,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,5,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n7,9,7,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,7,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**The Path to Solving the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where the goal is to predict the output grid given an input grid and a few examples. I immediately notice some patterns: the input grids contain 3x3 objects, often with a center pixel of a different color. There's also this grey \"wire\" connecting them. The first step, always, is to *really* understand Example 1.\n\nI start breaking down Example 1, thinking, \"What's changing? What's staying? Is the grey path important?\" Analyzing Example 1, I see that some boxes disappear while others remain, and the centers seem to change. I focus on the connectivity of the boxes - which ones touch the wire? Do the connected boxes stay or go? I'm quickly realizing that it's not simply \"connected boxes stay\".\n\nAs I examine the input and output, I make the connection that boxes that disappear seem to be \"giving\" their center color to the boxes that *do* remain. This sparks a theory about object pairs, a hypothesis about \"who's connected, who's not\". I get a bit stuck, thinking, \"Is there a reference relationship between the objects, maybe color-based?\" Then, \"Aha! Is the center color the link?\" I start mapping \"references\": If an object's center color is the same as another object's body color, that forms a connection.\n\nAt this point, I think, \"Ok, so object A eats object B if A's center color matches B's body color.\" This leads to the thought, \"What if there are chains? If A eats B, and B eats C...?\" I'm also thinking, \"What does the wire do?\" and, \"Does the order of these actions matter? Do we have 'simultaneous consumption'?\" Example 2 comes to play, and I think, \"Wire defines a sequence/path\" which turns out to not be the case. I go back to the idea of object's *Donating Centers*, that connected/unconnected has some role here.\n\nSo, I refine the \"A eats B\" rule: if an object's center color equals another object's body color, the \"eater\" survives, the \"eaten\" disappears, and the \"eater\" takes the original center color of the eaten object. I'm also considering a sequence: the wire path is key to understanding the action. I need to consider a case for \"Dangling\" wired objects: if Object D is on a wire, and D's reference is invalid, maybe D becomes the color of its survivor?\n\nExample 3 is like another test. All the components are there but I need to make the rule work. Again, thinking \"What about that wire, is the wire just decorative?\" Here I'm thinking I can ignore it but also maybe there is some special logic for the wire. Now, I have the model, but I need to test it on the test grid.\n\nSo, I have the refined steps: parse the grid, find the objects, find the \"eating\" relationships (where one object 'eats' another), handle any \"dangling\" references, and construct the output grid. The test input, the ultimate test.\n\nI'm now ready to apply my refined logic. I analyze the test input, identify the objects, create all reference chains, apply the rules. \"Ok, Yellow eats Red, who survives? Orange chain\". I apply the color change to create the final grid. I have everything now.\n\n\nThe problem presents a set of grids containing \"objects\" (colored 3x3 boxes or crosses) and \"wires\" (grey lines). The transformation involves interactions between these objects based on their colors.\n\n**Logic Explanation:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification**: The grid contains distinct objects. In the examples, they are 3x3 squares. In the test input, they are \"plus\" or \"cross\" shapes. Each object has a main \"Body Color\" and a \"Center Color\".\n2.  **Reference Rule**: Interactions are determined by references. An object A \"references\" object B if **A's Center Color equals B's Body Color**.\n3.  **Eating Mechanism**:\n    *   If Object A references Object B, Object A \"eats\" Object B.\n    *   The \"eaten\" object (B) is removed from the grid.\n    *   The \"eater\" object (A) survives.\n    *   **Center Transfer**: The survivor (A) updates its Center Color to match the **original Center Color** of the victim (B).\n4.  **Chains**: This can form a chain (A -> B -> C).\n    *   A eats B. B eats C.\n    *   A survives. B and C are removed.\n    *   A acquires B's original center color.\n5.  **Wires**: The grey (5) pixels represent wires. They persist in the output (unless overwritten by a surviving object). While wires seem to connect objects, the primary logic is governed by the color references. Isolated objects can still eat connected objects (as seen in Example 1 and the Test Input).\n6.  **Edge Cases**:\n    *   If a survivor has a reference to a color that doesn't exist (e.g., Blue references Maroon, and no Maroon object exists), and it is eaten by another object, it simply disappears.\n    *   In Example 2, a survivor (Blue) with an invalid reference that was connected to another survivor (Teal) adopted Teal's color. However, in the Test Input, the survivors (Yellow and Orange) have valid references (Red and Blue, respectively), so this special case does not apply.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Objects Present**:\n    *   **A: Yellow Cross (4)** at top-left. Center: **Red (2)**. -> References **B**.\n    *   **B: Red Cross (2)** at top-right. Center: **Green (3)**. -> References **C**.\n    *   **C: Green Cross (3)** at bottom-right. Center: **Green (3)**. -> References **Self** (or terminates).\n    *   **D: Blue Cross (1)** at bottom-middle. Center: **Maroon (9)**. -> References **None** (Maroon object doesn't exist).\n    *   **E: Orange Cross (7)** at bottom-left. Center: **Blue (1)**. -> References **D**.\n\n*   **Interactions**:\n    *   **Chain 1**: A (Yellow) refs B (Red). B (Red) refs C (Green).\n        *   A eats B.\n        *   B eats C.\n        *   Result: A survives. B and C are removed.\n        *   A's new center becomes B's old center: **3** (Green).\n    *   **Chain 2**: E (Orange) refs D (Blue). D refs Missing.\n        *   E eats D.\n        *   Result: E survives. D is removed.\n        *   E's new center becomes D's old center: **9** (Maroon).\n\n*   **Construction**:\n    *   Clear the grid.\n    *   Copy the wire pixels (color 5) from the input.\n    *   Draw the surviving **Yellow Cross** at its original location with Center **3**.\n    *   Draw the surviving **Orange Cross** at its original location with Center **9**.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,4,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,5,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n7,9,7,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,7,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**My Solution for ARC Task:**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process. The goal is to solve these \"ARC\" puzzles. The data is presented as a grid, where each cell has a number representing a color. The task is to transform the grid based on some rules that are not initially given.\n\nI start by making some initial observations about the grid structure. The grids are 10x10. I notice that the numbers (0-9) are colors, with 0 being black and 5 being a grey \"wire\". Other numbers seem to form 3x3 squares with a different colored center. I call these squares \"modules\" or \"flowers\" because it helps visualize.\n\nI analyze the first example to figure out the rules. The grid has modules that have colored rims and centers. The modules are connected by grey \"wires\" (the 5s). Tracing the wires and comparing the grid representation with the image representation of \"Input 1\", I conclude that modules are connected when their rims are touching the grey wires.\n\nAfter trying to identify the pattern and how the input and the output of the first example are related, I determine that the color of the center of one module might go to the center of another. I identify there's a pattern, where the output grid shows changes in the centers of the modules, with some modules disappearing entirely. \n\nThe first thought is that one module \"pushes\" its center color to a connected module. So if a module has its center of color 'A' and is connected to another module which has its rim the same color 'A', the center of the rim module changes its color to 'A'. And the former module disappears. From that logic, I write that 'The Receiver gets a copy of the Sender's Center color and the Sender dies'.\n\nI test this hypothesis on Example 2 and find it does not work. This means I need to reevaluate how I determine whether one module pushes its center color to a connected module. Now I figure out that I need to determine if there is an order of application of a rule, where each module calls another or is being called, and these calls happen in an order in time that is critical to the transformations. \n\nI make new observations and test a few new theories. The next theory is that if a module is connected by a grey \"wire\", it might transfer its color to the module connected by that wire. I write: \"In each pair, one module moves its center color to the other, replacing the destination's center. The source module disappears\". I try to determine which module is source and which is destination.\n\nAfter tracing all connections, it appears that, in the first example, all of these modules have the ability to \"transfer\" their center color to the other connected modules. In this example, one module should transfer to another and should die. But I'm missing something, because if the connected module received the color transfer, it should not die. This is what helps me come to the right answer. The correct logic is that the center of one module goes to the center of the other that has the same rim. The module with the center color that gets used up then disappears.\n\nThe core rule here seems to be that a \"Receiver\" module takes on the color of a connected module if its center matches the connected module's rim color and that the \"Sender\" module disappears. If a module cannot receive anything, then I assume it \"survives\". \n\nHowever, there's an exception, which I eventually infer: a module that can be pulled, but does not pull, survives. With that, I formulate the final strategy.\n\nFor solving a new grid:\n\n1.  **Identify Modules:** Locate 3x3 \"flower\" shapes and note their rim and center colors.\n2.  **Trace Wires:** Find the grey \"wire\" paths (5s) connecting the modules.\n3.  **Establish Connections:** Determine if modules are connected based on wire adjacency.\n4.  **Identify Pulls:** Look for pairs where a module's center color matches a connected module's rim. A pulls B.\n5.  **Simultaneous Transfer:** Perform all valid \"pull\" transfers simultaneously, where A's color goes to B's center.\n6.  **Survival:** All Senders (modules that are pulled) die. Non-Senders survive.\n\nI am now confident to solve a new test input by using this logic.\n\nNow, apply this process to the provided \"Test Input\" to generate the final transformed grid. This will be the output.\n\n\nThe logic for solving this task is based on modeling the grid as a network of \"modules\" connected by \"wires\".\n\n1.  **Identify Objects**:\n    *   **Modules**: In the solved examples, these are 3x3 squares. In the test input, they are 3x3 \"crosses\" (or diamond shapes). A module consists of a \"Rim\" (the outer pixels of the shape) of one color and a \"Center\" (the core pixel) of another color.\n    *   **Wires**: Grey pixels (value 5) form lines connecting the modules. Diagonal connections between wire pixels or between wire and module pixels are valid.\n\n2.  **Determine Interactions (\"Pulls\")**:\n    *   We trace the connections to determine the network topology.\n    *   An interaction occurs between two connected modules, say Module A and Module B.\n    *   **Rule**: If Module A's **Center** color matches Module B's **Rim** color, then Module A \"pulls\" information from Module B.\n    *   **Direction**: Module A is the **Receiver**. Module B is the **Sender**.\n    *   **Action**: The Sender's Center color is transferred to the Receiver, becoming the Receiver's new Center color.\n\n3.  **Determine Fates (Survival vs. Death)**:\n    *   **Sender Rule**: Any module that acts as a Sender (i.e., its Rim color matched a neighbor's Center) **dies** (is removed from the grid).\n    *   **Receiver Rule**: A Receiver survives, unless it is also a Sender in another interaction. (In the examples, modules that both send and receive tend to die, but terminal receivers survive).\n    *   **Isolation Rule**: Modules that are not connected to anything, or connected modules that do not trigger the \"Center matches Rim\" condition with any neighbor, are unaffected and survive.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Module A** (Top-Left, centered at 2,2): Rim 4 (Yellow), Center 2 (Red). It is isolated (no wires connect to it). **Result**: Survives unchanged.\n*   **Module B** (Top-Right, centered at 1,7): Rim 2 (Red), Center 3 (Green). Connected to the wire network.\n*   **Module C** (Bottom-Left, centered at 7,1): Rim 7 (Orange), Center 1 (Blue). Connected to the wire network.\n*   **Module D** (Middle-Right, centered at 6,4): Rim 1 (Blue), Center 9 (Maroon). Connected to the wire network.\n*   **Module E** (Bottom-Right, centered at 6,8): Rim 3 (Green), Center 3 (Green). Connected to the wire network.\n\n**Network Interactions**:\n*   Modules B, C, D, E are all connected via the grey wires.\n*   **Check D & C**: Module D has Center 9. Module C has Rim 7. No match.\n    *   Wait, let's check the other way: Module C has Center 1. Module D has Rim 1. **Match!**\n    *   **Interaction**: Module D pulls from Module C.\n    *   **Effect**: D becomes Center 1 (from C). C acts as Sender.\n*   **Check E & B**: Module E has Center 3. Module B has Rim 2. No match.\n    *   Wait, Module E has Center 3. Does B have Rim 3? No (Rim 2).\n    *   Let's check B's Center. Module B has Center 3. Module E has Rim 3. **Match!**\n    *   **Interaction**: Module E pulls from Module B.\n    *   **Effect**: E becomes Center 3 (from B). B acts as Sender.\n\n**Final States**:\n*   **Module A**: Isolated. Survives. (Rim 4, Center 2).\n*   **Module B**: Acts as Sender (to E). Dies.\n*   **Module C**: Acts as Sender (to D). Dies.\n*   **Module D**: Acts as Receiver. Survives. New Center = 1.\n*   **Module E**: Acts as Receiver. Survives. New Center = 3.\n*   **Wires**: Remain unchanged.\n\n**Output Generation**:\n*   Clear the pixels of Module B (Red/Green cross at top right).\n*   Clear the pixels of Module C (Orange/Blue cross at bottom left).\n*   Change Center of Module D (at 6,4) to 1.\n*   Ensure Center of Module E (at 6,8) is 3 (it is).\n*   Leave A and Wires intact.\n\nOutput Grid:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,4,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,5,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,1,0,5,0,3,0\n0,0,0,1,1,1,5,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,1,0,5,0,3,0\n0,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Understanding the transformation**\n\n1. **Identify the special \u201crooms\u201d (portals).**  \n   From the examples and the picture it is clear that non\u2011zero colors come in two kinds:\n   - Color `5` draws a fixed grey \u201cpath\u201d which is never changed.\n   - Other colors form small colored rooms. In the grids those rooms are:\n     - a center cell with color \\(C\\),\n     - whose four orthogonal neighbours all have the same color \\(B\\neq C\\),\n     - and that color \\(B\\) forms one connected component around that center.\n\n   Each such room can be represented as a **directed mapping**  \n   \\[\n   B \\rightarrow C\n   \\]\n   (border color \u2192 center color).\n\n2. **Build the color\u2011graph of the rooms.**  \n   In every training example, each border color appears only once and each center color is unique.  \n   Therefore the mappings form **disjoint directed chains** of colors:\n   \\[\n   B_0 \\rightarrow B_1 \\rightarrow B_2 \\rightarrow \\dots \\rightarrow T\n   \\]\n   where the last color \\(T\\) is not a border color of any room.\n\n   Examples:\n   - Example 1 mappings: `3\u21924, 4\u21922, 6\u21921, 1\u21923`  \n     Chain: \\(6 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 2\\).\n   - Example 2: `2\u21926, 3\u21922, 8\u21923, 1\u21924, 4\u21928`  \n     Chain: \\(1 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 6\\).\n   - Example 3: `1\u21922, 2\u21929, 4\u21923, 7\u21924`  \n     Chains: \\(1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 9\\) and \\(7 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 3\\).\n\n3. **Chain compression rule.**  \n   For each chain we compress it **pairwise**:\n\n   - Number the edges of a chain as  \n     \\(E_0: V_0 \\to V_1,\\; E_1: V_1 \\to V_2,\\; E_2: V_2 \\to V_3,\\dots\\)\n   - Take edges in pairs \\((E_0,E_1), (E_2,E_3), \\dots\\).  \n     Each pair \\((V_i\\!\\to\\!V_{i+1},\\; V_{i+1}\\!\\to\\!V_{i+2})\\) is replaced by a **composite room**\n     \\[\n     V_i \\rightarrow V_{i+2}\n     \\]\n   - The room whose border color is \\(V_{i+1}\\) is deleted.\n   - If the chain has an odd number of edges, the last unpaired edge is removed.\n\n   This exactly reproduces all three training outputs:\n   - Example 1 (chain of 4 edges):  \n     \\(6\\to1\\to3\\to4\\to2\\) \u2192 rooms `6\u21923` and `3\u21922`, rooms with borders `1` and `4` removed.\n   - Example 2 (chain of 5 edges):  \n     \\(1\\to4\\to8\\to3\\to2\\to6\\) \u2192 rooms `1\u21928` and `8\u21922`, others removed.\n   - Example 3 (two chains, each of 2 edges):  \n     `1\u21929` and `7\u21923`, rooms with borders `2` and `4` removed.\n\n4. **Cleaning the grid.**  \n   After determining which rooms survive and their new centers:\n   - Every cell that is color `5` (the grey path) is **kept unchanged**.\n   - For each surviving room:\n     - all cells in its border component keep the border color \\(B\\),\n     - its center cell is recolored to the new center value from the chain compression.\n   - All other non\u2011zero cells (rooms that were deleted, or any stray colors) are set to `0`.\n\n---\n\n## Applying the rule to the test input\n\n### 1. Find all rooms in the test grid\n\nLocate all cells whose four orthogonal neighbours share a color \\(B\\neq\\) center:\n\n- **Room A**: center at \\((2,2)\\) (0\u2011based rows,cols), pattern\n\n  ```\n  0 4 0\n  4 2 4\n  0 4 0\n  ```\n  Border color `4`, center `2`: mapping `4\u21922`.\n\n- **Room B**: center at \\((7,1)\\):\n\n  ```\n  7 1 7\n  7 1 7   (taking neighbours)\n  7 . .\n  ```\n  (actually plus of `7`s around `1`) \u2192 mapping `7\u21921`.\n\n- **Room C**: center at \\((6,4)\\):\n\n  ```\n  0 1 0\n  1 9 1\n  0 1 0\n  ```\n  \u2192 mapping `1\u21929`.\n\n- **Room D**: center at \\((1,7)\\):\n\n  ```\n  0 2 0\n  2 3 2\n  0 2 0\n  ```\n  \u2192 mapping `2\u21923`.\n\n(We ignore the 3\u00d73 of `3`s at \\((6,8)\\) because its center equals its border color; in the training tasks all functional rooms have different center and border.)\n\nSo the mappings are:\n\n\\[\n4\\rightarrow2,\\quad 7\\rightarrow1,\\quad 1\\rightarrow9,\\quad 2\\rightarrow3\n\\]\n\nBorder colors set \\(D = \\{4,7,1,2\\}\\).\n\n### 2. Build color chains\n\nCompute predecessors: for each border color, ask which other room has it as its center.\n\n- `4`: never a center \u2192 predecessor none.\n- `7`: never a center \u2192 predecessor none.\n- `1`: predecessor `7` (from `7\u21921`).\n- `2`: predecessor `4` (from `4\u21922`).\n\nSo the roots (no predecessors) are colors `4` and `7`.  \nChains:\n\n- From `4`:\n  - `4\u21922` and `2` is a border,\n  - `2\u21923` and `3` is not a border \u2192 stop.\n\n  Chain: \\(4 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3\\).\n\n- From `7`:\n  - `7\u21921` and `1` is a border,\n  - `1\u21929` and `9` is not a border \u2192 stop.\n\n  Chain: \\(7 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 9\\).\n\nEach chain has 2 edges.\n\n### 3. Pairwise compression\n\nCompress each chain:\n\n- Chain \\(4 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3\\):  \n  Pair of edges `(4\u21922, 2\u21923)` \u2192 new room `4\u21923`.  \n  Room with border `2` is deleted.\n\n- Chain \\(7 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 9\\):  \n  Pair `(7\u21921, 1\u21929)` \u2192 new room `7\u21929`.  \n  Room with border `1` is deleted.\n\nThus surviving rooms and their new centers:\n\n- Border `4` room (around (2,2)) now has center color `3`.\n- Border `7` room (around (7,1)) now has center color `9`.\n- Rooms with borders `1` and `2` are removed entirely.\n\n### 4. Construct the output grid\n\nKeep only:\n- all `5` cells (unchanged),\n- the two surviving rooms (their border components + new centers),\nand set everything else to `0`.\n\nSurviving room A (border 4):\n- border cells: (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2) = `4`\n- center (2,2) = `3`.\n\nSurviving room B (border 7):\n- border cells: (6,1), (7,0), (7,2), (8,1) = `7`\n- center (7,1) = `9`.\n\nWalkway (color 5) positions are preserved at:\n(3,7), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (8,3), (8,5), (9,1), (9,2), (9,4).\n\nAll other cells are `0`.\n\nSo the final output grid is:\n\nRow0: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \nRow1: 0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \nRow2: 0,4,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0  \nRow3: 0,0,4,0,0,0,0,5,0,0  \nRow4: 0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0  \nRow5: 0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0  \nRow6: 0,7,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0  \nRow7: 7,9,7,0,0,0,5,0,0,0  \nRow8: 0,7,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0  \nRow9: 0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0  \n\n### Final output grid\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,4,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,5,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n7,9,7,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,7,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "The examples all consist of small \u201cbox\u201d objects: a cell whose four orthogonal neighbours are all the same non\u2011zero colour (the box\u2019s outer colour), with a different centre colour. Those boxes are linked by using the centre colour of one to refer to the outer colour of another; colour\u202f5 cells form the unchanged background/path.\n\nTo transform a grid, first detect all such boxes. Build a directed edge from each box to the box whose outer colour equals its centre, if it exists. Starting from boxes with no incoming edge, traverse each chain along these edges. Keep boxes at even positions from the head as long as they have an outgoing edge; remove boxes at odd positions and any tail with no outgoing edge by setting their 3\u00d73 region to zero. For each kept box, replace its centre with the centre value of its successor; leave its outer cells unchanged. All other cells (including colour\u202f5 path) stay as in the input.\n\nIn the test grid there are four boxes:\n- outer\u202f4 centred at (3,3) pointing to outer\u202f2,\n- outer\u202f2 centred at (2,8) with no target,\n- outer\u202f7 centred at (8,2) pointing to outer\u202f1,\n- outer\u202f1 centred at (7,5) with no target.\n\nChains are 4\u21922 and 7\u21921. Keeping the heads and removing the tails, the centre of the outer\u20114 box becomes 3 (from box\u202f2), and the centre of the outer\u20117 box becomes 9 (from box\u202f1); the other two boxes are erased. The path cells remain.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,4,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,5,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,3,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,5,3,3,3\n7,9,7,0,0,0,5,0,3,0\n0,7,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "The coloured \u201csquares\u201d are the only objects that get manipulated: each is a distinct outer colour surrounding a single central colour. In the examples those are axis\u2011aligned 3\u00d73 borders, but in the test they appear as diamonds (outer colour on the four cardinal neighbours of a different centre). The grey 5\u2011path is never changed.\n\nFor each square, interpret its centre value as a pointer to another square whose outer colour matches that value. This gives one or more chains starting at squares whose outer colour is not anyone else\u2019s centre. Traverse each chain in order; group the nodes into pairs (1st with 2nd, 3rd with 4th, \u2026). In each pair, the first square is kept and its centre is replaced by the centre colour of the second; the second square is removed. If a chain has an unpaired last element, it is removed. All other coloured cells (including removed squares and any other colours) are set to 0; only the kept squares with updated centres and the original 5\u2011path remain.\n\nIn the test there are four diamond\u2011squares:\n- outer\u202f4 with centre\u202f2 at (2,2),\n- outer\u202f2 with centre\u202f3 at (1,7),\n- outer\u202f7 with centre\u202f1 at (7,1),\n- outer\u202f1 with centre\u202f9 at (6,4).\n\nChains: 4\u21922\u2192end and 7\u21921\u2192end. Keeping the first of each pair and copying the partner\u2019s centre yields outer\u202f4 with centre\u202f3 and outer\u202f7 with centre\u202f9. The others are removed.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this ARC task, and it seems pretty straightforward on the surface, but like all of them, the devil's in the details. The user's given me these three solved examples and one test input to figure out the transformation. I can see immediately that we're dealing with 10x10 grids of integers, which I'm assuming represent colors.\n\nThe hints are actually very helpful this time. They're telling me about \"blocks,\" and after a quick glance at those examples, I'm almost certain they mean 3x3 squares within the grid that have a specific structure. It looks like each block has a distinct outer border color and a center color, which is a good clue.\n\nThe second part of the hint is the real key here: the matching condition. It appears two blocks will match if the inner color of one equals the outer border color of the other. This feels very much like a puzzle piece situation. I'll need to figure out exactly how these blocks are arranged or related to form the solution grid. This is an exciting step to proceed with.\n\n\n**Explanation of Reasoning**\n\nThe problem involves interacting 3x3 blocks and a connecting \"network\" of grey (color 5) pixels. Here is the step-by-step logic derived from the examples and hints:\n\n1.  **Identify Blocks:**\n    Scan the grid for 3x3 patterns consisting of a border of one color and a single center pixel of another color.\n    *   In the test input, we identify the following 3x3 blocks (centers given in row, col notation, 0-indexed):\n        *   **Block A:** Center at (2, 2). Border color 4 (yellow), Inner color 2 (red).\n        *   **Block B:** Center at (1, 7). Border color 2 (red), Inner color 3 (green).\n        *   **Block C:** Center at (6, 4). Border color 1 (blue), Inner color 9 (maroon).\n        *   **Block D:** Center at (7, 1). Border color 7 (orange), Inner color 1 (blue).\n        *   **Block E:** Center at (6, 8). Border color 3 (green), Inner color ? (The grid actually shows a 3x3 block of color 3 at the bottom right area, centered at (6,8)? Let's re-examine.\n            *   Wait, looking at the test input's bottom right area:\n                Rows 5-7, Cols 7-9:\n                `0, 3, 0`\n                `3, 3, 3`\n                `0, 3, 0`\n                This looks like a plus shape or a partial block, but let's look closer. Actually, at (6,8) there isn't a full 3x3 block. Let's re-scan carefully.\n                *   Top-Left (2,2): Border 4, Center 2.\n                *   Top-Right (1,7): Border 2, Center 3. (Note: The shape is a cross `2` center `3` surrounded by `2`s at (0,7), (1,6), (1,8), (2,7). It's a \"plus\" shape rather than a full square, similar to the \"diamond\" shapes seen in other examples, effectively acting as blocks).\n                *   Bottom-Left (7,1): Border 7, Center 1.\n                *   Bottom-Middle (6,4): Border 1, Center 9.\n                *   Bottom-Right area: At (6,8), there is a structure. Center 3. Border 3? No, let's look at the \"matching\" hint.\n\n    Let's trace the chain based on the \"Matching Condition\": Inner Color of A == Border Color of B.\n\n    *   **Block A** (Top Left): Center = **2**. Border = 4.\n    *   **Block B** (Top Right): Border = **2**. Center = **3**.\n        *   Match found! Block A's center (2) matches Block B's border (2).\n        *   **Action:** Block A \"eats\" Block B. Block A stays. Block B disappears.\n        *   **Color Change:** Block A takes Block B's center color. Block A's new center = 3.\n\n    *   Now look for a match for Block B's center (3). Is there a block with Border 3?\n    *   **Block E** (Bottom Right area): Look at (6,8). The pixels are `3,3,3` in row 6 (cols 7-9), and `0,3,0` in row 5 and 7. Wait, the input has `3,3,3` at row 6, cols 7-9. And `0,3,0` at row 5 and 7?\n        *   Let's check the grid text:\n            Row 5: `... 0, 3, 0` -> No, Row 5 ends `5, 0, 3, 0`.\n            Row 6: `... 5, 3, 3, 3`.\n            Row 7: `... 5, 0, 3, 0`.\n            This forms a cross shape with center 3 and border 3. This is a block with Border 3, Center 3.\n        *   Match found! Block B's center (3) matches Block E's border (3).\n        *   **Action:** Block B (which was eaten) would have eaten Block E. Since the chain is usually A -> B -> C, and the survivor takes the color of the *ultimate* target in the chain or propagates down?\n        *   Let's re-read the \"Survivor\" hint: \"The survivor retains its original border but adopts the **Inner Color** of the block it just ate.\"\n        *   If A eats B, A gets B's center. If B was supposed to eat E, does A get E's center?\n        *   Let's look at Example 1:\n            *   Left Middle (border 5, center 4) -> Top Right (border 4, center 3) -> Bottom Right (border 3, center ?).\n            *   Wait, in Ex 1:\n                *   Block 1: Border 5, Center 4.\n                *   Block 2: Border 4, Center 2 (at 4,2).\n                *   Block 3: Border ? There is a block Border 5, Center 1 (at 5,8).\n            *   Let's follow the chain in Test Input specifically:\n                1.  **Block (Border 7, Center 1)** at Bottom Left.\n                2.  **Block (Border 1, Center 9)** at Bottom Middle.\n                    *   Match: Center 1 == Border 1.\n                    *   Outcome: Block (7,1) eats Block (1,9). Block (1,9) is removed. Block (7,1) changes center to 9.\n                3.  **Block (Border 4, Center 2)** at Top Left.\n                4.  **Block (Border 2, Center 3)** at Top Right.\n                    *   Match: Center 2 == Border 2.\n                    *   Outcome: Block (4,2) eats Block (2,3). Block (2,3) is removed. Block (4,2) changes center to 3.\n                5.  **Block (Border 3, Center 3)** at Bottom Right.\n                    *   Is there a block with Border 3? Yes, this one. Is there a block with Center 3? The Top Right one had center 3.\n                    *   If the Top Right block (Border 2, Center 3) eats the Bottom Right block (Border 3, Center 3), then the Top Right block would survive and become center 3.\n                    *   But the Top Right block is *eaten* by the Top Left block (Border 4, Center 2).\n                    *   Usually in these \"chain\" logic puzzles, the dominant predator at the top of the chain survives, and the attributes propagate or the specific \"eating\" happens sequentially.\n                    *   Logic: Top Left (4,2) eats Top Right (2,3). Top Right is gone. Top Left becomes (4,3).\n                    *   Does the Top Right (2,3) eat Bottom Right (3,3) *before* being eaten?\n                    *   If yes: Top Right becomes (2,3). Then Top Left eats it and becomes (4,3).\n                    *   If transitive: A eats B, B eats C -> A survives, C disappears, B disappears. A takes C's color?\n                    *   Let's look at the Grey Lines. The grey lines connect the blocks. The output removes connections to eaten blocks and connects the survivors.\n                    *   Test Input Chains:\n                        *   Chain 1: (Border 7, Center 1) -> (Border 1, Center 9).\n                            *   Survivor: Bottom Left. New Center: 9.\n                            *   Removed: Bottom Middle.\n                        *   Chain 2: (Border 4, Center 2) -> (Border 2, Center 3) -> (Border 3, Center 3).\n                            *   The grey path connects 4->2->3.\n                            *   Survivor: The head of the chain (Border 4).\n                            *   It eats the next, which eats the next.\n                            *   Final state: The head survives. All others in chain removed.\n                            *   Final Center Color: The center of the *last* block in the chain.\n                            *   Last block is Bottom Right (Border 3, Center 3). Center is 3.\n                            *   So Top Left becomes (Border 4, Center 3).\n\n2.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   **Survivor 1 (Bottom Left):** Original Border 7. New Center 9 (from the eaten block). Position: Center (7,1).\n        *   Pixels:\n            (6,0)-(6,2): `0, 7, 0`\n            (7,0)-(7,2): `7, 9, 7`\n            (8,0)-(8,2): `0, 7, 0`\n    *   **Survivor 2 (Top Left):** Original Border 4. New Center 3 (from the end of chain). Position: Center (2,2).\n        *   Pixels:\n            (1,1)-(1,3): `0, 4, 0`\n            (2,1)-(2,3): `4, 3, 4`\n            (3,1)-(3,3): `0, 4, 0`\n    *   **Removed Blocks:**\n        *   Top Right (Border 2).\n        *   Bottom Middle (Border 1).\n        *   Bottom Right (Border 3).\n    *   **Grey Paths (Color 5):**\n        *   The grey paths in the input connect all these blocks.\n        *   In the output, we only keep paths connecting the *survivors* if they were connected in a chain? No, usually surviving blocks are isolated if their partners are gone, or they connect to other survivors.\n        *   Looking at Example 3: Two separate chains. 1->4 and 2->7.\n            *   Input has paths connecting 1-4 and 2-7.\n            *   Output: The paths between the eater and the eaten are gone. The paths connecting the survivors? There are no paths left in Ex 3 output except unrelated ones? Actually, Ex 3 output has NO grey paths.\n        *   Looking at Example 2: 8->2->1 chain. 8 survives, becomes center 8. Wait.\n            *   Ex 2 Input: Bottom Left (8,3) -> Top Left (2,6) -> Top Right (3,2)? No.\n            *   Let's trace Ex 2 carefully:\n                *   (8,3) -> (5,?) No 5 block.\n                *   Let's check the grey lines. They direct the flow.\n                *   In the Test Input, there is a grey path from Top Left (4) to Top Right (2). Then from Top Right (2) down to Bottom Right (3).\n                *   There is a grey path from Bottom Left (7) to Bottom Middle (1).\n            *   Rule for Grey Lines: If the blocks are removed, the lines connecting them are removed. If a line connected two survivors, it stays. Here, the chains are collapsing. (A eats B, B eats C). A and C are connected indirectly. A survives. B and C are gone. A is the only one left in that chain.\n            *   So, **ALL** grey lines involved in the eating chains are removed.\n            *   Are there any other grey lines?\n            *   Input has `0,5,5` at bottom left. `5`s connecting the blocks.\n            *   Conclusion: Clear all grey paths connecting the removed blocks. Since the chains collapse to single points, no connections remain between blocks.\n            *   However, we must preserve the *surviving* blocks' geometry.\n\n    *   **Summary of Output Grid Construction:**\n        1.  Clear grid to 0.\n        2.  Draw Survivor 1 (Top Left) at (2,2): Border 4 (diamond shape), Center 3.\n        3.  Draw Survivor 2 (Bottom Left) at (7,1): Border 7 (diamond shape), Center 9.\n        4.  Verify empty spaces: The locations of eaten blocks (1,7), (6,4), (6,8) become 0.\n        5.  Verify grey lines: All grey lines in the input connected these chains. Since the chains result in single survivors, no paths are needed. (Like Ex 2 and 3).\n\n    **Double Check Colors/Positions:**\n    *   **Survivor A:** Centered at (2,2).\n        *   Row 1: `0, 0, 0, 0, ...` -> `0, 4, 0` at cols 1-3.\n        *   Row 2: `0, 4, 3, 4, ...` (Center changed from 2 to 3).\n        *   Row 3: `0, 0, 4, 0, ...`\n    *   **Survivor B:** Centered at (7,1).\n        *   Row 6: `0, 7, 0` at cols 0-2.\n        *   Row 7: `7, 9, 7` (Center changed from 1 to 9).\n        *   Row 8: `0, 7, 0`.\n\n    Wait, I need to confirm the \"Center 9\" for the bottom left.\n    Chain: Bottom Left (Border 7, Center 1) -> Bottom Middle (Border 1, Center 9).\n    End of chain is Center 9. So Survivor takes 9. Correct.\n\n    I need to confirm \"Center 3\" for top left.\n    Chain: Top Left (Border 4, Center 2) -> Top Right (Border 2, Center 3) -> Bottom Right (Border 3, Center 3).\n    End of chain is Center 3. So Survivor takes 3. Correct.\n\n    **Final Output Grid:**\n    10x10 grid.\n    Only two blocks remain.\n    All background 0.\n    All grey paths removed (as they connected eaten stuff).\n\noutput:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,4,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,9,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nWait, did I miss any \"static\" grey lines? In Ex 2, some grey lines remained?\nEx 2 Output: Has `0,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0` etc.\nAh, in Ex 2, there is a path `5` connecting the surviving `8` block to... wait.\nIn Ex 2 input, there are grey lines.\nIn Ex 2 output, the grey lines connecting the `8` block to the eaten blocks are gone?\nActually, in Ex 2 output, there are still grey lines: `0,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0` at row 3.\nThe surviving block is at (5,1) (Border 8, Center 2).\nThe grey lines in Ex 2 output seem to be the ones that were NOT part of the \"eating path\" or were re-routed?\nHint says: \"Grey paths are re-routed to connect only the surviving blocks.\"\nIn the test input, are the two survivors connected?\nInput grey lines:\n(2,2) connects to (1,7) via (2,4)-(2,6)? No, path goes `4,0,0,0,2`.\nLet's trace the grey path in Input:\n(2,2) is Top Left.\n(1,7) is Top Right.\nPath from TL to TR: (2,3) is 4. (2,4) is 0. (1,3) is 0.\nRow 1: `...0,0,0,2...`\nRow 2: `...2,4,0,0,0,2...`\nRow 3: `...4,0,0,0,0,5...`\nActually, look at Row 3, Col 7. `5`.\nThere is a 5 at (3,7).\nIt connects to the Top Right block (Border 2).\nAnd to the Bottom Right block (Border 3).\nThere is a 5 path between Top Left and Top Right?\nRow 5: `0,0,0,0,1,0,5,0,3,0`. (1 is border of BM).\nThe grey `5`s are sparse.\nLet's look at the \"re-routed\" hint.\nIf there is a path between Chain A and Chain B survivors?\nIn Test Input, is there a connection between the Top Left chain and Bottom Left chain?\nTop chain: TL -> TR -> BR.\nBottom chain: BL -> BM.\nAre they connected?\nRow 6, Col 4 is `1` (BM Border).\nRow 5, Col 4 is `1`? No, Row 5 is `0`.\nThere is a `1` at (5,4).\nIs there a grey path between them?\n(5,4) is `1`. (5,6) is `5`.\n(6,6) is `5`.\n(7,6) is `5`.\n(8,3) is `5`.\n(8,5) is `5`.\n(9,1) is `5`.\nIt seems the grey pixels form a network.\nIf the survivors are Top Left and Bottom Left.\nAre they connected in the output?\nIn Ex 1, all grey lines vanished.\nIn Ex 3, all grey lines vanished.\nIn Ex 2, grey lines remained. Why?\nIn Ex 2, the survivors were... wait. Ex 2 had only ONE survivor?\nEx 2 Input: (4,0) Border 8. (0,0) Border 2. (0,6) Border 3.\nChain: 8 -> ?\n(4,0) is 8,8,8... center 3.\n(0,0) is 2,2,2... center 6.\n(0,6) is 3,3,3... center 2.\nChain: 8(3) -> 3(2) -> 2(6).\nWait, 8(3) matches border 3 of Top Right. Top Right(2) matches border 2 of Top Left.\nSo 8 eats 3. 3 eats 2.\nSurvivor is 8. New center is 2 (from the end of chain).\nOutput shows Block 8 at (4,0) with center 2.\nAnd there are grey lines `5` remaining in the output.\nThe grey lines in Ex 2 output connect the survivor to... nowhere? They just exist.\nLet's look at the Hint: \"Grey paths are re-routed to connect only the surviving blocks.\"\nIn Test Input, we have TWO survivors.\nIf they were connected in the input (indirectly), they should be connected in the output.\nTop Left (4,2) and Bottom Left (7,1).\nAre they connected by grey in the input?\nThere are no grey pixels directly between them on the left side.\nThe grey pixels are mostly on the right and bottom.\nThe Top Left connects to Top Right via 5s? No, there are no 5s between TL and TR. Just empty space `0`.\nWait, if there are no 5s, how are they connected?\nMaybe adjacency?\nLet's check Test Input Row 3: `0,0,4,0,0,0,0,5,0,0`.\nRow 5: `...0,0,5,0,0,0`.\nIt seems the grey network connects the \"eaten\" blocks to each other or to the survivors.\nIf the path was 4 -> 2 -> 3, and 7 -> 1.\nThere is no path between 4 and 7.\nSo in the output, there should be no path connecting them.\nSo the output should just be the two survivor blocks.\nWhat about the `5`s in Ex 2?\nThe path in Ex 2 output goes from the survivor (8) to the right.\nIt looks like it traces the path to where the eaten blocks *were*, or just stays?\nActually, looking at Ex 2 output:\nThe path `5,0,5,5,5,5,0` etc is preserved/modified.\nHowever, in Ex 1 and 3, they are gone.\nThe safest bet for this specific test input, given the distinct separation of the two events and no obvious grey connection between the two survivors in the input (left side is clear of 5s), is that the grey lines disappear or are not drawn between these two specific blocks.\n\nOne specific detail:\nTest Input Row 9: `0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0`.\nRow 8: `0,7,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0`.\nThe survivor is at (7,1) (rows 6-8).\nThere are 5s adjacent to it.\nShould they stay?\nIn Ex 3, survivor at (1,1) had 5s nearby in input?\nEx 3 Input: `0,5,0...` at row 3. Survivor at (0,0)-(2,2).\nOutput: No 5s.\nIn Ex 1: Survivor at (1,2). Grey lines in input connected it. Output: No grey lines.\nThis suggests that unless the grey lines connect *two* survivors, they are removed.\nSince survivor 1 and survivor 2 are not connected by grey lines in the input (TL and BL are separated by 0s), no grey lines should remain.\n\nThe plan:\n1.  Top Left Block (Border 4): Becomes Center 3.\n2.  Bottom Left Block (Border 7): Becomes Center 9.\n3.  Everything else 0.\n\nWait, looking closer at Ex 2.\nSurvivor 8 connects to... nothing in the output?\nThe grey lines in Ex 2 Output are `0,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0`.\nThis corresponds to the input grey lines at that location.\nMaybe the rule is: Keep grey lines that don't touch the eaten blocks?\nOr \"Re-route to connect only surviving blocks\".\nIf there's only one survivor, maybe the lines are valid if they connect to the edge?\nBut in Ex 1 and 3, there are multiple survivors?\nEx 1: Input has multiple blocks. Output has... Wait, Ex 1 Output has 3 blocks!\nEx 1 Input:\n(1,2) Border 5, Center 4.\n(1,8) Border 3, Center 4.\n(5,2) Border 4, Center 2. (Center 4,2 -> Border 4. Match!)\n(5,7) Border 6, Center 6.\n(8,2) Border 1, Center 1.\n(Let's check matches in Ex 1)\nBlock (5,2) [Border 4, Center 2].\nBlock (1,2) [Border 5, Center 4]. Center 4 matches Border 4 of (5,2).\nSo (1,2) eats (5,2). (1,2) becomes Center 2.\nCheck Output Ex 1:\n(1,2) is Border 5, Center 2. Correct.\n(5,2) is gone.\nBlock (5,7) [Border 6, Center 1].\nBlock (8,2) [Border 1, Center 3].\nBlock (1,8) [Border 3, Center ?] Center 4.\nChain: (8,2) [Border 1, Center 3] -> (1,8) [Border 3, Center 4]. Match!\nSo (8,2) eats (1,8). (8,2) becomes Center 4.\nWait, (8,2) is gone in Output?\nOutput shows:\n(1,2) Border 5, Center 2.\n(1,8) Border 3, Center 2? No, (1,8) is `3,2,3`. Center 2.\n(5,7) Border 6, Center 3?\nLet's re-evaluate Ex 1 chains.\nA: (1,2) Border 5, Center 4.\nB: (5,2) Border 4, Center 2.\nC: (1,8) Border 3, Center 4.\nD: (5,7) Border 6, Center 1.\nE: (8,2) Border 1, Center 3.\nMatches:\nA(4) matches B(4). A eats B. A -> 2.\nC(4) matches B(4). C eats B? No, B is eaten by A.\nDoes C(4) match A(5)? No.\nDoes B(2) match anything? B's center 2. No border 2s.\nDoes D(1) match E(1). D eats E. D -> 3.\nDoes E(3) match C(3). E eats C. E -> 4.\nChain: D(1) -> E(1) -> C(3) -> B? No.\nChain D(1) eats E(Border 1). E removed. D takes E's center (3).\nD is now Center 3. D is at (5,7).\nCheck Output: (5,7) is Border 6, Center 3. Correct.\nChain E(3) eats C(Border 3). E removed. E takes C's center (4).\nSince D ate E, D takes the result of E?\nIf D eats E, and E eats C.\nD survives. E and C removed.\nD takes C's color (4)?\nBut Output D is Center 3.\nThis implies D ate E, and E *didn't* eat C? Or E's center was 3 when eaten?\nInput E center is 3.\nSo D eats E, gets 3.\nWhat happens to C?\nInput C is Border 3, Center 4.\nOutput C is Border 3, Center 2.\nWhere did 2 come from?\nMaybe A(4) eats B(Border 4). A gets 2.\nMaybe C(4) eats B(Border 4). C gets 2.\nBoth A and C eat B.\nB is eaten by both.\nBoth A and C survive. Both get B's center (2).\nCheck Output:\nA (Top Left) is Center 2. Correct.\nC (Top Right) is Center 2. Correct.\nD (Bottom Right) is Center 3. Correct.\nB and E are gone.\nGrey lines:\nIn Ex 1 input, grey lines connect A-B, C-B, D-E.\nIn Ex 1 output, NO grey lines.\nReason: All connections were \"eating\" connections. No lines between survivors.\n\nEx 2 again:\nChain: 8 -> 3 -> 2.\n8 eats 3. 3 eats 2.\n8 survives. 3 and 2 gone.\n8 takes 2's center (6? No, 2's center in Ex 2 is 6. Wait.\nEx 2 Input:\n(4,0) Border 8, Center 3.\n(1,6) Border 3, Center 2.\n(1,0) Border 2, Center 6.\nChain:\n8(3) -> 3(2) -> 2(6).\nSurvivor 8 takes center 6?\nOutput 8 has center 2.\nWait.\nInput 3 block is at (1,6). Center is 2.\nInput 2 block is at (1,0). Center is 6.\nChain: 8(3) matches Border 3.\nBlock 3(2) matches Border 2.\nBlock 2(6) matches... nothing.\nSo 8 eats 3. 3 eats 2.\nResult: 8 survives.\nColor: The survivor takes the color of the *next* block? Or the end?\nIf 8 takes 2, it should be 6.\nIf 8 takes 3's center, it should be 2.\nOutput is 2.\nSo A eats B. A takes B's center.\nB eats C. B takes C's center.\nIf A eats B, does A take B's *original* center or B's *new* center?\nIf simultaneous: A sees B's original center.\nSo 8 sees 3's center (2). 8 becomes 2.\n3 sees 2's center (6). 3 becomes 6 (but is eaten).\nSo 8 becomes 2. Correct.\nThis explains Ex 1 too.\nA(4) eats B(4,2). A gets 2.\nC(4) eats B(4,2). C gets 2.\nD(1) eats E(1,3). D gets 3.\nAll consistent.\nRule: Survivor takes the *original* inner color of the victim.\nGrey lines in Ex 2 Output:\nWhy do they exist?\nInput has paths between 2-3-8.\nOutput keeps paths?\nActually, the grey path in Ex 2 output is `0,0,0,5,0,5...`\nThis is row 3.\nIn input, row 3 is `0,0,0,5,0,5...`\nRow 4 is `8,8,8...`\nThe grey lines that are preserved are those NOT connecting the eating pair?\nOr maybe the \"network\" is preserved?\nBut in Ex 1, the network was removed.\nDifference: In Ex 1, the network connected A to B and C to B. Since B is gone, the paths to B are removed?\nIn Ex 2, the network connects 2, 3, 8.\n2 and 3 are gone. Path to them should be removed.\nMaybe the remaining grey pixels are just fragments that didn't connect to the removed blocks directly?\nLet's check the Test Input.\nWe established the survivors are Top Left and Bottom Left.\nAre there grey lines that do *not* connect to the eaten blocks?\nMost lines in the test input connect to the eaten blocks (Border 2, Border 1, Border 3).\nThe lines around the survivors?\nIn Ex 1, lines around A (survivor) were removed.\nSo, I will assume all grey lines are removed for the Test Input as well, as they are all part of the \"eating\" network.\n\n**Final Plan for Test Input:**\n1.  **Survivor 1:** Top Left (Border 4). Original Center 2. Target (Border 2, Center 3). New Center 3.\n    *   Coords: (2,2). Shape: Diamond 4. Center 3.\n2.  **Survivor 2:** Bottom Left (Border 7). Original Center 1.

(7,2) is 7.\n(8,1) is 7.\nIt's a diamond.\n\nOutput matches these shapes with new centers.\n\nFinal check of the \"Chain\" in Test Input.\nTL(4,2) -> TR(2,3) -> BR(3,3).\nTL eats TR. TL gets 3.\nTR eats BR. TR gets 3.\nBR eats... nothing.\nTL survives. TL gets 3. Correct.\nBL(7,1) -> BM(1,9).\nBL eats BM. BL gets 9.\nBM eats... nothing.\nBL survives. BL gets 9. Correct.\n\nResulting Grid:\nRows 0-9.\nRow 0: All 0.\nRow 1: `0,0,4,0...`\nRow 2: `0,4,3,4...`\nRow 3: `0,0,4,0...`\nRow 4, 5: All 0.\nRow 6: `0,7,0...`\nRow 7: `7,9,7...`\nRow 8: `0,7,0...`\nRow 9: All 0.\n\nWait, looking at Row 1 of test input.\n`0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0` -> Top Right top pixel.\n`0,0,4,0,0,0,2,3,2,0` -> Row 1.\nMy Survivor 1 is at (2,2).

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analyzing the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to tackle an ARC problem, and they've given me three example grids and a test grid. My first instinct, as always with these problems, is to dive into the data and start looking for patterns. The hints mentioning \"blocks\" is a good starting point. That suggests I should be looking for groupings of connected pixels. Maybe it's about identifying blocks, counting them, their shapes, sizes, colors, or how they're arranged in relation to each other. I'll need to carefully examine each example and the test input to see if I can spot any clear relationships or rules governing how the grid is transformed. Let's see what these examples reveal.\n\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of the logic derived from the examples and hints, followed by the solution for the test input.\n\n### Reasoning\n\n1.  **Identify Objects (Blocks):**\n    The input grids consist of several distinct 3x3 square blocks. Each block has a specific structure: an \"Outer Border Color\" (the ring of 8 pixels) and an \"Inner Color\" (the single center pixel). There are also grey (color 5) pixels forming lines or paths between these blocks.\n\n2.  **Determine Relationships (Matching Pairs):**\n    The core rule provided in the hints is: \"Match pairs of blocks where the **Inner Color** of the first block equals the **Outer Border Color** of the second block.\"\n    *   Let's denote a block as $B(Outer, Inner)$.\n    *   A pair exists if $Inner(Block A) = Outer(Block B)$.\n    *   In this relationship, Block A is the \"Eater\" and Block B is the \"Eaten\".\n\n3.  **Apply Transformation Rules:**\n    *   **Survival:** The \"Eater\" block survives. The \"Eaten\" block is removed (turned into background/black).\n    *   **Color Swap:** The surviving \"Eater\" block changes its *center pixel* (Inner Color) to match the *center pixel* (Inner Color) of the block it just ate.\n    *   **Grey Paths:** The grey pixels (color 5) act as connectors. In the output, the grey paths are modified to connect *only* the surviving blocks, removing segments that led to eaten blocks.\n\n4.  **Analyze Test Input:**\n\n    **Step 4a: Identify Blocks**\n    Let's locate the 3x3 blocks in the test input:\n    *   **Top Left:** A diamond shape of 4s surrounding a 2. Actually, looking closely, it's a cross shape. Let's look for standard 3x3 squares or similar entities.\n        *   Row 1-3, Col 2-4: Border 0/4 mix? No, looking at the grid:\n            `0,0,4,0`\n            `0,4,2,4`\n            `0,0,4,0`\n            This is a 3x3 area. Center is **2**. Border is **4** (diamond shape). Let's call this Block 1: $B_1(4, 2)$. Note: The borders in the examples are usually full squares, but here the 'border' concept seems to apply to the dominant color surrounding the center. The hint says \"Outer Border Color\". In this specific shape, the non-zero color surrounding the center is 4.\n    *   **Top Right:**\n        `0,2,0`\n        `2,3,2`\n        `0,2,0`\n        Center is **3**. Border color is **2**. Let's call this Block 2: $B_2(2, 3)$.\n    *   **Bottom Left:**\n        `0,7,0`\n        `7,1,7`\n        `0,7,0`\n        Center is **1**. Border color is **7**. Let's call this Block 3: $B_3(7, 1)$.\n    *   **Center/Bottom:**\n        `0,1,0`\n        `1,9,1`\n        `0,1,0`\n        Center is **9**. Border color is **1**. Let's call this Block 4: $B_4(1, 9)$.\n    *   **Bottom Right:**\n        `0,3,0`\n        `3,3,3`\n        `0,3,0`\n        Center is **3** (or border is 3?). Wait, looking at row 6-8, cols 8-10.\n        `0,3,0` -> row 6\n        `3,3,3` -> row 7\n        `0,3,0` -> row 8 (implied).\n        Actually looking at the grid:\n        Row 6: ... `0,3,0`\n        Row 7: ... `3,3,3`\n        Row 8: ... `0,3,0`\n        Wait, row 8 is `0,5,0,5...` in the big grid. Let's re-read the test input grid carefully.\n\n        **Grid Parsing:**\n        R0: `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0`\n        R1: `0,0,4,0,0,0,2,3,2,0` (Block Top Right: Center 3, Border 2)\n        R2: `0,4,2,4,0,0,0,2,0,0` (Block Top Left: Center 2, Border 4)\n        R3: `0,0,4,0,0,0,0,5,0,0`\n        R4: `0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0`\n        R5: `0,0,0,0,1,0,5,0,3,0`\n        R6: `0,7,0,1,9,1,5,3,3,3` (Block Mid: Center 9, Border 1) (Block Right: Center 3, Border 3?? No, look at shape)\n        R7: `7,1,7,0,1,0,5,0,3,0` (Block Left: Center 1, Border 7)\n        R8: `0,7,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0`\n        R9: `0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0`\n\n    **Refined Block Identification:**\n    1.  **Top Left (TL):** Center (2,2) is `2`. Neighbors are `4`. Block $B_1(4, 2)$.\n    2.  **Top Right (TR):** Center (1,7) is `3`. Neighbors are `2`. Block $B_2(2, 3)$.\n    3.  **Bottom Left (BL):** Center (7,1) is `1`. Neighbors are `7`. Block $B_3(7, 1)$.\n    4.  **Center (Mid):** Center (6,4) is `9`. Neighbors are `1`. Block $B_4(1, 9)$.\n    5.  **Right (R):** Center (6,8) is `3`. Neighbors are `3`?\n        Look at R5, R6, R7, Cols 7-9:\n        R5: `0,3,0`\n        R6: `3,3,3`\n        R7: `0,3,0`\n        This is a cross shape. Center is 3. Border is 3. Block $B_5(3, 3)$.\n\n    **Step 4b: Find Pairs**\n    Rule: Eater's Inner == Eaten's Outer.\n\n    *   $B_1$ Inner=2. Matches $B_2$ Outer=2.\n        *   Pair 1: $B_1$ eats $B_2$.\n        *   Result: $B_1$ survives, $B_2$ removed.\n        *   $B_1$ new inner = $B_2$ old inner = 3.\n        *   $B_1$ becomes $(4, 3)$.\n\n    *   $B_4$ Inner=9. Does any block have Outer=9? No.\n    *   $B_3$ Inner=1. Matches $B_4$ Outer=1.\n        *   Pair 2: $B_3$ eats $B_4$.\n        *   Result: $B_3$ survives, $B_4$ removed.\n        *   $B_3$ new inner = $B_4$ old inner = 9.\n        *   $B_3$ becomes $(7, 9)$.\n\n    *   $B_5$ Inner=3. Does any block have Outer=3? No. (B5 itself has outer 3, but self-cannibalism isn't the pattern).\n    *   $B_2$ Inner=3. Matches $B_5$ Outer=3.\n        *   Pair 3: $B_2$ eats $B_5$.\n        *   Wait, $B_2$ was already eaten by $B_1$.\n        *   Let's check the dependency chain. $B_1$ eats $B_2$. $B_2$ eats $B_5$.\n        *   Typically in ARC, this implies a chain or hierarchy. If $B_2$ is eaten, it disappears. Does it get to eat $B_5$ first?\n        *   Let's look at the survivors. In Example 1, a chain exists: Center Top (Inner 4) -> Top Left (Outer 4, Inner 2) -> Center Left (Outer 2?? No).\n        *   Let's re-evaluate \"Eater survives\".\n        *   Chain: $B_1 \\xrightarrow{eats} B_2 \\xrightarrow{eats} B_5$.\n        *   If $B_1$ eats $B_2$, $B_2$ is gone. $B_5$ remains alone? Or does the property transfer?\n        *   Hint says: \"first block (the eater) survives, and the second block (the eaten) is removed.\"\n        *   If $B_2$ is removed, it can't be an eater? Or is it simply that $B_1$ targets $B_2$ and $B_2$ targets $B_5$, and we resolve valid pairs?\n        *   Let's look at Example 1:\n            - Block A (Top Right): Outer 3, Inner 4.\n            - Block B (Bottom Right): Outer 6, Inner 1.\n            - Block C (Bottom Mid/Left?): Outer 4, Inner 2.\n            - Block D (Top Mid): Outer 5, Inner 4.\n            - Block E (Bottom Left): Outer 1, Inner 3.\n            Matches:\n            - A(Inner 4) matches C(Outer 4). A eats C. Result A survives, Inner becomes 2. C removed.\n            - D(Inner 4) matches C(Outer 4). D eats C.\n            - E(Inner 3) matches A(Outer 3). E eats A. Result E survives, Inner becomes 4.\n            Wait, Example 1 output:\n            - Top Right survived. Inner became 2. (Originally Inner 4). It ate C (Inner 2).\n            - Bottom Right survived. Inner became 3. (Originally Inner 1). It ate E (Inner 3, Outer 1).\n            - Bottom Left (E) was removed? Wait. Bottom Right (Outer 6, Inner 1). Match E (Outer 1). So BR eats BL.\n            - Top Mid (D) survived? No, removed.\n            - Top Left? No blocks there.\n            - Let's re-map Example 1 specifically.\n            - Survivors: Top Right (Outer 3), Bottom Right (Outer 6).\n            - Removed: Top Mid (Outer 5), Bottom Left (Outer 1), Center Left (Outer 4).\n            - Relationships:\n                1. TR(3,4) matches CL(4,2). TR eats CL. New TR is (3,2). Correct.\n                2. BR(6,1) matches BL(1,3). BR eats BL. New BR is (6,3). Correct.\n            - What about Top Mid (5,4)? It matches CL(4,2) too. Why did TR win?\n            - Or did CL eat TM? CL is (4,2). TM is (5,4). No match.\n            - Did TM eat anyone? TM(Inner 4) matches CL(Outer 4).\n            - So both TR and TM wanted to eat CL. TR won. Why?\n            - Maybe connectivity? The grey lines connect TR to CL. Grey lines connect BR to BL.\n            - TM is isolated? No, there are lines.\n            - Let's check test input connectivity.\n                - $B_1$ connected to $B_2$? Yes, via grey lines? No, distinct lack of grey lines between $B_1$ and $B_2$ in Test Input?\n                - Wait, look at the grey lines (5s) in Test Input.\n                - R3C7 `5` connects to nothing?\n                - R4C6 `5`.\n                - R5C4 `1` (part of block?), R5C6 `5`.\n                - R8C3 `5`, R8C5 `5`, R9C1 `5`...\n                - Actually, the grey lines in the Test Input connect $B_3$ (BL) and $B_4$ (Mid). Also $B_4$ and $B_5$ (Right) seem connected by 5s.\n                - $B_1$ (TL) and $B_2$ (TR) don't seem connected by 5s. Wait, R3C7 is a 5? No, R3C7 is 5 in Ex 2. In Test Input:\n                  R3: `0,0,4,0,0,0,0,5,0,0` -> There is a 5 at (3,7).\n                  R4: `...5...` at (4,6).\n                  R5: `...5...` at (5,6).\n                  These connect the top area to the bottom/right area.\n            - Let's reconsider the logic based simply on the \"Chain\" idea without connectivity first, as ARC rules are usually local or global logic, not path-dependent unless specified.\n            - Chain: $B_1(4,2) \\to B_2(2,3) \\to B_5(3,3)$.\n              $B_1$ eats $B_2$. $B_2$ is eaten. $B_5$ survives?\n              Or $B_2$ eats $B_5$ before being eaten?\n              In Example 3:\n              - Top Left (1,2) eats Top Right (4,3)? No TL is (1,2). TR is (4,3). No match.\n              - TL(1,2) matches Bot Left(2,9). TL eats BL. TL becomes (1,9). BL removed.\n              - Bot Right (7,4) matches TR(4,3). BR eats TR. BR becomes (7,3). TR removed.\n              - Mid (3,6) matches Bot Right's old inner (4)? No.\n              - Mid (3,6) matches ...?\n              - Let's re-read Example 3 Input:\n                TL: Outer 1, Inner 2.\n                TR: Outer 4, Inner 3.\n                Mid: Outer 3, Inner 6.\n                BL: Outer 2, Inner 9.\n                BR: Outer 7, Inner 4.\n              - Matches:\n                TL(2) -> BL(Outer 2). TL eats BL. New TL=(1,9). Correct (Output shows TL with inner 9).\n                TR(3) -> Mid(Outer 3). TR eats Mid?\n                Mid(6) -> ?\n                BR(4) -> TR(Outer 4). BR eats TR. New BR=(7,3). Correct (Output shows BR with inner 3).\n                BL(9) -> ?\n              - Conflict: TR wants to eat Mid. BR wants to eat TR.\n              - Result: BR survives (eats TR). TR is removed. Mid survives?\n              - Looking at Example 3 Output:\n                TL is present (1,9).\n                Mid is present! (Outer 3... wait, Inner is still 6? No, Inner is 5?).\n                Let's look at Ex 3 Output Mid block:\n                `0,0,5,0,0`\n                `0,5,0,5,0`\n                `0,0,5,0,0`\n                That's not the Mid block. The Mid block was `0,5,0,5,3,3,3...`.\n                In output, the Mid block (Outer 3) is GONE.\n                Re-check Ex 3 Output:\n                Rows 3-6 contain 5s.\n                Row 3: `0,5,0,0,5...`\n                Row 4: `0,5,0,5,0...`\n                Row 5: `0,0,5,0,0...`\n                The block with 3s (Mid) is completely gone.\n                The block with 4s (TR) is completely gone.\n                The block with 2s (BL) is completely gone.\n                Survivors: TL (1,9) and BR (7,3).\n                And the grey 5s remain/reconnect.\n              - Chain Logic:\n                BR eats TR.\n                TR eats Mid.\n                Does BR eating TR prevent TR from eating Mid?\n                Outcome: TR is gone. Mid is gone.\n                This implies that the \"eating\" is transitive or simultaneous.\n                If BR eats TR, BR takes TR's inner (3).\n                Since TR was an eater of Mid, maybe BR inherits the \"prey\"?\n                New BR inner is 3. 3 Matches Mid(Outer 3).\n                So BR (now 3) eats Mid?\n                Result: BR survives, eats TR, then eats Mid. Final inner = Mid's inner (6)?\n                Output BR inner is 3. So it didn't eat Mid.\n                Why is Mid gone?\n                Maybe TR *did* eat Mid, but was then eaten by BR?\n                If TR eats Mid, TR survives (with inner 6). Then BR eats TR? BR would get inner 6.\n                Output is 3.\n                This suggests: **Eaters survive. Eaten blocks die. Blocks that are eaten are removed.**\n                Why is Mid removed?\n                TR(Inner 3) matches Mid(Outer 3). So TR eats Mid.\n                BR(Inner 4) matches TR(Outer 4). So BR eats TR.\n                So TR is both Eater and Eaten.\n                In this scenario (A eats B, B eats C), A survives, B is removed, C is removed.\n                Why? If B is removed, it can't sustain itself. If C is eaten by B, it is removed.\n                Essentially, any block that is on the \"Eaten\" side of a valid pair is removed.\n                Any block that is strictly an \"Eater\" survives.\n                Survivors update their color based on their *immediate* victim.\n                BR eats TR (Inner 3). BR becomes (7,3).\n                TR eats Mid. Mid is removed.\n                TR is removed (eaten by BR).\n                TL eats BL. TL becomes (1,9). BL removed.\n                This fits Example 3 perfectly.\n\n    **Step 4c: Apply to Test Input**\n    Blocks:\n    $B_1$ (TL): Outer 4, Inner 2.\n    $B_2$ (TR): Outer 2, Inner 3.\n    $B_3$ (BL): Outer 7, Inner 1.\n    $B_4$ (Mid): Outer 1, Inner 9.\n    $B_5$ (Right): Outer 3, Inner 3.\n\n    Pairs:\n    1. $B_1$(Inner 2) matches $B_2$(Outer 2). $B_1$ eats $B_2$.\n    2. $B_2$(Inner 3) matches $B_5$(Outer 3). $B_2$ eats $B_5$.\n    3. $B_3$(Inner 1) matches $B_4$(Outer 1). $B_3$ eats $B_4$.\n\n    Chains:\n    - Chain 1: $B_1 \\to B_2 \\to B_5$.\n      - $B_1$ is purely Eater. Survives.\n      - $B_2$ is Eaten (by $B_1$) and Eater (of $B_5$). Removed.\n      - $B_5$ is Eaten (by $B_2$). Removed.\n      - $B_1$ updates Inner to $B_2$'s original Inner: 3.\n      - Final $B_1$: Outer 4, Inner 3.\n\n    - Chain 2: $B_3 \\to B_4$.\n      - $B_3$ is purely Eater. Survives.\n      - $B_4$ is Eaten. Removed.\n      - $B_3$ updates Inner to $B_4$'s original Inner: 9.\n      - Final $B_3$: Outer 7, Inner 9.\n\n    **Step 4d: Grey Path Routing**\n    - The grey pixels (5) form paths.\n    - Survivors: $B_1$ (Top Left) and $B_3$ (Bottom Left).\n    - We need to keep/draw paths connecting the survivors.\n    - In Example 3, the path connecting TL and BR was kept/modified. The paths to the dead blocks were pruned.\n    - Test Input connectivity:\n      - Is there a path between $B_1$ and $B_3$?\n      - Looking at the grid:\n        $B_1$ is at top left.\n        $B_3$ is at bottom left.\n        There are 0s between them in column 1-3.\n        However, there are grey pixels (5).\n        Input R8/R9 has `0,5,5,0,5...`.\n        Input R3/R4/R5 has `...5...`.\n        Let's map the '5's in the input:\n        (3,7), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (8,3), (8,5), (9,1), (9,2), (9,4).\n        It looks like a network.\n        We need to retain the path connecting the two survivors ($B_1$ and $B_3$) if one exists?\n        Or does the transformation just keep 5s that are adjacent to survivors and connect them?\n        In Ex 3, the surviving TL and BR are connected by a chain of 5s.\n        In Ex 2, TR and BotRight? No.\n        Let's look at Ex 1. Survivors TR and BR. Path connects them.\n        In the Test Input, $B_1$ is at R0-R2. $B_3$ is at R6-R8 (Left).\n        The 5s seem to cluster around the eaten blocks too.\n        Simple heuristic from examples:\n        \"Grey paths are re-routed to connect only the surviving blocks.\"\n        This usually means the shortest path of 5s between the survivors is kept, or the existing graph of 5s is pruned of dead ends leading to removed blocks.\n        Given $B_1$ (TL) and $B_3$ (BL) are on the left side.\n        Are there 5s connecting them?\n        R9C1, R9C2 are 5s. R8C3 is 5. R8C5 is 5.\n        $B_3$ is roughly R6-R8 C0-C2.\n        $B_1$ is R0-R2 C1-C3.\n        There are no 5s directly between them in the input (Col 0-3 rows 3-5 are 0s).\n        Wait, R3: `0,0,4...`\n        R4: `0,0,0...`\n        R5: `0,0,0,0,1...`\n        There is no direct grey connection between $B_1$ and $B_3$ in the input?\n        If they aren't connected, maybe no grey lines remain?\n        Let's re-examine the hints. \"Grey paths are re-routed to connect only the surviving blocks.\"\n        This implies a connection *will* exist.\n        Let's look at the 5s in Test Input again.\n        (3,7), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6). Vertical line.\n        (5,4), (8,3), (8,5).\n        (9,1), (9,2), (9,4).\n        This looks like a path from Bottom Left ($B_3$ vicinity) -> Rightwards -> Upwards -> Top Right ($B_2$ vicinity).\n        $B_2$ is eaten.\n        $B_1$ is isolated from 5s?\n        Let's look at $B_1$: `0,0,4,0 / 0,4,2,4 / 0,0,4,0`.\n        Surrounding pixels: (0,0-4), (1,0-1,5), (2,0,4-5), (3,0-3).\n        (3,7) is the closest 5. That's far.\n        Wait, let me double check specific pixels.\n        R3 C7 is 5.\n        $B_1$ ends at C3.\n        Is it possible $B_1$ is not the survivor?\n        $B_1(4,2) \\to B_2(2,3)$. $B_1$ eats $B_2$.\n        Unless... $B_2$ eats $B_1$?\n        $B_2$ Inner 3. $B_1$ Outer 4. No.\n        $B_1$ Inner 2. $B_2$ Outer 2. Yes.\n        So $B_1$ definitely eats $B_2$.\n        Is there another block?\n        Maybe the single '1' at R5C4 is a tiny block? No, blocks are 3x3.\n        Maybe I'm missing a connection.\n        If $B_1$ is isolated, maybe the grey path rule implies removing all grey paths because they connected the *eaten* blocks ($B_2, B_4, B_5$) to each other or to $B_3$?\n        $B_3$ is close to 5s at R8C3, R9C1, etc.\n        $B_4$ is close to 5s.\n        $B_2$ is close to 5s.\n        $B_1$ is NOT close to 5s.\n        If $B_1$ and $B_3$ survive, and $B_1$ has no connection to the network, maybe the network disappears?\n        Or maybe the network just stays attached to $B_3$?\n        \"Connect *only* the surviving blocks\".\n        If they can't be connected (disjoint components), maybe clear the path?\n        In Ex 2: Survivors are Top Left (Wait, Ex 2 output has empty top left).\n        Let's check Ex 2.\n        Input blocks:\n        TL: 2s. Inner 6. Outer 2.\n        TR: 3s. Inner 2. Outer 3.\n        Mid: 5s. Inner ? Wait, Mid is just 5s. `0,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0`.\n        Actually Ex 2 has:\n        TL Block (2s, inner 6).\n        TR Block (3s, inner 2).\n        BL Block (8s, inner 3).\n        BR Block (1s, inner 4).\n        Chain:\n        TL(6) - no match.\n        TR(2) matches TL(Outer 2). TR eats TL. New TR(3,6).\n        BL(3) matches TR(Outer 3). BL eats TR. New BL(8,2).\n        BR(4) - no match.\n        Matches:\n        TR -> TL.\n        BL -> TR.\n        So BL eats TR, TR eats TL.\n        Survivors: BL (eats TR). TR is removed. TL is removed.\n        BR? BR(Outer 1, Inner 4). No one eats BR. BR eats no one? (No Outer 4).\n        So BR survives as is?\n        Output Ex 2:\n        BL survives (Inner becomes 2). Correct.\n        BR survives (Inner becomes 8). Wait.\n        Original BR: Outer 1, Inner 4.\n        Output BR: Outer 1, Inner 8.\n        Where did 8 come from?\n        BL Outer is 8.\n        So BR eats BL?\n        BR(Inner 4). BL(Outer 8). No match.\n        Wait, look at Ex 2 Input BR again.\n        R5: `8,3,8... 1,4,1`.\n        R6: `... 1,1,1`.\n        R7: `...`.\n        BR Center is 4. Border is 1.\n        BL Center is 3.

Border 4.\n        Let's re-evaluate Ex 2 chains.\n        Blocks:\n        1. TL(2,6)\n        2. TR(3,2)\n        3. BL(8,3)\n        4. BR(1,4)\n        5. BC(4,8) (Bottom Center)\n\n        Pairs:\n        TR(2) -> TL(2). TR eats TL.\n        BL(3) -> TR(3). BL eats TR.\n        BR(4) -> BC(4). BR eats BC.\n        BC(8) -> BL(8). BC eats BL.\n\n        Cycle/Chain:\n        Chain A: BL -> TR -> TL.\n        Chain B: BR -> BC -> BL.\n        Combined: BR -> BC -> BL -> TR -> TL.\n        Eater at top of food chain: BR.\n        BR eats BC. BC is removed.\n        BC *would have* eaten BL.\n        BL *would have* eaten TR.\n        TR *would have* eaten TL.\n        Transitivity rule:\n        If A eats B, A survives and takes B's inner.\n        Does A take the result of B's eating?\n        Output Ex 2:\n        Survivors: BL and BR.\n        BL is at R4-6 Left. Inner became 2.\n        BR is at R4-6 Right. Inner became 8.\n        TL, TR, BC are gone.\n        Wait, in Output, BL is there. BR is there.\n        Why did BL survive if BC eats BL?\n        And BR eats BC.\n        Maybe \"A eats B\" prevents \"B eats C\"?\n        If BR eats BC, BC is dead. BC cannot eat BL.\n        So BL survives.\n        BL eats TR. TR is dead. TR cannot eat TL.\n        So TL survives?\n        Output says TL is GONE.\n        Why?\n        Maybe the chain is simultaneous?\n        Or maybe my direction is wrong?\n        Let's check colors.\n        Output BL Inner is 2.\n        BL(Original Inner 3) -> Target TR(Outer 3, Inner 2).\n        So BL ate TR. BL becomes (8, 2). Matches output.\n        Output BR Inner is 8.\n        BR(Original Inner 4) -> Target BC(Outer 4, Inner 8).\n        So BR ate BC. BR becomes (1, 8). Matches output.\n        So:\n        BR eats BC. (BC removed).\n        BL eats TR. (TR removed).\n        What about TL?\n        TR *targets* TL.\n        If TR is eaten by BL, does TR still eat TL?\n        Apparently yes, because TL is removed in output.\n        So: \"Eaten blocks are removed\".\n        TL was targeted by TR. TR was targeted by BL.\n        Even though TR died, its \"eating event\" on TL happened? Or simply \"Anyone who is a target dies\".\n        TL was a target (of TR). Died.\n        TR was a target (of BL). Died.\n        BC was a target (of BR). Died.\n        BL was a target (of BC).\n        But BC was eaten by BR.\n        Why did BL survive?\n        BC was targeted by BR.\n        BL was targeted by BC.\n        If \"Anyone who is a target dies\", BL should die.\n        But BL survived.\n        Difference: The block targeting BL (which is BC) was *also* targeted (by BR).\n        The block targeting TL (TR) was *also* targeted (by BL).\n        Why did BL live and TL die?\n        Chain: BR -> BC -> BL -> TR -> TL.\n        Result: BR lives. BC dies. BL lives. TR dies. TL dies?\n        This looks like \"Alternating survival\" starting from the top of the chain?\n        1. BR eats BC. BR lives, BC dies.\n        2. Since BC is dead, it *cannot* eat BL. So BL lives.\n        3. BL lives, so it eats TR. BL lives, TR dies.\n        4. Since TR is dead, it *cannot* eat TL?\n        If so, TL should live.\n        But TL is gone in Ex 2 output.\n        Contradiction.\n        Let's look at the grey lines in Ex 2.\n        Maybe TL is just not connected?\n        Or maybe my block identification is wrong.\n        Check Ex 2 Output again.\n        Rows 0-3 are empty (0).\n        TL was in R0-2. TR in R0-2. Both gone.\n        So TL died.\n        Hypothesis: A block dies if it is eaten.\n        Does the eating action propagate?\n        BR eats BC. BC dies.\n        BL eats TR. TR dies.\n        TR eats TL. TL dies.\n        BC eats BL.\n        Why didn't BL die?\n        Conflict: BC eats BL vs BR eats BC.\n        Maybe speed?\n        Or maybe the graph of 5s determines precedence?\n        Or maybe circular logic?\n        Actually, looking at the grey pixels in Ex 2:\n        There is a 5 at (3,3), (3,5), (2,3? No).\n        The structure of 5s connects everything.\n        Maybe the rule is:\n        Calculate all potential attacks.\n        Resolve conflicts.\n        Conflict: BR attacks BC. BC attacks BL.\n        If BR attacks BC, BC is removed *before* it can attack BL?\n        Why?\n        Maybe because BR is not attacked by anyone. (Root of the chain).\n        BR is a \"Source\".\n        BC is an intermediate.\n        BL is... wait, BL attacks TR. TR attacks TL.\n        BC attacks BL.\n        So chain is: BR -> BC -> BL -> TR -> TL.\n        BR is Source.\n        Step 1: BR eats BC. BC removed.\n        Step 2: BC is gone, so threat to BL is removed. BL survives.\n        Step 3: BL is alive, so BL eats TR. TR removed.\n        Step 4: TR is gone, so threat to TL is removed. TL survives.\n        But TL is REMOVED.\n        Why?\n        Maybe TR's death doesn't stop it from killing TL?\n        If \"being eaten\" and \"eating\" are simultaneous state changes:\n        Everyone who is a target gets removed.\n        But BL was a target and survived.\n        So there is a priority.\n        Why is BL different from TR or BC or TL?\n        The only logic that fits \"BR lives, BC dies, BL lives, TR dies, TL dies\" is:\n        BR (Source) -> Lives.\n        BC (Target of Source) -> Dies.\n        BL (Target of Dead) -> Lives.\n        TR (Target of Living BL) -> Dies.\n        TL (Target of Dead TR) -> Dies????\n        That breaks the alternation.\n        Unless... TL was *not* eaten by TR?\n        Check TL and TR again.\n        TL: Outer 2, Inner 6.\n        TR: Outer 3, Inner 2.\n        Match: TR Inner (2) == TL Outer (2). Yes, TR eats TL.\n        Is there another interaction?\n        Maybe grey lines matter?\n        Or maybe TL is just cleared for another reason?\n        Wait. Look at Ex 2 Output closely.\n        The top rows are all 0.\n        Maybe the grey paths didn't connect to TL?\n        \"Grey paths are re-routed to connect only the surviving blocks.\"\n        If a block survives but is disconnected from the main group, is it removed?\n        In Ex 1, no blocks were disconnected survivors.\n        In Ex 3, TL and BR survive. They are far apart. The path connects them.\n        In Ex 2, if TL survived (by alternating logic), it would be at R0-2.\n        BL is at R4-6.\n        BR is at R4-6.\n        Was there a path from BL/BR to TL?\n        Input Ex 2:\n        R2C3 is 0.\n        R3C3 is 5.\n        R3C5 is 5.\n        R2C5 is 0.\n        The grey lines are in the middle (row 3, row 8, etc).\n        TL is connected to TR via grey? No.\n        TR connected to BL?\n        If the path is required for survival, and the path goes through a dead block?\n        If TR dies, the path from BL to TL (via TR) might be broken.\n        If path broken -> TL removed?\n        This seems plausible.\n        Logic:\n        1. Resolve \"Eating\" based on Source priority (alternating survival).\n           Survivors based on logic: BR, BL, TL.\n           Dead: BC, TR.\n        2. Check Connectivity.\n           Survivors must be connected by the grey network.\n           Start from the \"Source\" (BR)? Or the largest cluster?\n           BR and BL are connected (via the space where BC was? or other 5s).\n           TL connects to the rest via TR.\n           Since TR is dead/removed, is the path broken?\n           If the path logic is \"re-route\", maybe it can't bridge the gap of a missing block?\n           If TL becomes isolated, it is removed.\n           This explains why TL is gone.\n\n    **Apply this logic to Test Input:**\n    Chains:\n    1. $B_1$(TL, 4,2) eats $B_2$(TR, 2,3) eats $B_5$(R, 3,3).\n       Chain: $B_1 \\to B_2 \\to B_5$.\n       Source: $B_1$ (Not eaten by anyone).\n       Logic:\n       - $B_1$ eats $B_2$. $B_1$ Lives. $B_2$ Dies.\n       - $B_2$ is dead. Can it eat $B_5$?\n       - If \"Dead men eat no blocks\": $B_5$ survives.\n       - If \"Simultaneous\": $B_5$ dies.\n       - Let's look at Ex 2 again. TL died. TL was at end of chain.\n         Chain: BR -> BC -> BL -> TR -> TL.\n         If alternation holds: BR(L), BC(D), BL(L), TR(D), TL(L).\n         TL died. Why?\n         Hypothesis A: Connectivity. TR died, cutting TL off.\n         Hypothesis B: Simultaneous eating. $B_2$ eats $B_5$ regardless of $B_1$.\n         In Ex 2, if simultaneous:\n         BR eats BC -> BC dies.\n         BC eats BL -> BL dies.\n         BL eats TR -> TR dies.\n         TR eats TL -> TL dies.\n         Survivors: BR.\n         But Output has BL surviving.\n         So it's NOT simultaneous. It must be alternating/priority based.\n         So BC died, saving BL.\n         So TR died.\n         Did TR die before eating TL?\n         If TR dies, TL is saved.\n         So TL *should* be alive logically.\n         So TL's removal *must* be due to connectivity.\n\n    **Back to Test Input with \"Alternation + Connectivity\":**\n    Chain 1: $B_1 \\to B_2 \\to B_5$.\n    - Source $B_1$.\n    - $B_1$ eats $B_2$. $B_1$ survives. $B_2$ removed.\n    - $B_2$ is dead, so $B_5$ is safe (survives).\n    - Survivors in this chain: $B_1, B_5$.\n    Chain 2: $B_3 \\to B_4$.\n    - Source $B_3$.\n    - $B_3$ eats $B_4$. $B_3$ survives. $B_4$ removed.\n    - Survivors in this chain: $B_3$.\n\n    Potential Survivors: $B_1$ (TL), $B_5$ (Right), $B_3$ (BL).\n\n    **Connectivity Check:**\n    - Input network of 5s.\n    - $B_1$ (TL).

Correct.\n2.  **Eating Logic**:\n    - $B_1$ eats $B_2$ ($2=2$).\n    - $B_2$ (Inner 3) matches $B_5$ (Outer 3), but $B_2$ is eaten by $B_1$. $B_5$ survives.\n    - $B_3$ eats $B_4$ ($1=1$).\n    - Survivors: $B_1, B_3, B_5$. Removed: $B_2, B_4$.\n3.  **Connectivity Pruning**:\n    - $B_1$ is isolated from the 5-grid. Removed.\n    - Path to $B_2$ (dead) removed.\n    - $B_3$ and $B_5$ connected by remaining 5s.\n4.  **Color Update**:\n    - $B_3$ takes $B_4$'s inner (9).\n    - $B_5$ takes nothing (retains 3).\n5.  **Output Construction**:\n    - Top half empty.\n    - Bottom half contains modified $B_3$, original $B_5$, and connecting 5s.\n\nThe solution seems consistent with all clues.\n\n### Final Grid Generation\nRows 0-4: All 0s.\nRow 5: `0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,3,0`\nRow 6: `0,7,0,0,0,0,5,3,3,3`\nRow 7: `7,9,7,0,0,0,5,0,3,0`\nRow 8: `0,7,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0`\nRow 9: `0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0`\n\nOne small check: Row 5, Col 7.\nInput R5: `...5,0,3,0`.\nPixel at C7 is 0.\n$B_5$ top is `0,3,0`.\nC7 is 0.\nMy R5 output: `...5,0,3,0`.

Correct.\n\nDouble check R9.\nInput: `0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0`\nOutput: `0,5,5,0,5...` (Keep path 5s).\nResult: `0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0`. Correct.\n\nThe solution is solid.\n\n**Explanation**:\nThe transformation follows these rules:\n1.  **Identify Blocks:** We find 3x3 blocks defined by a border color and an inner center color. In the test input, we have five blocks: Top-Left (Outer 4, Inner 2), Top-Right (Outer 2, Inner 3), Bottom-Left (Outer 7, Inner 1), Middle (Outer 1, Inner 9), and Right (Outer 3, Inner 3).\n2.  **Determine Predation:** A block \"eats\" another if its Inner Color matches the victim's Outer Color.\n    *   Top-Left (Inner 2) eats Top-Right (Outer 2). Top-Right is removed.\n    *   Bottom-Left (Inner 1) eats Middle (Outer 1). Middle is removed.\n    *   Top-Right *would* have eaten Right (Inner 3 vs Outer 3), but Top-Right was eaten first. Thus, the Right block survives.\n3.  **Update Survivors:**\n    *   Survivors are Top-Left, Bottom-Left, and Right.\n    *   Top-Left adopts Top-Right's inner color (3).\n    *   Bottom-Left adopts Middle's inner color (9).\n    *   Right block remains unchanged (inner 3).\n4.  **Route Grey Paths:**\n    *   We must connect survivors using the grey (5) pixels.\n    *   Top-Left block is isolated (no grey pixels connect to it). Isolated survivors are removed (consistent with Example 2).\n    *   Bottom-Left and Right blocks are connected by a path of 5s. We keep this path.\n    *   Path segments leading to removed blocks (like Top-Right) are removed.\n5.  **Final Output:**\n    *   Top half is cleared (Top-Left removed, Top-Right removed).\n    *   Bottom-Left block is redrawn with new inner color 9.\n    *   Right block is redrawn unchanged.\n    *   Grey path connecting them is preserved.\n\noutput grid:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,3,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,5,3,3,3\n7,9,7,0,0,0,5,0,3,0\n0,7,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0",

Survives, takes Block 5's inner (3)\n- **Block 4**: Not eaten (no block has inner 7). Survives, takes Block 3's inner (9)\n- Block 3: Eaten by Block 4 - removed\n- Block 5: Eaten by Block 1 - removed\n- Block 2: Disconnected - removed\n\n## Final Output:\n\n- Block 1: Border 2, Inner 3 (at position centered at (1,7))\n- Block 4: Border 7, Inner 9 (at position centered at (7,1))\n- Grey paths remain as in input\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,2,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n7,9,7,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,7,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "To work out what is going on, I first looked at the three worked examples. In each input there are small \u201cblocks\u201d consisting of a central cell (the inner colour) surrounded orthogonally by cells of a different colour (the outer border). In the examples these are 3\u00d73 squares with a uniform border and a different centre, but the essential feature is that a cell has four orthogonal neighbours all the same colour and different from itself. The colour 5, which appears as lines between objects, stays unchanged in all outputs and serves as the grey path.\n\nThe transformation can be understood in terms of directed edges between these blocks: from a block\u202fX to a block\u202fY if X\u2019s inner colour equals Y\u2019s border colour. The blocks that act as \u201ceaters\u201d are the sources of this graph: blocks with no incoming edge and with an outgoing edge. We process these sources iteratively: each such block eats its target, changes its centre to the inner colour of the eaten block, and the eaten block is removed. After removing eaten blocks and their edges, newly exposed sources can eat in the next step. At the end, only blocks that have eaten at least once are kept; all other non\u20115 coloured cells are set to 0. The shapes of the surviving blocks and all 5\u2011coloured \u201cpaths\u201d are left as they were in the input.\n\nOn the test grid there are four blocks of the plus\u2011shape form (centre with four equal orthogonal neighbours):\n\n- Border\u202f4, inner\u202f2 centred at (2,2).\n- Border\u202f2, inner\u202f3 centred at (1,7).\n- Border\u202f7, inner\u202f1 centred at (7,1).\n- Border\u202f1, inner\u202f9 centred at (6,4).\n\nEdges are from 4/2 to 2/3, and from 7/1 to 1/9. The two source blocks (border\u202f4 and border\u202f7) each eat their target. The border\u20114 block\u2019s centre becomes 3; the border\u20117 block\u2019s centre becomes 9. The other two blocks are removed. All 5s are kept; all other coloured cells are cleared to 0. This yields the following output grid:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,4,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,5,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n7,9,7,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,7,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "First I\u2019ll describe the rule I inferred from the three solved examples, then I\u2019ll apply it to the test grid step by step and give the final output.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Interpreting \u201cblocks\u201d\n\nFrom the examples, each **block** is a 3\u00d73 pattern with:\n\n- A **border color** on the four cardinal neighbors of the center (up, down, left, right), all the same non\u2011zero color.\n- A (possibly different) **inner color** at the central cell.\n- The four corners of the 3\u00d73 may be either the border color or 0; they don\u2019t matter for identifying the block.\n\nIn the examples, the corners happened also to be the border color, giving full 3\u00d73 \u201cframes\u201d; in the test grid, blocks are \u201cplus\u201d shapes with 0 corners, but the same definition via the cross of 4 neighbors still works.\n\nSo a block is detected at (r,c) if:\n\n- G[r,c] = inner color (any nonzero),\n- G[r-1,c], G[r+1,c], G[r,c-1], G[r,c+1] are all the same nonzero color B,\n- We call B the **outer / border color**, and G[r,c] the **inner color**.\n\nThe grey paths are color 5; in all given examples, the 5s are never modified by the transformation (except where a block is removed and that region was already 0 or non\u20115), so I leave all 5s unchanged.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The \u201ceating\u201d relation between blocks\n\nFor each block, with border color `B` and inner color `I`, we define a directed edge:\n\n- Block P **eats** block Q if `inner(P) == border(Q)` and P \u2260 Q.\n\nThis defines a directed graph on the blocks. Because border colors are unique across blocks in each example, and inner colors that match borders do so at most once, each block has:\n\n- Outdegree \u2264 1 (it can eat at most one other block),\n- Indegree \u2264 1 (it can be eaten by at most one other block).\n\nSo each connected component of this graph is a simple **chain**:\n\n`P0 -> P1 -> P2 -> ... -> Pk -> T`\n\nwhere:\n\n- Each `Pi` (0 \u2264 i \u2264 k) *does* eat something (outdegree = 1),\n- The last node `T` has outdegree 0 (it eats no one),\n- `P0` has indegree 0 (no one eats it) \u2013 the \u201capex\u201d of the food chain.\n\nFrom the three examples, the behavior on such a chain is:\n\n- Let the chain nodes in order be:\n  - N\u2080 = P\u2080, N\u2081 = P\u2081, \u2026, N\u2096 = P\u2096, N\u2096\u208a\u2081 = T.\n- **Predator sequence** = [N\u2080, \u2026, N\u2096], i.e. all nodes that do have an outgoing edge.\n- The **surviving blocks** in this component are exactly those predators at even positions in this sequence:\n  - N\u2080, N\u2082, N\u2084, \u2026\n- All predators at odd positions (N\u2081, N\u2083, \u2026) are removed.\n- The terminal non\u2011predator T = N\u2096\u208a\u2081 is also removed.\n- For each **surviving predator** N\u1d62 (i even), its inner color becomes the inner color of its **direct prey** N\u1d62\u208a\u2081 (as in the examples: inner of eater unchanged except for taking prey\u2019s inner).\n\nCrucially, *all* prey in the chain ultimately disappear, whether or not their own predator survives; they still \u201cate\u201d their own prey conceptually, so lower blocks are removed as well. This matches:\n\n- Example 1: Chain C\u2192D\u2192A\u2192B; survivors: C and A.\n- Example 2: Chain E\u2192F\u2192D\u2192B\u2192A; survivors: E and D.\n- Example 3: Chains A\u2192E and D\u2192B\u2192C; survivors: A and D.\n\nIn all these, the surviving blocks are the even-index predators along each chain.\n\nFinally:\n\n- For a surviving block S, only the **center cell** (inner color) changes to that of S\u2019s immediate prey; the border (outer color) stays unchanged.\n- For every block that does **not** survive, all its 3\u00d73 block cells (its cross / frame plus the center) become 0.\n- Color\u20115 paths are left untouched.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

            "Full raw LLM response": "First I\u2019ll describe the rule I inferred from the three solved examples, then apply it step by step to the test grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Interpreting the training examples\n\n### 1.1. What counts as a \u201cblock\u201d\n\nFrom the examples, a **block** is defined by:\n\n- A center cell (the **inner color**).\n- Its 4 orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right) all having the same **non\u2011zero** color (the **outer border color**).\n\nSo a block is detected whenever a cell at \\((r,c)\\) has:\n\n- value \\(I\\neq 0\\), and\n- its neighbors \\((r-1,c), (r+1,c), (r,c-1), (r,c+1)\\) are all the same nonzero color \\(B\\).\n\nIn the examples these sometimes formed a full 3\u00d73 ring (all 8 neighbors the same border color), but that extra ring is not essential: the rule only needs the center and 4 orthogonal neighbors.\n\nFor each block we record:\n\n- position of its center,\n- outer border color \\(B\\),\n- original inner color \\(I_0\\).\n\nColor 5 is used for grey \u201cpaths\u201d but does not form blocks (no block has border color 5 in the examples).\n\n### 1.2. The eating rule\n\nThe hints say:\n\n> \u201cmatching\u201d pairs of blocks where the Inner Color of the first block equals the Outer Border Color of the second block. In such a pair, the first block (the \"eater\") survives, and the second block (the \"eaten\") is removed. The survivor retains its original border but adopts the Inner Color of the block it just ate.\n\nFrom the examples, the **operational process** consistent with all three is:\n\n1. Detect all blocks and list them in **reading order** (top\u2011to\u2011bottom, left\u2011to\u2011right by center position).\n2. Let each block act **once in that order**, if it is still alive:\n   - Take its **original** inner color \\(I_0\\) (not updated by earlier eats).\n   - Among the blocks that are still alive and distinct from it, look for a block whose **border color** \\(B\\) equals that \\(I_0\\).\n   - If such a block exists (in all examples there is at most one), it is eaten:\n     - The acting block (the **eater**) survives and gets a **new inner color** equal to the eaten block\u2019s **original** inner color.\n     - The eaten block is removed from the set of blocks (it will be erased from the grid at the end).\n   - If no such block exists, it does nothing and keeps its original inner color.\n3. After this single pass, any block that has ever been eaten is removed from the grid; any block that was never eaten remains (with either its original or updated center).\n4. When a block is removed, its entire 3\u00d73 neighborhood (center plus border and diagonals) is cleared to background 0.\n5. Grey paths (color 5) are **not** altered; in all examples their coordinates remain unchanged. Their \u201cre\u2011routing\u201d is just a conceptual consequence of blocks disappearing.\n\nI verified this process on:\n\n- **Example 1**: 4 blocks; in reading order, two of them eat and later two of them are eaten. Survivors and center colors match exactly.\n- **Example 2**: 5 blocks; chain of eats B2\u2192B1, B5\u2192B2, B3\u2192B4 in that order; survivors B3 and B5 with updated centers 8 and 2 as in the output.\n- **Example 3**: 5 blocks; in order B1\u2192B3, B2\u2192B5, B4\u2192B2; survivors B1(center 9) and B4(center 3) as in the output.\n\nThe key technical detail is:\n\n- **Predators always use the original inner color of their prey**, even if the prey itself has eaten someone earlier in the pass.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying the rule to the test input\n\n### 2.1. Identify all blocks\n\nTest input:\n\n```\nr1:  0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\nr2:  0,0,4,0,0,0,2,3,2,0\nr3:  0,4,2,4,0,0,0,2,0,0\nr4:  0,0,4,0,0,0,0,5,0,0\nr5:  0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\nr6:  0,0,0,0,1,0,5,0,3,0\nr7:  0,7,0,1,9,1,5,3,3,3\nr8:  7,1,7,0,1,0,5,0,3,0\nr9:  0,7,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0\nr10: 0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0\n```\n\nScan rows 2\u20139, cols 2\u20139 for center cells with four equal nonzero neighbors:\n\n- **Block A** at (r2,c8):\n  - center = 3\n  - neighbors: up r1c8=2, down r3c8=2, left r2c7=2, right r2c9=2 \u21d2 all 2\n  - \u21d2 outer border color \\(B_A = 2\\), inner \\(I_{0A} = 3\\).\n\n- **Block B** at (r3,c3):\n  - center = 2\n  - neighbors: up r2c3=4, down r4c3=4, left r3c2=4, right r3c4=4 \u21d2 all 4\n  - \u21d2 \\(B_B = 4\\), \\(I_{0B} = 2\\).\n\n- **Block C** at (r7,c5):\n  - center = 9\n  - neighbors: up r6c5=1, down r8c5=1, left r7c4=1, right r7c6=1 \u21d2 all 1\n  - \u21d2 \\(B_C = 1\\), \\(I_{0C} = 9\\).\n\n- **Block D** at (r7,c9):\n  - center = 3\n  - neighbors: up r6c9=3, down r8c9=3, left r7c8=3, right r7c10=3 \u21d2 all 3\n  - \u21d2 \\(B_D = 3\\), \\(I_{0D} = 3\\).\n\n- **Block E** at (r8,c2):\n  - center = 1\n  - neighbors: up r7c2=7, down r9c2=7, left r8c1=7, right r8c3=7 \u21d2 all 7\n  - \u21d2 \\(B_E = 7\\), \\(I_{0E} = 1\\).\n\nNo other nonzero cell has four equal nonzero neighbors, so we have exactly five blocks: A, B, C, D, E.\n\nTheir centers in reading order (top\u2011to\u2011bottom, left\u2011to\u2011right):\n\n1. A at (2,8)\n2. B at (3,3)\n3. C at (7,5)\n4. D at (7,9)\n5. E at (8,2)\n\n### 2.2. Simulate the eating process\n\nWe keep a set `alive = {A,B,C,D,E}` and track updated centers, but always match using *original* inners and borders.\n\n#### Step 1: Block A (2,8)\n\n- Original inner \\(I_{0A} = 3\\).\n- Look among currently alive blocks for any with border color \\(B = 3\\).\n  - A has B=2\n  - B has B=4\n  - C has B=1\n  - D has B=3  \u2705\n  - E has B=7\n- So **A eats D**.\n  - A survives.\n  - New inner of A becomes original inner of D: \\(I_A := I_{0D} = 3\\) (no visible change, but the event happens).\n  - D is removed from `alive`.\n\nNow `alive = {A,B,C,E}`.\n\n#### Step 2: Block B (3,3)\n\n- \\(I_{0B} = 2\\).\n- Among alive blocks with border 2:\n  - A has \\(B_A=2\\) \u2705\n  - C has B=1\n  - E has B=7\n- So **B eats A**.\n  - B survives.\n  - New inner of B becomes original inner of A: \\(I_B := I_{0A} = 3\\).\n  - A is removed.\n\nNow `alive = {B,C,E}`.\n\n#### Step 3: Block C (7,5)\n\n- \\(I_{0C} = 9\\).\n- Search alive blocks with B=9: none (B=4,1,7 respectively).\n- So **C eats nothing** and keeps inner 9 (for now).\n\n`alive` unchanged: {B,C,E}.\n\n#### Step 4: Block D (7,9)\n\n- D is already removed; skip.\n\n#### Step 5: Block E (8,2)\n\n- \\(I_{0E} = 1\\).\n- Search alive blocks with border 1:\n  - C has \\(B_C = 1\\) \u2705\n- So **E eats C**.\n  - E survives.\n  - New inner of E becomes original inner of C: \\(I_E := I_{0C} = 9\\).\n  - C is removed.\n\nFinal `alive = {B,E}`.\n\nSo:\n\n- **Survivors**: B and E.\n  - B: border 4, center changes from 2 \u2192 3.\n  - E: border 7, center changes from 1 \u2192 9.\n- **Eaten blocks**: A, C, D.\n  - A was eaten by B.\n  - C was eaten by E.\n  - D was eaten by A.\n- No other blocks remain.\n\n### 2.3. Update the grid\n\nFor each eaten block we erase its 3\u00d73 neighborhood (center plus all 8 neighbors) by setting them to 0. For survivors we only update the center value; their border cells stay intact.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's how I see the solution to this training example:**\n\n1.  **Observables:** The training example presents a canvas with colored blocks and grey paths. The blocks are $3\\times3$ hollow squares with distinct border and center colors. The paths appear to connect blocks, but their precise role is subtle. Each example consists of an input state and a corresponding output state.\n\n2.  **Categories:** The key categories are the colored blocks, the relationships between them (primarily driven by color matching), and the grey path. I'm focusing on the border and center colors of the blocks. The paths seem to provide a structural element, possibly connecting the blocks to a starting point or each other.\n\n3.  **Insights:**\n    *   The core transformation occurs *between* the blocks, driven by their *colors*, not their spatial proximity.\n    *   The relationships can be described by matching the *center* color of one block to the *border* color of another.\n    *   This matching creates a directed relationship: the block whose center color matches \"eats\" the block with the matching border color.\n    *   The \"eaten\" blocks disappear.\n    *   The survivors are those blocks at the \"head\" of the eating chains (those that have a center color matching no border).\n    *   The survivor's center color is updated to the *original* center color of the block it ate.\n    *   The grey path *rewrites* itself in the output, linking the surviving blocks.\n\n4.  **Rule Hypothesis:** A chain reaction, or directed graph reduction, defines the transformation. A \"predator\" block (matching center color to border color) absorbs its \"prey.\" The predator adopts the prey's center color, and the prey vanishes. The surviving blocks, those not consumed, are linked in the output by a revised grey path.\n\n5.  **Checks:**\n    *   Verify whether a block can be eaten by two blocks (merging).\n    *   Verify if a block can \"eat\" itself (self-consumption).\n    *   Check for cyclic consumption (A eats B, B eats A).\n    *   Check the path-rewriting algorithm. Is it a minimal spanning tree, or a simpler connection algorithm?\n    *   Ensure the center color update rule is understood; is it the initial or the intermediate center of the eaten block?\n\n6.  **HINT:** This is a problem of relationships defined by *color-based matching*. Focus on the predator-prey relationship and the color inheritance. The path's role is structural, connecting the remaining blocks after the transformation.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided image containing three training examples:\n\n### **1. Describe the observable structures**\n\n*   **Objects:** The grid contains distinct $3\\times3$ square blocks. Each block is hollow, consisting of a colored **border** (1 pixel thick) and a single pixel **center** of a different color.\n*   **Connections:** There are grey lines (paths) connecting some of these blocks or extending from the grid edges. These lines move orthogonally (horizontally and vertically).\n*   **Background:** The background is black.\n*   **Changes:**\n    *   In the output, several blocks disappear.\n    *   The surviving blocks maintain their original **border color** and **position**.\n    *   The **center color** of the surviving blocks changes.\n    *   The grey connecting path changes shape, generally simplifying to connect the remaining blocks.\n\n### **2. Identify transformation categories**\n\n*   **Object movement:** Absent (Surviving blocks stay in place).\n*   **Object recoloring:** Present (Center pixels change).\n*   **Bordering / outlining:** Present (Implicitly, the objects are borders).\n*   **Filling holes or cavities:** Maybe (The center pixel is filled/swapped).\n*   **Removing noise / extracting main shape:** Present (Many blocks are removed).\n*   **Copying / pasting / repositioning:** Absent.\n*   **Using a key anchor location:** Absent.\n*   **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors:** Absent.\n*   **Size-based filtering or selection:** Absent.\n*   **Symmetry or reflection operations:** Absent.\n*   **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion:** Absent.\n*   **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping:** Present (Abstract mapping based on color logic).\n\n### **3. Extract the key non-obvious insights**\n\n*   **Color-Based Matching:** The transformation is driven by a relationship between the **center color** of one block and the **border color** of another. For example, in Input 1, the top-right block has a yellow center, and there is another block (middle-left) with a yellow border.\n*   **Predator-Prey Chains:** There is a directional dependency. If Block A's center matches Block B's border, Block A \"targets\" Block B.\n*   **Selective Survival:** Only the blocks that are \"targeting\" others (and are not targeted themselves) seem to survive. Blocks that are \"targeted\" (whose border color is matched) disappear in the output.\n*   **Property Inheritance:** The surviving block takes the **center color** of the block it targeted.\n    *   *Example (Input 2):* The Mid-Left block (Blue border, Green center) targets the Top-Right block (Green border, Red center). In the output, the Mid-Left block survives, keeps its Blue border, but acquires the Red center.\n*   **Depth of Chain:** Chains can be multi-step (A targets B, B targets C), but the inheritance seems to be from the *immediate* target only (A takes B's original center). The entire tail of the chain (B and C) is removed.\n\n### **4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)**\n\nThe puzzle simulates a \"consumption\" or \"pointer\" logic based on color codes.\n1.  **Identify Links:** Treat each colored block as a node. Create a directed link from Block A to Block B if **Block A's Center Color == Block B's Border Color**.\n2.  **Determine Survivors:** Blocks that initiate a link (predators) but are not the target of another link survive. Blocks that are targets (prey) are removed.\n3.  **Update State:** Each surviving block updates its **center color** to match the center color of the block it immediately targeted.\n4.  **Rewire Paths:** The grey path is redrawn to connect the surviving blocks (and potentially the original entry point), discarding the old path segments that led to removed blocks.\n\n### **5. List checks you would perform when solving**\n\n*   **Check for Chains vs. Cycles:** Verify what happens if Block A targets B, and B targets A (cycle). (Likely neither survives, or the rule breaks, but in these examples, chains are linear).\n*   **Verify Inheritance Source:** Confirm strictly whether a survivor takes the *original* center of the victim or the *modified* center (if the victim had also eaten someone). Evidence from Input 2 suggests it takes the *original* center.\n*   **Path Logic Validation:** Test if the new grey path follows a Minimal Spanning Tree logic or simply preserves the connectivity that existed between the surviving nodes in the original graph.\n*   **Orphan Check:** What happens to a block whose center color matches *no* other block's border, and whose border matches *no* other block's center? (Likely removed, or survives unchanged\u2014though in the examples, most blocks are part of a chain).\n\n### **6. Summarize final insights**\n\nHINT_START\n*   The transformation is defined by \"matching\" pairs of blocks where the **Inner Color** of the first block equals the **Outer Border Color** of the second block.\n*   In such a pair, the first block (the \"eater\") survives, and the second block (the \"eaten\") is removed.\n*   The survivor retains its original border but adopts the **Inner Color** of the block it just ate.\n*   Grey paths are re-routed to connect only the surviving blocks.\nHINT_END",

Multiple framed objects can coexist in each grid, positioned at various locations.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. **Chain Construction**: Objects form chains where Object A receives from Object B if A's center color = B's border/arm color\n2. **Survival Pattern**: Within each chain, objects at positions 1 and 3 from the sink survive, except the source which is always deleted\n3. **Center Update**: Surviving objects' centers are replaced by their predecessor's original center value\n4. **Path Preservation**: All color 5 path segments remain unchanged\n5. **Deletion**: All non-surviving objects are removed (set to 0)\n\nFor the test input:\n- Chain 1: Object(arms-3,center-3) \u2192 Object(arms-2,center-3) \u2192 Object(arms-4,center-2)\n- Chain 2: Object(arms-1,center-9) \u2192 Object(arms-7,center-1)\n- Survivors: Plus(arms-4) with new center 3, Plus(arms-7) with new center 9\n- 5-path preserved\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Solution Summary**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown of my thought process: The user wants me to solve this ARC task, so first, I need to understand the rules. I'm given some objects: 3x3 frames, cross shapes, paths, and a background. My initial thought is to go through each step carefully.\n\n1.  **Understanding the Rules:** I need to look at each input and output pair to understand the pattern.\n    *   **Object Relationships:**  The main thing is about chains of objects.  Object A *receives* from Object B if A's center color is the same as B's border/arm color. I double-checked this by tracing through the examples, making sure I got the \"flow\" direction right: Sender -> Receiver.\n    *   **Survival Logic:** Within a chain, it's about which objects *survive*. The tricky part is the \"positions from the sink\" rule: only positions 1 and 3 from the end of the chain survive. This part had me going back and forth on \"where is the end?\" and the definition of a source object. I kept checking against the provided examples to make sure I got it right, especially since the source is *always* deleted, which can contradict the survival positions.\n    *   **Center Update:**  The center color of the *surviving* objects will change, but it changes to the predecessor's original center value.\n\n2.  **Test Input Analysis:** I need to work step-by-step to analyze the test input.\n\n    *   **Identifying Objects:** First, I had to identify the \"objects\" in the input grid. This involved locating the cross and frames and their corresponding center and arm colors.\n    *   **Chain Building:** Then, I built the chains based on that \"receives from\" logic, tracing the links between objects to define the proper flow.\n    *   **Survival Check:** I went through each chain I identified and applied the \"survival\" rules. Position 1 (from the end) and position 3 (from the end) survive - unless the position is the source. The source is always deleted.\n    *   **Center Update:** Surviving objects get a new center color from their direct predecessor in the chain.\n\n3.  **Output Generation:** To visualize the answer, I'll clear the grid, put the path back in, and place the survivors with their new center colors. I just have to verify all the coordinates are correct and account for possible overlaps. I checked everything again to ensure I didn't misinterpret anything!\n\n\nBased on the provided examples and object descriptions, here is the step-by-step derivation of the solution for the test input:\n\n### 1. Object Identification and Analysis\nFirst, we identify the objects in the input grid based on the \"Objects Description\".\n*   **Plus/Cross Shapes**: There are 5 \"plus\" shapes (5 cells each).\n    1.  **Object A (Top-Left)**: Centered at `(2, 2)`. Arms color `4`, Center color `2`.\n    2.  **Object B (Top-Right)**: Centered at `(1, 7)`. Arms color `2`, Center color `3`.\n    3.  **Object C (Mid-Right)**: Centered at `(6, 8)`. Arms color `3`, Center color `3`.\n    4.  **Object D (Mid-Center)**: Centered at `(6, 4)`. Arms color `1`, Center color `9`.\n    5.  **Object E (Bottom-Left)**: Centered at `(7, 1)`. Arms color `7`, Center color `1`.\n*   **Path**: Scattered pixels of color `5`. These must be preserved exactly as they are.\n\n### 2. Chain Construction\nAccording to the rules, an object forms a chain `Predecessor -> Successor` if the Successor's center color matches the Predecessor's arm/border color.\n*   **Chain 1**:\n    *   Object A (Center `2`) matches Object B's Arms (`2`). Link: **B \u2192 A**.\n    *   Object B (Center `3`) matches Object C's Arms (`3`). Link: **C \u2192 B**.\n    *   Full Chain: **C \u2192 B \u2192 A**.\n*   **Chain 2**:\n    *   Object E (Center `1`) matches Object D's Arms (`1`). Link: **D \u2192 E**.\n    *   Full Chain: **D \u2192 E**.\n\n### 3. Survival and Center Update\nWe apply the survival logic: \"objects at positions 1 and 3 from the sink survive, except the source which is always deleted\".\n*   **Processing Chain 1 (C \u2192 B \u2192 A)**:\n    *   **Sink (Pos 1)**: Object A. Survives.\n    *   **Pos 2**: Object B. Deleted.\n    *   **Source (Pos 3)**: Object C. Source is always deleted.\n    *   **Update**: Survivor A's center is replaced by its predecessor (B)'s original center (`3`).\n    *   **Result**: Object A remains with Arms `4` and **New Center `3`**.\n\n*   **Processing Chain 2 (D \u2192 E)**:\n    *   **Sink (Pos 1)**: Object E. Survives.\n    *   **Source (Pos 2)**: Object D. Source is always deleted.\n    *   **Update**: Survivor E's center is replaced by its predecessor (D)'s original center (`9`).\n    *   **Result**: Object E remains with Arms `7` and **New Center `9`**.\n\n### 4. Final Grid Construction\nWe reconstruct the grid with the survivors and the preserved path.\n*   **Background**: Initialize with 0.\n*   **Path**: Copy all color `5` cells from the input.\n*   **Object A**: Draw at `(2, 2)` with Arms `4`, Center `3`.\n*   **Object E**: Draw at `(7, 1)` with Arms `7`, Center `9`.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,4,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,5,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n7,9,7,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,7,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0",

Transformation inferred from the examples\n\nFrom the three solved examples and the textual description:\n\n- **Objects** are either:\n  - 3\u00d73 square frames: 8 border cells of a single color, plus a (possibly different) center color; or\n  - Plus (cross) shapes: 5 cells (center + 4 neighbors up/down/left/right) with arm color in {1,2,3,4,7} and center color in {1,2,3,9}.\n- **Color 5** cells form an unrelated path and are **never modified**.\n- The **background** is color 0.\n\n### Chains\n\nFor each object we have:\n- a **border/arm color** (for frames / plus shapes respectively), and\n- a **center** color.\n\nWe form directed edges **B \u2192 A** when:\n\n> A.center color == B.border/arm color.\n\nThis means A \u201creceives\u201d from B.\n\nA **chain** is a directed path from a **source** (no incoming edge) to a **sink** (no outgoing edge).\n\n### Survival rule inside a chain\n\nLet the chain be ordered from source to sink:\n\\[ O_1 \\to O_2 \\to \\dots \\to O_n \\]\nwhere \\(O_n\\) is the sink.\n\nNow number positions *from the sink backwards*:\n- position 1: \\(O_n\\) (the sink),\n- position 2: \\(O_{n-1}\\),\n- position 3: \\(O_{n-2}\\),\n- etc.\n\nThe rule:\n\n1. Objects at **positions 1 and 3 from the sink** are marked to survive.\n2. The **source** (i.e. \\(O_1\\)) is **always deleted**, even if it would otherwise be at a surviving position.\n3. For each surviving object \\(O_k\\), its **center** is replaced with the **original center** of its **predecessor** in the chain (\\(O_{k-1}\\)).\n4. All non-surviving object cells are turned to 0.\n5. All color-5 path cells are left exactly as in the input.\n\nThe solved examples 1\u20133 match this behavior for frame objects.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identify objects in the test input\n\nTest input grid (for reference):\n\nr0: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0  \nr1: 0,0,4,0,0,0,2,3,2,0  \nr2: 0,4,2,4,0,0,0,2,0,0  \nr3: 0,0,4,0,0,0,0,5,0,0  \nr4: 0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0  \nr5: 0,0,0,0,1,0,5,0,3,0  \nr6: 0,7,0,1,9,1,5,3,3,3  \nr7: 7,1,7,0,1,0,5,0,3,0  \nr8: 0,7,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0  \nr9: 0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0  \n\n### 2.1. Color-5 path cells\n\nFrom the grid, color 5 appears at:\n\n- (3,7)\n- (4,6)\n- (5,6)\n- (6,6)\n- (7,6)\n- (8,3)\n- (8,5)\n- (9,1)\n- (9,2)\n- (9,4)\n\nThese will remain unchanged in the output.\n\n### 2.2. Plus objects\n\nNow detect all plus (cross) shapes, i.e., a center cell with 4 neighbors sharing an arm color.\n\n1. **Plus with arms 4, center 2** (surviving chain sink):\n\n   - Center at (2,2) = 2  \n   - Arms (color 4):\n     - Up:   (1,2) = 4  \n     - Down: (3,2) = 4  \n     - Left: (2,1) = 4  \n     - Right:(2,3) = 4  \n\n   So this is the plus **arms=4, center=2**.\n\n2. **Plus with arms 2, center 3**:\n\n   - Center at (1,7) = 3  \n   - Arms (color 2):\n     - Up:   (0,7) = 2  \n     - Down: (2,7) = 2  \n     - Left: (1,6) = 2  \n     - Right:(1,8) = 2  \n\n   This is **arms=2, center=3**.\n\n3. **Plus with arms 3, center 3**:\n\n   - Center at (6,8) = 3  \n   - Arms (color 3):\n     - Up:   (5,8) = 3  \n     - Down: (7,8) = 3  \n     - Left: (6,7) = 3  \n     - Right:(6,9) = 3  \n\n   This is **arms=3, center=3**.\n\n4. **Plus with arms 1, center 9**:\n\n   - Center at (6,4) = 9  \n   - Arms (color 1):\n     - Up:   (5,4) = 1  \n     - Down: (7,4) = 1  \n     - Left: (6,3) = 1  \n     - Right:(6,5) = 1  \n\n   This is **arms=1, center=9**.\n\n5. **Plus with arms 7, center 1** (another sink):\n\n   - Center at (7,1) = 1  \n   - Arms (color 7):\n     - Up:   (6,1) = 7  \n     - Down: (8,1) = 7  \n     - Left: (7,0) = 7  \n     - Right:(7,2) = 7  \n\n   This is **arms=7, center=1**.\n\nThere are **no 3\u00d73 frame objects** here\u2014every such 3\u00d73 region with nonzeros has corners 0 and is a plus, not a frame.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Build chains from these objects\n\nUse the rule: **B \u2192 A if A.center == B.arm_color**.\n\nLet\u2019s name the five plus objects by their arm and center colors:\n\n- P3: arms=3, center=3  (center at (6,8))\n- P2: arms=2, center=3  (center at (1,7))\n- P4: arms=4, center=2  (center at (2,2))\n- P1: arms=1, center=9  (center at (6,4))\n- P7: arms=7, center=1  (center at (7,1))\n\n### 3.1. Chain 1\n\n- P3 (arms=3, center=3):\n\n  Needs an object whose **center = 3** to receive from it. Candidates are P3 and P2; we ignore self-links and take P3 \u2192 P2.\n\n- P2 (arms=2, center=3):\n\n  Needs object with **center = 2**: that\u2019s P4.\n\n  So P2 \u2192 P4.\n\n- P4 (arms=4, center=2):\n\n  Needs object with **center = 4** \u2014 none exist, so P4 is the **sink**.\n\nThus **Chain 1** is:\n\n> P3 \u2192 P2 \u2192 P4\n\nSource: P3  \nSink: P4\n\nThis matches the provided description:  \n_Object(arms-3,center-3) \u2192 Object(arms-2,center-3) \u2192 Object(arms-4,center-2)_.\n\n### 3.2. Chain 2\n\n- P1 (arms=1, center=9):\n\n  Needs object with **center = 1**: that is P7.\n\n  So P1 \u2192 P7.\n\n- P7 (arms=7, center=1):\n\n  Needs object with **center = 7** \u2014 none; so P7 is the sink.\n\nThus **Chain 2** is:\n\n> P1 \u2192 P7\n\nSource: P1  \nSink: P7\n\nAgain matching the description:  \n_Object(arms-1,center-9) \u2192 Object(arms-7,center-1)_.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Apply the survival rule\n\n### 4.1. Chain 1: P3 \u2192 P2 \u2192 P4\n\nOrder from source to sink:\n- O\u2081 = P3 (source)\n- O\u2082 = P2\n- O\u2083 = P4 (sink)\n\nNow index **from sink backwards**:\n\n- Position 1 (from sink): O\u2083 = P4 (sink)\n- Position 2: O\u2082 = P2\n- Position 3: O\u2081 = P3 (source)\n\n\u201cPositions 1 and 3 from the sink survive, except the source which is always deleted.\u201d\n\n- Position 1: P4 survives.\n- Position 3: would be P3, but P3 is also the **source**, so it is deleted.\n\nSo from Chain 1, **only P4 survives**.\n\nCenter update for P4:\n- Predecessor of P4 in the chain is P2.\n- P2\u2019s original center is 3.\n- Therefore **P4\u2019s new center becomes 3** (its arms remain color 4).\n\n### 4.2. Chain 2: P1 \u2192 P7\n\n- O\u2081 = P1 (source)\n- O\u2082 = P7 (sink)\n\nFrom sink backwards:\n\n- Position 1: O\u2082 = P7 (sink)\n- Position 2: O\u2081 = P1 (source)\n\nSurvivors are position 1 (and 3 if it existed); source is always deleted.\n\n- Position 1: P7 survives.\n- P1 is source and is deleted.\n\nCenter update for P7:\n- Predecessor is P1.\n- P1\u2019s center = 9.\n- So **P7\u2019s new center becomes 9** (arms remain color 7).\n\nSo the **surviving plus objects** are:\n\n1. **P4** \u2013 arms 4, center changed from 2 \u2192 3  \n2. **P7** \u2013 arms 7, center changed from 1 \u2192 9  \n\nAll other plus shapes (P1, P2, P3) are completely removed (their cells set to 0).\n\nColor-5 path cells stay exactly as they were.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Construct the output grid\n\nRule per cell:\n\n- If the input cell is color **5**, keep it 5.\n- Else if it belongs to surviving plus **P4** or **P7**, set it to the appropriate arm or center color.\n- Else set it to **0**.\n\n### 5.1. Surviving plus P4 (arms 4, new center 3)\n\n- Center: (2,2) = 3\n- Arms (color 4):\n  - (1,2)\n  - (3,2)\n  - (2,1)\n  - (2,3)\n\n### 5.2. Surviving plus P7 (arms 7, new center 9)\n\n- Center: (7,1) = 9\n- Arms (color 7):\n  - (6,1)\n  - (8,1)\n  - (7,0)\n  - (7,2)\n\n### 5.3. Final rows\n\nGo row by row (r = 0..9, c = 0..9):\n\n- **Row 0**: no 5\u2019s, no surviving plus cells \u2192 all 0  \n  \u2192 `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\n- **Row 1**: only (1,2) is an arm of P4  \n  \u2192 `0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\n- **Row 2**: P4 occupies (2,1),(2,2),(2,3) as [4,3,4]  \n  \u2192 `0,4,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\n- **Row 3**: has path 5 at (3,7) and P4 arm at (3,2)  \n  \u2192 `0,0,4,0,0,0,0,5,0,0`\n\n- **Row 4**: has path 5 at (4,6)  \n  \u2192 `0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0`\n\n- **Row 5**: has path 5 at (5,6)  \n  \u2192 `0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0`\n\n- **Row 6**: has P7 arm at (6,1) and path 5 at (6,6)  \n  \u2192 `0,7,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0`\n\n- **Row 7**: P7 arms at (7,0),(7,2), center 9 at (7,1), path 5 at (7,6)  \n  \u2192 `7,9,7,0,0,0,5,0,0,0`\n\n- **Row 8**: P7 arm at (8,1), path 5 at (8,3),(8,5)  \n  \u2192 `0,7,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0`\n\n- **Row 9**: path 5 at (9,1),(9,2),(9,4)  \n  \u2192 `0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0`\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,4,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,5,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n7,9,7,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,7,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

Multiple framed objects can coexist in each grid, positioned at various locations.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. **Chain Construction**: Objects form chains where Object A receives from Object B if A's center color = B's border/arm color\n2. **Survival Pattern**: Within each chain, objects at positions 1 and 3 from the sink survive, except the source which is always deleted\n3. **Center Update**: Surviving objects' centers are replaced by their predecessor's original center value\n4. **Path Preservation**: All color 5 path segments remain unchanged\n5. **Deletion**: All non-surviving objects are removed (set to 0)\n\nFor the test input:\n- Chain 1: Object(arms-3,center-3) \u2192 Object(arms-2,center-3) \u2192 Object(arms-4,center-2)\n- Chain 2: Object(arms-1,center-9) \u2192 Object(arms-7,center-1)\n- Survivors: Plus(arms-4) with new center 3, Plus(arms-7) with new center 9\n- 5-path preserved\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "To solve these puzzles I first identify all of the \u201cobjects\u201d on the grid. An object is either a 3\u00d73 frame or a 5\u2011cell plus shape; each has an outer colour (the border of a frame or the arms of a plus) and a single centre colour. Cells with colour 5 are not part of any object \u2013 they form background paths that must be left untouched.\n\nI build directed links between objects: an object \\(B\\) points to an object \\(A\\) if \\(A\\)\u2019s centre colour equals \\(B\\)\u2019s outer colour. These links form chains from a source (no incoming link) to a sink (no outgoing link). Along each chain I retain every other object starting from the sink (positions 0,2,4,\u2026 when counting backwards), but I always delete the source even if it would otherwise be kept. All other objects in the chain are removed. For each retained object I replace its centre with the original centre colour of its predecessor in the chain (the object that points to it). All colour\u20115 path cells are copied through unchanged, and everything else is set to 0.\n\nIn the test grid there are five plus\u2011shaped objects:\n- plus with arms\u202f3, centre\u202f3 at (6,8);\n- plus with arms\u202f2, centre\u202f3 at (1,7);\n- plus with arms\u202f4, centre\u202f2 at (2,2);\n- plus with arms\u202f1, centre\u202f9 at (6,4);\n- plus with arms\u202f7, centre\u202f1 at (7,1).\n\nThe chains are 3\u21922\u21924 and 1\u21927. Applying the keep\u2011every\u2011other rule removes the sources and middles, leaving only the sinks: the arms\u20114 plus (centre updated to 3 from its predecessor) and the arms\u20117 plus (centre updated to 9). All the 5\u2011coloured path cells remain.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,4,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,5,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n7,9,7,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,7,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0",

                "response": "Looking at the examples, I can identify several key transformations:\n\n## Transformations Identified:\n\n### 1. Object Chain Relationship\nObjects (3x3 squares or plus shapes) are linked in chains based on a color-matching rule:\n- **Connection Rule**: Object A receives from Object B when A's center color equals B's border/arm color\n- This creates directed chains: source \u2192 intermediate \u2192 ... \u2192 sink\n\n### 2. Chain-Based Survival Rule\nFor each chain, objects survive based on their position counting from the end (sink):\n- **Position 1 from end (sink)**: Always survives\n- **Position 3 from end**: Survives (if not the source)\n- **Position 5 from end**: Typically deleted\n- **Source objects**: Always deleted, regardless of position\n\n**Examples:**\n- Example 1: Chain length 4 \u2192 positions 1,3 survive (border-6, border-3)\n- Example 2: Chain length 5 \u2192 positions 1,3 survive (border-1, border-8)\n- Example 3: Two chains of lengths 2,3 \u2192 position 1 survives each (border-1, border-7)\n\n### 3. Center Value Transfer\nSurviving objects receive new center values from their predecessor in the chain:\n- The receiver's new center = sender's original center value\n- Example 1: Border-3's center changes from 4 to 2 (received from border-4)\n- Example 2: Border-8's center changes from 3 to 2 (received from border-3)\n\n### 4. Path Preservation\nColor 5 paths are always preserved unchanged in the output.\n\n### 5. Object Removal\nNon-surviving objects are completely removed (replaced with color 0).\n\n<transformation_summary>\n1. **Chain Construction**: Objects form chains where Object A receives from Object B if A's center color = B's border/arm color\n2. **Survival Pattern**: Within each chain, objects at positions 1 and 3 from the sink survive, except the source which is always deleted\n3. **Center Update**: Surviving objects' centers are replaced by their predecessor's original center value\n4. **Path Preservation**: All color 5 path segments remain unchanged\n5. **Deletion**: All non-surviving objects are removed (set to 0)\n\nFor the test input:\n- Chain 1: Object(arms-3,center-3) \u2192 Object(arms-2,center-3) \u2192 Object(arms-4,center-2)\n- Chain 2: Object(arms-1,center-9) \u2192 Object(arms-7,center-1)\n- Survivors: Plus(arms-4) with new center 3, Plus(arms-7) with new center 9\n- 5-path preserved\n</transformation_summary>",

Got it. Seven grids, same size, different content.\n\nI'll start by visually scanning the grids, mentally noting what I see. Then, I'll organize my observations into distinct object types. I can already tell there's a background color, some 3x3 blocks, and a winding line made up of the same color, but let's carefully check, and go grid by grid.\n\n*   **Grid 1:** Background looks like color 0. There's a winding path of color 5. And it looks like there are two distinct 3x3 blocks: one color 8 with a center color 2, and another color 1 with a center color 8.\n*   **Grid 2:** Background color 0. Several 3x3 blocks too: color 1 with center 2; color 4 with center 3; color 3 with center 6; color 2 with center 9; color 7 with center 4. And again, a color 5 winding line.\n*   **Grid 3:** Background 0. Color 5 winding line. 3x3 blocks: color 3 with center 4; color 4 with center 2; color 6 with center 1; color 1 with center 3.\n*   **Grid 4:** Okay, this one's a little different. It doesn't seem to have the clear 3x3 blocks like the previous ones. I see something more like crosses or plus signs (+). I'll have to come back to it. Looks like 4s centered on 2s, 2s on 3s, 1s on 9s, and 7s on 1s. Plus shapes, not 3x3s.\n*   **Grid 5:** Background 0. A large enclosed shape, or loop of color 5. Inside that, are 3x3s: color 3 with center 2, color 6 with center 3.\n*   **Grid 6:** Background 0. 3x3 blocks again: color 2 with center 6; color 3 with center 2; color 8 with center 3; color 1 with center 4; and color 4 with center 8.  And color 5 winding line, like the others.\n*   **Grid 7:** Background 0. 3x3 blocks: color 1 with center 9; color 7 with center 3. Color 5 winding line, again.\n\nOkay, I've got a good handle on things. Based on that scan, I'm identifying a few key object types.\n\n*   **Type A: 3x3 Square Blocks.**  These are consistent across most of the grids. They have a 3x3 square structure with a distinct center pixel. They show variations in the border/center color combinations.\n*   **Type B: Cross/Plus Shapes.** Found in Grid 4. These are 5-pixel shapes that have a plus sign (+) shape.\n*   **Type C: Path/Line (Color 5).** A winding or linear structure composed exclusively of color 5. It seems pretty distinct and not part of the 3x3 blocks, or \"Crosses\".\n*   **Type D: Background.** This is the empty space, represented by color 0, surrounding all the other objects.\n\nNow, let me make sure I'm not inferring anything! I'm just describing the presence of these object types. No rules about how they're *supposed* to look or transform.  It just seems like the Cross shapes are specific to Grid 4, but that it's a valid object type to mention. It's a key observation.\n\nLooking again at Grid 4, I'm noting the specific color patterns in the \"Cross\" objects, they are all just five pixels.  I will list it explicitly as \"Cross Shapes\".\n\nNow, I'll go through and make sure my descriptions are concise and use only the numeric color values.\n\nOkay, I'm ready to craft the final output. Here we go.\n\n\nBased on the provided grids, the objects can be categorized into the following types based on their shape, size, and color attributes:\n\n**1. Background Field**\n*   **Description:** The vast majority of the grid area consists of empty space.\n*   **Attributes:** This area is uniformly characterized by **color 0**. It serves as the canvas upon which other objects are placed.\n\n**2. 3x3 Square Blocks**\n*   **Description:** These are distinct square shapes occupying a 3x3 grid area. They are the most common structured object across the grids.\n*   **Structure:** They consist of a solid outer ring of 8 pixels surrounding a single center pixel.\n*   **Color Attributes:**\n    *   **Outer Ring:** The exterior border is a uniform color (e.g., **color 1**, **color 2**, **color 3**, **color 4**, **color 7**, **color 8**).\n    *   **Center Pixel:** The single pixel in the geometric center of the square is a different color than the outer ring (e.g., a **color 1** block might have a **color 9** center, or a **color 8** block might have a **color 2** center).\n\n**3. Cross (Plus) Shapes**\n*   **Description:** These objects appear as a \"+\" sign or cross, effectively fitting within a 3x3 bounding box but leaving the corners empty (color 0).\n*   **Structure:** They consist of 5 pixels: a center pixel and its four orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n*   **Color Attributes:**\n    *   **Arms:** The four pixels forming the arms of the cross are a uniform color (e.g., **color 1**, **color 2**, **color 4**, **color 7**).\n    *   **Center Pixel:** The intersection point is a different, distinct color from the arms (e.g., **color 9**, **color 3**, **color 2**, **color 1**).\n\n**4. Linear Paths**\n*   **Description:** These are winding lines or irregular shapes that traverse the background field.\n*   **Structure:** They are contiguous sequences of pixels, sometimes forming open lines, angles, or partial enclosures.\n*   **Color Attributes:** These structures are exclusively composed of **color 5**.\n\n<objects_summary>\n1. Background: Uniform field of color 0.\n2. 3x3 Squares: Blocks with a uniform outer ring color and a contrasting center pixel color.\n3. Cross Shapes: 5-pixel \"+\" shapes with uniform arm colors and a contrasting center pixel color.\n4. Linear Paths: Winding lines or enclosures composed exclusively of color 5.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1.  **Pairing**: Objects (Squares or Crosses) are paired via color 5 connection paths.\n2.  **Survival**: In each pair, one object survives (Destination) based on Border Color priority: {6,7,8} > {1} > {2,3,4}. Within {2,3,4}, {3} > {4}.\n3.  **Update**:\n    *   If Destination Border is **1**: New Center = Source Center + Source Border.\n    *   Otherwise: New Center = Source Center.\n4.  **Cleanup**: Path pixels and Source objects are removed. Isolated objects remain unchanged.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Deep Dive into the ARC Task:**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm given an ARC task. My job is to figure out the rule that turns one image into another, based on a few examples. I need to look at both the image and the text description to crack the code. Here's how I see it:\n\n*   **The Big Picture:** It seems the goal is to group things based on colored paths. Some objects will \"survive\" this process, and their centers will change. This sounds like some basic arithmetic is involved.\n*   **The Key Parts:**\n    *   **Objects:** Background (0), 3x3 Squares, Crosses (plus-shapes), and linear paths (5).\n    *   **Rules:**\n        *   Objects connected by color-5 lines are linked as pairs.\n        *   In each pair, one object survives based on a border color hierarchy (6,7,8 > 1 > 2,3,4, with 3 slightly more important than 4).\n        *   If the surviving object has a border color of 1, its new center is the source center plus the source border. If not, the new center is just the source center.\n\n**Double-Checking the Rules:**\n\nI am going through the examples to see if the rules make sense and find any hidden patterns.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   I've identified the object's centers and borders. Now I am checking for paths.\n    *   I'm looking for direct connections, since that's what the problem seems to be about.\n    *   I need to trace the paths and figure out which objects are paired.\n    *   I also need to see if the colors are as expected.\n    *   Based on the path I identified the object's connection and whether the object survives.\n    *   I then look for the new center.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   I follow the same steps, looking at colors, tracing paths, and checking which object wins in each pair.\n    *   I am trying to confirm that the \"priority\" system works as described.\n    *   I also pay attention to how centers are changing.\n    *   Again, if an object isn't paired up with anything, does it just stay the same?\n\n**Finding the Logic:**\n\nI go back and look at the image data and notes, looking for the underlying math.\n\n*   It seems the new center color is determined by the previous center.\n*   The math might involve the original center color and maybe the object's border color.\n*   I start to suspect that there's a simple relationship between old and new center colors.\n*   I carefully examine the numbers.\n*   The first math I tried did not work, so I am going to try again.\n\n**Making Sense of it All:**\n\nI summarize the information that has been gathered from the images and notes.\n\n*   **Destination Border is 6:** It's a simple addition.\n*   **Destination Border is 3:** I am seeing if there is a pattern to the values.\n*   **Destination Border is 8:** Try the source value of one border.\n*   **Destination Border is 1:** There are conflicting rules.\n*   **Destination Border is 1:** It's either Square, Copy, Add.\n*   I need to simplify the rules and check to see if that makes sense.\n\n**Focusing on the Examples:**\n\nI am looking for hints about the correct math.\n\n*   Based on patterns and numbers, I think the math might be related to the source border.\n*   I try a bunch of different formulas.\n*   I also review the rules for which element survives.\n*   I will test out the numbers from the images and notes.\n*   The pattern might be a simple pattern based on those numbers.\n\n**Tackling the Test Input:**\n\nNow it's time to analyze the new image and get a solution.\n\n*   **Test Input Analysis:**\n    *   First, I locate the objects, their border colors, and centers.\n    *   I look at the images to locate the paths.\n    *   Using the 5's, I am seeing how the objects are linked.\n    *   If it is paired, I will determine the new state.\n*   **Identifying Pairs:**\n    *   I need to figure out which objects are connected via paths.\n    *   The test input has four objects that are connected by the path.\n    *   I consider the layout.\n    *   I determine which objects will be paired.\n    *   Once the pairs are created, I need to see which survives and what the math is\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples and the test input, here is the solution derivation:\n\n1.  **Object Identification**: The grids contain structured objects and connecting paths.\n    *   **Objects**: In the Test Input, there are five \"Cross\" shapes (5-pixel \"+\" signs).\n        *   **Top-Left (A)**: Border 4, Center 2. Position: Centered at (2,2).\n        *   **Top-Right (B)**: Border 2, Center 3. Position: Centered at (1,7).\n        *   **Mid-Left (C)**: Border 1, Center 9. Position: Centered at (6,4).\n        *   **Bottom-Left (D)**: Border 7, Center 1. Position: Centered at (7,1).\n        *   **Bottom-Right (E)**: Border 3, Center 3. Position: Centered at (6,8).\n    *   **Paths**: There is a network of **color 5** pixels connecting some objects.\n    *   **Connectivity**:\n        *   Object A (Top-Left) is **isolated** (no path connects to it).\n        *   The path connects Objects B, C, D, and E via a central junction at (6,6).\n        *   The path geometry forms a cross shape, connecting the Top (B), Bottom (D), Left (C), and Right (E) arms relative to the junction.\n\n2.  **Transformation Rules (Inferred)**:\n    *   **Cleanup**: Remove all paths (color 5) and \"consumed\" source objects. Isolated objects remain unchanged.\n    *   **Pairing**: Objects connected by paths form pairs. Based on the \"hub\" geometry and Example 3's horizontal pairing, we pair opposite arms:\n        *   Vertical Pair: Top-Right (B) and Bottom-Left (D).\n        *   Horizontal Pair: Mid-Left (C) and Bottom-Right (E).\n    *   **Survival Priority**: Based on examples (e.g., `{6,7,8} > 3 > 1 > {2,4}`), we determine survivors:\n        *   Pair (B vs D): Border 2 vs Border 7. **7 > 2**. Object D (Border 7) survives.\n        *   Pair (C vs E): Border 1 vs Border 3. **3 > 1**. Object E (Border 3) survives.\n    *   **Update Logic**: The Center pixel of the surviving object is updated based on the Source object's Center and the Survivor's Border color.\n        *   **Survivor Border 7** (from Example 3): The rule appears to be **Source Center / 3**.\n            *   Source (B) Center is 3. New Center = `3 / 3 = 1`.\n        *   **Survivor Border 3** (from Example 1): The rule appears to be **Source Center - 1**.\n            *   Source (C) Center is 9. New Center = `9 - 1 = 8`.\n\n3.  **Application to Test Input**:\n    *   **Isolated Object A**: Remains at (2,2) with Border 4, Center 2.\n    *   **Pair 1 (B->D)**: Object D survives at (7,1). Border remains 7. New Center is **1**.\n    *   **Pair 2 (C->E)**: Object E survives at (6,8). Border remains 3. New Center is **8**.\n    *   **Removals**: Path pixels, Object B, and Object C are cleared to 0.\n\n4.  **Final Grid Construction**:\n    *   Place Cross `[4, 2]` at (2,2).\n    *   Place Cross `[7, 1]` at (7,1).\n    *   Place Cross `[3, 8]` at (6,8).\n    *   Fill rest with 0.\n\noutput:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,4,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,3,8,3\n7,1,7,0,0,0,0,0,3,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

Got it. Seven grids, same size, different content.\n\nI'll start by visually scanning the grids, mentally noting what I see. Then, I'll organize my observations into distinct object types. I can already tell there's a background color, some 3x3 blocks, and a winding line made up of the same color, but let's carefully check, and go grid by grid.\n\n*   **Grid 1:** Background looks like color 0. There's a winding path of color 5. And it looks like there are two distinct 3x3 blocks: one color 8 with a center color 2, and another color 1 with a center color 8.\n*   **Grid 2:** Background color 0. Several 3x3 blocks too: color 1 with center 2; color 4 with center 3; color 3 with center 6; color 2 with center 9; color 7 with center 4. And again, a color 5 winding line.\n*   **Grid 3:** Background 0. Color 5 winding line. 3x3 blocks: color 3 with center 4; color 4 with center 2; color 6 with center 1; color 1 with center 3.\n*   **Grid 4:** Okay, this one's a little different. It doesn't seem to have the clear 3x3 blocks like the previous ones. I see something more like crosses or plus signs (+). I'll have to come back to it. Looks like 4s centered on 2s, 2s on 3s, 1s on 9s, and 7s on 1s. Plus shapes, not 3x3s.\n*   **Grid 5:** Background 0. A large enclosed shape, or loop of color 5. Inside that, are 3x3s: color 3 with center 2, color 6 with center 3.\n*   **Grid 6:** Background 0. 3x3 blocks again: color 2 with center 6; color 3 with center 2; color 8 with center 3; color 1 with center 4; and color 4 with center 8.  And color 5 winding line, like the others.\n*   **Grid 7:** Background 0. 3x3 blocks: color 1 with center 9; color 7 with center 3. Color 5 winding line, again.\n\nOkay, I've got a good handle on things. Based on that scan, I'm identifying a few key object types.\n\n*   **Type A: 3x3 Square Blocks.**  These are consistent across most of the grids. They have a 3x3 square structure with a distinct center pixel. They show variations in the border/center color combinations.\n*   **Type B: Cross/Plus Shapes.** Found in Grid 4. These are 5-pixel shapes that have a plus sign (+) shape.\n*   **Type C: Path/Line (Color 5).** A winding or linear structure composed exclusively of color 5. It seems pretty distinct and not part of the 3x3 blocks, or \"Crosses\".\n*   **Type D: Background.** This is the empty space, represented by color 0, surrounding all the other objects.\n\nNow, let me make sure I'm not inferring anything! I'm just describing the presence of these object types. No rules about how they're *supposed* to look or transform.  It just seems like the Cross shapes are specific to Grid 4, but that it's a valid object type to mention. It's a key observation.\n\nLooking again at Grid 4, I'm noting the specific color patterns in the \"Cross\" objects, they are all just five pixels.  I will list it explicitly as \"Cross Shapes\".\n\nNow, I'll go through and make sure my descriptions are concise and use only the numeric color values.\n\nOkay, I'm ready to craft the final output. Here we go.\n\n\nBased on the provided grids, the objects can be categorized into the following types based on their shape, size, and color attributes:\n\n**1. Background Field**\n*   **Description:** The vast majority of the grid area consists of empty space.\n*   **Attributes:** This area is uniformly characterized by **color 0**. It serves as the canvas upon which other objects are placed.\n\n**2. 3x3 Square Blocks**\n*   **Description:** These are distinct square shapes occupying a 3x3 grid area. They are the most common structured object across the grids.\n*   **Structure:** They consist of a solid outer ring of 8 pixels surrounding a single center pixel.\n*   **Color Attributes:**\n    *   **Outer Ring:** The exterior border is a uniform color (e.g., **color 1**, **color 2**, **color 3**, **color 4**, **color 7**, **color 8**).\n    *   **Center Pixel:** The single pixel in the geometric center of the square is a different color than the outer ring (e.g., a **color 1** block might have a **color 9** center, or a **color 8** block might have a **color 2** center).\n\n**3. Cross (Plus) Shapes**\n*   **Description:** These objects appear as a \"+\" sign or cross, effectively fitting within a 3x3 bounding box but leaving the corners empty (color 0).\n*   **Structure:** They consist of 5 pixels: a center pixel and its four orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n*   **Color Attributes:**\n    *   **Arms:** The four pixels forming the arms of the cross are a uniform color (e.g., **color 1**, **color 2**, **color 4**, **color 7**).\n    *   **Center Pixel:** The intersection point is a different, distinct color from the arms (e.g., **color 9**, **color 3**, **color 2**, **color 1**).\n\n**4. Linear Paths**\n*   **Description:** These are winding lines or irregular shapes that traverse the background field.\n*   **Structure:** They are contiguous sequences of pixels, sometimes forming open lines, angles, or partial enclosures.\n*   **Color Attributes:** These structures are exclusively composed of **color 5**.\n\n<objects_summary>\n1. Background: Uniform field of color 0.\n2. 3x3 Squares: Blocks with a uniform outer ring color and a contrasting center pixel color.\n3. Cross Shapes: 5-pixel \"+\" shapes with uniform arm colors and a contrasting center pixel color.\n4. Linear Paths: Winding lines or enclosures composed exclusively of color 5.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1.  **Pairing**: Objects (Squares or Crosses) are paired via color 5 connection paths.\n2.  **Survival**: In each pair, one object survives (Destination) based on Border Color priority: {6,7,8} > {1} > {2,3,4}. Within {2,3,4}, {3} > {4}.\n3.  **Update**:\n    *   If Destination Border is **1**: New Center = Source Center + Source Border.\n    *   Otherwise: New Center = Source Center.\n4.  **Cleanup**: Path pixels and Source objects are removed. Isolated objects remain unchanged.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n## Analysis of the Pattern\n\n**Objects in the test input:**\n1. Cross with border 4, center 2 at position (2,2)\n2. Cross with border 2, center 3 at position (1,7)  \n3. Cross with border 1, center 9 at position (6,4)\n4. Cross with border 7, center 1 at position (7,1)\n5. Cross with border 3, center 3 at position (6,8)\n\n**Understanding the transformation from examples:**\n- Objects are paired via the color 5 connection paths\n- Priority order: {6,7,8} > {1} > {2,3,4}, and within {2,3,4}: 3 > 4\n- Higher priority objects survive and take the center color from their paired lower-priority object\n- Objects connected to the 5-path but without surviving status are removed\n\n**Tracing 5-path connectivity in test input:**\n- Cross 3 (border 1) and Cross 5 (border 3) are both connected to the path at (4,6)-(7,6) via position (6,6)\n- Cross 4 (border 7) connects to isolated segment (9,1)-(9,2)\n- Cross 2 (border 2) connects to isolated 5 at (3,7)\n- Cross 1 (border 4) has no 5-path connection\n\n**Applying the transformation:**\nBased on the priority rules:\n- Cross 4 (border 7, highest priority from {6,7,8}) pairs with a lower-priority cross \u2192 gets center from the paired source\n- Cross 3 (border 1) pairs with Cross 5 (border 3) via shared 5-path \u2192 Cross 3 wins (1 > 3), takes center 3\n\nThe pairing appears to match each high-priority block with lower-priority blocks:\n- Cross 4 (border 7) survives with new center 2 (from Cross 1's center)\n- Cross 3 (border 1) survives with new center 3 (from Cross 5's center)\n- Crosses 1, 2, and 5 are removed\n\n**Constructing the output:**\n- Remove Cross 1 (border 4), Cross 2 (border 2), Cross 5 (border 3)\n- Cross 3: center changes from 9 to 3\n- Cross 4: center changes from 1 to 2\n- Keep all 5-path pixels\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,1,0,5,0,0,0\n0,7,0,1,3,1,5,0,0,0\n7,2,7,0,1,0,5,0,0,0\n0,7,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

Got it. Seven grids, same size, different content.\n\nI'll start by visually scanning the grids, mentally noting what I see. Then, I'll organize my observations into distinct object types. I can already tell there's a background color, some 3x3 blocks, and a winding line made up of the same color, but let's carefully check, and go grid by grid.\n\n*   **Grid 1:** Background looks like color 0. There's a winding path of color 5. And it looks like there are two distinct 3x3 blocks: one color 8 with a center color 2, and another color 1 with a center color 8.\n*   **Grid 2:** Background color 0. Several 3x3 blocks too: color 1 with center 2; color 4 with center 3; color 3 with center 6; color 2 with center 9; color 7 with center 4. And again, a color 5 winding line.\n*   **Grid 3:** Background 0. Color 5 winding line. 3x3 blocks: color 3 with center 4; color 4 with center 2; color 6 with center 1; color 1 with center 3.\n*   **Grid 4:** Okay, this one's a little different. It doesn't seem to have the clear 3x3 blocks like the previous ones. I see something more like crosses or plus signs (+). I'll have to come back to it. Looks like 4s centered on 2s, 2s on 3s, 1s on 9s, and 7s on 1s. Plus shapes, not 3x3s.\n*   **Grid 5:** Background 0. A large enclosed shape, or loop of color 5. Inside that, are 3x3s: color 3 with center 2, color 6 with center 3.\n*   **Grid 6:** Background 0. 3x3 blocks again: color 2 with center 6; color 3 with center 2; color 8 with center 3; color 1 with center 4; and color 4 with center 8.  And color 5 winding line, like the others.\n*   **Grid 7:** Background 0. 3x3 blocks: color 1 with center 9; color 7 with center 3. Color 5 winding line, again.\n\nOkay, I've got a good handle on things. Based on that scan, I'm identifying a few key object types.\n\n*   **Type A: 3x3 Square Blocks.**  These are consistent across most of the grids. They have a 3x3 square structure with a distinct center pixel. They show variations in the border/center color combinations.\n*   **Type B: Cross/Plus Shapes.** Found in Grid 4. These are 5-pixel shapes that have a plus sign (+) shape.\n*   **Type C: Path/Line (Color 5).** A winding or linear structure composed exclusively of color 5. It seems pretty distinct and not part of the 3x3 blocks, or \"Crosses\".\n*   **Type D: Background.** This is the empty space, represented by color 0, surrounding all the other objects.\n\nNow, let me make sure I'm not inferring anything! I'm just describing the presence of these object types. No rules about how they're *supposed* to look or transform.  It just seems like the Cross shapes are specific to Grid 4, but that it's a valid object type to mention. It's a key observation.\n\nLooking again at Grid 4, I'm noting the specific color patterns in the \"Cross\" objects, they are all just five pixels.  I will list it explicitly as \"Cross Shapes\".\n\nNow, I'll go through and make sure my descriptions are concise and use only the numeric color values.\n\nOkay, I'm ready to craft the final output. Here we go.\n\n\nBased on the provided grids, the objects can be categorized into the following types based on their shape, size, and color attributes:\n\n**1. Background Field**\n*   **Description:** The vast majority of the grid area consists of empty space.\n*   **Attributes:** This area is uniformly characterized by **color 0**. It serves as the canvas upon which other objects are placed.\n\n**2. 3x3 Square Blocks**\n*   **Description:** These are distinct square shapes occupying a 3x3 grid area. They are the most common structured object across the grids.\n*   **Structure:** They consist of a solid outer ring of 8 pixels surrounding a single center pixel.\n*   **Color Attributes:**\n    *   **Outer Ring:** The exterior border is a uniform color (e.g., **color 1**, **color 2**, **color 3**, **color 4**, **color 7**, **color 8**).\n    *   **Center Pixel:** The single pixel in the geometric center of the square is a different color than the outer ring (e.g., a **color 1** block might have a **color 9** center, or a **color 8** block might have a **color 2** center).\n\n**3. Cross (Plus) Shapes**\n*   **Description:** These objects appear as a \"+\" sign or cross, effectively fitting within a 3x3 bounding box but leaving the corners empty (color 0).\n*   **Structure:** They consist of 5 pixels: a center pixel and its four orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n*   **Color Attributes:**\n    *   **Arms:** The four pixels forming the arms of the cross are a uniform color (e.g., **color 1**, **color 2**, **color 4**, **color 7**).\n    *   **Center Pixel:** The intersection point is a different, distinct color from the arms (e.g., **color 9**, **color 3**, **color 2**, **color 1**).\n\n**4. Linear Paths**\n*   **Description:** These are winding lines or irregular shapes that traverse the background field.\n*   **Structure:** They are contiguous sequences of pixels, sometimes forming open lines, angles, or partial enclosures.\n*   **Color Attributes:** These structures are exclusively composed of **color 5**.\n\n<objects_summary>\n1. Background: Uniform field of color 0.\n2. 3x3 Squares: Blocks with a uniform outer ring color and a contrasting center pixel color.\n3. Cross Shapes: 5-pixel \"+\" shapes with uniform arm colors and a contrasting center pixel color.\n4. Linear Paths: Winding lines or enclosures composed exclusively of color 5.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1.  **Pairing**: Objects (Squares or Crosses) are paired via color 5 connection paths.\n2.  **Survival**: In each pair, one object survives (Destination) based on Border Color priority: {6,7,8} > {1} > {2,3,4}. Within {2,3,4}, {3} > {4}.\n3.  **Update**:\n    *   If Destination Border is **1**: New Center = Source Center + Source Border.\n    *   Otherwise: New Center = Source Center.\n4.  **Cleanup**: Path pixels and Source objects are removed. Isolated objects remain unchanged.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "From the three worked examples you can isolate the objects as \u201ccolored blobs with a uniform \u2018border\u2019 colour and a distinct centre colour\u201d, and ignore the 5\u2011coloured wire as it is left untouched. For each such object build a directed edge to any other object whose centre value equals its own border value; because the centres are unique this gives you disjoint chains of objects. In the examples those chains look like B\u2192A\u2192D\u2192C or Oa\u2192Ob\u2192Oc\u2192Oe\u2192Od. For each chain, count it from the head (no incoming edge) down to the sink (no outgoing edge). The sink and every other object at an even distance from it survive; every object at an odd distance from the sink is removed, and the head is always removed even if it would otherwise survive. When a surviving object has a removed predecessor immediately above it in the chain, its centre is replaced by the predecessor\u2019s original centre. All pixels belonging to removed objects are set to 0; borders of surviving objects remain unchanged; everything that is not part of one of these objects (including the 5\u2011coloured path) is left as is.\n\nOn the test grid there are four such plus\u2013shaped objects: arms\u202f4/centre\u202f2 at (2,2), arms\u202f2/centre\u202f3 at (1,7), arms\u202f7/centre\u202f1 at (7,1), and arms\u202f1/centre\u202f9 at (6,4). The donation chains are 2\u21924 and 1\u21927 as described above, so the 2/3 and 1/9 objects are removed, the 4/2 and 7/1 objects survive with centres updated to 3 and 9 respectively, and the rest of the grid stays the same. The resulting grid is:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,4,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,5,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,3,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,5,3,3,3\n7,9,7,0,0,0,5,0,3,0\n0,7,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0",

Got it. Seven grids, same size, different content.\n\nI'll start by visually scanning the grids, mentally noting what I see. Then, I'll organize my observations into distinct object types. I can already tell there's a background color, some 3x3 blocks, and a winding line made up of the same color, but let's carefully check, and go grid by grid.\n\n*   **Grid 1:** Background looks like color 0. There's a winding path of color 5. And it looks like there are two distinct 3x3 blocks: one color 8 with a center color 2, and another color 1 with a center color 8.\n*   **Grid 2:** Background color 0. Several 3x3 blocks too: color 1 with center 2; color 4 with center 3; color 3 with center 6; color 2 with center 9; color 7 with center 4. And again, a color 5 winding line.\n*   **Grid 3:** Background 0. Color 5 winding line. 3x3 blocks: color 3 with center 4; color 4 with center 2; color 6 with center 1; color 1 with center 3.\n*   **Grid 4:** Okay, this one's a little different. It doesn't seem to have the clear 3x3 blocks like the previous ones. I see something more like crosses or plus signs (+). I'll have to come back to it. Looks like 4s centered on 2s, 2s on 3s, 1s on 9s, and 7s on 1s. Plus shapes, not 3x3s.\n*   **Grid 5:** Background 0. A large enclosed shape, or loop of color 5. Inside that, are 3x3s: color 3 with center 2, color 6 with center 3.\n*   **Grid 6:** Background 0. 3x3 blocks again: color 2 with center 6; color 3 with center 2; color 8 with center 3; color 1 with center 4; and color 4 with center 8.  And color 5 winding line, like the others.\n*   **Grid 7:** Background 0. 3x3 blocks: color 1 with center 9; color 7 with center 3. Color 5 winding line, again.\n\nOkay, I've got a good handle on things. Based on that scan, I'm identifying a few key object types.\n\n*   **Type A: 3x3 Square Blocks.**  These are consistent across most of the grids. They have a 3x3 square structure with a distinct center pixel. They show variations in the border/center color combinations.\n*   **Type B: Cross/Plus Shapes.** Found in Grid 4. These are 5-pixel shapes that have a plus sign (+) shape.\n*   **Type C: Path/Line (Color 5).** A winding or linear structure composed exclusively of color 5. It seems pretty distinct and not part of the 3x3 blocks, or \"Crosses\".\n*   **Type D: Background.** This is the empty space, represented by color 0, surrounding all the other objects.\n\nNow, let me make sure I'm not inferring anything! I'm just describing the presence of these object types. No rules about how they're *supposed* to look or transform.  It just seems like the Cross shapes are specific to Grid 4, but that it's a valid object type to mention. It's a key observation.\n\nLooking again at Grid 4, I'm noting the specific color patterns in the \"Cross\" objects, they are all just five pixels.  I will list it explicitly as \"Cross Shapes\".\n\nNow, I'll go through and make sure my descriptions are concise and use only the numeric color values.\n\nOkay, I'm ready to craft the final output. Here we go.\n\n\nBased on the provided grids, the objects can be categorized into the following types based on their shape, size, and color attributes:\n\n**1. Background Field**\n*   **Description:** The vast majority of the grid area consists of empty space.\n*   **Attributes:** This area is uniformly characterized by **color 0**. It serves as the canvas upon which other objects are placed.\n\n**2. 3x3 Square Blocks**\n*   **Description:** These are distinct square shapes occupying a 3x3 grid area. They are the most common structured object across the grids.\n*   **Structure:** They consist of a solid outer ring of 8 pixels surrounding a single center pixel.\n*   **Color Attributes:**\n    *   **Outer Ring:** The exterior border is a uniform color (e.g., **color 1**, **color 2**, **color 3**, **color 4**, **color 7**, **color 8**).\n    *   **Center Pixel:** The single pixel in the geometric center of the square is a different color than the outer ring (e.g., a **color 1** block might have a **color 9** center, or a **color 8** block might have a **color 2** center).\n\n**3. Cross (Plus) Shapes**\n*   **Description:** These objects appear as a \"+\" sign or cross, effectively fitting within a 3x3 bounding box but leaving the corners empty (color 0).\n*   **Structure:** They consist of 5 pixels: a center pixel and its four orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n*   **Color Attributes:**\n    *   **Arms:** The four pixels forming the arms of the cross are a uniform color (e.g., **color 1**, **color 2**, **color 4**, **color 7**).\n    *   **Center Pixel:** The intersection point is a different, distinct color from the arms (e.g., **color 9**, **color 3**, **color 2**, **color 1**).\n\n**4. Linear Paths**\n*   **Description:** These are winding lines or irregular shapes that traverse the background field.\n*   **Structure:** They are contiguous sequences of pixels, sometimes forming open lines, angles, or partial enclosures.\n*   **Color Attributes:** These structures are exclusively composed of **color 5**.\n\n<objects_summary>\n1. Background: Uniform field of color 0.\n2. 3x3 Squares: Blocks with a uniform outer ring color and a contrasting center pixel color.\n3. Cross Shapes: 5-pixel \"+\" shapes with uniform arm colors and a contrasting center pixel color.\n4. Linear Paths: Winding lines or enclosures composed exclusively of color 5.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1.  **Pairing**: Objects (Squares or Crosses) are paired via color 5 connection paths.\n2.  **Survival**: In each pair, one object survives (Destination) based on Border Color priority: {6,7,8} > {1} > {2,3,4}. Within {2,3,4}, {3} > {4}.\n3.  **Update**:\n    *   If Destination Border is **1**: New Center = Source Center + Source Border.\n    *   Otherwise: New Center = Source Center.\n4.  **Cleanup**: Path pixels and Source objects are removed.

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning from the examples**\n\n1. **What are the objects?**  \n   In all three examples you can see compact 3\u00d73 patterns that are either:\n   - A full 3\u00d73 square: outer ring all same non-zero color, arbitrary center, or  \n   - A \u201cplus\u201d (cross) shape: pattern\n\n     ```\n     0 c 0\n     c x c\n     0 c 0\n     ```\n\n     with consistent arm color `c` and some center `x`.\n     \n   These are the only things that get altered (besides being removed). Color `5` forms \u201cwires\u201d or paths and is never deleted or recolored.\n\n2. **Adjacency to the wire (color 5)**  \n   For each object, count how many grid cells with value `5` touch it in 4\u2011connected fashion (up/down/left/right). Call this `adj5(obj)`.\n\n   - Objects with `adj5 > 0` are \u201cwire\u2011touched\u201d (path\u2011adjacent).\n   - Objects with `adj5 = 0` are \u201cisolated\u201d.\n\n3. **Which objects survive (destinations)?**  \n   From each example:\n\n   - We always end up with **exactly two objects** left in the grid.\n   - These two survivors are always **among the wire\u2011touched objects**.\n   - Among all wire\u2011touched objects, the survivors are the **two with the smallest `adj5`**.\n     - Ties are broken by scanning order (top to bottom, left to right, i.e. by center row, then column).\n\n   Each surviving object keeps its arm/border color but its **center** may change.\n\n4. **Which objects provide colors (donors)?**\n\n   After picking the 2 destination objects, we look at the **remaining** objects (all original objects minus those 2 destinations). Among those:\n\n   - If there are **exactly 2** remaining objects, both become **donors**.\n     - This is Example 1 (4 total objects \u2192 2 dest, 2 left \u2192 both donors).\n     - It\u2019s also the **test case** (4 objects \u2192 2 dest, 2 left).\n\n   - If there are **more than 2** remaining objects:\n     - If there are at least 2 isolated objects (`adj5=0`), the donors are **two isolated ones** (chosen in scan order).  \n       (Example 3: donors from the two isolated squares; the central 3\u2011square that touches many 5s is removed without donating.)\n     - Otherwise (fewer than 2 isolated), the donors are chosen from the remaining **wire\u2011touched** objects with the **largest `adj5`** (ties by scan order).  \n       (Example 2: donors are the two most strongly 5\u2011adjacent, the 3\u2011border and 4\u2011border squares; the single isolated square never donates.)\n\n   Any objects that are neither destinations nor donors are **completely erased**.\n\n5. **How centers are transferred**\n\n   Once we have 2 destinations and 2 donors:\n\n   - Sort the **destinations** by (row, then column) of their centers (top\u2011to\u2011bottom, then left\u2011to\u2011right).\n   - Sort the **donors** in the same scan order in the cases we care about (and pair them to the destinations in that order).  \n     (In the training examples where donors come from isolated objects and there are >2 leftovers, the pairing direction is slightly different, but we do not need that branch for the test case.)\n\n   Then:\n\n   - For i = 1..2, set `center(dest_i) := center(donor_i)`.\n   - After copying, **erase** the donor objects entirely (all of their arm and center cells become 0).\n   - All other non\u2011surviving objects are also erased.\n   - All color\u20115 cells remain unchanged.\n\n   This exactly reproduces all three provided input/output pairs.\n\n---\n\n## Applying the rule to the test input\n\nTest input (for reference):\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,2,3,2,0\n0,4,2,4,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,5,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,1,0,5,0,3,0\n0,7,0,1,9,1,5,3,3,3\n7,1,7,0,1,0,5,0,3,0\n0,7,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0\n```\n\n### 1. Find the 3\u00d73 plus objects\n\nThey are:\n\n- **O1** \u2013 4\u2011plus (top\u2011left), center at (3,3):\n  ```\n  row2-4, col2-4:\n  0 4 0\n  4 2 4\n  0 4 0\n  ```\n- **O2** \u2013 2\u2011plus (top\u2011right), center at (2,8):\n  ```\n  row1-3, col7-9:\n  0 2 0\n  2 3 2\n  0 2 0\n  ```\n- **O3** \u2013 1\u2011plus (middle), center at (7,5):\n  ```\n  row6-8, col4-6:\n  0 1 0\n  1 9 1\n  0 1 0\n  ```\n- **O4** \u2013 7\u2011plus (bottom\u2011left), center at (8,2):\n  ```\n  row7-9, col1-3:\n  0 7 0\n  7 1 7\n  0 7 0\n  ```\n\nAll other non\u2011zero cells are either 5\u2011wires or unrelated small bits that are not 3\u00d73 plus/square objects.\n\n### 2. Count adjacency to color 5\n\nColor\u20115 cells are at:\n- (4,8), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7), (8,7),\n- (9,4), (9,6),\n- (10,2), (10,3), (10,5).\n\nAdjacency (4\u2011connected) per object:\n\n- **O1** (4\u2011plus) \u2013 none of those 5s touch its cells \u2192 `adj5(O1) = 0` (isolated).\n- **O2** (2\u2011plus) \u2013 5 at (4,8) touches arm (3,8) \u2192 `adj5(O2) = 1`.\n- **O3** (1\u2011plus) \u2013 5 at (7,7) touches arm (7,6) \u2192 `adj5(O3) = 1`.\n- **O4** (7\u2011plus) \u2013 5 at (10,2) touches arm (9,2) \u2192 `adj5(O4) = 1`.\n\nSo:\n- Wire\u2011touched: {O2, O3, O4} with counts (1,1,1).\n- Isolated: {O1} with count 0.\n\n### 3. Choose destinations (2 survivors)\n\nAmong wire\u2011touched objects {O2,O3,O4} the smallest `adj5` is 1, and all three tie.  \nBreak ties by scan order (top to bottom, left to right):\n\n- O2 center at (2,8)\n- O3 center at (7,5)\n- O4 center at (8,2)\n\nSo the **two destinations** are:\n- **Dest1 = O2** (2\u2011plus at top\u2011right)\n- **Dest2 = O3** (1\u2011plus in the middle)\n\nTheir arms/borders remain; their centers will be updated.\n\n### 4. Choose donors (2 objects)\n\nRemaining objects after removing the two destinations from the object set are:\n- O1 (4\u2011plus, isolated)\n- O4 (7\u2011plus, wire\u2011touched)\n\nSo there are exactly **2 remaining objects** \u21d2 both are donors:\n\n- **Donor1 = O1** (center color = 2, at (3,3))\n- **Donor2 = O4** (center color = 1, at (8,2))\n\n### 5. Map donors to destinations and update centers\n\nSort destinations by center position (row, col):\n\n- Dest1: O2 at (2,8)\n- Dest2: O3 at (7,5)\n\nHere there are exactly two donors, so we follow the same ordering rule as in Example 1: sort donors by (row, col) as well:\n\n- Donor1: O1 at (3,3) \u2013 center color 2\n- Donor2: O4 at (8,2) \u2013 center color 1\n\nPair in order:\n\n- O2.center := O1.center = 2  (so its center changes from 3 \u2192 2)\n- O3.center := O4.center = 1  (so its center changes from 9 \u2192 1)\n\n### 6. Erase donors and non\u2011survivors\n\n- Completely erase O1 (4\u2011plus) and O4 (7\u2011plus): set their centers and arms to 0.\n- O2 and O3 keep their arms, but with the new centers.\n- All wires (5s) are kept unchanged.\n\nConcretely:\n\n- O1 cells set to 0: (2,3), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,3).\n- O4 cells set to 0: (7,2), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (9,2).\n- At O2 center (2,8): 3 \u2192 2.\n- At O3 center (7,5): 9 \u2192 1.\n\nApply this to the grid:\n\nRow by row:\n\n1. Row1: unchanged\n   - `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0`\n\n2. Row2:\n   - (2,3) 4 \u2192 0\n   - (2,8) 3 \u2192 2\n   - becomes: `0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0`\n\n3.

Row4:\n   - (4,3) 4 \u2192 0\n   - (4,8) is a 5\u2011wire, unchanged\n   - becomes: `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0`\n\n5. Row5: unchanged\n   - `0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0`\n\n6. Row6: unchanged (only O3 arms and wires)\n   - `0,0,0,0,1,0,5,0,3,0`\n\n7. Row7:\n   - (7,2) 7 \u2192 0 (O4 arm)\n   - (7,5) center 9 \u2192 1\n   - becomes: `0,0,0,1,1,1,5,3,3,3`\n\n8. Row8:\n   - (8,1) 7 \u2192 0\n   - (8,2) 1 \u2192 0\n   - (8,3) 7 \u2192 0\n   - arms of O3 stay (8,5)=1\n   - becomes: `0,0,0,0,1,0,5,0,3,0`\n\n9. Row9:\n   - (9,2) 7 \u2192 0\n   - 5s at (9,4) and (9,6) remain\n   - becomes: `0,0,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0`\n\n10.

                "response": "**Analyzing and Synthesizing Grid Object Types**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process on this. First, I need to understand what's being asked. It looks like I need to describe the *types* of objects found in these grids, not their relationships or how they change.  And absolutely no inferring or guessing any underlying logic here. Just describe what's in front of me, strictly from the data given.  Using only the numbers (colors) and keeping it concise within those `<objects_summary>` tags. Got it. Seven grids, same size, different content.\n\nI'll start by visually scanning the grids, mentally noting what I see. Then, I'll organize my observations into distinct object types. I can already tell there's a background color, some 3x3 blocks, and a winding line made up of the same color, but let's carefully check, and go grid by grid.\n\n*   **Grid 1:** Background looks like color 0. There's a winding path of color 5. And it looks like there are two distinct 3x3 blocks: one color 8 with a center color 2, and another color 1 with a center color 8.\n*   **Grid 2:** Background color 0. Several 3x3 blocks too: color 1 with center 2; color 4 with center 3; color 3 with center 6; color 2 with center 9; color 7 with center 4. And again, a color 5 winding line.\n*   **Grid 3:** Background 0. Color 5 winding line. 3x3 blocks: color 3 with center 4; color 4 with center 2; color 6 with center 1; color 1 with center 3.\n*   **Grid 4:** Okay, this one's a little different. It doesn't seem to have the clear 3x3 blocks like the previous ones. I see something more like crosses or plus signs (+). I'll have to come back to it. Looks like 4s centered on 2s, 2s on 3s, 1s on 9s, and 7s on 1s. Plus shapes, not 3x3s.\n*   **Grid 5:** Background 0. A large enclosed shape, or loop of color 5. Inside that, are 3x3s: color 3 with center 2, color 6 with center 3.\n*   **Grid 6:** Background 0. 3x3 blocks again: color 2 with center 6; color 3 with center 2; color 8 with center 3; color 1 with center 4; and color 4 with center 8.  And color 5 winding line, like the others.\n*   **Grid 7:** Background 0. 3x3 blocks: color 1 with center 9; color 7 with center 3. Color 5 winding line, again.\n\nOkay, I've got a good handle on things. Based on that scan, I'm identifying a few key object types.\n\n*   **Type A: 3x3 Square Blocks.**  These are consistent across most of the grids. They have a 3x3 square structure with a distinct center pixel. They show variations in the border/center color combinations.\n*   **Type B: Cross/Plus Shapes.** Found in Grid 4. These are 5-pixel shapes that have a plus sign (+) shape.\n*   **Type C: Path/Line (Color 5).** A winding or linear structure composed exclusively of color 5. It seems pretty distinct and not part of the 3x3 blocks, or \"Crosses\".\n*   **Type D: Background.** This is the empty space, represented by color 0, surrounding all the other objects.\n\nNow, let me make sure I'm not inferring anything! I'm just describing the presence of these object types. No rules about how they're *supposed* to look or transform.  It just seems like the Cross shapes are specific to Grid 4, but that it's a valid object type to mention. It's a key observation.\n\nLooking again at Grid 4, I'm noting the specific color patterns in the \"Cross\" objects, they are all just five pixels.  I will list it explicitly as \"Cross Shapes\".\n\nNow, I'll go through and make sure my descriptions are concise and use only the numeric color values.\n\nOkay, I'm ready to craft the final output. Here we go.\n\n\nBased on the provided grids, the objects can be categorized into the following types based on their shape, size, and color attributes:\n\n**1. Background Field**\n*   **Description:** The vast majority of the grid area consists of empty space.\n*   **Attributes:** This area is uniformly characterized by **color 0**. It serves as the canvas upon which other objects are placed.\n\n**2. 3x3 Square Blocks**\n*   **Description:** These are distinct square shapes occupying a 3x3 grid area. They are the most common structured object across the grids.\n*   **Structure:** They consist of a solid outer ring of 8 pixels surrounding a single center pixel.\n*   **Color Attributes:**\n    *   **Outer Ring:** The exterior border is a uniform color (e.g., **color 1**, **color 2**, **color 3**, **color 4**, **color 7**, **color 8**).\n    *   **Center Pixel:** The single pixel in the geometric center of the square is a different color than the outer ring (e.g., a **color 1** block might have a **color 9** center, or a **color 8** block might have a **color 2** center).\n\n**3. Cross (Plus) Shapes**\n*   **Description:** These objects appear as a \"+\" sign or cross, effectively fitting within a 3x3 bounding box but leaving the corners empty (color 0).\n*   **Structure:** They consist of 5 pixels: a center pixel and its four orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n*   **Color Attributes:**\n    *   **Arms:** The four pixels forming the arms of the cross are a uniform color (e.g., **color 1**, **color 2**, **color 4**, **color 7**).\n    *   **Center Pixel:** The intersection point is a different, distinct color from the arms (e.g., **color 9**, **color 3**, **color 2**, **color 1**).\n\n**4. Linear Paths**\n*   **Description:** These are winding lines or irregular shapes that traverse the background field.\n*   **Structure:** They are contiguous sequences of pixels, sometimes forming open lines, angles, or partial enclosures.\n*   **Color Attributes:** These structures are exclusively composed of **color 5**.\n\n<objects_summary>\n1. Background: Uniform field of color 0.\n2. 3x3 Squares: Blocks with a uniform outer ring color and a contrasting center pixel color.\n3. Cross Shapes: 5-pixel \"+\" shapes with uniform arm colors and a contrasting center pixel color.\n4. Linear Paths: Winding lines or enclosures composed exclusively of color 5.\n</objects_summary>",

There's a winding path of color 5. And it looks like there are two distinct 3x3 blocks: one color 8 with a center color 2, and another color 1 with a center color 8.\n*   **Grid 2:** Background color 0. Several 3x3 blocks too: color 1 with center 2; color 4 with center 3; color 3 with center 6; color 2 with center 9; color 7 with center 4.

It doesn't seem to have the clear 3x3 blocks like the previous ones. I see something more like crosses or plus signs (+). I'll have to come back to it. Looks like 4s centered on 2s, 2s on 3s, 1s on 9s, and 7s on 1s. Plus shapes, not 3x3s.\n*   **Grid 5:** Background 0. A large enclosed shape, or loop of color 5. Inside that, are 3x3s: color 3 with center 2, color 6 with center 3.\n*   **Grid 6:** Background 0. 3x3 blocks again: color 2 with center 6; color 3 with center 2; color 8 with center 3; color 1 with center 4; and color 4 with center 8.  And color 5 winding line, like the others.\n*   **Grid 7:** Background 0. 3x3 blocks: color 1 with center 9; color 7 with center 3.

Cross (Plus) Shapes**\n*   **Description:** These objects appear as a \"+\" sign or cross, effectively fitting within a 3x3 bounding box but leaving the corners empty (color 0).\n*   **Structure:** They consist of 5 pixels: a center pixel and its four orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n*   **Color Attributes:**\n    *   **Arms:** The four pixels forming the arms of the cross are a uniform color (e.g., **color 1**, **color 2**, **color 4**, **color 7**).\n    *   **Center Pixel:** The intersection point is a different, distinct color from the arms (e.g., **color 9**, **color 3**, **color 2**, **color 1**).\n\n**4. Linear Paths**\n*   **Description:** These are winding lines or irregular shapes that traverse the background field.\n*   **Structure:** They are contiguous sequences of pixels, sometimes forming open lines, angles, or partial enclosures.\n*   **Color Attributes:** These structures are exclusively composed of **color 5**.\n\n<objects_summary>\n1. Background: Uniform field of color 0.\n2. 3x3 Squares: Blocks with a uniform outer ring color and a contrasting center pixel color.\n3. Cross Shapes: 5-pixel \"+\" shapes with uniform arm colors and a contrasting center pixel color.\n4. Linear Paths: Winding lines or enclosures composed exclusively of color 5.",
                "response": "**Understanding Grid Transformations: A Deep Dive**\n\nAlright, let's break down this puzzle. It's all about how these input grids morph into outputs, and the key is understanding how connected elements interact.\n\nFirst off, we've got objects. These are clearly defined by their border and center colors \u2013 either 3x3 squares or, as we see in the test, crosses. Color 5, that grey winding line, is the communication channel between them.\n\nThe core of the transformation lies in a simple, elegant process:\n\n1.  **Pairing:** Objects become linked, or \"paired,\" through the grey line. It\u2019s like a communication network, connecting specific shapes.\n\n2.  **Survival (or Designation):** When two objects are linked, only one \"survives\" \u2013 the other disappears. The rules for determining the survivor involve the border color. There\u2019s a hierarchy at play: Objects with border colors of 6, 7, or 8 (the \"high\" numbers) will \"win\" against anything lower. Also, objects with border 1 survive against 2, 3 or 4. Within the lower group (2, 3, and 4), 3 survives against 4.\n\n3.  **Color Update:** The victorious object then changes its central color, and the update rule differs based on its border color.\n    *   If the surviving object\u2019s border color is 1, its center color becomes the sum of the border and center colors of the disappearing object. It's a color merger.\n    *   If the survivor\u2019s border color is *not* 1, the new center becomes simply the center color of the disappearing one.\n\n4.  **Cleanup:** Finally, all the grey paths and the losing objects vanish. Unconnected shapes remain untouched.\n\nIn summary, this is a system where pairs interact, the dominant entity absorbs the vital characteristics of the weaker and the connection is broken.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the input and output grids, here are the identified transformations.\n\n### 1. Object Identification and Pairing\n*   **Objects**: The primary objects are 3x3 shapes (either full squares or \"+\" crosses) characterized by a uniform **Border Color** and a single **Center Color**.\n*   **Connections**: A winding path of **color 5** connects these objects. This path acts as a connector, linking objects into pairs.\n    *   In the **Test Input**, the path connects the Cross (Border 2, Center 3) to the Cross (Border 7, Center 1), and also connects the Cross (Border 3, Center 3) to the Cross (Border 1, Center 9).\n    *   The Cross (Border 4, Center 2) in the Test Input is **isolated** (not connected to any path).\n\n### 2. Survival Hierarchy (Source vs. Destination)\nWhen two objects are paired, one is the **Destination** (survives) and the other is the **Source** (disappears). This is determined by a hierarchy based on the **Border Color**:\n*   **Tier 1 (Highest Priority):** Borders **6, 7, 8**. These always survive when paired with lower tiers.\n*   **Tier 2:** Border **1**. This survives when paired with Tier 3.\n*   **Tier 3 (Lowest Priority):** Borders **2, 3, 4**.\n    *   *Sub-rule observed:* Within Tier 3, Border **3** survives against Border **4**.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Pair 1:** Cross (Border 1) vs. Cross (Border 3).\n    *   **1** is Tier 2, **3** is Tier 3. **Cross (Border 1) survives** (Destination). Cross (Border 3) is the Source.\n*   **Pair 2:** Cross (Border 7) vs. Cross (Border 2).\n    *   **7** is Tier 1, **2** is Tier 3. **Cross (Border 7) survives** (Destination). Cross (Border 2) is the Source.\n\n### 3. Center Color Transformation Rules\nThe surviving Destination object updates its **Center Color** based on the Source object's properties. The rule depends on the **Destination's Border Color**.\n\n*   **Rule A (Summation):** If the Destination object has **Border Color 1**, the new center is the sum of the Source's Center and the Source's Border.\n    *   *Formula:* `New Center = Source Center + Source Border`\n*   **Rule B (Transfer):** If the Destination object has any **other Border Color**, the new center is simply the Source's Center.\n    *   *Formula:* `New Center = Source Center`\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Pair 1 (Dest: 1, Source: 3/3):** Dest Border is 1.\n    *   Calculation: Source Center (3) + Source Border (3) = **6**.\n    *   Result: Cross with Border 1 changes Center to **6**.\n*   **Pair 2 (Dest: 7, Source: 2/3):** Dest Border is 7 (not 1).\n    *   Calculation: Source Center (3).\n    *   Result: Cross with Border 7 changes Center to **3**.\n\n### 4. Cleanup and Isolation\n*   **Removal:** The **Source objects** and the **color 5 paths** are removed from the grid (pixels become 0).\n*   **Isolation:** Objects that are not connected to a path are not part of a transformation pair. They remain **unchanged**. (The Cross with Border 4, Center 2 stays as is).\n\n<transformation_summary>\n1.  **Pairing**: Objects (Squares or Crosses) are paired via color 5 connection paths.\n2.  **Survival**: In each pair, one object survives (Destination) based on Border Color priority: {6,7,8} > {1} > {2,3,4}. Within {2,3,4}, {3} > {4}.\n3.  **Update**:\n    *   If Destination Border is **1**: New Center = Source Center + Source Border.\n    *   Otherwise: New Center = Source Center.\n4.  **Cleanup**: Path pixels and Source objects are removed. Isolated objects remain unchanged.\n</transformation_summary>",

Got it. Seven grids, same size, different content.\n\nI'll start by visually scanning the grids, mentally noting what I see. Then, I'll organize my observations into distinct object types. I can already tell there's a background color, some 3x3 blocks, and a winding line made up of the same color, but let's carefully check, and go grid by grid.\n\n*   **Grid 1:** Background looks like color 0. There's a winding path of color 5. And it looks like there are two distinct 3x3 blocks: one color 8 with a center color 2, and another color 1 with a center color 8.\n*   **Grid 2:** Background color 0. Several 3x3 blocks too: color 1 with center 2; color 4 with center 3; color 3 with center 6; color 2 with center 9; color 7 with center 4. And again, a color 5 winding line.\n*   **Grid 3:** Background 0. Color 5 winding line. 3x3 blocks: color 3 with center 4; color 4 with center 2; color 6 with center 1; color 1 with center 3.\n*   **Grid 4:** Okay, this one's a little different. It doesn't seem to have the clear 3x3 blocks like the previous ones. I see something more like crosses or plus signs (+). I'll have to come back to it. Looks like 4s centered on 2s, 2s on 3s, 1s on 9s, and 7s on 1s. Plus shapes, not 3x3s.\n*   **Grid 5:** Background 0. A large enclosed shape, or loop of color 5. Inside that, are 3x3s: color 3 with center 2, color 6 with center 3.\n*   **Grid 6:** Background 0. 3x3 blocks again: color 2 with center 6; color 3 with center 2; color 8 with center 3; color 1 with center 4; and color 4 with center 8.  And color 5 winding line, like the others.\n*   **Grid 7:** Background 0. 3x3 blocks: color 1 with center 9; color 7 with center 3. Color 5 winding line, again.\n\nOkay, I've got a good handle on things. Based on that scan, I'm identifying a few key object types.\n\n*   **Type A: 3x3 Square Blocks.**  These are consistent across most of the grids. They have a 3x3 square structure with a distinct center pixel. They show variations in the border/center color combinations.\n*   **Type B: Cross/Plus Shapes.** Found in Grid 4. These are 5-pixel shapes that have a plus sign (+) shape.\n*   **Type C: Path/Line (Color 5).** A winding or linear structure composed exclusively of color 5. It seems pretty distinct and not part of the 3x3 blocks, or \"Crosses\".\n*   **Type D: Background.** This is the empty space, represented by color 0, surrounding all the other objects.\n\nNow, let me make sure I'm not inferring anything! I'm just describing the presence of these object types. No rules about how they're *supposed* to look or transform.  It just seems like the Cross shapes are specific to Grid 4, but that it's a valid object type to mention. It's a key observation.\n\nLooking again at Grid 4, I'm noting the specific color patterns in the \"Cross\" objects, they are all just five pixels.  I will list it explicitly as \"Cross Shapes\".\n\nNow, I'll go through and make sure my descriptions are concise and use only the numeric color values.\n\nOkay, I'm ready to craft the final output. Here we go.\n\n\nBased on the provided grids, the objects can be categorized into the following types based on their shape, size, and color attributes:\n\n**1. Background Field**\n*   **Description:** The vast majority of the grid area consists of empty space.\n*   **Attributes:** This area is uniformly characterized by **color 0**. It serves as the canvas upon which other objects are placed.\n\n**2. 3x3 Square Blocks**\n*   **Description:** These are distinct square shapes occupying a 3x3 grid area. They are the most common structured object across the grids.\n*   **Structure:** They consist of a solid outer ring of 8 pixels surrounding a single center pixel.\n*   **Color Attributes:**\n    *   **Outer Ring:** The exterior border is a uniform color (e.g., **color 1**, **color 2**, **color 3**, **color 4**, **color 7**, **color 8**).\n    *   **Center Pixel:** The single pixel in the geometric center of the square is a different color than the outer ring (e.g., a **color 1** block might have a **color 9** center, or a **color 8** block might have a **color 2** center).\n\n**3. Cross (Plus) Shapes**\n*   **Description:** These objects appear as a \"+\" sign or cross, effectively fitting within a 3x3 bounding box but leaving the corners empty (color 0).\n*   **Structure:** They consist of 5 pixels: a center pixel and its four orthogonal neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n*   **Color Attributes:**\n    *   **Arms:** The four pixels forming the arms of the cross are a uniform color (e.g., **color 1**, **color 2**, **color 4**, **color 7**).\n    *   **Center Pixel:** The intersection point is a different, distinct color from the arms (e.g., **color 9**, **color 3**, **color 2**, **color 1**).\n\n**4. Linear Paths**\n*   **Description:** These are winding lines or irregular shapes that traverse the background field.\n*   **Structure:** They are contiguous sequences of pixels, sometimes forming open lines, angles, or partial enclosures.\n*   **Color Attributes:** These structures are exclusively composed of **color 5**.\n\n<objects_summary>\n1. Background: Uniform field of color 0.\n2. 3x3 Squares: Blocks with a uniform outer ring color and a contrasting center pixel color.\n3. Cross Shapes: 5-pixel \"+\" shapes with uniform arm colors and a contrasting center pixel color.\n4. Linear Paths: Winding lines or enclosures composed exclusively of color 5.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1.  **Pairing**: Objects (Squares or Crosses) are paired via color 5 connection paths.\n2.  **Survival**: In each pair, one object survives (Destination) based on Border Color priority: {6,7,8} > {1} > {2,3,4}. Within {2,3,4}, {3} > {4}.\n3.  **Update**:\n    *   If Destination Border is **1**: New Center = Source Center + Source Border.\n    *   Otherwise: New Center = Source Center.\n4.  **Cleanup**: Path pixels and Source objects are removed. Isolated objects remain unchanged.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.
