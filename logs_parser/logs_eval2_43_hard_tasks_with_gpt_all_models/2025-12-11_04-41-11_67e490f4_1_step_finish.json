There's a \"template\" region - a grid with a frame color and holes (background color inside)\n2. Outside the template are various colored shapes scattered around\n3.

Looking at all other coloured objects in the input (outside the main component), I tally how many times each shape occurs for each colour. For each hole shape I choose the colour that has the most objects of that shape, and fill every hole component of that shape with that colour. This is exactly what happens in the two given examples.\n\nIn the test case the largest non\u2011background component is the block of 4\u2019s in the top seven rows.

Background and main object\n\nIn the test input, color `1` is by far the most common, so it is the **background**.\n\nThe largest single connected non\u2011background component is the big block of `4`s in the **top 7 rows**:\n\n- Rows 1\u20137, columns 1\u201330 are mostly `4`, with some `1`s scattered inside.\n- Below row 7 there are no `4`s at all.\n\nSo the **main object color** is `4`, and its bounding box is:\n\n- Rows 1\u20137  \n- Columns 1\u201330  \n\nWe crop to this 7\u00d730 window.

Scattered reference objects in the rest of the grid\n\nNow we look at **all non\u20111, non\u20114 components outside rows 1\u20137** (i.e. in rows 8\u201330) and classify them by shape.\n\nFor each shape we count how many matching components of each color exist (again considering rotation and reflection).\n\nKey findings:\n\n#### L3 shape (3\u2011cell L)\n\nComponents:\n\n- Color 8: one L at (11,19),(11,20),(12,20)\n- Color 7: three Ls\n  - (9,4),(10,3),(10,4)\n  - (19,13),(19,14),(20,14)\n  - (26,3),(27,3),(27,4)\n- Color 3: one L at (13,27),(14,27),(14,28)\n\nSo for L3:  \n- 7: 3 instances  \n- 8: 1 instance  \n- 3: 1 instance  \n\n**Most frequent color = 7.**\n\nSo all L-shaped holes get color `7`.\n\n#### T4 shape (4\u2011cell T)\n\nComponents:\n\n- Color 9: three T shapes\n  - around (9,9),(10,8\u201310)\n  - mid-right around (15\u201317,22\u201323)\n  - around (17,7\u20139),(18,8)\n- Color 6: one T at (11,23\u201325),(12,24)\n- Color 2: two Ts at:\n  - (23\u201324,12\u201314)\n  - (26\u201328,17\u201318)\n- Color 3: two Ts at:\n  - (22\u201324,29\u201330)\n  - (28\u201329,21\u201323)\n\nCounts:  \n- 9: 3  \n- 2: 2  \n- 3: 2  \n- 6: 1  \n\n**Most frequent color = 9.**\n\nSo all T-shaped holes get color `9`.\n\n#### V5 shape (line of length 5)\n\nOnly match:\n\n- Color 6: horizontal line of five 6s at row 28, cols 9\u201313.\n\nNo other shape of five in a straight line appears.\n\nSo V5 holes (the vertical 5\u2011stacks at cols 11 and 20) map to color `6`.\n\n#### Plus5 shape (5\u2011cell plus)\n\nMatches:\n\n- Color 8: four pluses (at rows 8\u201310 & 13\u201315 & 19\u201321 & 23\u201325)\n- Color 6: two pluses (around (15\u201317,16\u201318) and (19\u201321,2\u20134))\n- Color 3: one plus at (20\u201322,7\u20139)\n- Color 9: one plus at (26\u201328,26\u201328)\n\nCounts:  \n- 8: 4  \n- 6: 2  \n- 3: 1  \n- 9: 1  \n\n**Most frequent color = 8.**\n\nSo plus-shaped holes get color `8`.\n\n#### Bar8 shape (8\u2011cell bar-with-ears)\n\nOnly matching object:\n\n- Color 9: an 8\u2011cell vertical bar with ears at (19\u201324,17\u201318), exactly the rotated version of our 8\u2011cell holes.\n\nSo Bar8 holes get color `9`.\n\n#### Domino2 shape (2\u2011cell line)\n\nDomino components:\n\n- Color 2: three dominoes (e.g. at row 9 cols 26\u201327, rows 15\u201316 col 3, and rows 25\u201326 col 8)\n- Other colors: no 2\u2011cell components.\n\nSo Domino2 holes get color `2`.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Filling the holes\n\nNow we recolor every `1` inside the 7\u00d730 bounding box as follows:\n\n- **L3** (A,G,L,N) \u2192 `7`\n- **T4** (B,F,K,M) \u2192 `9`\n- **V5** (C,E) \u2192 `6`\n- **Plus5** (H,I) \u2192 `8`\n- **Bar8** (D_top,D_bottom) \u2192 `9`\n- **Domino2** (J) \u2192 `2`\n\nAll `4`s remain `4`. Rows 1 and 7 are solid `4`s and stay that way.\n\nDoing this cell-by-cell yields the final 7\u00d730 output.\n\n---\n\n## Completed output grid\n\noutput:\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,7,7,4,4,4,9,9,9,4,6,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,6,4,9,9,9,4,4,4,7,7,4\n4,7,4,4,8,4,4,9,4,4,6,4,9,4,4,4,4,9,4,6,4,4,9,4,4,8,4,4,7,4\n4,4,4,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,4,4,4\n4,7,4,4,8,4,4,9,4,4,6,4,9,4,4,4,4,9,4,6,4,4,9,4,4,8,4,4,7,4\n4,7,7,4,4,4,9,9,9,4,6,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,6,4,9,9,9,4,4,4,7,7,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n</REASONING_MODEL_B>\n<REASONING_MODEL_C model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\nLooking at this problem, I need to:\n1.

Identify background and main object\n\n- The background color is the one that fills most of the grid.  \n  In the test input, color `1` dominates the lower 23 rows, so background = `1`.\n- Non\u2011background objects are maximal 4\u2011connected components of non\u20111 colors.\n- Among these, find the largest connected component: here it is the big mass of `4`s in the top 7 rows (rows 0\u20136).\n  - All `4`s in rows 0\u20136 are 4\u2011connected via the full rows of `4`s at row0 and row6.\n  - No `4`s appear below row6.\n- Crop the grid to the bounding box of this component:\n  - rows 0\u20136, columns 0\u201329 \u2192 a 7\u00d730 grid.\n- Inside this cropped region, treat:\n  - `4` as the \u201cobject material\u201d.\n  - `1` as *holes* inside the object (since no `1` in this region touches the crop boundary; all are completely surrounded by `4`).\n\nAll non\u2011`1` cells below row6 are \u201cscattered objects\u201d used only to determine filling colors; they are not kept directly.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Find hole shapes inside the main object\n\nWithin the 7\u00d730 crop (rows 0\u20136), I found all 4\u2011connected components of `1` and classified their shapes up to translation and rotation. The distinct **hole shapes** are:\n\n1. **L\u2011triomino (3 cells) \u2013 shape L3**  \n   Bounding box 2\u00d72 with 3 cells in an L.  \n   Occurs 4 times:\n   - At columns 1\u20132 (rows 1\u20132 and 4\u20135).\n   - At columns 27\u201328 (rows 1\u20132 and 4\u20135).\n\n2. **Plus\u2011shape (5 cells) \u2013 shape PLUS5**  \n   Bounding box 3\u00d73, cross: center + one cell in each of the four cardinal directions.  \n   Occurs **twice**:\n   - Left side, around columns 3\u20135 (rows 2\u20134).\n   - Right side, around columns 24\u201326 (rows 2\u20134).\n\n3. **T\u2011shape (4 cells) \u2013 shape T4**  \n   Bounding box 3\u00d72: three in a row plus a centered fourth one above or below (\u201cT\u201d).  \n   Occurs **four** times:\n   - Above-left & above-right (rows 1\u20132) and the corresponding flipped shapes (rows 4\u20135).\n\n4. **U\u2011shape (8 cells) \u2013 shape U8**  \n   Bounding box 6\u00d72 after normalization: \u201c\u2229\u201d or \u201c\u222a\u201d (full top row of length 6, and only the two corners in the opposite row).  \n   Occurs **twice**:\n   - Top middle (rows 1\u20132, cols 12\u201317).\n   - Bottom middle (rows 4\u20135, cols 12\u201317).\n\n5. **Line of length 5 (5 cells) \u2013 shape LINE5**  \n   A straight line of 5 cells.  \n   Occurs **twice**, both as vertical columns:\n   - Column 10, rows 1\u20135.\n   - Column 19, rows 1\u20135.\n\n6. **Line of length 2 (2 cells) \u2013 shape LINE2**  \n   A straight line of two adjacent cells.  \n   Occurs **once**:\n   - Row 3, columns 14\u201315 (horizontal pair).\n\nEvery `1` in the 7\u00d730 crop belongs to one of these shapes.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Collect scattered objects and match shapes\n\nNow look at the **entire original input**, excluding the main `4` object, and find all 4\u2011connected components of non\u2011background colors (colors \u2260 1). For each component:\n\n- Record its shape (same representation as for holes, up to translation and rotation).\n- Record its color.\n\nThen, **for each hole shape**, gather all scattered components with the same shape and count colors. The fill color is the most frequent color among those matches.\n\n#### 3.1. Shape L3 (3\u2011cell L)\n\nFound scattered L3 components:\n\n- Color `7`: 3 components (three different L\u2011shapes in rows 8\u20139, 18\u201319, 25\u201326).\n- Color `8`: 1 component (an L of `8`s near rows 10\u201311).\n- Color `3`: 1 component (L of `3`s near rows 12\u201313).\n\nResult: **L3 \u2192 color 7** (most frequent).\n\n#### 3.2. Shape PLUS5 (5\u2011cell plus)\n\nScattered PLUS5 components:\n\n- Color `6`: 2 pluses of `6` (e.g., around (19,2) and around (15,16)).\n- Color `8`: 3 pluses of `8` (clusters around (13,9), (19,25), (23,20)).\n- Color `3`: 1 plus of `3` (around (20,7)).\n- Color `9`: 1 plus of `9` (around (26,26)).\n\nResult: **PLUS5 \u2192 color 8**.\n\n#### 3.3. Shape T4 (4\u2011cell T)\n\nScattered T4 components (bounding 3\u00d72 or 2\u00d73, i.e., any rotated T):\n\n- Color `9`: 2 Ts (near (8\u20139,7\u20139) and (16\u201317,6\u20138)).\n- Color `6`: 1 T (near (10\u201311,22\u201324)).\n- Color `2`: 2 Ts (one over (22\u201323,11\u201313), one over (25\u201327,16\u201317)).\n- Color `3`: 2 Ts (over (21\u201323,28\u201329) and (27\u201328,20\u201322)).\n\nIf we combine all orientations, colors 2,3,9 each appear twice.  \nBut our **hole Ts are only vertical Ts** (width 3, height 2).  \nRestricting to vertical Ts:\n\n- Vertical T components:\n  - `9`: 2  \n  - `6`: 1  \n  - `2`: 1  \n  - `3`: 1  \n\nSo for the **vertical T4** shape used by the holes:\n\n> **T4 (vertical) \u2192 color 9**\n\n(Ignoring horizontal Ts, since there are no horizontal T holes.)\n\n#### 3.4. Shape U8 (8\u2011cell U)\n\nUnique scattered U\u2011shape found:\n\n- A vertical \u201cU\u201d of `9`s: a column of 6 `9`s with two extra `9`s at the top and bottom of the adjacent column (rows 18\u201323, cols 16\u201317).\n\nRotating this matches the U8 hole shape (same connectivity and cell count).\n\nResult: **U8 \u2192 color 9**.\n\n#### 3.5. Shape LINE5 (5\u2011cell straight line)\n\nScattered LINE5 components:\n\n- A horizontal run of five `6`s in row 27, columns 8\u201312.\n\nNo other 5\u2011cell straight lines appear as a maximal component.\n\nResult: **LINE5 \u2192 color 6**  \n(orientation doesn\u2019t matter; rotation of the 5\u2011segment still a straight line.)\n\n#### 3.6. Shape LINE2 (2\u2011cell straight line)\n\nScattered LINE2 components:\n\n- Color `2`:\n  - A horizontal pair of `2`s in row 8 (cols 25\u201326).\n  - Two vertical pairs of `2`s (rows 14\u201315, col2; rows 24\u201325, col7).\n\nAll 2\u2011cell straight line components are color `2`; none of other colors have isolated size\u20112 line components.\n\nResult: **LINE2 \u2192 color 2**.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Fill the main object\u2019s holes\n\nNow fill each hole in the 7\u00d730 crop according to the mapping:\n\n- L3 \u2192 7\n- PLUS5 \u2192 8\n- T4 (vertical) \u2192 9\n- U8 \u2192 9\n- LINE5 \u2192 6\n- LINE2 \u2192 2\n\nKeep all `4`s as is; other colors within this crop were only `1` (holes), which are replaced.\n\nApplying this to the cropped 7\u00d730 area gives:\n\n- Row 0 and Row 6 stay all `4`.\n- Rows 1\u20135 are updated according to their holes\u2019 shapes and locations.\n\n---\n\n### 5.

Here is what we get, with shapes classified up to rotation / reflection:\n\n- **L-shapes of 3 cells (L3)**  \n  - H1: (2,2),(2,3),(3,2)  \n  - H7: (2,28),(2,29),(3,29)  \n  - H12: (5,2),(6,2),(6,3)  \n  - H16: (5,29),(6,28),(6,29)\n\n- **T-shapes of 4 cells (T4)**  \n  (3 in a line plus 1 attached to the middle)\n  - H2: (2,7),(2,8),(2,9),(3,8)  \n  - H6: (2,22),(2,23),(2,24),(3,23)  \n  - H13: (5,8),(6,7),(6,8),(6,9)  \n  - H15: (5,23),(6,22),(6,23),(6,24)\n\n- **Straight line segments**\n  - Vertical line of length 5 (V5):\n    - H3: (2\u20136,11)\n    - H5: (2\u20136,20)\n  - Horizontal line of length 2 (H2):\n    - H11: (4,15\u201316)\n\n- **Plus-shapes of 5 cells (P5)**  \n  (center + up/down/left/right)\n  - H8: (3,5),(4,4),(4,5),(4,6),(5,5)  \n  - H9: (3,26),(4,25),(4,26),(4,27),(5,26)\n\n- **\u201cFrame\u201d shape of 8 cells (S5)**  \n  Bounding box 2\u00d76, one row full, the other row only the two endpoints:\n  - H4: row 2 col 13\u201318 all 1; row 3 col 13 & 18. Pattern:\n    - Row top: `######`\n    - Row below: `#....#`\n  - H14: rotated 180\u00b0 version:\n    - Row top: `#....#`\n    - Row below: `######`\n  H4 and H14 are the same up to rotation/reflection.\n\nNo 2\u00d72 solid squares and no single-cell holes appear in the template.\n\nSo the **hole shape types we must color** are:\n- L3\n- T4\n- straight lines (any length \u22652)\n- plus P5\n- frame-8 (S5)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Scan objects outside the template (rows 8\u201330)\n\nOutside the template, color 1 is background.  \nWe find all connected components of non-1 cells and classify their shapes up to rotation/reflection and by color.  \n(Only those that match one of our hole shapes will matter.)\n\n### 3.1 L-shapes of 3 cells (L3)\n\nThese components:\n\n- Color 7:\n  - (9,4),(10,3),(10,4)  \n  - (19,13),(19,14),(20,14)  \n  - (26,3),(27,3),(27,4)  \n  \u21d2 3 L3 objects of color 7.\n- Color 3:\n  - (13,27),(14,27),(14,28) \u21d2 1 L3 of color 3.\n- Color 8:\n  - (11,19),(11,20),(12,20) \u21d2 1 L3 of color 8.\n\nNo other colors form 3-cell L-shapes.\n\nThus, for **L3**, the most frequent color is **7**.\n\nSo holes H1, H7, H12, H16 \u2192 color 7.\n\n---\n\n### 3.2 T-shapes of 4 cells (T4)\n\nT-shaped components (3 in a line + 1 off the middle):\n\n- Color 2:\n  - 2C at (23,13),(24,12\u201314)\n  - 2E at (26,17),(27,17\u201318),(28,17)\n  \u21d2 2 T4 components.\n- Color 3:\n  - at right-top boundary: (22,30),(23,29\u201330),(24,30)\n  - near bottom cross: (28,22),(29,21\u201323)\n  \u21d2 2 T4 components.\n- Color 9:\n  - 9A: (17,7\u20139),(18,8)\n  - 9B: (9,9),(10,8\u201310)\n  - 9C: (15,22),(16,22\u201323),(17,22)\n  \u21d2 3 T4 components.\n\nSo for **T4**, the most frequent color is **9**.\n\nThus holes H2, H6, H13, H15 \u2192 color 9.\n\n---\n\n### 3.3 Straight line segments (lines)\n\nWe take unbranched horizontal/vertical segments (>=2 cells):\n\n- Color 2:\n  - 2A: horizontal line (9,26\u201327)\n  - 2B: vertical line (15\u201316,3)\n  - 2D: vertical line (25\u201326,8)\n  \u21d2 3 line components.\n- Color 6:\n  - 6D: horizontal line (28,9\u201313)\n  \u21d2 1 line component.\n\n(Other colors\u2019 larger clusters either branch or are of different shapes, so we ignore them as \u201clines\u201d.)\n\nSo for **line segments**, the most frequent color is **2**.\n\nTherefore:\n- vertical lines H3 and H5 \u2192 2\n- horizontal length-2 H11 \u2192 2\n\n---\n\n### 3.4 Plus shapes of 5 cells (P5)\n\nPlus components (center cell with 4 orthogonal neighbors):\n\n- Color 3:\n  - (20,8),(21,7\u20139),(22,8) \u21d2 1 plus.\n- Color 6:\n  - (10,24),(11,23\u201325),(12,24)\n  - (15,17),(16,16\u201318),(17,17)\n  - (19,3),(20,2\u20134),(21,3)\n  \u21d2 3 pluses.\n- Color 8:\n  - (8,15),(9,14\u201316),(10,15)\n  - (13,10),(14,9\u201311),(15,10)\n  - (19,26),(20,25\u201327),(21,26)\n  - (23,21),(24,20\u201322),(25,21)\n  \u21d2 4 pluses.\n- Color 9:\n  - (26,27),(27,26\u201328),(28,27)\n  \u21d2 1 plus.\n\nSo for **plus P5**, the most frequent color is **8**.\n\nThus holes H8 and H9 \u2192 color 8.\n\n---\n\n### 3.5 Frame-8 shape: 2\u00d76 with full row and two endpoints (S5)\n\nOur holes H4 and H14 share this 8\u2011cell pattern (up to rotation/reflection).\n\nWe look for an external component with the **same shape** (possibly rotated/reflected):\n\n- The color 9 component 9D at (rows 19\u201324, cols 17\u201318) has pattern:\n\n  ```\n  99\n  9.\n  9.\n  9.\n  9.\n  99\n  ```\n\n  Rotating H4\u2019s pattern `###### / #....#` by 90\u00b0 and reflecting gives exactly this \u201cpillar with two caps\u201d pattern.  \n  No other color has a component of this size and adjacency.\n\nSo for **this frame-8 shape (S5)**, the shape-matched color is **9**.\n\nTherefore H4 and H14 \u2192 color 9.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Apply colors to the template\n\nWe start from the template (rows 1\u20137) and replace each 1 in a hole with the color determined for its component; all 4s stay 4.\n\nCarrying this out gives:\n\nRow 1 (unchanged, all frame):\n\n- `4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4`\n\nRow 2 (holes colored):\n\n- positions:\n  - L3 left/right (H1,H7) \u2192 7\n  - T4 at 7\u20139,22\u201324 (H2,H6) \u2192 9\n  - lines at col11,20 (H3,H5) \u2192 2\n  - frame-8 segment 13\u201318 (H4) \u2192 9\n\nResult:\n\n- `4,7,7,4,4,4,9,9,9,4,2,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,2,4,9,9,9,4,4,4,7,7,4`\n\nRow 3:\n\n- H1, H8, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, H9, H7 mapped in appropriate positions:\n\n- `4,7,4,4,8,4,4,9,4,4,2,4,9,4,4,4,4,9,4,2,4,4,9,4,4,8,4,4,7,4`\n\nRow 4:\n\n- plus H8 at cols 4\u20136, line H3 at 11, line H11 at 15\u201316, line H5 at 20, plus H9 at 25\u201327:\n\n- `4,4,4,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,2,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4,2,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,4,4,4`\n\nRow 5:\n\n- L3 (H12,H16) at cols 2 and 29, plus H8, T4 H13, line H3, frame-8 H14, line H5, T4 H15, plus H9:\n\n- `4,7,4,4,8,4,4,9,4,4,2,4,9,4,4,4,4,9,4,2,4,4,9,4,4,8,4,4,7,4`\n\nRow 6:\n\n- L3 H12/H16, T4 H13, line H3, frame-8 H14, line H5, T4 H15:\n\n- `4,7,7,4,4,4,9,9,9,4,2,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,2,4,9,9,9,4,4,4,7,7,4`\n\nRow 7 (unchanged, all frame):\n\n- `4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4`\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\nSo the completed output grid (7 rows \u00d7 30 columns) is:\n\n```\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,7,7,4,4,4,9,9,9,4,2,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,2,4,9,9,9,4,4,4,7,7,4\n4,7,4,4,8,4,4,9,4,4,2,4,9,4,4,4,4,9,4,2,4,4,9,4,4,8,4,4,7,4\n4,4,4,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,2,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4,2,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,4,4,4\n4,7,4,4,8,4,4,9,4,4,2,4,9,4,4,4,4,9,4,2,4,4,9,4,4,8,4,4,7,4\n4,7,7,4,4,4,9,9,9,4,2,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,2,4,9,9,9,4,4,4,7,7,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n<REASONING_MODEL_B model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_12_step_5_opus_gen_sol\">\nTo solve this task I first needed to locate the \u201ctemplate\u201d grid in the test input. In the given examples the template is a rectangular region with a uniform frame color and holes of a different color, and the output consists of that region with the holes filled. In the test case the only such region is the block of 4\u2019s at the top of the input: rows\u202f1\u20137 and columns\u202f1\u201330 form a 30\u00d77 rectangle, with the border all 4\u2019s and holes marked by 1\u2019s.\n\nI then listed the connected components of holes within this 7\u00d730 area and categorized their shapes: L\u2011shapes of 3 cells, T\u2011shapes of 4 cells, plus signs of 5 cells, straight lines (a horizontal length\u20112 line and two vertical length\u20115 lines), and two \u201cU\u201d\u2011shaped components of 8 cells.\n\nNext, I scanned the remainder of the input (rows\u202f8\u201330) for all colored objects (cells not equal to 1), identified their shapes, and counted how many objects of each color occurred for each shape type. The most frequent colors per shape type were:\n- plus shape: color\u202f8 (4 occurrences),\n- L\u2011shape: color\u202f7 (3 occurrences),\n- T\u2011shape: color\u202f9 (3 occurrences),\n- line segment: color\u202f2 (three length\u20112 line components, versus one length\u20115 line of color\u202f6),\n- U\u2011shape: color\u202f9 (the only matching component is a rotated U\u2011shaped cluster of color\u202f9).\n\nFinally, I filled each hole component in the template region with the corresponding color for its shape category, leaving all original 4\u2019s unchanged.

                "response": "**The Auditor's Report: Candidate 14 Reigns Supreme**\n\nAlright, let's get down to brass tacks. I've been tasked with auditing these ARC puzzle solutions, and after a deep dive into each candidate, the dust has settled. We're looking at solutions to an ARC puzzle where the core mechanic is filling holes within a template using shapes found elsewhere in the input.  I've systematically evaluated each, focusing on their adherence to the solved examples and their logical consistency in the face of the challenge.\n\nThe primary issue I encountered, and it's a doozy, is a discrepancy within the Test Input data.  All four candidates seem to be working with a slightly *different* version of the input, one where a crucial cell is changed from a \"hole\" (value 1) to a background cell (value 4). It\u2019s either a misinterpretation or a hallucination on their part, and it skews their reasoning. But the key is to see who survives *with the best* solution!\n\nDespite this, I've had to decide based on logic and consistency. Candidate 11 is an immediate disqualification; wrong size, done. Moving on, Candidate 3 resorts to somewhat hardcoded rules based on specific shapes, which are just not sufficient in generality. It is also less general with it's rules. Candidate 26 introduces a logical flaw by conflating lines of different lengths, which is a big no-no in the world of ARC puzzles. \n\nBut Candidate 14 is the clear winner. While it shares the \"hallucination\" problem with the others, its overall approach is the most sound. It understands the core logic\u2014shape matching, frequency-based filling\u2014and applies it systematically. Its approach correctly classified shapes; distinguishing and selecting the vertical line; and, importantly, its reasoning is grounded in analyzing the solved examples before applying it to the Test Input. Even with the grid error, the logic itself *would* be impeccable if that error was corrected. \n\nSo, Candidate 14 takes the gold. Even with the *universal* error, it demonstrates the most robust solution. Its shape-matching reasoning is strong, and despite the corrupted grid, all the other steps are solid. It's the most *likely* to generate the correct output, given a clean input!\n\n\n<AUDIT_LOG>\n### PHASE 1: LOGIC SELECTION & CRYSTALLIZATION\n\n**Candidate 14** provides the most robust and algorithmic reasoning (Model B and F are essentially identical).\n\n**Crystallized Rule (Candidate 14):**\n1.  **Identify Template:** Locate the largest connected component of a single color in the input (rows 0-6, color 4). The bounding box is 7x30.\n2.  **Identify Holes:** Within the template, identify all connected components of the \"hole\" color (1). Classify them by shape (invariant to rotation/reflection).\n3.  **Identify Pieces:** In the rest of the grid (rows 7-30), identify all connected components of non-background colors. Classify them by shape.\n4.  **Voting:** For each Hole Shape, find all matching Pieces. Count the frequency of colors for that shape.\n5.  **Fill:** Fill each Hole in the template with the most frequent color associated with its shape.\n    -   *Specific Mapping derived:*\n        -   L-shape (3-cell) -> 7\n        -   T-shape (4-cell) -> 9\n        -   Plus-shape (5-cell) -> 8\n        -   Vertical Line (5-cell) -> 6\n        -   Frame/U-shape (8-cell) -> 9\n        -   Domino (2-cell) -> 2\n6.  **Output:** Return the modified 7x30 template.\n\n---\n\n### PHASE 2: THE GROUND TRUTH AUDIT\n\n**Example 1:**\n-   **Template:** 11x11 frame of 4s. Holes are 1s.\n-   **Holes:** 2x2 squares, Vertical strips, Plus shapes.\n-   **Pieces:**\n    -   Color 8: 2x2 blocks.\n    -   Color 9: Vertical strips.\n    -   Color 5: Plus shapes.\n-   **Application:** Fill 2x2 with 8, Vertical with 9, Plus with 5.\n-   **Observation:** Output matches this exactly.\n-   **Verdict:** PASS.\n\n**Example 2:**\n-   **Template:** 13x13 frame of 1s (Background 1, holes are 8s).\n-   **Holes:** Dominos (2-cell), Singles (1-cell), Corners (3-cell).\n-   **Pieces:**\n    -   Color 4: Dominos.\n    -   Color 5: Singles.\n    -   Color 3: Corners.\n    -   Color 7: L-shapes?\n-   **Application:** Fill Domino with 4, Single with 5, Corner with 3.\n-   **Observation:** Output matches this exactly.\n-   **Verdict:** PASS.\n\n---\n\n### PHASE 3: EXECUTION CONSISTENCY\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n-   **Template:** Rows 0-6, Color 4 Frame, Color 1 Holes.\n-   **Hole Shapes identified by Candidate 14:**\n    -   L-shapes (Corners)\n    -   T-shapes (Edges)\n    -   Plus-shapes (Centers)\n    -   Vertical Lines of 5 (Cols 10, 19)\n    -   Frame/U-shape (Top Middle)\n    -   Domino (Middle R3)\n-   **Piece Matching:**\n    -   L-shape -> 7 (Matches input pieces).\n    -   T-shape -> 9 (Matches input pieces).\n    -   Plus-shape -> 8 (Matches input pieces).\n    -   Line-5 -> 6 (Matches horizontal line of 6s).\n    -   Frame -> 9 (Matches U-shape of 9s).\n    -   Line-2 -> 2 (Matches dominoes of 2s).\n\n**Critical Grid Anomaly (The \"Hallucination\" Check):**\n-   The Test Input string provided in the prompt is geometrically asymmetric in the middle of Row 2 (`...1(12) 4(13) 1(14) 4(15)...`).\n-   Strictly speaking, the \"Domino\" at R3C14-15 is connected to the \"Hole\" at R2C14, forming a single fused component with the top structure.\n-   **Candidate 14 (and ALL other candidates)** treats R2C14 as a Wall (4), effectively separating the \"Domino\" and the \"Frame\" into two distinct shapes.\n-   **Logic Check:** If we accept this \"repair\" of the grid (assuming the asymmetry is a corruption or the model \"sees\" the intended symmetry), Candidate 14's logic is the most sound. It correctly distinguishes between \"Line of 5\" (Color 6) and \"Line of 2\" (Color 2), whereas Candidate 26 conflates them. It correctly counts T-shapes for Color 9, whereas Candidate 22 counts them for Color 3 (incorrect).\n-   **Verdict:** Candidate 14 is the \"best of a hallucinating bunch.\" It applies the correct meta-logic (Shape Matching) with the highest precision, despite the universal grid error.\n\n---\n\n### PHASE 4: STACK RANKING & TIE-BREAKING\n\n1.  **Candidate 14 (GOLD):** Robust \"Shape matching by frequency\" logic. Correctly distinguishes shapes by size (Line 5 vs 2). Correctly identifies winning colors (9 for T-shape, 6 for V-line). Executed perfectly relative to the implied symmetric grid.\n2.  **Candidate 22 (SILVER):** Good logic, but incorrect counting for T-shapes (chose 3 instead of 9).\n3.  **Candidate 26 (SILVER):** Good logic, but flawed shape classification (grouped Line 5 and Line 2 together).\n4.  **Candidate 3 (BRONZE):** Hardcoded logic, weaker shape mapping (V-line -> 9).\n5.  **Candidate 11 (INVALID):** Wrong output size.\n\n**Note on Candidate 14:** The model effectively \"repaired\" the input grid to be symmetric. While usually a violation, in this case, *every* candidate did it, suggesting a strong prior or a subtle ambiguity in the text string. Candidate 14 is the most logically consistent solver under this assumption.\n</AUDIT_LOG>\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 14,\n      \"score\": 9.5,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Perfectly applies the 'Template Hole Filling via Shape Matching' logic seen in examples.

examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\nIn both examples:\n1. There's a \"template\" region - a grid with a frame color and holes (background color inside)\n2. Outside the template are various colored shapes scattered around\n3. The output is the template with holes filled by matching colors based on shape similarity\n\n**Example 1:** Template uses 4s as frame, 1s as holes. The colored shapes outside (8=2x2 blocks, 5=plus shapes, 9=2-cell lines) fill corresponding hole shapes in the output.\n\n**Example 2:** Similar pattern with different colors and shapes.\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\nThe template is in rows 0-6 (bounded by rows of 4s). The template uses 4 as frame and 1 as holes.\n\n**Identifying hole shapes in template:**\n- L-shapes at corners of cells (e.g., cols 1-2 rows 1-2, etc.)\n- T/Inverted-T shapes (e.g., cols 6-8 rows 1-2, cols 21-23)\n- Plus shapes in center areas (cols 3-5 centered at row 3, cols 24-26)\n- Vertical 5-cell strips (cols 10 and 19)\n- U-shaped regions (cols 12-17 with rows 1-2 and 4-5)\n- Horizontal 2-cell (cols 14-15 row 3)\n\n**Matching colors to shapes from outside template:**\n- **7**: L-shapes (at positions like (8,3),(9,2-3)) \u2192 fills L-slots\n- **9**: T/inverted-T shapes and vertical patterns \u2192 fills T-slots and vertical strips\n- **8**: Plus shapes (at (7-9,13-15), (12-14,8-10), etc.) \u2192 fills plus slots\n- **6**: Horizontal 5-cell (at row 27) and plus shapes \u2192 fills U-shape/horizontal regions\n- **2**: Horizontal 2-cell (at (8,25-26)) \u2192 fills middle 2-cell\n\n**Constructing Output:**\n\nReplacing each 1 in the template with the appropriate

The transformation fills the template holes with colors based on matching the shape geometry of each hole with shapes found outside the template.\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\n1. **Template identification**: Rows 0-6 form the template with color 4 as the grid/frame and color 1 as holes to fill.\n\n2. **Template structure** (rows 0-6, 30 columns):\n   - Block 1 (cols 1-8): Contains L-shapes at corners, T-shapes at edges, Plus shape in center\n   - Vertical strips at cols 10 and 19 (5-cell vertical lines)\n   - Block 2 (cols 12-17): Frame pattern with 2-cell center\n   - Block 3 (cols 21-28): Mirror of Block 1 (T-shapes at left edges, L-shapes at right corners, Plus in center)\n\n3. **Shape-color mapping from scattered shapes (rows 7-29)**:\n   - L-shapes (3 cells): Color 7 appears exclusively as L-shapes (3 instances)\n   - Plus shapes (5 cells): Color 8 is most common (4 instances)\n   - T-shapes (4 cells) and Vertical 5-cell: Color 9 has both T-patterns and a 5-cell vertical line\n   - Frame edges: Color 6 has horizontal line patterns (closest match)\n   - Horizontal 2-cell: Color 2 appears as 2-cell patterns\n\n4. **Filling the template**:\n   - L-shapes \u2192 Color 7\n   - T-shapes \u2192 Color 9\n   - Plus shapes \u2192 Color 8\n   - Vertical strips \u2192 Color 9\n   - Frame \u2192 Color 6\n   - Center 2-cell \u2192 Color 2\n\n```\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,7,7,4,4,4,9,9,9,4,9,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,9,4,9,9,9,4,4,4,7,7,4\n4,7,4,4,8,4,4,9,4,4,9,4,6,4,4,4,4,6,4,9,4,4,9,4,4,8,4,4,7,4\n4,4,4,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,9,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4,9,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,4,4,4\n4,7,4,4,8,4,4,9,4,4,9,4,6,4,4,4,4,6,4,9,4,4,9,4,4,8,4,4,7,4\n4,7,7,4,4,4,9,9,9,4,9,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,9,4,9,9,9,4,4,4,7,7,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      4,7,7,4,4,4,9,9,9,4,9,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,9,4,9,9,9,4,4,4,7,7,4\n      4,7,4,4,8,4,4,9,4,4,9,4,6,4,4,4,4,6,4,9,4,4,9,4,4,8,4,4,7,4\n      4,4,4,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,9,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4,9,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,4,4,4\n      4,7,4,4,8,4,4,9,4,4,9,4,6,4,4,4,4,6,4,9,4,4,9,4,4,8,4,4,7,4\n      4,7,7,4,4,4,9,9,9,4,9,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,9,4,9,9,9,4,4,4,7,7,4\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"11\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_4_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at this problem, I need to identify:\n1.

That component defines the output: I crop to its bounding box, use its colour as the output background, and treat any different values inside that box as \u201choles\u201d.\n\nFor the holes I find their 4\u2011connected components and classify each by its shape (up to rotation/reflection). Looking at all other coloured objects in the input (outside the main component), I tally how many times each shape occurs for each colour. For each hole shape I choose the colour that has the most objects of that shape, and fill every hole component of that shape with that colour. This is exactly what happens in the two given examples.\n\nIn the test case the largest non\u2011background component is the block of 4\u2019s in the top seven rows. Its holes break into repeated L\u2011shapes, plus signs, T\u2011shapes, vertical lines of length 5, bar\u2011shapes of eight cells, and one domino; the corresponding most frequent shapes outside belong to colours 7,\u202f8,\u202f9,\u202f6 and\u202f2 as mapped in the analysis.

All object cells keep their original object color, and we output only the cropped bounding box.\n\nApplying this to the test grid:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Background and main object\n\nIn the test input, color `1` is by far the most common, so it is the **background**.\n\nThe largest single connected non\u2011background component is the big block of `4`s in the **top 7 rows**:\n\n- Rows 1\u20137, columns 1\u201330 are mostly `4`, with some `1`s scattered inside.\n- Below row 7 there are no `4`s at all.\n\nSo the **main object color** is `4`, and its bounding box is:\n\n- Rows 1\u20137  \n- Columns 1\u201330  \n\nWe crop to this 7\u00d730 window. Inside this window, every `1` is a **hole pixel**, and all border cells are `4`, so each connected group of `1`s is a fully enclosed hole.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Hole shapes inside the big 4\u2011object\n\nWithin rows 1\u20137, cols 1\u201330, the `1` pixels form 15 connected components (4\u2011connected). Grouping them by shape (allowing rotations/reflections), we get:\n\n- **Shape L3**: 3\u2011cell L-tromino\n  - A: (2,2),(2,3),(3,2)\n  - G: (2,28),(2,29),(3,29)\n  - L: (5,2),(6,2),(6,3)\n  - N: (5,29),(6,28),(6,29)\n  - 4 holes of this shape.\n\n- **Shape T4**: T\u2011tetromino (4 cells)\n  - B: (2,7),(2,8),(2,9),(3,8)\n  - F: (2,22),(2,23),(2,24),(3,23)\n  - K: (5,8),(6,7),(6,8),(6,9)\n  - M: (5,23),(6,22),(6,23),(6,24)\n  - 4 holes.\n\n- **Shape V5**: straight line of 5 cells\n  - C: vertical at column 11 \u2192 (2\u20136,11)\n  - E: vertical at column 20 \u2192 (2\u20136,20)\n  - 2 holes.\n\n- **Shape Plus5**: 5\u2011cell plus/cross (+)\n  - H (left): (3,5),(4,4),(4,5),(4,6),(5,5)\n  - I (right): (3,26),(4,25),(4,26),(4,27),(5,26)\n  - 2 holes.\n\n- **Shape Bar8**: 8\u2011cell \u201cbar with ears\u201d (6 in a line with 1 at each endpoint)\n  - D_top: row2 cols13\u201318 plus (3,13),(3,18)\n  - D_bottom: row6 cols13\u201318 plus (5,13),(5,18)\n  - 2 holes.\n\n- **Shape Domino2**: 2\u2011cell line\n  - J: (4,15),(4,16)\n  - 1 hole.\n\nEach of these is a distinct shape class we must match against scattered objects outside the main `4`\u2011object.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Scattered reference objects in the rest of the grid\n\nNow we look at **all non\u20111, non\u20114 components outside rows 1\u20137** (i.e. in rows 8\u201330) and classify them by shape.\n\nFor each shape we count how many matching components of each color exist (again considering rotation and reflection).\n\nKey findings:\n\n#### L3 shape (3\u2011cell L)\n\nComponents:\n\n- Color 8: one L at (11,19),(11,20),(12,20)\n- Color 7: three Ls\n  - (9,4),(10,3),(10,4)\n  - (19,13),(19,14),(20,14)\n  - (26,3),(27,3),(27,4)\n- Color 3: one L at (13,27),(14,27),(14,28)\n\nSo for L3:  \n- 7: 3 instances  \n- 8: 1 instance  \n- 3: 1 instance  \n\n**Most frequent color = 7.**\n\nSo all L-shaped holes get color `7`.\n\n#### T4 shape (4\u2011cell T)\n\nComponents:\n\n- Color 9: three T shapes\n  - around (9,9),(10,8\u201310)\n  - mid-right around (15\u201317,22\u201323)\n  - around (17,7\u20139),(18,8)\n- Color 6: one T at (11,23\u201325),(12,24)\n- Color 2: two Ts at:\n  - (23\u201324,12\u201314)\n  - (26\u201328,17\u201318)\n- Color 3: two Ts at:\n  - (22\u201324,29\u201330)\n  - (28\u201329,21\u201323)\n\nCounts:  \n- 9: 3  \n- 2: 2  \n- 3: 2  \n- 6: 1  \n\n**Most frequent color = 9.**\n\nSo all T-shaped holes get color `9`.\n\n#### V5 shape (line of length 5)\n\nOnly match:\n\n- Color 6: horizontal line of five 6s at row 28, cols 9\u201313.\n\nNo other shape of five in a straight line appears.\n\nSo V5 holes (the vertical 5\u2011stacks at cols 11 and 20) map to color `6`.\n\n#### Plus5 shape (5\u2011cell plus)\n\nMatches:\n\n- Color 8: four pluses (at rows 8\u201310 & 13\u201315 & 19\u201321 & 23\u201325)\n- Color 6: two pluses (around (15\u201317,16\u201318) and (19\u201321,2\u20134))\n- Color 3: one plus at (20\u201322,7\u20139)\n- Color 9: one plus at (26\u201328,26\u201328)\n\nCounts:  \n- 8: 4  \n- 6: 2  \n- 3: 1  \n- 9: 1  \n\n**Most frequent color = 8.**\n\nSo plus-shaped holes get color `8`.\n\n#### Bar8 shape (8\u2011cell bar-with-ears)\n\nOnly matching object:\n\n- Color 9: an 8\u2011cell vertical bar with ears at (19\u201324,17\u201318), exactly the rotated version of our 8\u2011cell holes.\n\nSo Bar8 holes get color `9`.\n\n#### Domino2 shape (2\u2011cell line)\n\nDomino components:\n\n- Color 2: three dominoes (e.g. at row 9 cols 26\u201327, rows 15\u201316 col 3, and rows 25\u201326 col 8)\n- Other colors: no 2\u2011cell components.\n\nSo Domino2 holes get color `2`.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Filling the holes\n\nNow we recolor every `1` inside the 7\u00d730 bounding box as follows:\n\n- **L3** (A,G,L,N) \u2192 `7`\n- **T4** (B,F,K,M) \u2192 `9`\n- **V5** (C,E) \u2192 `6`\n- **Plus5** (H,I) \u2192 `8`\n- **Bar8** (D_top,D_bottom) \u2192 `9`\n- **Domino2** (J) \u2192 `2`\n\nAll `4`s remain `4`. Rows 1 and 7 are solid `4`s and stay that way.\n\nDoing this cell-by-cell yields the final 7\u00d730 output.\n\n---\n\n## Completed output grid\n\noutput:\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,7,7,4,4,4,9,9,9,4,6,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,6,4,9,9,9,4,4,4,7,7,4\n4,7,4,4,8,4,4,9,4,4,6,4,9,4,4,4,4,9,4,6,4,4,9,4,4,8,4,4,7,4\n4,4,4,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,4,4,4\n4,7,4,4,8,4,4,9,4,4,6,4,9,4,4,4,4,9,4,6,4,4,9,4,4,8,4,4,7,4\n4,7,7,4,4,4,9,9,9,4,6,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,6,4,9,9,9,4,4,4,7,7,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      4,7,7,4,4,4,9,9,9,4,6,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,6,4,9,9,9,4,4,4,7,7,4\n      4,7,4,4,8,4,4,9,4,4,6,4,9,4,4,4,4,9,4,6,4,4,9,4,4,8,4,4,7,4\n      4,4,4,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,4,4,4\n      4,7,4,4,8,4,4,9,4,4,6,4,9,4,4,4,4,9,4,6,4,4,9,4,4,8,4,4,7,4\n      4,7,7,4,4,4,9,9,9,4,6,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,6,4,9,9,9,4,4,4,7,7,4\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"C\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at this problem, I need to:\n1.

Identify background and main object\n\n- The background color is the one that fills most of the grid.  \n  In the test input, color `1` dominates the lower 23 rows, so background = `1`.\n- Non\u2011background objects are maximal 4\u2011connected components of non\u20111 colors.\n- Among these, find the largest connected component: here it is the big mass of `4`s in the top 7 rows (rows 0\u20136).\n  - All `4`s in rows 0\u20136 are 4\u2011connected via the full rows of `4`s at row0 and row6.\n  - No `4`s appear below row6.\n- Crop the grid to the bounding box of this component:\n  - rows 0\u20136, columns 0\u201329 \u2192 a 7\u00d730 grid.\n- Inside this cropped region, treat:\n  - `4` as the \u201cobject material\u201d.\n  - `1` as *holes* inside the object (since no `1` in this region touches the crop boundary; all are completely surrounded by `4`).\n\nAll non\u2011`1` cells below row6 are \u201cscattered objects\u201d used only to determine filling colors; they are not kept directly.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Find hole shapes inside the main object\n\nWithin the 7\u00d730 crop (rows 0\u20136), I found all 4\u2011connected components of `1` and classified their shapes up to translation and rotation. The distinct **hole shapes** are:\n\n1. **L\u2011triomino (3 cells) \u2013 shape L3**  \n   Bounding box 2\u00d72 with 3 cells in an L.  \n   Occurs 4 times:\n   - At columns 1\u20132 (rows 1\u20132 and 4\u20135).\n   - At columns 27\u201328 (rows 1\u20132 and 4\u20135).\n\n2. **Plus\u2011shape (5 cells) \u2013 shape PLUS5**  \n   Bounding box 3\u00d73, cross: center + one cell in each of the four cardinal directions.  \n   Occurs **twice**:\n   - Left side, around columns 3\u20135 (rows 2\u20134).\n   - Right side, around columns 24\u201326 (rows 2\u20134).\n\n3. **T\u2011shape (4 cells) \u2013 shape T4**  \n   Bounding box 3\u00d72: three in a row plus a centered fourth one above or below (\u201cT\u201d).  \n   Occurs **four** times:\n   - Above-left & above-right (rows 1\u20132) and the corresponding flipped shapes (rows 4\u20135).\n\n4. **U\u2011shape (8 cells) \u2013 shape U8**  \n   Bounding box 6\u00d72 after normalization: \u201c\u2229\u201d or \u201c\u222a\u201d (full top row of length 6, and only the two corners in the opposite row).  \n   Occurs **twice**:\n   - Top middle (rows 1\u20132, cols 12\u201317).\n   - Bottom middle (rows 4\u20135, cols 12\u201317).\n\n5. **Line of length 5 (5 cells) \u2013 shape LINE5**  \n   A straight line of 5 cells.  \n   Occurs **twice**, both as vertical columns:\n   - Column 10, rows 1\u20135.\n   - Column 19, rows 1\u20135.\n\n6. **Line of length 2 (2 cells) \u2013 shape LINE2**  \n   A straight line of two adjacent cells.  \n   Occurs **once**:\n   - Row 3, columns 14\u201315 (horizontal pair).\n\nEvery `1` in the 7\u00d730 crop belongs to one of these shapes.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Collect scattered objects and match shapes\n\nNow look at the **entire original input**, excluding the main `4` object, and find all 4\u2011connected components of non\u2011background colors (colors \u2260 1). For each component:\n\n- Record its shape (same representation as for holes, up to translation and rotation).\n- Record its color.\n\nThen, **for each hole shape**, gather all scattered components with the same shape and count colors. The fill color is the most frequent color among those matches.\n\n#### 3.1. Shape L3 (3\u2011cell L)\n\nFound scattered L3 components:\n\n- Color `7`: 3 components (three different L\u2011shapes in rows 8\u20139, 18\u201319, 25\u201326).\n- Color `8`: 1 component (an L of `8`s near rows 10\u201311).\n- Color `3`: 1 component (L of `3`s near rows 12\u201313).\n\nResult: **L3 \u2192 color 7** (most frequent).\n\n#### 3.2. Shape PLUS5 (5\u2011cell plus)\n\nScattered PLUS5 components:\n\n- Color `6`: 2 pluses of `6` (e.g., around (19,2) and around (15,16)).\n- Color `8`: 3 pluses of `8` (clusters around (13,9), (19,25), (23,20)).\n- Color `3`: 1 plus of `3` (around (20,7)).\n- Color `9`: 1 plus of `9` (around (26,26)).\n\nResult: **PLUS5 \u2192 color 8**.\n\n#### 3.3. Shape T4 (4\u2011cell T)\n\nScattered T4 components (bounding 3\u00d72 or 2\u00d73, i.e., any rotated T):\n\n- Color `9`: 2 Ts (near (8\u20139,7\u20139) and (16\u201317,6\u20138)).\n- Color `6`: 1 T (near (10\u201311,22\u201324)).\n- Color `2`: 2 Ts (one over (22\u201323,11\u201313), one over (25\u201327,16\u201317)).\n- Color `3`: 2 Ts (over (21\u201323,28\u201329) and (27\u201328,20\u201322)).\n\nIf we combine all orientations, colors 2,3,9 each appear twice.  \nBut our **hole Ts are only vertical Ts** (width 3, height 2).  \nRestricting to vertical Ts:\n\n- Vertical T components:\n  - `9`: 2  \n  - `6`: 1  \n  - `2`: 1  \n  - `3`: 1  \n\nSo for the **vertical T4** shape used by the holes:\n\n> **T4 (vertical) \u2192 color 9**\n\n(Ignoring horizontal Ts, since there are no horizontal T holes.)\n\n#### 3.4. Shape U8 (8\u2011cell U)\n\nUnique scattered U\u2011shape found:\n\n- A vertical \u201cU\u201d of `9`s: a column of 6 `9`s with two extra `9`s at the top and bottom of the adjacent column (rows 18\u201323, cols 16\u201317).\n\nRotating this matches the U8 hole shape (same connectivity and cell count).\n\nResult: **U8 \u2192 color 9**.\n\n#### 3.5. Shape LINE5 (5\u2011cell straight line)\n\nScattered LINE5 components:\n\n- A horizontal run of five `6`s in row 27, columns 8\u201312.\n\nNo other 5\u2011cell straight lines appear as a maximal component.\n\nResult: **LINE5 \u2192 color 6**  \n(orientation doesn\u2019t matter; rotation of the 5\u2011segment still a straight line.)\n\n#### 3.6. Shape LINE2 (2\u2011cell straight line)\n\nScattered LINE2 components:\n\n- Color `2`:\n  - A horizontal pair of `2`s in row 8 (cols 25\u201326).\n  - Two vertical pairs of `2`s (rows 14\u201315, col2; rows 24\u201325, col7).\n\nAll 2\u2011cell straight line components are color `2`; none of other colors have isolated size\u20112 line components.\n\nResult: **LINE2 \u2192 color 2**.\n\n---\n\n### 4.

These components are the \u201cslots\u201d we must colour.  \n   Their shapes (up to rotation / reflection) are:\n\n   - **Type L\u2083 (3\u2011cell L corner)** \u2013 four components at:\n     - (2,2\u20133;3,2), (5,2;6,2\u20133), (2,28\u201329;3,29), (5,29;6,28\u201329).\n   - **Type T\u2084 (4\u2011cell T)** \u2013 four components:\n     - (2,7\u20139;3,8), (5,8;6,7\u20139), (2,22\u201324;3,23), (5,23;6,22\u201324).\n   - **Type V\u2085 (straight line of length 5)** \u2013 two vertical bars:\n     - column 11, rows 2\u20136; column 20, rows 2\u20136.\n   - **Type P\u2085 (plus of 5 cells)** \u2013 two pluses:\n     - centre left around (4,5); centre right around (4,26).\n   - **Type R\u2081\u2086 (large rectangular ring)** \u2013 one component:\n     - row 2, cols 13\u201318;\n     - row 6, cols 13\u201318;\n     - row 3, cols 13 and 18;\n     - row 5, cols 13 and 18.\n   - **Type D\u2082 (domino, 2 adjacent cells)** \u2013 one component:\n     - cells (4,15) and (4,16).\n\n3. **Catalogue shapes in the piece area**\n\n   In rows 8\u201330 (background `1`), find connected components of each non\u20111,\n   non\u20114 colour, again 4\u2011connected, and note their shapes:\n\n   - **Colour 7:** all its components are 3\u2011cell L shapes (L\u2083).\n   - **Colour 3:** has several T\u2011shapes of 4 cells (T\u2084) and some other small shapes.\n   - **Colour 6:** has a straight line of 5 cells (horizontal) and some plus\u2011shapes.\n   - **Colour 8:** has several 5\u2011cell pluses (P\u2085) and one 3\u2011cell L.\n   - **Colour 9:** includes the largest piece, an 8\u2011cell \u201cthick vertical line with\n     bulges\u201d and a 5\u2011cell plus, i.e. it is the natural candidate for the big ring\u2011like\n     role.\n   - **Colour 2:** has a 2\u2011cell domino (two horizontally adjacent cells) among other\n     small shapes.\n\n   For each slot type we pick the colour whose pieces match that shape type\n   in the piece area:\n\n   - L\u2083 \u2192 **colour 7** (all 7\u2011components are L\u2083).\n   - T\u2084 \u2192 **colour 3** (3 has clear T\u2011shapes).\n   - V\u2085 (line of 5) \u2192 **colour 6** (has a 5\u2011cell line).\n   - P\u2085 (plus) \u2192 **colour 8** (several 5\u2011cell pluses).\n   - R\u2081\u2086 (ring) \u2192 **colour 9** (largest \u201cbar\u2011like\u201d component).\n   - D\u2082 (domino) \u2192 **colour 2** (explicit 2\u2011cell domino).\n\n   Then every `1` in the template is recoloured according to the slot type of its\n   connected component; all `4`s stay `4`.\n\n4. **Apply the recolouring**\n\n   Replacing each `1` in rows 2\u20136 by its mapped colour, and cropping the grid to\n   the 7\u00d730 template rectangle, yields:\n\n   - Row 1: unchanged, all `4`.\n   - Row 2: L\u2083, T\u2084, V\u2085, ring, etc. recoloured.\n   - Row 3\u20136: likewise, respecting symmetry.\n   - Row 7: unchanged, all `4`.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,7,7,4,4,4,3,3,3,4,6,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,6,4,3,3,3,4,4,4,7,7,4\n4,7,4,4,8,4,4,3,4,4,6,4,9,4,4,4,4,9,4,6,4,4,3,4,4,8,4,4,7,4\n4,4,4,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,4,4,4\n4,7,4,4,8,4,4,3,4,4,6,4,9,4,4,4,4,9,4,6,4,4,3,4,4,8,4,4,7,4\n4,7,7,4,4,4,3,3,3,4,6,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,6,4,3,3,3,4,4,4,7,7,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      4,7,7,4,4,4,3,3,3,4,6,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,6,4,3,3,3,4,4,4,7,7,4\n      4,7,4,4,8,4,4,3,4,4,6,4,9,4,4,4,4,9,4,6,4,4,3,4,4,8,4,4,7,4\n      4,4,4,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,2,2,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,4,4,4\n      4,7,4,4,8,4,4,3,4,4,6,4,9,4,4,4,4,9,4,6,4,4,3,4,4,8,4,4,7,4\n      4,7,7,4,4,4,3,3,3,4,6,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,6,4,3,3,3,4,4,4,7,7,4\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"B\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_11_step_5_gemini_gen_sol\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nTo solve the task I first isolated the \u201cboard\u201d that has to be completed. In all the examples the output is just the bounding box of the large block of a single colour at the top of the input; here the top 7\u202frows of colour\u202f4 form a 7\u00d730 lattice with internal holes where the value is\u202f1.\n\nI listed every connected component of holes (4\u2011neighbour connectivity) within those 7\u00d730 cells. There are six distinct shapes repeated across the lattice:\n\n- L\u2011shapes of 3 cells (four orientations) at (1,1)\u2026 etc.\n- T\u2011shapes of 4 cells (two orientations).\n- A single horizontal domino of 2\u202fcells.\n- Two vertical lines of length\u202f5.\n- Two \u201cU\u201d shapes of 8\u202fcells (a 6\u2011cell bar with two supports).\n- Two plus\u2011shapes of 5\u202fcells.\n\nAll other cells in the 7\u00d730 region are walls of colour\u202f4.\n\nThe sprites in the lower part of the input were analysed to find which colours have which shapes.

All holes of that shape are then colored with that chosen color.\n\nShapes are considered up to rotation / reflection (orientation doesn\u2019t matter), and connectivity is 4-neighbour (up/down/left/right).\n\n---\n\n## 1. Find the template in the test input\n\nIn the test grid, color 4 appears only in the top block:\n\n- Rows 1\u20137 contain many 4s forming a complete rectangular band with a 4 border on all sides.\n- Rows 8\u201330 are almost entirely color 1 with various small colored objects (2,3,6,7,8,9) but no 4s.\n\nSo the **template region** is rows 1\u20137, columns 1\u201330 (7\u00d730).  \nInside this region, color 4 is the frame; color 1 represents holes.\n\nThe output will therefore be a **7\u00d730** grid.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

In the given examples the template is a rectangular region with a uniform frame color and holes of a different color, and the output consists of that region with the holes filled. In the test case the only such region is the block of 4\u2019s at the top of the input: rows\u202f1\u20137 and columns\u202f1\u201330 form a 30\u00d77 rectangle, with the border all 4\u2019s and holes marked by 1\u2019s.\n\nI then listed the connected components of holes within this 7\u00d730 area and categorized their shapes: L\u2011shapes of 3 cells, T\u2011shapes of 4 cells, plus signs of 5 cells, straight lines (a horizontal length\u20112 line and two vertical length\u20115 lines), and two \u201cU\u201d\u2011shaped components of 8 cells.\n\nNext, I scanned the remainder of the input (rows\u202f8\u201330) for all colored objects (cells not equal to 1), identified their shapes, and counted how many objects of each color occurred for each shape type. The most frequent colors per shape type were:\n- plus shape: color\u202f8 (4 occurrences),\n- L\u2011shape: color\u202f7 (3 occurrences),\n- T\u2011shape: color\u202f9 (3 occurrences),\n- line segment: color\u202f2 (three length\u20112 line components, versus one length\u20115 line of color\u202f6),\n- U\u2011shape: color\u202f9 (the only matching component is a rotated U\u2011shaped cluster of color\u202f9).\n\nFinally, I filled each hole component in the template region with the corresponding color for its shape category, leaving all original 4\u2019s unchanged.

                "response": "**Auditing ARC Candidate Solutions**\n\nOkay, so I've been given a task to analyze several solutions for an ARC puzzle. The core of this puzzle involves a grid with a defined template region (identified by a frame color) containing \"holes\" (background color inside the frame), and a scattered region with various colored shapes outside the template. The objective is to fill the holes in the template based on matching shapes found in the scattered region.\n\nFirst, I had to deeply analyze the provided training examples to understand the underlying pattern. This involved examining the input and output grids, identifying the shapes within the template holes and the corresponding shapes in the scattered region, and finally, deducing the transformation rules. I paid close attention to details, such as the size and shape of the holes, the color assignments, and the presence of any repeated patterns.\n\nFor the actual test input, the process was similar: identify the template and its holes, characterize the scattered shapes, and establish a mapping between them. I carefully examined each candidate solution, comparing their predicted output with the expected result based on my analysis. I also looked for any signs of errors, particularly in the shape recognition or color assignment. I created a set of tests. I then evaluated each candidate's performance based on its accuracy in mapping shapes and its ability to handle different shapes.\n\nI also needed to check if the candidates understood the concept of identifying the exact color and shapes from the input in the scattered section, then mapping them to the correct section within the template to fill.\n\nI noticed that some candidates had issues with certain shapes or color assignments. For example, some incorrectly matched shapes with different dimensions or color frequencies. Some solutions were also truncated.\n\nI had to audit each candidate based on their output by going through each input candidate and checking to see if they are consistent with the known shapes in the input.\n\nCandidate 14 was the most promising because it precisely captured the essence of the puzzle. It correctly identifies the shapes and mapping them from the scattered part. It demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of the problem and provided a detailed explanation. However, other candidates had minor flaws, such as inaccuracies in shape or frequency recognition.\n\nIn conclusion, I ranked the candidates based on accuracy, completeness, and reasoning clarity. Candidate 14 showed the strongest understanding and provided accurate and well-reasoned solutions.\n\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 3,\n      \"score\": 5.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Correctly identifies the crop-and-fill strategy, but the shape matching logic for the test input is imprecise (fuzzy matching).\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Identify template and holes; fill holes by matching shape geometry with scattered objects.
