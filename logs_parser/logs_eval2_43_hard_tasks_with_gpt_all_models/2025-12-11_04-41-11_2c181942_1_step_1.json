Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis of an ARC Task: The Docking Station Problem**\n\nOkay, so the challenge here is to figure out the rules for transforming these grids. It looks like we're dealing with a \"docking station\" concept. Here's my thought process:\n\n1.  **Grid Makeup**: Most of the grid is filled with a background color (8, in this case). But there are these interesting \"shapes\" or objects made up of different colors.\n\n2.  **Object Detection**: I'm seeing \"connected components\" of non-background colors. Each example seems to have a central structure and separate objects that interact with it.\n\n3.  **Example 1 Deep Dive**: Let's break down the examples. Example 1 shows us that the shapes and their arrangement are altered from the input to the output. Specifically: There is a \"cross\" shaped dock (the central object) that pulls in any \"dangling\" coloured shapes to itself!\n\n4.  **How Docking Works**:\n    *   **The Docking Process**: Shapes that match the color of a corresponding side on the central object are attracted and merge/dock with it. Shapes of unmatched colors disappear.\n    *   **Geometric Alignment**: The shapes seem to rotate to have their best-fit side connect.\n\n5.  **Let's Verify**:\n    *   Example 2, confirms it. We are seeing a pattern of \"matching colors attract/dock, others disappear/don't move\".\n\n6.  **Detailed Mechanics of Docking**:\n    *   **Geometry and Matching**: The shapes appear to be rotating to fit. The rotation is probably such that the contacting side is maximized.\n    *   **Hypothesis**: Shapes rotate and attach, where the 'fit' optimizes. Maybe the dimension of the contact edge matters.\n\n7.  **Final Hypothesis**: Shapes rotate so that an appropriate \"side\" is facing the dock. If a shape is horizontal, it rotates to vertical and merges. If it's a square, it's unchanged.\n\n8.  **Test Input Analysis**: With the hypothesis in mind, I need to see how the rule applies to this new input.\n    *   The Central Dock. The colors of the central Dock are extracted.\n    *   Find the Shapes. Locate individual shapes that \"float\" around the central dock.\n    *   Apply the Rotation. Rotate the shapes to their \"best fit\" orientation.\n    *   Let's create the shapes:\n        *   Blue -> Rotate, attach.\n        *   Magenta -> Rotate, attach.\n        *   Yellow -> No Rotate, attach.\n        *   Red -> Rotate, attach.\n        *   Green -> Unmatched/Disappear\n\n9.  **Build the Solution**: Now that I have the \"assembly instructions\", I just apply those to the input grid.\n    *   Create a blank grid with the correct dimensions (24x26).\n    *   Draw the central station.\n    *   Draw each of the moved shapes.\n\n10. **Test and Verify**. Let's run a quick check to ensure that the shapes are aligned and make sure there are no overlaps.\n\n11. **Final Result**. Finally, the output should be generated based on the above.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on a pattern observed in the examples.\n\n### Reasoning\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Structure (\"Docking Station\")**:\n    *   In all examples and the test input, there is a central cluster of pixels with an empty $2 \\times 2$ center (filled with the background color 8).\n    *   This \"docking station\" is composed of four different colored anchors, located at the Top, Bottom, Left, and Right of the central hole.\n    *   **In the Test Input**:\n        *   **Center Hole**: Rows 12-13, Columns 15-16.\n        *   **Top Anchor (Blue/1)**: Row 11, Columns 15-16. (Width 2).\n        *   **Bottom Anchor (Magenta/6)**: Row 14, Columns 15-16. (Width 2).\n        *   **Left Anchor (Yellow/4)**: Rows 12-13, Column 14. (Height 2).\n        *   **Right Anchor (Red/2)**: Rows 12-13, Column 17. (Height 2).\n\n2.  **Identify Scattered Shapes**:\n    *   There are several other shapes scattered throughout the grid.\n    *   **Blue Shape**: Top Right. A cross/diamond shape.\n    *   **Red Shape**: Top Left. A hollow square-like shape.\n    *   **Yellow Shape**: Middle Right. A rectangular shape with gaps.\n    *   **Magenta Shape**: Bottom Center. A large \"T\" or cross shape on its side.\n    *   **Green Shape**: Middle Left.\n    *   **Rule**: Only shapes with a color matching one of the station's anchors are preserved. The Green shape has no matching anchor (Green is not in the station), so it is discarded.\n\n3.  **Determine Movement and Rotation**:\n    *   Each surviving shape moves to attach to the anchor of its corresponding color.\n    *   **Rotation Rule**: The shape rotates so that its connecting side matches the dimensions of the anchor.\n        *   **Top/Bottom Anchors** are Horizontal (Width 2). The attaching shape must present a width of 2.\n        *   **Left/Right Anchors** are Vertical (Height 2). The attaching shape must present a height of 2.\n\n4.  **Apply Transformations**:\n    *   **Blue Shape (Target: Top Anchor)**:\n        *   Input: A $3 \\times 4$ shape. Top/Bottom ends are width 1.\n        *   Transformation: Rotates 90\u00b0 to become $4 \\times 3$. The new bottom side has width 2, matching the Top Anchor's width.\n        *   Placement: Attaches above the Blue anchor.\n    *   **Magenta Shape (Target: Bottom Anchor)**:\n        *   Input: A shape with a long vertical bar and a protrusion. The \"left\" side of the protrusion has height 2.\n        *   Transformation: Rotates 90\u00b0 Clockwise so the \"left\" side becomes the \"top\" side (width 2). This matches the Bottom Anchor's width.\n        *   Placement: Attaches below the Magenta anchor.\n    *   **Yellow Shape (Target: Left Anchor)**:\n        *   Input: A shape where the right vertical edge is height 2.\n        *   Transformation: No rotation needed, as the height (2) already matches the Left Anchor's height.\n        *   Placement: Attaches to the left of the Yellow anchor.\n    *   **Red Shape (Target: Right Anchor)**:\n        *   Input: A shape where the side edges are not contiguous height 2.\n        *   Transformation: Rotates 90\u00b0 Counter-Clockwise. The new \"left\" side presents a solid vertical bar of height 2, matching the Right Anchor.\n        *   Placement: Attaches to the right of the Red anchor.\n\n5.  **Final Construction**:\n    *   Clear the grid to background color (8).\n    *   Draw the Docking Station.\n    *   Draw the four transformed shapes in their new positions.\n\n### Output Grid\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition:**\n\nAlright, the task is to decipher a pattern from a set of input/output grid pairs, a classic ARC problem.  I need to understand how the input grids, filled with integer-coded colors (0-9, with 8 as the background), are transformed into the output grids.  My initial focus is on identifying repeating elements or transformations.  I suspect that the color '8' represents the background, a common ARC convention.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis: Identifying Components**\n\nLet's begin by tracing individual objects in the first example.  There are distinct shapes of different colors against the background.  My initial thought is that the objects themselves, not their position, are key to the transformation.  The shapes are scattered in the input.\n\nIt seems the objects are not just placed randomly. There appear to be markers \u2013 a Top, a Bottom, a Left and a Right, creating some sort of container/hub where the other parts are assembled. The background color acts as an empty space filler.\n\n**Example 1: Tracing Objects, Initial Hypothesis, and Object Characteristics**\n\nLooking at the first example, I'm identifying shapes by their color (a red U, a blue line, a yellow shape, etc.).  My focus is on understanding the shapes and how they interact.  The initial analysis yields:\n\n- Object A (Red): This has a strange trapezoid shape in the input, but it's really like a 'boat' with a missing bottom.\n- Object B (Magenta):  This is just a line.\n- Object C (Green): A vertical line.\n- Object D (Red): Wait, there's another red thing? It is also a vertical line. This one is on different rows from the previous red.\n- Object E (Blue): Two adjacent pixels, a horizontal line.\n- Object F (Yellow): Another weird shape, kind of like a volcano or hat. It's a 2x2 on top of a 1x4 horizontal line.\n- Object G (Green):  Looks like an alien, a more complex structure (like an inverted U with some vertical connections).\n\nThe output, it seems, has combined all these distinct components.  This suggests these individual parts need to be properly identified.\n\n**Output Analysis and Object Matching (Refining the Analysis)**\n\nObserving the output, the shapes are grouped together. It also looks like a vertical line shape (Object C) is attached to a Magenta/Blue shape. There are recognizable pieces within this composite shape. My current hypothesis is that the individual objects from the input are moved and combined into the output (possibly overlapping).\n\nNow, comparing Object G in the input with the output, I see the green shape in the output might be part of an \"Invader\" shape. However, this shape might be a result of the combination of the markers and the key. These Markers are probably the key to understanding the pattern. I also note that the markers in the Output were the same as the input positions.\n\nIn the Input Grid, there are the following:\n\n- Top: Magenta(6) at Row 8.\n- Bottom: Blue(1) at Row 11.\n- Left: Green(3).\n- Right: Red(2).\n\nThese \"markers\" define a region (Rows 8-11). What's inside?\n\n**Hypothesis: Assembly Around a Central \"Hub\" (Re-evaluation)**\n\nIt seems all the shapes are placed within or around the \"hub.\" These markers and floating pieces are not placed at random. I suspect all the floating objects are moved near these markers in the output.\n\n**Example 2: Refining the Model**\n\nMoving on to Example 2. Let's trace objects (I will only trace the keys, not the markers, so the analysis is easier).\n- The Hub is now at Rows 7-10.\n- 3 floating objects: Green, Blue, Red.\n\nThe output shows a similar assembly near the hub.\n\n**Re-reading the Examples and Identifying Key Attributes**\n\nSo what am I actually seeing? The floating shapes are moved to the hub.\n\nLet's carefully write down all the pieces.\n\nExample 1:\n\n- Input: The pieces are Red, Green, Yellow, etc. They are not random.\n- Output: The pieces (red, green, etc) are moved together to form an assembly.\n- Pieces:  I need a structured way to write down the shape of the components.\n\nLet's read the Input as:\n\n- Input 1:\n\n- Object 1: Boat (4 width, 2 width) -- Red.\n- Object 2: Line (2 pixels wide) -- Magenta.\n- Object 3: Line (1 pixel wide) -- Green.\n- Object 4: Line (1 pixel\n\nThe problem asks us to solve an ARC task where we need to transform a grid containing several colored shapes. From the solved examples, we can infer a transformation rule involving a central \"hub\" and several \"key\" shapes scattered around it.\n\n**Inferred Transformation Rule:**\n1.  **Identify the Hub:** There is a central structure in the grid composed of four colored markers (Top, Bottom, Left, Right) surrounding a 2x2 empty space (or hole). In the test input, this hub is located around rows 10-13 and columns 13-16 (0-indexed).\n    *   Top Marker (Blue `1 1`): Row 10, Columns 14-15.\n    *   Left Marker (Yellow `4 4`): Rows 11-12, Column 13.\n    *   Right Marker (Red `2 2`): Rows 11-12, Column 16.\n    *   Bottom Marker (Magenta `6 6`): Row 13, Columns 14-15.\n\n2.  **Identify the Keys:** There are distinct shapes of corresponding colors scattered elsewhere in the grid.\n    *   Blue Key (matches Top): Located at the top left.\n    *   Yellow Key (matches Left): Located at the bottom right/center.\n    *   Red Key (matches Right): Located at the top left/center.\n    *   Magenta Key (matches Bottom): Located at the bottom center.\n\n3.  **Transformation:**\n    *   Each key is **rotated 90 degrees clockwise**.\n    *   The rotated key is then moved to attach to its corresponding marker on the hub.\n    *   The attachment aligns the key such that it connects to the marker (usually centering the connecting side of the key on the marker). The key stays outside the central hole.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Blue Key (Top):**\n    *   Input Shape: A diamond-like shape (`.1./111/111/.1.`).\n    *   Rotated 90\u00b0 CW: `.11./1111/.11.`.\n    *   Placement: Attached above the Top Marker (Row 10). It occupies rows 7-9, columns 13-16.\n\n*   **Yellow Key (Left):**\n    *   Input Shape: `4..4/4444/.44.`.\n    *   Rotated 90\u00b0 CW: `.44/444/444/.44`.\n    *   Placement: Attached to the left of the Left Marker (Column 13). It occupies rows 10-13, columns 10-12.\n\n*   **Red Key (Right):**\n    *   Input Shape: `.22./.22./.22./2..2`.\n    *   Rotated 90\u00b0 CW: `...2/222./222./...2`.\n    *   Placement: Attached to the right of the Right Marker (Column 16). It occupies rows 10-13, columns 17-20.\n\n*   **Magenta Key (Bottom):**\n    *   Input Shape: `...6/...6/6666/6666/...6/...6`.\n    *   Rotated 90\u00b0 CW: `..66../..66../..66../666666`.\n    *   Placement: Attached below the Bottom Marker (Row 13). It occupies rows 14-17, columns 12-17.\n\nThe final grid consists of the background (8s) with the Hub Markers and the newly attached Rotated Keys.\n\n**Test Output Grid:**\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "Below is the reasoning I used to construct a consistent transformation and then apply it to the test grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the examples suggest\n\nFrom the three solved examples:\n\n- The background color is always 8.\n- Colors that appear in **multiple disconnected components** are treated differently from colors that form a **single connected component**.\n- In the outputs:\n  - Colors with **only one connected component** tend to be **left in place** (e.g. color 4 in Example 2, colors 1 and 6 in Example 1, etc.).\n  - Colors with **multiple disconnected components** get **all of their pixels gathered together into a single compact cluster**:\n    - The total number of pixels of that color is preserved.\n    - The new cluster is vertically symmetric (row counts form a palindrome like 1\u20113\u20113\u20111, 2\u20113\u20113\u20112, 2\u20114\u20114\u20112, etc.).\n    - The exact horizontal skew varies but each row\u2019s pixels are **contiguous**.\n  - The rest of the grid is reset to background 8 where nothing is drawn.\n\nSo a workable abstraction is:\n\n> - Keep single-component colors as-is.  \n> - For colors with multiple components, erase their original pixels and redraw all their pixels as a single vertically symmetric, compact blob in a central horizontal band, with a shape determined by the total number of pixels of that color.\n\nThe exact geometric layouts used in the examples for 6, 8, 10, 12, \u2026 pixels all follow the \u201cpalindromic row-length\u201d idea:\n\n- 6 pixels \u2192 3 rows: 2,2,2\n- 8 pixels \u2192 4 rows: 1,3,3,1\n- 10 pixels \u2192 typically 4 rows: 2,3,3,2\n- 12 pixels \u2192 4 rows: 2,4,4,2  \n  (and by extension we can use 3,4,4,3 for 14 pixels)\n\nWithin each row, the pixels are in one solid run (contiguous in columns).\n\n### Where to place the new clusters?\n\nFrom the examples:\n\n- Clusters for \u201caggregated\u201d colors are put in **one horizontal band** (4 or so rows) somewhere around the **middle of the grid**, and spaced out horizontally so they don\u2019t overlap.\n- Colors are ordered roughly left\u2011to\u2011right based on where their \u201cmost central\u201d original components lie (mean column of the component nearest the grid center).\n\nTo solve the test case, I adopt the same idea:\n\n1. Choose one central band of 4 rows.\n2. For each multi-component color, choose a canonical vertical pattern based on its pixel count.\n3. Order these colors by the horizontal position of their \u201canchor\u201d component (closest to grid center).\n4. Place the canonical shapes in that band, spaced horizontally so they do not overlap.\n5. Leave any single-component colors where they were and erase all other non-background pixels.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Analyze the test input\n\nThe test grid is 24\u00d726. Background is 8.\n\n### 2.1. Count components and pixels per color\n\nColors present: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6.\n\n#### Color 1\n\nCoordinates:\n\n- Cluster A (top-right): rows 2\u20135, col 18\u201320:\n  - r2: (2,18)\n  - r3: (3,18\u201320)\n  - r4: (4,18\u201320)\n  - r5: (5,18)\n  \u2192 8 cells (one component).\n\n- Cluster B (middle): row 11, cols 15\u201316:\n  - r11: (11,15\u201316)\n  \u2192 2 cells.\n\nTotal N\u2081 = 8 + 2 = **10** pixels, in **2 components**.\n\nSo color 1 will be aggregated.\n\nThe \u201canchor\u201d component (closest to grid center at (12.5,13.5)) is the middle one at (11,15\u201316); its centroid \u2248 (11,15.5).\n\n#### Color 2\n\nCoordinates:\n\n- r4\u20136, c4\u20135: vertical 3\u00d72 block (6 cells).\n- r7: (7,3) and (7,6): 2 separated singletons.\n- r12\u201313: (12,17), (13,17): vertical pair.\n\nTotal N\u2082 = 6 + 2 + 2 = **10** pixels in **4 components**.\n\nAnchor component closest to grid center is the vertical pair at (12\u201313,17), centroid \u2248 (12.5,17).\n\n#### Color 3\n\nCoordinates (only one cluster):\n\n- r14: (14,5\u20136)\n- r15: (15,4\u20136)\n- r16: (16,4\u20135)\n\nTotal N\u2083 = **7** pixels, **1 component**.\n\nColor 3 remains **unchanged**.\n\n#### Color 4\n\nCoordinates:\n\n- Component A (central pair):\n  - r12\u201313, c14\n- Component B (right cluster):\n  - r15: c21, c24\n  - r16: c21\u201324\n  - r17: c22\u201323\n\nTotal N\u2084 = 2 + 8 = **10** pixels, in **2 components**.\n\nAnchor component is the central pair at (12\u201313,14), centroid \u2248 (12.5,14).\n\n#### Color 6\n\nCoordinates:\n\n- Component A (near middle-right):\n  - r14, c15\u201316 (2 cells)\n- Component B (larger bottom cluster):\n  - r18\u201319, c13 (2 cells)\n  - r20\u201321, c10\u201313 (8 cells)\n  - r22\u201323, c13 (2 cells)\n\nTotal N\u2086 = 2 + 12 = **14** pixels, in **2 components**.\n\nAnchor component is the middle-right pair at (14,15\u201316), centroid \u2248 (14,15.5).\n\n### 2.2. Which colors aggregate?\n\n- Multi-component: 1, 2, 4, 6 \u2192 **aggregate** into new clusters.\n- Single-component: 3 \u2192 **leave as-is**.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Choose canonical shapes for each aggregated color\n\nWe use a 4-row, vertically symmetric pattern (palindromic row counts), with contiguous runs per row.\n\n- For N = 10 (colors 1, 2, 4), use pattern **[2,3,3,2]**:\n  - Over 4 consecutive rows:\n    - Row pattern of lengths: 2, 3, 3, 2.\n\nCanonical layout for a center column `c`:\n\n- Row r (top of band):          columns c, c+1     \u2192 2 cells\n- Row r+1 and r+2 (middle):     columns c\u22121..c+1   \u2192 3 cells\n- Row r+3 (bottom):             columns c, c+1     \u2192 2 cells\n\n- For N = 14 (color 6), use pattern **[3,4,4,3]**:\n  - Layout for center column `c`:\n\n- Row r:                        columns c\u22121..c+1   \u2192 3 cells\n- Rows r+1 and r+2:             columns c\u22121..c+2   \u2192 4 cells\n- Row r+3:                      columns c\u22121..c+1   \u2192 3 cells\n\nTotal 3 + 4 + 4 + 3 = 14.\n\n### 3.1. Select common vertical band\n\nPick rows 9\u201312 as the aggregation band; it is above the original color-3 cluster (rows 14\u201316) and near the vertical middle.\n\nSo for all aggregated colors, the 4-row band is rows 9,10,11,12.\n\n### 3.2. Horizontal ordering and centers\n\nOrder aggregated colors left\u2192right by the x-coordinate of their anchor component:\n\n- Color 4: anchor at col 14.\n- Color 1: anchor at col 15.5.\n- Color 6: anchor at col 15.5 (same; but lower rows).\n- Color 2: anchor at col 17.\n\nSorted: **4, 1, 6, 2** (ties broken by anchor row / arbitrary but consistent).\n\nNow assign non-overlapping center columns in this order:\n\n- Color 4 \u2192 center column c\u2084 = 6\n- Color 1 \u2192 center column c\u2081 = 11\n- Color 6 \u2192 center column c\u2086 = 17\n- Color 2 \u2192 center column c\u2082 = 23\n\nAll widths fit in 1\u202626 and ranges do not overlap:\n\n- Color 4, N=10, pattern [2,3,3,2], c\u2084 = 6:\n  - Row 9:  c6\u20137\n  - Row 10: c5\u20137\n  - Row 11: c5\u20137\n  - Row 12: c6\u20137\n\n- Color 1, N=10, pattern [2,3,3,2], c\u2081 = 11:\n  - Row 9:  c11\u201312\n  - Row 10: c10\u201312\n  - Row 11: c10\u201312\n  - Row 12: c11\u201312\n\n- Color 6, N=14, pattern [3,4,4,3], c\u2086 = 17:\n  - Row 9:  c16\u201318\n  - Row 10: c16\u201319\n  - Row 11: c16\u201319\n  - Row 12: c16\u201318\n\n- Color 2, N=10, pattern [2,3,3,2], c\u2082 = 23:\n  - Row 9:  c23\u201324\n  - Row 10: c22\u201324\n  - Row 11: c22\u201324\n  - Row 12: c23\u201324\n\n---\n\n## 4. Construct the output grid\n\nStart from an all-8 grid (24\u00d726).\n\n1. **Keep color 3 cluster exactly as in the input**:\n\n- Row 14: columns 5\u20136 = 3\n- Row 15: columns 4\u20136 = 3\n- Row 16: columns 4\u20135 = 3\n\n2. **Place aggregated shapes for colors 4, 1, 6, 2** in rows 9\u201312 as above.\n\nEverything else remains 8.\n\n### Final output grid\n\nRow by row (24 rows, each 26 columns):\n\n1. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n2. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n3. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n4. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n5. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n6. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n7. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n8. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n9. `8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,2,2,8,8`\n10.`8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,1,1,1,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,2,2,2,8,8`\n11.`8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,1,1,1,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,2,2,2,8,8`\n12.`8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,2,2,8,8`\n13.`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n14.`8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n15.`8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n16.`8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n17.`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n18.`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n19.`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n20.`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n21.`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n22.`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n23.`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n24.`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning / inferred rule**\n\n1. **Background and colours**\n\n   - The background is colour `8`.\n   - Non\u20118 pixels form several coloured \u201cobjects\u201d.\n\n2. **Find a small background core with a 4\u2011colour cross around it**\n\n   In all three training inputs, there is a *small block of background cells* (a `2\u00d72` or `2\u00d71` block of `8`s) such that:\n\n   - Directly above that little block (north) there is a run of some non\u20118 colour `U`.\n   - Directly below it (south) there is a run of some non\u20118 colour `D`.\n   - Directly to the left (west) there is a vertical run of some non\u20118 colour `L`.\n   - Directly to the right (east) there is a vertical run of some non\u20118 colour `R`.\n   - These four colours are *all different*.\n\n   This gives us a \u201ccross skeleton\u201d:  \n   center = small block of 8s,  \n   arms = up/down/left/right coloured neighbours.\n\n   Example (test input): rows 10\u201313, cols 13\u201316:\n   ```\n   r10: 8  1  1  8\n   r11: 4  8  8  2\n   r12: 4  8  8  2\n   r13: 8  6  6  8\n        c13 c14 c15 c16\n   ```\n   The central `2\u00d72` block of 8s is at rows 11\u201312, cols 14\u201315. Its four \u201carms\u201d are:\n\n   - Up (row 10, cols 14\u201315): colour `1`\n   - Down (row 13, cols 14\u201315): colour `6`\n   - Left (rows 11\u201312, col 13): colour `4`\n   - Right (rows 11\u201312, col 16): colour `2`\n\n   So for the test we have the cross colours:\n   - Up: `1`\n   - Down: `6`\n   - Left: `4`\n   - Right: `2`\n\n3. **Discard any colours that are not part of this cross**\n\n   In each training example, any colour that never appears as one of those four arms is completely removed in the output (e.g. the `4` in Example 1).  \n\n   In the test input, colour `3` never participates in the cross skeleton (the 4\u2011colour structure is made from `1,2,4,6`), so all `3` pixels will be removed in the output.\n\n4. **Count how many pixels each cross colour has in the whole input**\n\n   In the test:\n\n   - Colour `1`: total of 10 pixels.\n   - Colour `2`: total of 10 pixels.\n   - Colour `4`: total of 10 pixels.\n   - Colour `6`: total of 14 pixels.\n   - Colour `3`: will be discarded (not used).\n\n5. **Build simple rectangular \u201carms\u201d from these counts**\n\n   Around the fixed central `2\u00d72` block of 8s (rows 11\u201312, cols 14\u201315), we build four solid rectangular arms:\n\n   - The central `2\u00d72` block itself stays 8s.\n   - Each arm has **thickness 2** (matching the 2\u2011cell width of each skeleton arm) and extends straight outwards from the central block along its direction.\n   - Let `n` be the total count of a colour. Since each arm-row or arm-column for that colour is 2 cells wide, the arm length (number of rows or columns) is `n / 2`.\n   - We keep the arm adjacent to, but not overlapping, the central 2\u00d72 block.\n\n   For the test:\n\n   - **Up arm (colour 1)**  \n     - Thickness 2 columns (cols 14\u201315).  \n     - Total pixels `n = 10` \u21d2 length `10 / 2 = 5` rows.  \n     - We already have 1 row of `1`s at row 10, cols 14\u201315 (the skeleton); we extend it upwards 4 more rows.  \n     - So colour `1` occupies rows 6\u201310, cols 14\u201315.\n\n   - **Down arm (colour 6)**  \n     - Thickness 2 columns (cols 14\u201315).  \n     - Total pixels `n = 14` \u21d2 length `14 / 2 = 7` rows.  \n     - We keep the existing row 13, cols 14\u201315 (skeleton) and extend downward.  \n     - So colour `6` occupies rows 13\u201319, cols 14\u201315.\n\n   - **Left arm (colour 4)**  \n     - Thickness 2 rows (rows 11\u201312).  \n     - Total pixels `n = 10` \u21d2 length `10 / 2 = 5` columns.  \n     - We already have a vertical 2\u2011cell segment at col 13 (the skeleton). We extend leftwards by 4 more columns.  \n     - So colour `4` occupies rows 11\u201312, cols 9\u201313.\n\n   - **Right arm (colour 2)**  \n     - Thickness 2 rows (rows 11\u201312).  \n     - Total pixels `n = 10` \u21d2 length `5` columns.  \n     - We keep the existing vertical segment at col 16 and extend right by 4 more columns.  \n     - So colour `2` occupies rows 11\u201312, cols 16\u201320.\n\n6. **Everything else becomes background**\n\n   - All pixels of colours not in the cross (here, all `3`s) are set to `8`.\n   - Any original coloured pixels not in these new arms are also set to `8`.\n\nThe result is a clean, symmetric cross structure of four rectangular arms centred around the original 2\u00d72 block of 8s, using up exactly all the pixels of colours `1,2,4,6` and erasing `3`s.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n\nHere is the final 24\u00d726 output grid:\n\nRow 0\u20135 and 20\u201323 are all 8s. The arms are in the middle as described.\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

Shapes not matching any cross color are removed\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n\nThe cross is at rows 10-13, cols 13-16:\n- Top (row 10, cols 14-15): color 1\n- Bottom (row 13, cols 14-15): color 6  \n- Left (rows 11-12, col 13): color 4\n- Right (rows 11-12, col 16): color 2\n\n**Scattered shapes matching cross colors:**\n- Color 1: rows 1-4, cols 17-19 (goes TOP)\n- Color 2: rows 3-6, cols 2-5 (goes RIGHT)\n- Color 4: rows 14-16, cols 20-23 (goes LEFT)\n- Color 6: rows 17-22, cols 9-12 (goes BOTTOM)\n\n**Transformations:**\nEach shape is rotated 90\u00b0 and positioned adjacent to the cross:\n- Color 1 rotated 90\u00b0 CW, taking center 2 cols \u2192 placed above cross\n- Color 6 rotated 90\u00b0 CW, taking center 2 cols \u2192 placed below cross\n- Color 4 rotated 90\u00b0 CCW \u2192 placed to left of cross\n- Color 2 rotated 90\u00b0 CCW \u2192 placed to right of cross\n\nThe color 3 shape is removed as it doesn't match any cross direction.\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "To solve this task I looked at the three worked examples and noticed that the output is not a direct clean\u2011up of the input but a reorganisation based on a small \u201ccross\u201d motif in the input. In each input there is a 4\u00d74 block in which a pair of cells on the top edge share one colour, a vertical pair down the left edge share a second colour, a vertical pair on the right edge share a third colour, and a pair on the bottom edge share a fourth colour, with the 2\u00d72 centre of the block being background. Those four colours are the only ones kept; any other coloured cells are discarded.\n\nThe output is then a new, symmetric cross centred on the same place. The empty 2\u00d72 centre stays empty. The total number of cells of each of the four colours in the output equals the total count of that colour anywhere in the input. The left and right arms are always four rows high (one row above the top centre row, the two centre rows, and one below) with row lengths \\([a,b,b,a]\\) so that \\(2(a+b)\\) equals the count for that arm; colour\u202f2 always uses \\(a=1\\) and \\(b=\\text{count}/2-1\\). For non\u20112 arms of size 10 the examples use \\(a=2,b=3\\). The mid\u2011row segments of the arms abut the centre; the shorter top/bottom rows are offset outwards. The top and bottom arms are vertical bars two columns wide centred on the centre columns, with height equal to half the colour count, extending upward from the row just above the centre for the top arm, and downward from the row just below the centre for the bottom arm.\n\nIn the test input the 4\u00d74 cross is at rows\u202f11\u201314 and columns\u202f14\u201317, with centre rows\u202f12\u201313 and centre columns\u202f15\u201316. The colours are top\u202f=\u202f1, left\u202f=\u202f4, right\u202f=\u202f2, bottom\u202f=\u202f6. The counts of those colours in the whole input are 10,\u202f10,\u202f10 and\u202f14 respectively. I therefore draw:\n\n- top arm of colour\u202f1, height\u202f5 rows (rows\u202f7\u201311), columns\u202f15\u201316;\n- left arm of colour\u202f4, pattern \\([2,3,3,2]\\) on rows\u202f11\u201314, with mid\u2011rows in cols\u202f12\u201314 and top/bottom rows in cols\u202f11\u201312;\n- right arm of colour\u202f2, pattern \\([1,4,4,1]\\) on rows\u202f11\u201314, with mid\u2011rows in cols\u202f17\u201320 and top/bottom rows at col\u202f20;\n- bottom arm of colour\u202f6, height\u202f7 rows (rows\u202f14\u201320), columns\u202f15\u201316.\n\nEverything else is set to background 8. The resulting 24\u00d726 grid is:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "The three worked examples all start from a sparse input with a predominance of background colour\u202f8. The transformation removes all of the original coloured pixels and rebuilds a small, vertically symmetric motif from the counts and colours of the connected components. Colours occurring in a single component of size\u202f2 are left alone; single components larger than this are dropped. Colours with multiple components are packed into palindromic \u201cblocks\u201d: for colour\u202f2 the outer rows are single pixels with two equal middle rows, for other colours the outer rows are pairs of pixels and the remaining pixels are distributed symmetrically in the middle. The reconstructed blocks are placed in the middle of the canvas, spaced horizontally so that they do not overlap.\n\nApplying that scheme to the test case: colour\u202f3 occurs only once and is removed; colour\u202f1 is rebuilt as a 2\u2011wide pillar of height\u202f5 centred in the grid; colour\u202f2 gives a [1,4,4,1] pattern on the right; colour\u202f4 a [2,3,3,2] pattern on the left; colour\u202f6 becomes a vertical bar of seven 2\u2011wide rows below the pillar. Everything else is background\u202f8.\n\nThe resulting 24\u00d726 output grid is:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",
