            "Full raw LLM response": "**Constraint Conundrum & Reachability Reasoning**\n\nOkay, I'm facing a bit of a dilemma here. The user's prompt is a bit contradictory, but I'll make the call to provide the explanation *before* the grid, as the final instruction seems more direct. Now, I have to figure out this ARC task. Let's get to it.\n\nThe task appears to involve moving some \"9s\" into a 3x3 box (containing 3s and a center 2). I need to discern the rules behind which 9s are moved.\n\nFirst, I went through the examples one-by-one, trying to understand what's happening. I quickly noticed that there are \"noise\" 9s scattered in the input and that the output changes these to \"7s\", and sometimes put 9s inside the 3x3 box. I went through and tried to note all of the coordinate details of the 9s.\n\nIn example 1, I noted how some 9s outside the box become 7s, and some of the positions inside became 9s. I tried to determine where the new 9s came from. But the specific coordinates weren't clear yet. In example 2, I examined how the 9s had moved into the box. All 9s that were \"scattered\" seemed to be moved. In example 3, it was a similar story, but without the \"6\" walls of the other examples. This made things even more complicated.\n\nInitially, I thought some were kept. There must be a reason. Then, I considered \"Connectedness\". But why were things at the top kept, and things at the bottom moved? And the shapes. It made no sense yet. I tried to figure out a rule based on what was *not* changed. I focused on \"9s\", \"7s\", and \"6s\".\n\nI hypothesized that some might be protected by \"6s\". I called these the \"6\" walls. At first, it seemed like the \"6s\" acted as walls. I also hypothesized that perhaps all 9s within \"6s\" were removed. But these didn't always work. But it didn't seem to work. Some were removed, some not. I tried to figure out what was \"inside\" the 6 structure.\n\nNext, I thought of a \"Flood Fill\". I imagined 9s being pulled to the box. I tested this with the examples. The box seemed connected. It was blocked, and unblocked. If I could get to the 9 through \"7s\", I'd get it. If not, I wouldn't. This was the key.\n\nThis changed when example 3, without \"6s\", was present. Everything changed if there weren't \"6s\". This made the flood-fill hypothesis even more important. All 9s would move if there were no \"6s\" present. If there were \"6s\", then *some* 9s moved. I realized the \"6s\" were barriers.\n\nMy new hypothesis: \"6s block 9s from moving.\" I started to classify the 9s based on where they were: Above, Below, Outside. This didn't seem to work, though. Finally, I tested if 9s could block.\n\nI started to check if the path could pass over the 9s. This meant if 9s acted like walls. And that's when it hit me. Only reachable 9s are moved. This means there's a flood. The path can only have \"7s\". And some 9s might be blocked.\n\nTo find the correct path, I must imagine a flood that goes through \"7s\" and moves, if possible, over the \"9s\" to reach the 3-box. This finally clicked with the examples, and I felt I understood the logic! \n\nTo solve this problem, I will:\n\n1.  Flood from the box through 7s.\n2.  If the 9 is met, take it!\n3.  Once the box is at capacity, stop taking 9s.\n\nNow, with the new Test Input, I went through the 9s carefully. I found 6. I'm going to set these to \"7\" and put 9s in the target box.\n\n\nThe puzzle asks us to identify a transformation rule based on three examples and apply it to a test input. The grids contain integer values representing colors.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Object Decomposition**:\n    *   **The Container**: In all examples and the test input, there is a distinct 3x3 structure composed of `3`s (Green) with a `2` (Red) in the center. In the Test Input, this is located at Rows 4-6, Columns 4-6.\n    *   **The Candidate Objects**: There are scattered `9`s (Maroon) throughout the grid.\n    *   **The Network**: There are `6`s (Magenta) forming walls, loops, or rail-like structures. These act as barriers.\n    *   **The Background**: The background is `7` (Orange).\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule**:\n    *   **Reachability**: The core logic is a flood-fill or pathfinding operation starting from the \"Container\" (the 3x3 box). The `6`s act as solid walls. The flood can pass through `7`s (background) and `9`s (candidates).\n    *   **Collection**: Any `9` (Maroon) that is *reachable* from the Container via a path of non-`6` cells is identified for movement.\n    *   **Transportation**: The reachable `9`s are \"moved\" into the Container.\n        *   The original location of the reachable `9` becomes `7` (background).\n        *   The Container fills up with `9`s starting from the top-left cell (0,0) of the 3x3 box, proceeding row by row (reading order).\n        *   The filling overwrites the existing `3`s and the central `2`.\n    *   **Capacity**: The Container has a capacity of 9 cells. In Example 2, the number of reachable `9`s exceeded the capacity (or filled it exactly), and the closest ones were prioritized. In the Test Input, the number of reachable `9`s is less than the capacity.\n    *   **Unreachable Objects**: `9`s that are completely walled off by `6`s (relative to the Container) remain in their original positions.\n\n3.  **Application to Test Input**:\n    *   **Container Location**: Rows 4-6, Columns 4-6. Center at (5,5).\n    *   **Walls (6s)**:\n        *   Column 1 is a solid wall of `6`s from Row 0 to Row 9. (Row 10 is `7`, creating an opening at the bottom left).\n        *   Column 9 is a solid wall of `6`s (or backed by `6`s) effectively blocking the right side.\n        *   Row 1 is a solid wall of `6`s.\n    *   **Openings**:\n        *   The Container is open to the \"Inside Arena\" (Rows 2-8, Cols 2-8) via gaps in the surrounding `6`s at (5,3) and (5,7).\n        *   The \"Inside Arena\" connects to the \"Outside\" bottom strip (Row 10) via a gap at (9,8).\n        *   The bottom strip (Row 10) connects to the left strip (Column 0) via the gap at (10,1).\n    *   **Reachable 9s**:\n        *   **Inside Arena**: (2,2), (2,8), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8). These are directly connected to the box. (5 total).\n        *   **Left Strip**: (2,0). This is reachable via the path: Box -> Inside -> Bottom Gap (9,8) -> Bottom Row (10) -> Bottom Left Gap (10,1) -> Up Column 0 -> (2,0). (1 total).\n        *   **Blocked 9s**:\n            *   (0,2), (0,8): Blocked by the solid wall at Row 1.\n            *   (3,10), (5,10), (7,10): Blocked by the solid wall at Column 9.\n    *   **Execution**:\n        *   Total reachable `9`s = 6.\n        *   Remove these 6 `9`s from the grid (change to `7`).\n        *   Fill the first 6 cells of the Container with `9`s.\n            *   Container Row 0 (Grid Row 4): All 3 cells become `9`.\n            *   Container Row 1 (Grid Row 5): All 3 cells become `9`.\n            *   Container Row 2 (Grid Row 6): Remains unchanged (original `3`s).\n\n**Test Input Grid Generation:**\n*   Input `9`s at (2,0), (2,2), (2,8), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8) become `7`.\n*   Box cells at (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6) become `9`.\n\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Alright, let's see. This ARC task seems to involve a collector, a kind of 3x3 block with a special center, that snatches up maroon (9) pixels from its surroundings and stuffs them into itself.  The background's usually orange (7) but it's not the crucial part. The 6's are clearly walls, and they define a space.\n\nAnalyzing the examples, it's pretty clear that if a 9 is blocked by a wall of 6's, it's safe.  The collector, a 3x3 block with a red dot (2) in the center and green (3) all around it, \"collects\" accessible 9s and replaces them with itself. Accessible means can be reached by a walk that follows 3 and 7 pixels. The center acts like a beacon for the collectable 9's, which are removed from the original place and transferred into the collector itself.\n\nSo, the game is to figure out if we can \"reach\" any maroon pixels from this 3x3 block, which is also called the \"basket\".  If they're trapped inside a 6 enclosure, they're not reachable. If not, they are added in the box itself. The number of accessible 9s determines how many cells in the basket are filled. The rule is that it starts filling the basket from the top left corner.\n\nNow, I'm given a new grid and I've to trace a path starting from the center of the 3x3 block (the 2) by following either 3s or 7s, avoiding 6s. If I find a 9 along the way, I add that 9 to the basket. If K is less than 9, that's easy! Put those k 9's into the basket. If it's more, fill it up completely. If, for instance, there's a 9 that's cut off from the collector by a wall of 6s, that's like a lost gem - it's left as it is. After determining how many 9s, the output grid is updated.\n\nSeems like a straightforward pathfinding and set-filling problem once the core mechanic is understood. Let's start with a test input. I can visualize the walls and the paths, trace it, and replace the reachable 9s, then update the basket accordingly. I need to make sure I don't get tricked by any hidden walls.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid based on logic inferred from three examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Objects:**\n    *   **Basket:** A 3x3 region defined by a border of green (3) pixels and a red (2) pixel in the center. In the examples, this basket serves as a collection point.\n    *   **Targets:** Maroon (9) pixels scattered throughout the grid.\n    *   **Walls:** Magenta (6) pixels act as barriers.\n    *   **Agent/Reachability:** The red pixel (2) inside the basket acts as the \"agent\". The transformation depends on which Target pixels (9s) are *reachable* from the agent using orthogonal movement (up, down, left, right) through empty space (color 7) or other traversable pixels (3s, 2s, 9s), but **not** through walls (6s).\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Pathfinding):** Perform a flood-fill or pathfinding operation starting from the center of the basket (the 2). Determine the connected component of traversable cells. Walls (6s) block movement.\n    *   **Step 2 (Collection):** Identify all Target pixels (9s) that fall within this connected component. These are the \"collected\" items.\n    *   **Step 3 (Removal):** In the output grid, replace the collected 9s with the background color (7). 9s that are *not* reachable (blocked by walls) remain in their original positions.\n    *   **Step 4 (Deposit):** Count the number of collected 9s ($K$). Fill the 3x3 basket with $K$ maroon (9) pixels. The filling order is reading order (row by row, from top-left to bottom-right):\n        *   $(r_{top}, c_{left})$\n        *   $(r_{top}, c_{mid})$\n        *   $(r_{top}, c_{right})$\n        *   $(r_{mid}, c_{left})$\n        *   ...and so on.\n    *   Any cells in the basket that are not filled with 9s retain their original color (3 or 2).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Basket:** The basket is the 3x3 block at Rows 4-6, Columns 4-6. The center is at `(5, 5)`.\n    *   Row 4: `...3,3,3...`\n    *   Row 5: `...3,2,3...`\n    *   Row 6: `...3,3,3...`\n\n2.  **Pathfinding & Reachability:**\n    *   We start at `(5, 5)`.\n    *   **Walls:** Row 1 is a solid line of 6s, making Row 0 completely unreachable. Columns 1 and 9 are largely walls, but there are critical openings.\n    *   **Openings:**\n        *   Row 9 has a gap at Column 8 (`(9, 8)` is 7). This allows passage from the central region to the bottom row (Row 10).\n        *   Row 9 also has a gap at Column 0 (`(9, 0)` is 7).\n        *   Row 10 (bottom row) is entirely clear (7s) from Column 0 to Column 8.\n    *   **Tracing Connectivity:**\n        *   The central area (containing the basket) connects to the right side of Row 8.\n        *   From Row 8, we can pass through the gap at `(9, 8)` to reach Row 10.\n        *   From Row 10, we can traverse left to Column 0.\n        *   From Column 0 (Row 10), we can move up the leftmost strip (Column 0).\n        *   The rightmost strip (Column 10) is blocked by a solid wall at Column 9 and the wall at `(10, 9)`.\n\n3.  **Identify Collected Targets:**\n    *   **Reachable 9s:**\n        *   `(2, 2)`: Inside the main central region.\n        *   `(2, 8)`: Inside the main central region.\n        *   `(8, 2)`: Inside the main central region.\n        *   `(8, 5)`: Inside the main central region.\n        *   `(8, 8)`: Inside the main central region.\n        *   `(2, 0)`: Reachable via the long path (Center -> R9 gap -> R10 -> Col 0 -> Up).\n    *   **Unreachable 9s (Not Collected):**\n        *   `(0, 2)` and `(0, 8)`: Blocked by solid wall at Row 1.\n        *   `(3, 10)`, `(5, 10)`, `(7, 10)`: Blocked by wall at Column 9.\n\n    *   **Total Count ($K$):** 6.\n\n4.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   **Remove:** Replace the 6 reachable 9s at `(2,0), (2,2), (2,8), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8)` with 7.\n    *   **Fill Basket:** We have 6 items. The basket cells are filled in order:\n        1.  `(4, 4)` -> 9\n        2.  `(4, 5)` -> 9\n        3.  `(4, 6)` -> 9\n        4.  `(5, 4)` -> 9\n        5.  `(5, 5)` -> 9\n        6.  `(5, 6)` -> 9\n        *   The remaining cells `(6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)` remain 3.\n\n**Final Grid Generation:**\n*   Row 2 becomes: `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7`.\n*   Row 8 becomes: `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7`.\n*   Basket (Rows 4, 5, 6 cols 4, 5, 6):\n    *   Row 4: `9, 9, 9`\n    *   Row 5: `9, 9, 9`\n    *   Row 6: `3, 3, 3`\n\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6",

For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation rule:\n\n1. Each grid has a 3x3 pattern marked with 3s and a 2 in the center\n2. There are scattered 9s throughout the grid\n3. The transformation \"collects\" certain 9s and fills them into the 3x3 pattern\n4. The key is determining which 9s get collected\n\n**Analysis of the rule:**\n- 9s that can reach the 3x3 pattern via a path of non-6 cells get \"absorbed\" (converted to 7)\n- The 6s act as barriers/walls\n- The number of absorbed 9s equals the number of positions filled with 9 in the 3x3\n- The 3x3 fills in row-major order (top-left first)\n\n**Applying to test input:**\n\nThe 3x3 is at rows 4-6, cols 4-6. The entry points to reach it are through (5,3) and (5,7), then via (7,5) or (8,5).\n\n**9s that CAN reach the 3x3 (will be absorbed):**\n- (2,0), (2,2), (2,8) - can path down through col 2-8 to row 8, then to 3x3\n- (8,2), (8,5), (8,8) - can reach through row 8 to (7,5) entry point\n- **Total: 6 9s absorbed**\n\n**9s that CANNOT reach (remain as 9):**\n- (0,2), (0,8) - trapped above row 1 (which is all 6s)\n- (3,10), (5,10), (7,10) - trapped in column 10 by 6s at column 9\n\n**Result:**\n- 6 positions filled in 3x3 (row-major): positions (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6) become 9\n- Row 6 of 3x3 remains as 3s\n- Absorbed 9s become 7s; isolated 9s remain\n\n```\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n```",

Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

Each grid contains a 3\u00d73 block of 3s with a center 2\n2. There are scattered 9s throughout the grid\n3. The 6s form boundaries/walls that divide the grid into regions\n\n**Key Rule Discovered:**\n- 9s that can \"reach\" the 3\u00d73 block (without crossing 6 barriers) get absorbed into the 3\u00d73 block\n- 9s that are blocked by 6 walls stay in place\n- The 3\u00d73 block fills with 9s from top-left, row by row, preserving the center 2 (unless overwhelmed)\n- Absorbed 9s become 7s at their original positions\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\nThe test has:\n- A 3\u00d73 block at rows 4-6, cols 4-6\n- Row 1 is entirely 6s (horizontal wall)\n- Col 1 and Col 9 have 6s (vertical walls)\n- Internal frame of 6s around the 3\u00d73 (with gaps at row/col 5)\n\n**9s that can reach the 3\u00d73:** (2,2), (2,8), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8) - 5 total\nThese can navigate through the gaps in the internal frame to reach the 3\u00d73.\n\n**9s blocked by walls (stay in place):**\n- (0,2), (0,8) - blocked by row 1 wall\n- (2,0) - blocked by col 1 wall  \n- (3,10), (5,10), (7,10) - blocked by col 9 wall\n\n**Result:**\n- 5 cells in the 3\u00d73 become 9 (filling top-left to bottom-right, skipping center 2)\n- Row 4: all three 3s become 9s\n- Row 5: left and right 3s become 9s, center 2 preserved\n- Row 6: remains 3,3,3\n\n```\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,2,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n```",

That 3\u00d73 block is the target cluster.\n2. Treat every cell with a 6 as an impassable wall. All other colours (7, 3, 2, 9) are traversable.\n3. From the position of the 2, flood\u2011fill through non\u20116 cells to find which 9s are reachable. If a column of 6s or a full wall row blocks the path, 9s beyond it are not reachable.\n4. Let \\(k\\) be the number of reachable 9s (capped at 9, the size of the cluster). Remove those k 9s from their original positions by turning them into 7s.\n5. In the 3\u00d73 cluster, fill the first k cells in row\u2011major order (top\u2011left to bottom\u2011right) with 9s, overwriting the existing values (3 or 2). Leave the remaining cluster cells unchanged.\n\nApplying this to the test grid, only six 9s lie in the same component as the 2; the 9s in the isolated column 11 and above the solid wall at row\u00a02 are unreachable. Those six are removed and placed into the cluster\u2019s first six positions.\n\n**Output grid**\n\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7  \n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9  \n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7  \n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9  \n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7  \n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9  \n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7  \n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reflections on Solving the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got. The task seems to involve transforming grids of colored integers, focusing on a central 3x3 \"green square\" (3).  The key seems to be the color maroon (9) and some magenta (6) structures acting as boundaries or guidelines.\n\nInitially, I looked for a direct relationship:  Does a maroon pixel in the input directly map to a specific spot in the output green square?  I tried modulo arithmetic, trying to fold the grid, shift pixels, but none of these consistently worked.\n\nThen I noticed that in all examples the green square got transformed to some extent. There are some \"rooms\" defined in the examples. In example 1 there is a magenta loop or path around the green square. The green square in the examples acts like a central processing zone.\n\nI explored the magenta structures, thinking they might define \"source regions\" for the maroon pixels.  The green square seems to have \"walls.\"  I considered how the walls influence which maroons end up inside.\n\nThe key observation became that the maroon pixels that end up inside the green square seem to be *influenced* by their *relative position* to it, but also something more global. There is a sense of \"gravity\" or \"projection\" onto the green square.\n\nThe examples showed:\n*   In one case, a specific pattern \"9 9 . \" gets copied into the green square.\n*   The second example had a fill pattern with a 9 in the center.\n\nI tested the idea that 9s \"flow\" and maybe the structure in the examples influences the flow: A 9 above a green square would flow down, but a 9 beside it did not.\n\nNext I defined a method: The solution is a Centripetal Projection. The 9's will project to a specific area in the green square.\n\nThe key insight was to divide the grid into a smaller region 7x7 around the 3x3 green square. And the 9's outside the perimeter are pushed toward the inside. Top-Left quadrant, shift (+2, +2) relative to the center. So shift the 9s towards the center of the grid. It worked!\n\nThe Test Input has a 6-constructed frame like Example 1, but this frame has holes in the 6-wall. So, a Centripetal Projection from the Frame Boundary around the 3x3 square should resolve this test case!\n\n\nThe goal of this task is to determine how the \"Green Square\" (the 3x3 area of green (3) pixels with a red (2) center) is modified based on the surrounding maroon (9) pixels in the grid.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Fixed Structure:** In all examples, the Green Square is located at the center of the grid, specifically covering rows 4-6 and columns 4-6 (0-indexed). The center pixel at (5,5) is Red (2).\n2.  **Transformation Logic:** The maroon (9) pixels from the surrounding \"halls\" or \"frame\" are projected onto the Green Square.\n    *   The grid can be viewed as having a 7x7 perimeter centered at (5,5), which corresponds to rows/cols 2 to 8.\n    *   Maroon pixels on this perimeter map to the corresponding positions on the 3x3 Green Square perimeter.\n    *   The mapping is \"centripetal\" (moving towards the center):\n        *   **Top-Left** source area (around 2,2) shifts **(+2, +2)** to the Top-Left of the square (4,4).\n        *   **Top-Right** source area (around 2,8) shifts **(+2, -2)** to the Top-Right of the square (4,6).\n        *   **Bottom-Left** source area (around 8,2) shifts **(-2, +2)** to the Bottom-Left of the square (6,4).\n        *   **Bottom-Right** source area (around 8,8) shifts **(-2, -2)** to the Bottom-Right of the square (6,6).\n        *   Middle edge pixels (like 8,5) shift purely vertically or horizontally (e.g., (8,5) shifts (-2, 0) to (6,5)).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Locate Source 9s:** We examine the 7x7 frame (rows 2 and 8, cols 2 and 8) in the Test Input.\n    *   **Row 2 (Top):** Contains 9s at **(2,2)** and **(2,8)**.\n    *   **Row 8 (Bottom):** Contains 9s at **(8,2)**, **(8,5)**, and **(8,8)**.\n    *   **Col 2 (Left):** Contains 9s at (2,2) and (8,2).\n    *   **Col 8 (Right):** Contains 9s at (2,8) and (8,8).\n    *   There are no 9s at (2,5), (5,2), or (5,8).\n*   **Map to Green Square:**\n    *   (2,2) [Top-Left] maps to **(4,4)**.\n    *   (2,8) [Top-Right] maps to **(4,6)**.\n    *   (8,2) [Bottom-Left] maps to **(6,4)**.\n    *   (8,5) [Bottom-Middle] maps to **(6,5)**.\n    *   (8,8) [Bottom-Right] maps to **(6,6)**.\n*   **Construct Output:**\n    *   The Green Square pixels at the mapped coordinates turn into Maroon (9).\n    *   (4,4), (4,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) become 9.\n    *   The other Green Square pixels ((4,5), (5,4), (5,6)) remain Green (3).\n    *   The center pixel (5,5) remains Red (2).\n    *   All other pixels in the grid remain unchanged.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n*   Row 4 (was `...3,3,3...`) becomes `...9,3,9...`.\n*   Row 5 (was `...3,2,3...`) stays `...3,2,3...`.\n*   Row 6 (was `...3,3,3...`) becomes `...9,9,9...`.\n\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n9,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,3,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,3,2,3,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,9,7,7,9,7,7,9,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning / reconstruction**\n\n1. **Colours and key pattern**\n\n   All four grids are \\(11\\times 11\\).  \n   Colours:\n   - `7` is the background.\n   - `6` forms \u201cwalls\u201d.\n   - The special central object is always a \\(3 \\times 3\\) block\n\n     \\[\n     \\begin{matrix}\n     3 & 3 & 3\\\\\n     3 & 2 & 3\\\\\n     3 & 3 & 3\n     \\end{matrix}\n     \\]\n\n     surrounded by `6`-walls.\n   - Colour `9` appears as scattered \u201ctokens\u201d that may move.\n\n2. **What changes from input to output**\n\n   Comparing the three examples:\n\n   - The pattern of `6` never changes.\n   - Only two kinds of changes occur:\n     1. Some `9`\u2011cells elsewhere in the grid are turned into `7` (erased).\n     2. Some of the `3` (and sometimes the `2`) inside the central \\(3 \\times 3\\) are turned into `9`.\n\n   So the transformation is: **take some of the external 9\u2019s and move them into the central \\(3 \\times 3\\)**, in a fixed order, conserving the total number of `9` cells.\n\n3. **Which 9\u2019s are donors?**\n\n   A simple way to describe the donor set that fits Example 1 and Example 3 and is plausible for the test:\n\n   - Treat colour `6` as walls.\n   - All other colours (`0\u20135,7\u20139` here: `7,3,2,9`) are traversable.\n   - Starting from the central `2`, perform a flood\u2011fill over non\u2011`6` cells and obtain its connected region \\(R\\).\n   - **Donor 9\u2019s are the `9` cells that lie inside \\(R\\)** (i.e. in the same open region as the `2`, not separated by `6` walls).\n   - Remove each donor by painting it `7`.\n   - Let \\(K\\) be the number of donor 9\u2019s.\n\n4. **Where are the new 9\u2019s placed?**\n\n   Inside the fixed central \\(3\\times 3\\) pattern, we use a deterministic order:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{(row 5, col 5)},\\ \n   (5,6),\\ \n   (5,7),\\ \n   (6,5),\\ \n   (6,6),\\ \n   (6,7),\\ \n   (7,5),\\ \n   (7,6),\\ \n   (7,7)\n   \\]\n\n   i.e. **row\u2011major from the top\u2011left of the \\(3\\times 3\\)**.\n\n   For the first \\(K\\) positions in that sequence we paint them `9`. If \\(K<9\\), the remaining central cells keep their original `3` or `2`. If \\(K\\ge 9\\), the whole \\(3\\times 3\\) becomes `9`.\n\n   In each example the number of new `9` cells in the center equals the number of erased external `9` cells, so the total number of `9`s is conserved.\n\n5. **Apply to the test input**\n\n   Test grid (with coordinates; rows and columns are 1\u2011based):\n\n   ```\n   r1: 6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n   r2: 6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n   r3: 9,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,7\n   r4: 7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n   r5: 7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n   r6: 7,6,7,7,3,2,3,7,7,6,9\n   r7: 7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n   r8: 7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n   r9: 7,6,9,7,7,9,7,7,9,6,7\n   r10:7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n   r11:7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n   ```\n\n   - The central \\(3\\times 3\\) is rows 5\u20137, cols 5\u20137, containing the usual ring of `3`s with center `2` at (6,6).\n\n   **5.1. Flood\u2011fill region \\(R\\) (non\u20116) from the `2`**\n\n   Treat `6` as walls, all others (7,3,2,9) as open.\n\n   From (6,6) we flood over the grid; because row 2 is entirely `6`, the component cannot pass to row 1. The reachable non\u2011`6` cells with colour `9` are:\n\n   - (3,1), (3,3), (3,9)\n   - (4,11)\n   - (6,11)\n   - (8,11)\n   - (9,3), (9,6), (9,9)\n\n   That is \\(K = 9\\) donor `9` cells.\n\n   The two 9\u2019s on row 1, at (1,3) and (1,9), are separated from the central region by the full wall row of `6` in row 2, so they are *not* donors and remain where they are.\n\n   **5.2. Erase donors**\n\n   Turn each donor to `7`:\n\n   - Row 3: 9\u21927 at cols 1,3,9 \u2192 row3 becomes `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7`\n   - Row 4: col11 9\u21927 \u2192 row4 becomes `7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,7`\n   - Row 6: col11 9\u21927 \u2192 row6 becomes `7,6,7,7,3,2,3,7,7,6,7`\n   - Row 8: col11 9\u21927 \u2192 row8 becomes `7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,7`\n   - Row 9: cols 3,6,9 9\u21927 \u2192 row9 becomes `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7`\n\n   All other rows unchanged so far.\n\n   **5.3. Place 9\u2019s in the center**\n\n   We have \\(K=9\\) donors, and there are 9 cells in the central \\(3\\times 3\\), so we fill all of them:\n\n   - (5,5),(5,6),(5,7) \u2192 9,9,9\n   - (6,5),(6,6),(6,7) \u2192 9,9,9\n   - (7,5),(7,6),(7,7) \u2192 9,9,9\n\n   Rows 5\u20137 after this step:\n\n   - Row5: `7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7`\n   - Row6: `7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,7`\n   - Row7: `7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7`\n\n6. **Final output grid**\n\nPutting all rows together:\n\n```\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Central Structure**: Each grid has a 3x3 block with value 3 (green) and a center value of 2 (red)\n\n2. **Frame Structure**: There are frames made of 6s (pink) that create bounded regions\n\n3. **Scattered 9s**: Value 9 (maroon) appears scattered throughout the grid\n\n**The Transformation Rule:**\n- Count the 9s that are \"enclosed\" within the frame boundaries (not outside the frame edges defined by 6s)\n- Move these enclosed 9s to fill the 3x3 block, replacing 3s from top-left, row by row\n- The center 2 is skipped during filling\n- Remove the original enclosed 9s (replace with 7)\n- 9s outside the frame stay in place\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\nThe outer frame is bounded by column 1 (left) and column 9 (right), with row 1 as the top edge. The enclosed region is roughly rows 2-8, cols 2-8.\n\nEnclosed 9s (inside frame): \n- (2,2), (2,8), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8) = **5 total**\n\n9s outside frame (stay put):\n- (0,2), (0,8), (2,0), (3,10), (5,10), (7,10)\n\nWith 5 enclosed 9s, filling the 3x3 block from top-left:\n- Row 4: all three 3s \u2192 9,9,9\n- Row 5: first 3 \u2192 9, center 2 stays, last 3 \u2192 9 (that's positions 4,5,6 \u2192 9,2,9)\n- Row 6: no more fills needed (remains 3,3,3)\n\n**Output:**\n```\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,2,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**My Thought Process: Unraveling the ARC Pattern**\n\nI've been tasked with cracking an ARC puzzle based on a few examples, and I've got to say, this one's got me thinking. It's a grid-based puzzle with integers representing colors, but the real challenge is figuring out how the input transforms into the output.\n\n**Initial Observations:**\n\nThe grids are filled with numbers. The \"action\" seems to center around a distinct Green (3) square with a Red (2) center, often surrounded by Magenta (6) \"paths\" and scattered Maroon (9) dots. My initial thought is that the Orange (7) background stays unchanged. I see that the maroon dots aren\u2019t completely static; their positions change across the examples.\n\n**Deep Dive into the Examples:**\n\nExample 1 made the pattern clearer. I focused on what happened to those maroon dots. Sometimes, they seem to vanish, and other times, they move into the Green square. I observed that the central green square undergoes a transformation \u2013 specifically, some of its cells turn Maroon (9). Analyzing the text grid, I noticed that the maroon spots outside the center \"disappeared\" into the Green square, but a few stayed put. This led me to my first major hypothesis: **the maroon dots are somehow \"attracted\" to or \"connected\" to the Green square**.\n\nI then went through Example 2. It further confirmed my suspicion. It was a more extreme version of the same phenomenon: the central Green square was completely taken over by maroon colors, and the exterior maroon dots vanished. Then I looked at the way these dots are placed - are they in rows, columns, or by some specific position relative to others?\n\nExample 3, with its lack of walls, helped to test the ideas. In this instance, some exterior dots, once again, \"moved\" to the Green square, leaving an empty orange field. It's becoming clearer that the relationship between the external 9s, the Magenta walls, and the Green box is key.\n\n**Developing the \"Connectedness\" Hypothesis:**\n\nI started to think about connectivity and obstacles: Are there paths between these dots and the Green square, or are they blocked by Magenta \"walls\"? It became apparent that ONLY maroon dots that are \"connected\" to the Green square (via shared 7 cells) are involved in this transformation. Magenta walls block these \"connections\".\n\n**The \"Move and Stack\" Logic:**\n\nThen came the really tricky part: how do these connected maroon dots end up *inside* the Green square, and where exactly do they go? I thought that the 9s somehow get pushed up and to the side, but that didn't quite work. I had to look at it differently. I hypothesized that there is a **global \"float up\" that pushes everything up, and a spill to the side**.\n\nThe Algorithm:\n\n1.  **Find Connected 9s**: The first step involves identifying the 9s linked to the green box through 7s.\n2.  **Determine Entry Column**: Each 9, moves horizontally to the center (if no magenta walls) and the entry column for the green box is determined.\n3.  **Float Up**: These agents all go to row 4.\n4.  **Stack and Spill**: I found this to be the key step.\n\nLet's test this in Ex 3 again:\nI had 3 agents at C6.\nI had 1 agent at C4.\nSpill direction: Left, with wrap to the Next Row.\n\nSo (4,6) fills and 2 more spill Left: (4,5) and (4,4).\n\nAfter (4,4), the next spill is not to (5,6) but instead, to the next cell to the left, which fills the 5th spot, or (5,4).\nNo cells past the border of the main green structure are filled.\n\n**Application to the Test Input:**\n\nThe test input showed there were a few more rules and twists. I began by scanning for the walls (Magenta) and other obstructions, and connected dots. It seems that there are 6 distinct source dots that need to be processed according to the rules of movement and spill. 5 will move down, with the first 4 getting stacked (and possibly spill to the bottom row), and the remaining one lost to the left (by walls or by a spill pattern that prevents them from filling the space).\nThe output, then, should be:\nThe output is:\n9, 9, 9\n9, 2, 3\n9, 3, 3\n\nI'm confident this logic captures the essence of this ARC pattern. It boils down to movement into a stack and spill, and everything else is just details.\n\n\nThe transformation involves moving \"Maroon (9)\" pixels from the surrounding grid into the central \"Green (3) Box\". The rules derived from the examples are:\n\n1.  **Connectivity**: Only Maroon (9) pixels that are connected to the central Green Box via a path of \"Orange (7)\" (background) or other 9s can move. Walls made of \"Magenta (6)\" or unconnected regions block the movement.\n    *   In Example 1, 9s in the top-right were blocked by walls, while bottom-right 9s were connected via a hole.\n    *   In Example 3, there were no walls, so all 9s moved.\n    *   In the Test Input, we identify connected 9s by checking paths to the central room. The 9s at `(2,0)`, `(2,2)`, `(8,2)` (Left agents) connect via the bottom corridor (Row 10) and the gap at `(9,8)` to enter the room. The 9s at `(2,8)`, `(8,8)`, `(8,5)` are already inside or directly connected. The 9s at `(0,2)`, `(0,8)` (above top wall), and `(3,10), (5,10), (7,10)` (right isolated corridor) are not connected.\n\n2.  **Movement & Entry**: The connected 9s travel to the central box. They effectively \"enter\" the box at the column corresponding to their path.\n    *   In the Test Input, the 5 agents from the Left and Right sides (`(2,0), (2,2), (8,2), (2,8), (8,8)`) are routed through the gap at Column 8/7 or Column 0/1/2->10->8->7? No, the routing analysis showed they eventually enter the room and align to **Column 6** (Right side of box) or **Column 5**.\n    *   Specifically, the Left agents come through the bottom-right gap (`R9 C8`), moving to `C7` then `C6`. The Right agents are at `C8` moving to `C7` then `C6`.\n    *   The agent at `(8,5)` is already at `C5`.\n    *   So we have **5 agents entering at Column 6** and **1 agent entering at Column 5**. Total 6 connected agents.\n\n3.  **Filling Logic (Stack & Spill)**: The agents float to the top of the box (Row 4) and fill cells. The logic follows a \"Spill Left\" priority:\n    *   Agents accumulate at their entry column in Row 4.\n    *   If a cell is filled, excess agents spill to the **Left**.\n    *   If the leftmost column (Column 4) overflows, it spills **Down** to the next row in Column 4.\n    *   **Simulation for Test Input**:\n        *   **Column 6**: Starts with 5 agents. Fills `(4,6)`. Spills 4 to Col 5.\n        *   **Column 5**: Starts with 1 agent + 4 spilled = 5 agents. Fills `(4,5)`. Spills 4 to Col 4.\n        *   **Column 4**: Starts with 0 agents + 4 spilled = 4 agents.\n            *   1 fills `(4,4)`. 3 remain.\n            *   Spill Down -> Fills `(5,4)`. 2 remain.\n            *   Spill Down -> Fills `(6,4)`. 1 remains.\n            *   Spill Down -> Outside box / Blocked. The last agent is lost.\n    *   **Resulting Pattern**:\n        *   Row 4: `9, 9, 9` (Cells 4,4; 4,5; 4,6)\n        *   Row 5: `9, 2, 3` (Cell 5,4 becomes 9; Center 5,5 stays 2; 5,6 stays 3)\n        *   Row 6: `9, 3, 3` (Cell 6,4 becomes 9; 6,5 and 6,6 stay 3)\n\n4.  **Cleanup**: The source pixels for the connected 9s are cleared (turned to background 7). The unconnected 9s remain.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n-   **Background/Walls**: Copy test input.\n-   **Unconnected 9s (Stay)**: `(0,2)`, `(0,8)`, `(3,10)`, `(5,10)`, `(7,10)`.\n-   **Connected 9s (Cleared)**: `(2,0)`, `(2,2)`, `(2,8)`, `(8,2)`, `(8,5)`, `(8,8)` become `7`.\n-   **Central Box (Rows 4-6, Cols 4-6)**:\n    -   `(4,4), (4,5), (4,6)` -> `9`\n    -   `(5,4)` -> `9`, `(5,5)` -> `2`, `(5,6)` -> `3`\n    -   `(6,4)` -> `9`, `(6,5)` -> `3`, `(6,6)` -> `3`\n\noutput:\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,2,3,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6",

The task is to take maroon pixels (9) that lie in the same open region as the green patch, where open cells are anything but 6, and move as many of them as possible into the green patch. You compute the size of the green patch (9 cells) and the set of 9s connected to it through non\u20116 cells. Let k be the minimum of these two counts. Remove those k maroons closest to the green region (in the examples this simply meant all connected maroons when there were fewer than nine, or the nine shortest\u2011path maroons when there were more), setting their old positions to background 7. Then overwrite the first k cells of the green 3\u00d73 block in row\u2011major order with 9, leaving the remainder of the block unchanged.\n\nIn the test grid, the green block is at rows\u202f4\u20136, cols\u202f4\u20136.

            "Full raw LLM response": "The four colours play the same roles as in the examples: 6\u2011cells are impassable walls, 7\u2011cells are free space, 9\u2011cells are movable tokens, and the 3\u00d73 block of 3\u2019s/2 is the target to be filled.\n\nStart a flood fill from the green block through free space (cells with values 7,3,2), treating 6 and uncollected 9 as obstacles. Whenever a 9 lies orthogonally adjacent to the filled region, collect it: remove it from its original place and add that cell to the region so the search can pass through. Continue until no more 9s are reachable; if there were more tokens than the 3\u00d73 block can hold, you would stop after nine collections.\n\nPlace the collected tokens into the 3\u00d73 green block in row\u2011major order (top\u2011left to bottom\u2011right), overwriting the centre 2 if reached; leave any remaining target cells unchanged. Collected 9s elsewhere become 7. Unreached 9s remain.\n\nIn the test grid, the row\u20112 wall and the solid wall in column 10 isolate five of the 9s, so only six tokens are reachable and collected. These fill the first six positions of the green block; the last row of the block stays green. The collected positions at (3,1),(3,3),(3,9),(9,3),(9,6),(9,9) are cleared to 7.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**The Pathfinding Puzzle: A Deep Dive**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I need to transform a grid based on some examples. My gut feeling tells me this involves understanding a rule and applying it. Here's what I'm thinking:\n\n*   **Initial Goal:** Decode the rule from the examples. I need to figure out what's happening to pixels and how to apply it to a new grid.\n*   **Observations:** The examples show a \"core\" object (a green square with a red center). Maroon pixels seem to gravitate toward this core, but magenta pixels (walls) act as barriers.\n*   **The \"Magnet\" Hint:** The core seems to exert a \"pull\" on the maroons. This \"gravity\" metaphor feels crucial.\n*   **Refining the Concept:** Maroons *slide* towards the core center, but walls stop them. So, is it shortest path or sliding? In a real gravity simulation, what does \"move towards\" look like?\n*   **A-ha! The Key:** The examples reveal a pathfinding problem. Maroons move to the closest empty spot to the core. This is where I started thinking that this is related to Manhattan distance from the core.\n*   **The Overwrite Dilemma:** The most confusing part is that the maroons overwrite the core, especially the red pixel (center). Sometimes the red pixel gets overwritten, sometimes it doesn't. Why?\n*   **The Key: Raster Order** This leads to the crucial detail: The core is actually an area (3x3), and the maroons fill it from top-left. And the red pixel is just the last in line to be overwritten.\n*   **The Logic:** I can model this as a Breadth-First Search (BFS). I need to calculate a distance field from the core's center, respecting walls and then simulate a teleport to a raster order priority fill of the core.\n    -   Identify the Core (Red 2 pixel and neighbors).\n    -   Find the Maroons, which are the movers\n    -   Run a path search (BFS) on each maroon, and check the path towards any of the pixels of the core\n    -   For all those maroons, clear them from their starting location\n    -   The core cells can then be filled based on raster scan priority\n*   **The Implementation:**\n    1.  Parse the grid: Identify the core, walls, and maroons.\n    2.  Distance Field: BFS from each core cell to every point, considering walls as obstacles.\n    3.  Reachability: Maroons \"in\" means there's a valid path to the core (inside the 'room').\n    4.  Fill Priority: Sort slots within the core using raster scan (top-left to bottom-right).\n    5.  Move and Overwrite: Remove all maroons that are able to reach the Core, and teleport these maroons in. The count from Input will determine how many slots.\n*   **Tests and Validation:** I walked through all examples to confirm: the core has 3x3 slots, but also the Red cell can be overwritten. Those maroons that can get to the core, move to the core. Those that can't, stay.\n*   **The Test Run:** I'll apply the logic to the test case, check the Maroons are counted, and run through my steps to generate the output, one cell at a time. The result will confirm my understanding and provide the answer.\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the final state of a grid where specific \"mobile\" pixels (Maroon, 9) are attracted to a \"magnet\" or target object (Green/Red 3x3 block), subject to barriers (Magenta, 6).\n\n### Analysis of Examples\n\n1.  **Target Object (Core):** In all examples, there is a central 3x3 structure composed of Green (3) pixels with a Red (2) pixel in the center. This acts as the \"gravity well.\"\n2.  **Mobile Pixels:** Maroon (9) pixels are the ones that move.\n3.  **Barriers:** Magenta (6) pixels are walls that block movement.\n4.  **Movement Rule:**\n    *   Maroon pixels move towards the Core.\n    *   Only Maroon pixels that have a valid path to the Core (not blocked by walls) are moved. Pixels that are completely walled off remain in their original positions (as seen in Example 1 and Example 2).\n    *   The \"gravity\" effect pulls the mobile pixels into the Core itself.\n5.  **Filling Logic:**\n    *   The Maroon pixels that successfully reach the Core occupy the cells of the Core.\n    *   The available \"slots\" in the Core are filled in a specific order: **Top-Left to Bottom-Right** (Raster Scan order).\n        *   Example 3 shows 4 pixels filling the top row (indices 4,4; 4,5; 4,6) and the left-middle pixel (5,4).\n    *   The mobile pixels can overwrite the Green (3) and even the central Red (2) pixels if enough Maroon pixels arrive (as seen in Example 2).\n    *   The number of slots filled equals the number of Maroon pixels that had a valid path to the Core.\n    *   The original positions of the moved Maroon pixels become empty background (Orange, 7).\n\n### Application to Test Input\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Core**\nThe 3x3 Core is located at row indices 4, 5, and 6, and column indices 4, 5, and 6.\n*   Row 4: `...6,3,3,3,6...`\n*   Row 5: `...7,3,2,3,7...`\n*   Row 6: `...6,3,3,3,6...`\n\n**Step 2: Identify Reachable Maroon Pixels**\nWe analyze the grid to find Maroon (9) pixels and check if they can reach the Core via open space (7). The grid has walls (6) isolating certain sections.\n\n*   **Top Area (Rows 0-1):** Blocked by a full wall at Row 1 (Index 1). Maroons at `(0,2)` and `(0,8)` are trapped and **stay**.\n*   **Outer Sides:** There are vertical walls at Column 1 and Column 9 in the middle section.\n    *   Left side: Maroon at `(2,0)` is outside the wall. **Stays**.\n    *   Right side: Maroons at `(3,10)`, `(5,10)`, `(7,10)` are outside the wall. **Stay**.\n*   **Middle/Inner Area:** This area is connected to the Core. We check the Maroons here:\n    *   `(2,2)`: Connected. Path exists downwards through holes in walls at Rows 4, 5, 6. **Moves**.\n    *   `(2,8)`: Connected. Path exists downwards. **Moves**.\n    *   `(8,2)`: Connected. Path exists upwards. **Moves**.\n    *   `(8,5)`: Connected. Directly below the Core. **Moves**.\n    *   `(8,8)`: Connected. Path exists upwards. **Moves**.\n\n**Total Reachable Movers:** 5 pixels.\n\n**Step 3: Update the Grid**\n1.  **Remove Movers:** Change the 5 identified mobile pixels at `(2,2)`, `(2,8)`, `(8,2)`, `(8,5)`, and `(8,8)` to background color (7).\n2.  **Fill Core:** Fill the first 5 slots of the 3x3 Core with Maroon (9).\n    *   The Core coordinates are (Row, Col): `(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)`.\n    *   Fill `(4,4)` -> 9\n    *   Fill `(4,5)` -> 9\n    *   Fill `(4,6)` -> 9\n    *   Fill `(5,4)` -> 9\n    *   Fill `(5,5)` -> 9 (Overwrites the Red center)\n    *   The remaining slots `(5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)` retain their original Green (3) color.\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\n*   **Row 0:** Unchanged.\n*   **Row 1:** Unchanged.\n*   **Row 2:** `9,6,9...` becomes `9,6,7...` (indices 2 and 8 become 7).\n*   **Row 3:** Unchanged.\n*   **Row 4:** Core top row `...3,3,3...` becomes `...9,9,9...`.\n*   **Row 5:** Core mid row `...3,2,3...` becomes `...9,9,3...`.\n*   **Row 6:** Core bot row `...3,3,3...` remains `...3,3,3...`.\n*   **Row 7:** Unchanged.\n*   **Row 8:** `7,6,9,7,7,9,7,7,9,6,7` becomes `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7` (indices 2, 5, 8 become 7).\n*   **Row 9:** Unchanged.\n*   **Row 10:** Unchanged.\n\n### Completed Output Grid\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,3,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Okay, let's break down this ARC problem. The user wants me to write a program that takes three examples and one test case to generate a correct output grid.**\n\nI start by looking at what makes the grids tick. It's an 11x11 grid with numbers 0-9.  I notice that 7 is the background, 9 is a scattershot color I'll call maroon, 3 is green, 2 is red, and 6 is magenta, which seems to form lines or enclosures.\n\nNow, Example 1. There is a 3x3 green square in the center with a red dot. Surrounding this are magenta lines. I also see maroon pixels that are scattered around. The trick appears to be how the maroon pixels end up in the center. I trace some of the scattered pixels and see a pattern. It looks like the maroon pixels above the green square end up *inside* it in the output. There are magenta lines that may act as walls or constraints. I suspect they 'fall' or move towards the center. There is a \"magnet\" property in play. The 6s are barriers. So, I realize the maroon pixels *slide* toward the green square. The Magenta are rigid, but *do* contain the maroon pixels.\n\nMoving to Example 2. I note the maroon pixels are in different positions, and the green/red center is *completely* filled with them in the output. It is more than three pixels wide. And, the original locations are empty.  I make the crucial observation that the walls of magenta may not be walls *for all* maroon pixels.  The pixels seem to move to a center, even if blocked. I start thinking about the box-like walls. But the maroon pixels seem to tunnel through the wall.\n\nI refine my hypothesis: Maroon pixels (9s) move toward the center (3x3 with red 2 in the middle). The Magenta lines (6s) are rigid, and I need to look at if pixels can *get past them*. I am thinking there may be multiple paths to the center. So, if a maroon pixel reaches the zone, it 'fills' it.  I must count the moving pixels to know how many to move.\n\nI look at Example 1 and trace it again. I see that pixels blocked by walls still *influence* the output somehow.  I start noticing there are different types of walls and holes in some.\n\nExample 3 is crucial - there are *no* 6s, and the pixels just seem to \"fall\" down to the green center. So gravity is the main thing now. This leads to the idea that there is a pull from the center to them. With all those pixels, the green box is now filled. This points me to the *filling order* being row-by-row, from left to right. Also I see that if there are too many, the red is overwritten.\n\nI go back to Example 2 and see it completely fills the box, even overwriting the red. So if the number of maroon pixels is greater than the total pixel count of the target area, the target is fully filled. So, with enough, the red (2) is *always* overwritten, no matter what. There is also a rule: The red pixel might not be overwritten.  This must mean there is a priority to the target zone.\n\nI formalize the hypothesis:\n1.  All maroon pixels can move\n2.  Magenta are walls, the number of target pixels matters to the overwrite. If too many maroon pixels are accessible to the target zone, the red will disappear.\n3.  Each maroon pixel is evaluated to see if it can reach the center box\n4.  If not, it will remain\n5.  If it can, I count it\n6.  The green box is then filled using the count. I keep the pixels, unless I run out.\n\nNow, for the test input.\n\nFirst, I identify all maroon pixels. There is a specific shape to the center - it's a 3x3 square with a red 2 in the middle, surrounded by Magenta and some other pixels. There are magenta (6) walls at the sides and top, but there is also a gap. There is also a 6 wall at the top and bottom. There are gaps on the left and right, and access to the center on top and bottom.  I count the \"reachable\" maroon pixels (those that have a clear path to the center) and find five. This can be done by a pathfinding exercise.\n\nI start building the output. The pixels go in, and now I fill the center, then I make the output grid, one row at a time. The final result is made.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to simulate the movement of \"mobile\" Maroon (9) pixels towards a \"magnet\" or \"gravity well\" in the center, which is a 3x3 square initially composed of Green (3) pixels with a Red (2) pixel in the middle. Magenta (6) pixels act as rigid walls.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Target:** The target is the 3x3 central square (Rows 4-6, Cols 4-6).\n2.  **Identify Mobile Units:** The Maroon (9) pixels are the mobile units.\n3.  **Identify Barriers:** The Magenta (6) pixels are walls.\n4.  **Determine Reachability:** For each Maroon (9) pixel in the input grid, we determine if there is a valid path to the central 3x3 square. A valid path consists of moving horizontally or vertically through empty space (Orange/7) or other traversable cells (like the target itself). Paths cannot pass through walls (6).\n    *   **Top 9s:**\n        *   (0,2) and (0,8) are blocked by the solid wall of 6s on Row 1. They are unreachable.\n        *   (2,2) and (2,8) are inside the main enclosure. Row 3 has a gap at column 5 (index 5). These pixels can move to column 5 and proceed down into the center. They are **reachable**.\n        *   (2,0) is blocked by the solid wall on Column 1. Unreachable.\n    *   **Side 9s:**\n        *   (3,10), (5,10), (7,10) are to the right of the solid wall on Column 9. They are unreachable.\n    *   **Bottom 9s:**\n        *   Row 8 contains 9s at (8,2), (8,5), and (8,8).\n        *   (8,5) is directly below the center. Row 7 has a gap at column 5. It can move straight up. **Reachable**.\n        *   (8,2) is to the left. Row 8 is open between columns 1 and 9. It can move right to column 5 and then up. **Reachable**.\n        *   (8,8) is to the right. It can move left to column 5 and then up. **Reachable**.\n5.  **Count Reachable Units:** There are 2 reachable pixels from Row 2 and 3 reachable pixels from Row 8. Total = 5.\n6.  **Fill the Target:** We fill the 3x3 target square with 9s, starting from the top-left (4,4) and proceeding row by row.\n    *   We have 5 pixels to place.\n    *   Row 4: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) become 9.\n    *   Row 5: (5,4), (5,5) become 9. ((5,5) was Red/2, now overwritten).\n    *   The remaining cells ((5,6) and Row 6) remain as they were (Green/3).\n7.  **Clear Source Pixels:** The 5 reachable Maroon (9) pixels in the input grid are replaced with the background color Orange (7). The unreachable ones remain Maroon (9).\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n*   Rows 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10 are unchanged (except for potential 9 removals, but none of the reachable 9s are on these rows).\n*   Row 2: 9s at (2,2) and (2,8) become 7. (2,0) stays 9.\n*   Row 4: Center (4,4)-(4,6) becomes 9,9,9.\n*   Row 5: Center (5,4)-(5,5) becomes 9,9. (5,6) remains 3.\n*   Row 8: 9s at (8,2), (8,5), (8,8) become 7.\n\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,3,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand how the 9s (maroon color) interact with the center 3x3 block (marked by 3s with a 2 in the center), and how the 6s (magenta) act as barriers.\n\n**Analysis of the transformation:**\n\nFrom the examples, I can see that:\n1. The 9s are attracted to the center 3x3 block and fill it\n2. The 6s form rigid walls/barriers\n3. 9s that can \"reach\" the center (not completely blocked above the main wall) move to fill the center\n4. 9s turn to 7 at their original positions when they move\n\n**Test input structure:**\n- Center is at (5,5) with value 2, surrounded by 3s at rows 4-6, columns 4-6\n- Row 1 is completely 6s (top wall)\n- Columns 1 and 9 are mostly 6s (side walls)\n\n**Identifying 9s:**\n- Row 0: (0,2), (0,8) - above top wall\n- Row 2: (2,0), (2,2), (2,8)\n- Row 3: (3,10)\n- Row 5: (5,10)\n- Row 7: (7,10)\n- Row 8: (8,2), (8,5), (8,8)\n\n**Which 9s move:**\nBased on the pattern, 9s at or below the top wall (row 1) can contribute. 9s above the wall only contribute if in center columns (4-6).\n- (0,2) and (0,8) are in row 0 but columns 2 and 8 (not center columns) \u2192 stay\n- All other 9s \u2192 move (9 total)\n\nSince 9 9s move and center capacity is 9, the entire center fills with 9s.\n\n**Changes:**\n- Center (rows 4-6, cols 4-6): all become 9\n- 9s that move become 7: (2,0), (2,2), (2,8), (3,10), (5,10), (7,10), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8)\n- 9s that stay: (0,2), (0,8)\n\n**Output:**\n```\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "First I\u2019ll describe the rule I inferred from the training examples, then I\u2019ll apply it step\u2011by\u2011step to the test input and give the final grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Interpreting the colors and the setup\n\nFrom the hints and the examples:\n\n- **Maroon = color 9** \u2192 these are the **mobile pixels**.\n- **Magenta = color 6** \u2192 these are the **rigid walls**.\n- **The central object** is always a **3\u00d73 block of 3\u2019s with a 2 at the center**. This is the **gravity well / target**.\n- **Background** is mostly 7.\n\nIn every example:\n\n- Some 9\u2019s disappear from where they were and reappear **inside the 3\u00d73 central object**, turning some of the 3\u2019s (and sometimes the central 2) into 9\u2019s.\n- The total **count of 9\u2019s is preserved**.\n- The 6\u2019s never move or change.\n- The 7\u2019s only change where a 9 leaves or where a 9 appears.\n\nSo the transformation is:\n\n1. Decide **which 9\u2019s are \u201cattracted\u201d** into the central well (others stay put).\n2. Those attracted 9\u2019s are all **collected and placed inside the 3\u00d73 object** in a fixed order.\n3. Their **original cells are turned to background (7)**.\n\nThe key is how many 9\u2019s get attracted and how they are laid out inside the 3\u00d73.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How many 9\u2019s are sucked into the well?\n\nThe walls (6\u2019s) carve the board into \u201cbasins\u201d. For a given puzzle:\n\n- 9\u2019s that are in the **same basin** as the central 3\u00d73 (when you move through cells that are *not* 6) are **candidates** to be pulled in.\n- 9\u2019s that are **behind solid walls of 6\u2019s** and cannot reach the 3\u00d73 without crossing a 6 are **blocked** and stay where they are.\n\nIn the three training examples:\n\n- Example 3 has **no 6\u2019s**, so **all** 9\u2019s are in the same basin \u2192 all 4 move to the central area.\n- Example 1 has the 3\u00d73 surrounded by 6\u2019s with just a **single open \u201cdoor\u201d** below; only **two** 9\u2019s (the pair just below that door) are in the same basin as the center; the others are separated by 6 walls \u2192 N = 2.\n- Example 2\u2019s 6\u2011cross encloses the center with one open side; **exactly 9** of the 9\u2019s can reach that central basin without crossing a 6 \u2192 N = 9.\n\nThen:\n\n- Let **N = number of maroon 9\u2019s in the same 4\u2011connected region as the central 3\u00d73, when you treat 6 as walls**.\n- These N maroon pixels are \u201csucked in\u201d. Everywhere else, 9\u2019s are unchanged.\n\n---\n\n## 3. How the 9\u2019s fill the 3\u00d73 central object\n\nOnce you know N:\n\n- Take the 3\u00d73 central mask (rows r\u2080..r\u2080+2, cols c\u2080..c\u2080+2 where the 3\u2019s & the 2 are).\n- Visit its 9 cells **in reading order**: top row left\u2192right, then middle, then bottom.\n- Paint the **first N cells** of that 3\u00d73 **with color 9**.\n- Leave the remaining cells of that 3\u00d73 unchanged (still 3 or 2).\n\nThis pattern matches the examples:\n\n- Example 1: N = 2 \u2192 top row cells (1) and (2) become 9:  \n  3\u00d73 becomes  \n  `9 9 3`  \n  `3 2 3`  \n  `3 3 3`  \n  which is exactly the given output.\n- Example 3: N = 4 \u2192 cells (1\u20134) in reading order become 9:  \n  `9 9 9`  \n  `9 2 3`  \n  `3 3 3`  \n  matches the example.\n- Example 2: N \u2265 9 \u2192 all 9 cells become 9: full 3\u00d73 of 9\u2019s, as in the output.\n\nSeparately, for the N 9\u2019s that got sucked in, their original locations are turned to background 7.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Apply the rule to the test input\n\n### 4.1. Locate the central object\n\nThe central 3\u00d73 of 3\u2019s with a 2 in the middle is:\n\nRows 4\u20136, columns 4\u20136 (0\u2011based indexing):\n\n- Row 4: `...,6,3,3,3,6,...` \u2192 cells (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) are 3.\n- Row 5: `...,7,3,2,3,7,...` \u2192 cells (5,4), (5,5), (5,6) are 3,2,3.\n- Row 6: `...,6,3,3,3,6,...` \u2192 cells (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) are 3.\n\nSo the 3\u00d73 mask is:\n\n- (4,4) (4,5) (4,6)\n- (5,4) (5,5) (5,6)\n- (6,4) (6,5) (6,6)\n\n### 4.2. List all the 9\u2019s\n\nCoordinates (row, col):\n\n- Row 0: (0,2), (0,8)\n- Row 2: (2,0), (2,2), (2,8)\n- Row 3: (3,10)\n- Row 5: (5,10)\n- Row 7: (7,10)\n- Row 8: (8,2), (8,5), (8,8)\n\nTotal 11 maroon pixels.\n\n### 4.3. Find which 9\u2019s are in the same basin as the center\n\nTreat **6 as wall** and all other colors (7,3,2,9) as passable. Use 4\u2011connected adjacency (up/down/left/right).\n\nFrom the central 3\u00d73 we flood outwards:\n\n- Because of the big horizontal wall of 6\u2019s at row 1, the 9\u2019s on **row 0** \u2013 (0,2) and (0,8) \u2013 are **cut off**: you cannot get from the central region to row 0 without crossing row 1\u2019s 6\u2019s. So these two 9\u2019s are **blocked** and do not move.\n- The right edge has a vertical wall of 6\u2019s around column 9/10 that isolates the 9\u2019s at:\n  - (3,10), (5,10), (7,10)  \n    They have only neighbors that are 6 or out of bounds, except each other and some 7\u2019s behind the same wall; that pocket is sealed from the central basin by 6\u2019s. So these three are also **blocked**.\n- The remaining 9\u2019s:\n  - (2,0), (2,2), (2,8)\n  - (8,2), (8,5), (8,8)\n  are **reachable** from the central region via 4\u2011connected paths that do not go through any 6.\n\nThus the number of maroon pixels attracted into the well is:\n\n- **N = 6** (those six reachable 9\u2019s).\n\nThese are the ones whose original cells will be emptied (turned to 7) and whose mass will reappear in the 3\u00d73.\n\n### 4.4. Fill the central 3\u00d73 with N=6 maroon pixels\n\nThe 3\u00d73 cells in reading order:\n\n1. (4,4)\n2. (4,5)\n3. (4,6)\n4. (5,4)\n5. (5,5)\n6. (5,6)\n7. (6,4)\n8. (6,5)\n9. (6,6)\n\nWith N=6, we make cells 1\u20136 equal to 9 and leave cells 7\u20139 as they were:\n\n- (4,4) 3 \u2192 9\n- (4,5) 3 \u2192 9\n- (4,6) 3 \u2192 9\n- (5,4) 3 \u2192 9\n- (5,5) 2 \u2192 9\n- (5,6) 3 \u2192 9\n- (6,4) 3 \u2192 3 (unchanged)\n- (6,5) 3 \u2192 3\n- (6,6) 3 \u2192 3\n\nSo the central block becomes:\n\nRow 4 cols 4\u20136: `9,9,9`  \nRow 5 cols 4\u20136: `9,9,9`  \nRow 6 cols 4\u20136: `3,3,3`  (unchanged).\n\n### 4.5. Remove the six moved maroon pixels from their original positions\n\nThe six reachable maroon coordinates:\n\n- (2,0), (2,2), (2,8), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8)\n\nEach of these becomes 7.\n\nUpdate affected rows:\n\n- Row 2 original: `9,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,7`  \n  After clearing (2,0), (2,2), (2,8):  \n  \u2192 `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7`\n\n- Row 8 original: `7,6,9,7,7,9,7,7,9,6,7`  \n  After clearing (8,2), (8,5), (8,8):  \n  \u2192 `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7`\n\nAll other rows\u2019 9\u2019s were blocked and remain unchanged.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Final output grid\n\nPutting it all together, the output grid is:\n\nRow 0: `6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6`  \nRow 1: `6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6`  \nRow 2: `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7`  \nRow 3: `7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9`  \nRow 4: `7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7`  \nRow 5: `7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9`  \nRow 6: `7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7`  \nRow 7: `7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9`  \nRow 8: `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7`  \nRow 9: `7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6`  \nRow10: `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6`\n\nSo the completed output grid is:\n\n```\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "First I\u2019ll describe the pattern I inferred from the three training examples, then I\u2019ll show exactly how I applied it to the test grid, and finally I\u2019ll give the resulting output grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the transformation does\n\nAcross the examples the following behavior is consistent:\n\n- **Mobile color (maroon)**: `9`\n- **Wall color (magenta)**: `6`\n- **Central \u201cmagnet\u201d object**: a `3\u00d73` block whose outer cells are `3` and whose center is `2`\n- **Background**: `7` (and sometimes other colors, but they don\u2019t move)\n\nThe transformation looks like this:\n\n1. **Find the central 3\u00d73 magnet**  \n   It\u2019s always the 3\u00d73 block centered in the grid containing a single `2` in the center and `3`s around it.\n\n2. **Find maroon pixels that are \u201cattracted\u201d to the magnet**\n   - Treat `6` cells as **solid walls**.\n   - Treat `2`, `3`, `7`, and `9` as passable terrain (for the purpose of connectivity).\n   - Compute which `9` cells are in the same passable region as the magnet. Any `9` in a region that is separated by a complete band of `6`s (like a solid row or solid column of `6`s) is **blocked** and does not move.\n   - The movable maroons are exactly those reachable from the magnet without crossing a `6`.\n\n   In the examples:\n   - Example 3 has no `6`s, so all `9`s can reach the magnet \u2192 all 4 move.\n   - Example 1: only the two bottom maroons are in the same reachable pocket as the magnet \u2192 2 move.\n   - Example 2: the cross of `6`s splits off a batch of maroons near the top; 9 maroons remain in the same component as the magnet \u2192 9 move.\n\n   The **total number of moving maroons** `m` equals the number of reachable `9` cells.\n\n3. **Move (reassign) the moving maroons into the 3\u00d73 magnet**\n   - The magnet has 9 cells. We \u201cfill\u201d it with the `m` moving maroons in a fixed order:\n     - Order of cells inside the 3\u00d73 (row-major, top-left first):\n\n       1. (top row) left, middle, right\n       2. (middle row) left, center, right\n       3. (bottom row) left, middle, right\n\n       In coordinates relative to the grid this is:\n       ```\n       (r-1,c-1), (r-1,c), (r-1,c+1),\n       (r,  c-1), (r,  c), (r,  c+1),\n       (r+1,c-1), (r+1,c), (r+1,c+1)\n       ```\n       where `(r,c)` is the center cell (the `2`).\n\n   - For the first `m` cells in that order, overwrite whatever is there (3 or 2) with `9`.\n   - If `m < 9`, only a prefix of that order is turned into `9`s; the rest of the magnet stays as in the input.\n   - If `m \u2265 9`, the entire 3\u00d73 block becomes `9`s.\n\n   You can see this in the examples:\n   - Example 1: `m = 2` \u2192 only the top-left 2 cells of the 3\u00d73 (r5c5, r5c6) become `9`.\n   - Example 3: `m = 4` \u2192 (r5c5, r5c6, r5c7, r6c5) become `9`.\n   - Example 2: `m = 9` \u2192 the whole 3\u00d73 becomes `9`.\n\n4. **Erase the moved maroons from their original locations**\n   - Every `9` that we counted as reachable/moving disappears from its original position.\n   - In the examples, all those start cells become `7` in the output.\n   - Maroons that are in a different connectivity component (blocked by `6` walls) remain where they are.\n\n5. **All non-9, non-magnet parts of the grid otherwise stay unchanged.**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Apply this to the test input\n\n### 2.1. Locate the magnet\n\nTest input (for reference):\n\n```\nRow1:  6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\nRow2:  6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\nRow3:  9,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,7\nRow4:  7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\nRow5:  7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\nRow6:  7,6,7,7,3,2,3,7,7,6,9\nRow7:  7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\nRow8:  7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\nRow9:  7,6,9,7,7,9,7,7,9,6,7\nRow10: 7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\nRow11: 7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n```\n\nThe central 3\u00d73 with a `2` in the middle is at rows 5\u20137, columns 5\u20137:\n\n- Row 5, cols 5\u20137: `3,3,3`\n- Row 6, cols 5\u20137: `3,2,3`\n- Row 7, cols 5\u20137: `3,3,3`\n\nSo the magnet is:\n- Center `(r,c) = (6,6)`\n- Magnet cells:\n  - Row 5: (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)\n  - Row 6: (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)\n  - Row 7: (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)\n\n### 2.2. Find which 9s are reachable (not blocked by 6-walls)\n\nAll maroons (`9`) in the grid:\n\n- Row 1: (1,3), (1,9)\n- Row 3: (3,1), (3,3), (3,9)\n- Row 4: (4,11)\n- Row 6: (6,11)\n- Row 8: (8,11)\n- Row 9: (9,3), (9,6), (9,9)\n\nWe now look at the walls:\n\n- Row 2 is entirely `6`s \u2192 a **solid horizontal wall**.\n- Column 10 is entirely `6`s \u2192 a **solid vertical wall**.\n- Column 2 is `6` from row 1 to row 10 (only row 11 has non-6 in col 2), giving nearly a full vertical wall.\n\nBecause row 2 is all `6`, anything in **row 1** (above that solid wall) is in a separate component from the magnet; there is no way to reach the magnet (rows 5\u20137) without crossing row 2. Thus:\n\n- `(1,3)` and `(1,9)` are **blocked** by the row-2 wall and do not move.\n\nAll the other 9s (rows \u2265 3 and not on col 10) are in the same passable region as the magnet when you treat `6` as walls and walk through `7/3/2/9`. They are reachable and thus **will move**.\n\nSo:\n\n- **Unreachable and static**: (1,3), (1,9)  \u2192 stay as `9`.\n- **Reachable and moving**:  \n  (3,1), (3,3), (3,9), (4,11), (6,11), (8,11), (9,3), (9,6), (9,9)\n\nThere are 9 moving maroons, `m = 9`.\n\n### 2.3. Fill the magnet with the 9 moving maroons\n\nThe 3\u00d73 magnet has 9 cells, and `m = 9`, so it becomes **entirely filled with 9s**.\n\nRow-major order for the magnet cells:\n\n1. (5,5)\n2. (5,6)\n3. (5,7)\n4. (6,5)\n5. (6,6)\n6. (6,7)\n7. (7,5)\n8. (7,6)\n9. (7,7)\n\nSince we have exactly 9 moving maroons, all these cells are set to `9`.\n\nOriginal magnet:\n\n- Row 5: `..., 3,3,3, ...`\n- Row 6: `..., 3,2,3, ...`\n- Row 7: `..., 3,3,3, ...`\n\nAfter filling:\n\n- Row 5: `..., 9,9,9, ...`\n- Row 6: `..., 9,9,9, ...`\n- Row 7: `..., 9,9,9, ...`\n\n### 2.4. Erase the moved maroons from their start positions\n\nEvery **moving** `9` is replaced by background `7` at its original location:\n\n- (3,1): 9 \u2192 7\n- (3,3): 9 \u2192 7\n- (3,9): 9 \u2192 7\n- (4,11): 9 \u2192 7\n- (6,11): 9 \u2192 7\n- (8,11): 9 \u2192 7\n- (9,3): 9 \u2192 7\n- (9,6): 9 \u2192 7\n- (9,9): 9 \u2192 7\n\nThe two **blocked** maroons in row 1 remain as `9`.\n\nEverything else stays the same.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

            "Full raw LLM response": "To solve this task I looked at the three worked examples and identified three key colours:\n\n- `6` is the magenta \u201cwall\u201d colour that is impassable.\n- `9` is the maroon \u201cmobile\u201d colour that gets attracted.\n- The small 3\u00d73 patch of `3`s with a single `2` in its centre is the \u201cmagnet\u201d object.\n\nIn all examples the transformation conserves the number of `9`s, but some `9`s disappear from their original locations and reappear over the central object. The pattern of the re\u2011appearing `9`s is always the top\u2011left part of the 3\u00d73 magnet region in row\u2011major order, and the `2` is overwritten if enough `9`s are available. The positions that lose their `9` become background `7`.\n\nThe decisive factor is whether a `9` can reach the magnet without crossing a wall. The way to model that is to do a breadth\u2011first search (BFS) from all cells of the 3\u00d73 magnet region through all non\u2011`6` cells. Every time the BFS encounters a cell containing a `9` we add it to a list in order of increasing distance. At the end, we take as many of these reachable `9`s as there are cells in the magnet (at most 9). Those selected `9`s are removed from their original positions (set to `7`) and placed into the magnet cells in fixed row\u2011major order: (row\u202f5,col\u202f5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). Any remaining `9`s that are unreachable, or beyond the first nine, remain where they were.\n\nApplying this to the test grid:\n\n- Row\u202f2 is entirely walls, so the two `9`s in row\u202f1 are unreachable and stay put.\n- Column\u202f10 is entirely walls, so the `9`s in column\u202f11 form an isolated component and stay put.\n- The BFS from the magnet within the reachable component finds exactly six `9`s at positions (3,1),(3,3),(3,9),(9,3),(9,6),(9,9). These are removed.\n- The first six magnet cells in row\u2011major order are filled with `9`s; the last three remain as they were.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6",

            "Full raw LLM response": "To solve this task I first identified the three relevant colours from the examples:\n\n- `6` is the \u201cmagenta\u201d wall and blocks movement.\n- The central 3\u00d73 object made of `3` with a `2` in the centre is the target.\n- `9` are the maroon mobile pixels.\n\nIn all examples the only changes are that some `9`s disappear from their original positions and re\u2011appear inside the 3\u00d73 target. The number inserted equals the number of \u201creachable\u201d `9`s, capped at the nine cells of the block, and they are written into the block in row\u2011major order (top row left to right, then next row, etc.). Any cells of the block not filled remain as they were. The moved `9`s\u2019 original cells are set back to the background colour `7`; unreachable `9`s stay where they were.\n\nTo determine reachability and closeness I perform a BFS starting from all cells of the target block through all non\u2011wall cells (any value other than `6`). This gives the shortest path length to the target for every cell; cells not reached are unreachable. If there are more reachable `9`s than the nine block cells, I would take the nearest ones by this distance, but in this test there are fewer than nine so all reachable `9`s move.\n\nApplying this to the test input, the row of `6`s on row\u00a02 isolates row\u00a01, and the solid column of `6`s at col\u00a010 isolates col\u00a011, so the reachable `9`s are at (3,1),(3,3),(3,9),(9,3),(9,6),(9,9); all six move. They fill the first six positions of the 3\u00d73 block, turning the centre `2` into `9` as well. The original positions of those six are set to `7`. All other cells remain unchanged.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**My analysis reveals a core rule governing the transformation in these images.**\n\n**1. Observed Structures:** I see a constant Green square frame with a Red center as a target, Magenta shapes acting as barriers, Orange background, and Maroon blocks (dark red) which change their position.\n\n**2. Transformation Categories:** This task clearly involves object movement (Maroon blocks), an anchor point (Green/Red object), and obstacles (Magenta walls). It also effectively \"removes noise\" by aggregating the scattered Maroon blocks.\n\n**3. Key Insights:** Maroon blocks are attracted to the central Green/Red target. The Magenta shapes define immovable obstacles.\n\n**4. The Rule:** The task simulates the attraction of Maroon pixels toward the Green/Red target. The Magenta pixels are static walls that block movement. Maroon pixels slide towards the center (or the Green target, or the bounding box of it), until they collide with a wall, the target itself, or other Maroon pixels. They then form dense clusters at the stopping points.\n\n**5. Detailed Reasoning:**  Maroon objects are drawn towards the center of the Green object. Magenta lines act as physical barriers. When Maroon objects reach the center, they accumulate and are able to stack/overlap the green object.\n\n**6. Verification of the rule:**\n\n*   In *Input 1->Output 1* , the Magenta shape has several Maroon blocks inside a winding path, and outside. These blocks are \"trapped\" and cannot reach the center, so they stay in place.\n*   In *Input 2->Output 2*, the Magenta shape is shaped like an inverted \"U\", enclosing some Maroon blocks but not others. The enclosed blocks move to the center, pile up and form a large, rectangular Maroon block, obscuring the central Green shape. The outer Maroon blocks do not move.\n*   In *Input 3->Output 3*, there is no Magenta shape, so Maroon blocks move towards the Green object at the center, piling onto the top-left of the green shape. They are drawn to the green center, and stack.\n\n**In summary:** Maroon blocks simulate being drawn to the Green/Red center, Magenta walls act as obstacles, and the final locations and shapes depend on the Maroon blocks' starting positions and whether the way to the center is blocked.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided image containing three input-output pairs, here are the observations and insights.\n\n### **1. Describe the observable structures**\n\n*   **Background:** A uniform Orange field.\n*   **Static Objects:**\n    *   A central **Green square frame** (3x3) with a single **Light Red** pixel in its center. This object appears in the same location in all inputs and outputs (though it may be occluded).\n    *   **Magenta structures**: These act as linear paths, walls, or enclosures. Their shape and position are preserved exactly from input to output.\n*   **Dynamic Objects:**\n    *   **Maroon (Dark Red) blocks**: In the inputs, these appear as scattered \"noise\" or small blocks of varying sizes (1x1 to 2x1).\n    *   In the outputs, the Maroon pixels change position. They are either gone, consolidated into larger shapes, or shifted to new locations.\n*   **Arrangement:** The Green/Light Red object is always central. The Magenta shapes (if present) surround or border this center. The Maroon blocks are scattered initially but appear \"clumped\" or attached to other objects in the outputs.\n\n### **2. Identify transformation categories**\n\n*   **Object movement:** **Present**. Maroon blocks appear to move.\n*   **Object recoloring:** **Absent**.\n*   **Bordering / outlining:** **Absent**.\n*   **Filling holes or cavities:** **Maybe** (as a result of movement).\n*   **Removing noise / extracting main shape:** **Present** (Scattered pixels aggregate).\n*   **Copying / pasting / repositioning:** **Absent**.\n*   **Using a key anchor location:** **Present** (The central Green/Red object).\n*   **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors:** **Absent**.\n*   **Size-based filtering or selection:** **Absent**.\n*   **Symmetry or reflection operations:** **Absent**.\n*   **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion:** **Absent** (Conservation of mass seems likely).\n*   **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping:** **Maybe** (Aggregation).\n\n### **3. Extract the key non-obvious insights**\n\n*   **The \"Magnet\" Effect:** The central Green/Red object acts as an attractor. All Maroon pixels seem to travel towards this central point.\n*   **Walls as Barriers:** The Magenta shapes act as immovable physical barriers. Maroon pixels cannot pass through them.\n*   **Occlusion/Layering:** When Maroon pixels reach the central Green object (as seen in Output 2 and 3), they do not stop *at* the edge; they move *over* it, effectively covering or hiding the Green/Red pixels. Maroon has a higher \"z-index\" than Green/Red.\n*   **Stuck Pixels:** Maroon pixels that cannot reach the center because of Magenta walls (e.g., the outer blocks in Output 2) simply move as close as possible and then stop against the wall.\n*   **Conservation of Existence:** Maroon pixels are not deleted; they just pile up. The large block in Output 2 is likely the sum of the many small scattered pixels from Input 2.\n\n### **4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)**\n\nThe transformation simulates a **physics-based attraction** or **gravity** towards the center of the grid (specifically targeting the Green/Red object).\n\n1.  **Movers:** Maroon pixels act as mobile particles.\n2.  **Attractor:** The central Green/Red object attracts all Maroon pixels.\n3.  **Obstacles:** Magenta pixels act as solid walls.\n4.  **Behavior:** All Maroon pixels slide towards the center. They stop only when they collide with a Magenta wall, the central target (where they may stack or overlap), or another stopped Maroon pixel. This results in scattered \"noise\" aggregating into dense clusters at the center or against walls.\n\n### **5. List checks you would perform when solving**\n\n*   **Conservation Check:** Count the number of Maroon pixels in the input and compare it to the number of Maroon pixels in the output (accounting for potential overlap/occlusion on the green shape) to verify if mass is conserved.\n*   **Path Verification:** Trace straight lines from each input Maroon block towards the center. Verify if the final position in the output corresponds to the first obstacle (Magenta wall) or the target encountered along that path.\n*   **Layering Logic:** Confirm if the Green/Red pixels are replaced by Maroon pixels when they overlap, or if they mix. (Visual evidence suggests replacement).\n*   **Adjacency Check:** Ensure that Maroon pixels in the output are always adjacent to either a Magenta wall, the Green/Red center, or other Maroon pixels (no floating pixels allowed unless they are in transit, which the output captures as the final state).\n\n### **6. Summarize final insights**\n\nHINT_START\n*   The central object acts as a \"magnet\" or gravity well for a specific color (Maroon).\n*   A secondary color (Magenta) acts as a rigid barrier or wall that blocks movement.\n*   Mobile pixels slide towards the center until they hit a wall, the target, or pile up against each other.\n*   The mobile color can overwrite/occlude the central target object if it reaches it.\nHINT_END",

Got it.\n\nSo, first thing, I see a dominant background.  It's consistently filled with color `7`. That's the foundation.  Then, there are these rectangular shapes \u2013 hollow loops \u2013 always color `6`. They're like frames or boundaries.  Inside these frames, and sometimes standing alone, there's a distinct pattern I keep seeing:  a 3x3 block where the center pixel is color `2`, and the surrounding eight pixels are usually color `3`.  I'm going to call that the \"core\" pattern.  That `2` in the middle is like an eye or something, and the `3` surrounding it really stands out.\n\nThen there's this other element, the color `9`.  It's all over the place.  Sometimes it's just scattered individual pixels, or maybe small clusters.  Other times, it fills in a whole rectangular area, usually where I'd expect that `3/2` core pattern to be.  It seems flexible - it's either random noise or it replaces the \"inner\" parts of the structure.\n\nSo my object types are: the background (color `7`), the frames (color `6`), the core pattern (`2` center, `3` ring, usually in a 3x3), and the \"variable\" color `9` elements.\n\nHere's the final output:\nThe grids primarily contain a background field of color 7. Distinct geometric structures appear against this background.\nOne major object type is a hollow rectangular frame or boundary constructed from color 6. These frames vary in size and position.\nInside these frames, or sometimes appearing independently, is a composite square object, typically 3x3 in size. This composite object frequently features a central single pixel of color 2, surrounded by a ring of pixels of color 3.\nAnother object type consists of pixels of color 9. These appear in two forms: as scattered, isolated pixels or small clusters distributed across the color 7 background, and occasionally as a solid fill within the color 6 frames (replacing the color 3/2 pattern).\n\n<objects_summary>\n1. Background: Continuous field of color 7.\n2. Frames: Hollow rectangular loops made of color 6.\n3. Composite Squares: 3x3 blocks, typically with a center pixel of color 2 surrounded by a ring of color 3.\n4. Scattered/Fill Pixels: Color 9, appearing as small noise-like spots or filling rectangular regions.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Count the number of color 9 pixels that are topologically connected to the central 3x3 Core (through color 7/9, blocked by color 6). Limit this count to a maximum of 9 (prioritizing closest pixels).\n2. Change these identified source pixels from 9 to 7.\n3. Update the 3x3 Core pixels to color 9, filling in row-major order (top-left to bottom-right) based on the count from step 1.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Finalized Strategy for ARC Task: \"Pattern Filling\"**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to figure out this pattern-filling puzzle. I've broken it down step-by-step, using the examples and test case. Here's the plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the \"Core\"**: This is usually a 3x3 block in the middle, often with a \"2\" in the center. In the examples, I see the core centered at R4-R6, C4-C6.\n\n2.  **Find Connected \"9\" Pixels**: This is the heart of the algorithm. I need to count the number of \"9\" pixels that are *connected* to the core. A pixel is connected if there is a path of adjacent pixels (horizontally or vertically) made up of only background color (\"7\"), the \"9\" pixels themselves, or the core numbers (3,2). Important to note that the frame color \"6\" forms walls, blocking connection.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Fill Count**: The number of connected \"9\"s determines how many pixels within the core will be replaced with \"9\". Crucially, the maximum count seems to be capped at 9.\n\n4.  **Fill the Core**: The core is filled in a *specific* order: Top row (left to right), Middle row (left to right), Bottom row. The filling uses this specific count. The original numbers of the core get overwritten.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown of the process:**\n\n1.  **Example Analysis:**\n    *   I carefully examine the examples. In each one, I trace paths from the core to find connected \"9\" pixels.\n    *   Walls (defined by color 6) are crucial, as they can block connection and, thus, limit the count of \"9\".\n    *   Ex 1: 2, 2.\n    *   Ex 2: 8, 8 and, finally, I got 9 from a re-reading.\n    *   Ex 3: 4, 4.\n2.  **The \"Connected Pixel\" Logic:**\n    *   The algorithm identifies \"rooms\" that form separate components on the grid.\n    *   A pixel is part of the count if there is an unbroken connection to the core through \"7\"s and \"9\"s. A wall made of \"6\" blocks that path.\n\n3.  **The Center \"2\"**:  The number of \"2\" at the center stays during the whole filling process.\n\n4.  **Test the Input**\n    *   I carefully analyze and build the logic from the given input.\n    *   I see the frame as the border.\n\n**Putting It All Together**\n\nThis procedure is what I'll apply to each input grid. First, I identify the core and the \"connected 9\"s using my path-finding and wall analysis techniques. Then I calculate the \"fill count\" and replace parts of the core based on the filling strategy.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to simulate a specific transformation process on a grid of colored pixels. Based on the provided examples, here is the derived logic:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core:** Locate the 3x3 pattern consisting of color `3` (green) pixels surrounding a central color `2` (red) pixel. In the test input, this core is located at Rows 4-6 and Columns 4-6.\n\n2.  **Identify Connected Noise:** Identify all pixels of color `9` (maroon) that are topologically connected to the Core. Connectivity is defined by a path of non-blocking pixels (typically background `7`, core `3`/`2`, or other `9`s). Pixels of color `6` (magenta) act as walls/barriers. The count is limited to a maximum of 9.\n\n    *   **Connectivity Analysis for Test Input:**\n        *   The core is inside an inner room (Rows 3-7, Cols 3-7), with gaps in the walls at `R5C3` and `R5C7`.\n        *   These gaps lead to the outer region within the main frame (Rows 2-8, Cols 2-8).\n        *   From this outer region, we can reach `R9C8` (a gap in the bottom frame).\n        *   This gap leads to Row 10 (bottom edge), which is open (all `7`s).\n        *   Row 10 allows travel to Column 0.\n        *   **Connected `9`s found:**\n            1.  `R2C2`: Accessible from the inner region.\n            2.  `R2C8`: Accessible from the inner region.\n            3.  `R8C2`: Accessible from the inner region.\n            4.  `R8C5`: Accessible from the inner region (via R8).\n            5.  `R8C8`: Accessible from the inner region (via R8).\n            6.  `R2C0`: Accessible via the path exiting at `R9C8`, traversing `R10` to `C0`, and moving up.\n        *   **Isolated `9`s (Not Counted):**\n            *   `R0C2`, `R0C8`: Blocked by the solid wall at Row 1.\n            *   `R3C10`, `R5C10`, `R7C10`: Blocked by the solid vertical wall at Column 9.\n\n    *   **Total Count:** 6 pixels.\n\n3.  **Remove Source Pixels:** Change the identified connected `9`s to the background color `7`.\n    *   `R2C2`, `R2C8` become `7`.\n    *   `R8C2`, `R8C5`, `R8C8` become `7`.\n    *   `R2C0` becomes `7`.\n\n4.  **Fill the Core:** Fill the 3x3 Core with `9`s corresponding to the count, in row-major order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).\n    *   Count is 6.\n    *   Fill the first 6 positions of the 3x3 grid (Rows 4 and 5).\n    *   `R4C4`, `R4C5`, `R4C6` become `9`.\n    *   `R5C4`, `R5C5` (center), `R5C6` become `9`.\n    *   The remaining pixels (`R6C4`, `R6C5`, `R6C6`) remain `3`.\n\n**Final Grid Construction:**\nStart with the input grid and apply the changes.\n\n*   **Row 0:** `6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6` (Unchanged)\n*   **Row 1:** `6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6` (Unchanged)\n*   **Row 2:** `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7` (`9`s at C0, C2, C8 -> `7`)\n*   **Row 3:** `7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9` (Unchanged)\n*   **Row 4:** `7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7` (Core top row -> `9,9,9`)\n*   **Row 5:** `7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9` (Core mid row -> `9,9,9`)\n*   **Row 6:** `7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7` (Core bot row -> Unchanged `3,3,3`)\n*   **Row 7:** `7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9` (Unchanged)\n*   **Row 8:** `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7` (`9`s at C2, C5, C8 -> `7`)\n*   **Row 9:** `7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6` (Unchanged)\n*   **Row 10:** `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6` (Unchanged)\n\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6",

Got it.\n\nSo, first thing, I see a dominant background.  It's consistently filled with color `7`. That's the foundation.  Then, there are these rectangular shapes \u2013 hollow loops \u2013 always color `6`. They're like frames or boundaries.  Inside these frames, and sometimes standing alone, there's a distinct pattern I keep seeing:  a 3x3 block where the center pixel is color `2`, and the surrounding eight pixels are usually color `3`.  I'm going to call that the \"core\" pattern.  That `2` in the middle is like an eye or something, and the `3` surrounding it really stands out.\n\nThen there's this other element, the color `9`.  It's all over the place.  Sometimes it's just scattered individual pixels, or maybe small clusters.  Other times, it fills in a whole rectangular area, usually where I'd expect that `3/2` core pattern to be.  It seems flexible - it's either random noise or it replaces the \"inner\" parts of the structure.\n\nSo my object types are: the background (color `7`), the frames (color `6`), the core pattern (`2` center, `3` ring, usually in a 3x3), and the \"variable\" color `9` elements.\n\nHere's the final output:\nThe grids primarily contain a background field of color 7. Distinct geometric structures appear against this background.\nOne major object type is a hollow rectangular frame or boundary constructed from color 6. These frames vary in size and position.\nInside these frames, or sometimes appearing independently, is a composite square object, typically 3x3 in size. This composite object frequently features a central single pixel of color 2, surrounded by a ring of pixels of color 3.\nAnother object type consists of pixels of color 9. These appear in two forms: as scattered, isolated pixels or small clusters distributed across the color 7 background, and occasionally as a solid fill within the color 6 frames (replacing the color 3/2 pattern).\n\n<objects_summary>\n1. Background: Continuous field of color 7.\n2. Frames: Hollow rectangular loops made of color 6.\n3. Composite Squares: 3x3 blocks, typically with a center pixel of color 2 surrounded by a ring of color 3.\n4. Scattered/Fill Pixels: Color 9, appearing as small noise-like spots or filling rectangular regions.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Count the number of color 9 pixels that are topologically connected to the central 3x3 Core (through color 7/9, blocked by color 6). Limit this count to a maximum of 9 (prioritizing closest pixels).\n2. Change these identified source pixels from 9 to 7.\n3. Update the 3x3 Core pixels to color 9, filling in row-major order (top-left to bottom-right) based on the count from step 1.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

Got it.\n\nSo, first thing, I see a dominant background.  It's consistently filled with color `7`. That's the foundation.  Then, there are these rectangular shapes \u2013 hollow loops \u2013 always color `6`. They're like frames or boundaries.  Inside these frames, and sometimes standing alone, there's a distinct pattern I keep seeing:  a 3x3 block where the center pixel is color `2`, and the surrounding eight pixels are usually color `3`.  I'm going to call that the \"core\" pattern.  That `2` in the middle is like an eye or something, and the `3` surrounding it really stands out.\n\nThen there's this other element, the color `9`.  It's all over the place.  Sometimes it's just scattered individual pixels, or maybe small clusters.  Other times, it fills in a whole rectangular area, usually where I'd expect that `3/2` core pattern to be.  It seems flexible - it's either random noise or it replaces the \"inner\" parts of the structure.\n\nSo my object types are: the background (color `7`), the frames (color `6`), the core pattern (`2` center, `3` ring, usually in a 3x3), and the \"variable\" color `9` elements.\n\nHere's the final output:\nThe grids primarily contain a background field of color 7. Distinct geometric structures appear against this background.\nOne major object type is a hollow rectangular frame or boundary constructed from color 6. These frames vary in size and position.\nInside these frames, or sometimes appearing independently, is a composite square object, typically 3x3 in size. This composite object frequently features a central single pixel of color 2, surrounded by a ring of pixels of color 3.\nAnother object type consists of pixels of color 9. These appear in two forms: as scattered, isolated pixels or small clusters distributed across the color 7 background, and occasionally as a solid fill within the color 6 frames (replacing the color 3/2 pattern).\n\n<objects_summary>\n1. Background: Continuous field of color 7.\n2. Frames: Hollow rectangular loops made of color 6.\n3. Composite Squares: 3x3 blocks, typically with a center pixel of color 2 surrounded by a ring of color 3.\n4. Scattered/Fill Pixels: Color 9, appearing as small noise-like spots or filling rectangular regions.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Count the number of color 9 pixels that are topologically connected to the central 3x3 Core (through color 7/9, blocked by color 6). Limit this count to a maximum of 9 (prioritizing closest pixels).\n2. Change these identified source pixels from 9 to 7.\n3. Update the 3x3 Core pixels to color 9, filling in row-major order (top-left to bottom-right) based on the count from step 1.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Here is the transformation I inferred and how I applied it to the test grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the task is doing\n\nAcross the three examples, there is always:\n\n- A **3\u00d73 \u201ccore\u201d** made of colors `3` and `2`:\n  - pattern:  \n    ```\n    3 3 3\n    3 2 3\n    3 3 3\n    ```\n- Many pixels of color **`9`** scattered around.\n- Color **`6`** acts as **walls/barriers**.\n- Color **`7`** (and `9`) act as **open space / walkable** cells.\n\nThe transformation:\n\n1. **Find all `9` pixels that are connected to the core via a path through only `7` or `9`, with `6` blocking movement.**  \n   - Movement is 4-connected (up, down, left, right).\n   - The path may not step on `3` or `2`; they are part of the core, not part of the walkable graph.\n   - Practically:  \n     - Take all `7`/`9` cells that touch the core (the \u201cdoor\u201d cells around the 3\u00d73 block).  \n     - Run a flood fill (BFS/DFS) from these door cells through cells that are either `7` or `9`, with `6` (and also `3`/`2`) treated as walls.  \n     - Collect every `9` that lies in this reachable region.\n2. Let the number of such reachable `9`s be `N`. If `N > 9`, cap it to `9`.\n3. **Turn those `N` source `9` pixels into `7`.**\n4. **In the core\u2019s 3\u00d73 block, overwrite the first `N` cells (in row-major order: top-left to bottom-right) with `9`.**  \n   - Remaining core cells (if `N < 9`) keep their original values (3 or 2).\n   - If `N \u2265 9`, the entire 3\u00d73 becomes `9`.\n\nYou can verify this on the examples:\n\n- Example 1: Only 2 `9`s are reachable from the core through `7`/`9` without crossing `6`, so 2 `9`s are removed from outside and the first two cells of the core (top row, first two) become `9`.\n- Example 2: Many `9`s are reachable; more than 9, so only the 9 closest in BFS order are used. The core becomes fully 9s.\n- Example 3: 4 `9`s in the grid, all reachable and there are no `6` walls. All 4 are removed from outside, and the first four core cells become `9`.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Apply the rule to the test input\n\n### 2.1. Identify the core\n\nCore is the 3\u00d73 block of `3`s and `2`:\n\nRows 5\u20137, columns 5\u20137 in the test:\n\n```\nrow5 col5\u20137: 3 3 3\nrow6 col5\u20137: 3 2 3\nrow7 col5\u20137: 3 3 3\n```\n\nSo the core coordinates are:\n\n- (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)\n- (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)\n- (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)\n\n### 2.2. Find \u201cdoor\u201d cells and the walkable graph\n\nWalkable colors: `7` and `9`.  \nWalls: `6`, `3`, `2`.\n\nWe look at cells adjacent (4-neighbors) to the core that are `7` or `9`. Those are the door cells:\n\n- Above the core: row 4, cols 5\u20137 \u2192 values: `6,7,6` \u2192 door at (4,6).\n- Below the core: row 8, cols 5\u20137 \u2192 `6,7,6` \u2192 door at (8,6).\n- Left of the core: col 4, rows 5\u20137 \u2192 values `6,7,6` \u2192 door at (6,4).\n- Right of the core: col 8, rows 5\u20137 \u2192 `6,7,6` \u2192 door at (6,8).\n\nSo door set D = { (4,6), (6,4), (6,8), (8,6) }.\n\nNow perform a flood fill from D through cells whose color is `7` or `9`, treating all `6`, `3`, `2` as walls, to find all reachable `9`s.\n\n### 2.3. List `9` pixels in the grid\n\nPositions of `9` in the test input:\n\n- Row 1: (1,3), (1,9)\n- Row 3: (3,1), (3,3), (3,9)\n- Row 4: (4,11)\n- Row 6: (6,11)\n- Row 8: (8,11)\n- Row 9: (9,3), (9,6), (9,9)\n\nTotal: 11 pixels of color 9.\n\nBecause row 2 is all `6`, row 1 is isolated above a solid wall; so (1,3) and (1,9) are **not** connected to the core region.\n\nAlso, column 10 from rows 3\u201311 is all `6`, so column 11\u2019s walkable cells (rows 3\u20139) form a separate component that is **not** connected to the doors; thus (4,11), (6,11), (8,11) are also disconnected from the door component.\n\nRunning the flood fill from D through `7`/`9` in rows 3\u201311, you get that the reachable `9` pixels are exactly:\n\n- (3,1)\n- (3,3)\n- (3,9)\n- (9,3)\n- (9,6)\n- (9,9)\n\nThese 6 are in the same connected component as the doors. The 5 others:\n\n- (1,3), (1,9), (4,11), (6,11), (8,11)\n\nare in different components, hence not \u201cconnected to the core\u201d under the rule.\n\nSo `N = 6` reachable `9`s (and N \u2264 9, so no capping needed).\n\n### 2.4. Modify the outer `9` pixels\n\nTurn these 6 reachable `9` cells into `7`:\n\n- (3,1): 9 \u2192 7\n- (3,3): 9 \u2192 7\n- (3,9): 9 \u2192 7\n- (9,3): 9 \u2192 7\n- (9,6): 9 \u2192 7\n- (9,9): 9 \u2192 7\n\nAll other `9`s remain as they are.\n\n### 2.5. Fill the core with `9`s in row-major order\n\nRow-major order of the core cells:\n\n1. (5,5)\n2. (5,6)\n3. (5,7)\n4. (6,5)\n5. (6,6)\n6. (6,7)\n7. (7,5)\n8. (7,6)\n9. (7,7)\n\nWe have N = 6 reachable 9s, so we overwrite the first 6 core cells with `9`:\n\n- (5,5): 3 \u2192 9\n- (5,6): 3 \u2192 9\n- (5,7): 3 \u2192 9\n- (6,5): 3 \u2192 9\n- (6,6): 2 \u2192 9\n- (6,7): 3 \u2192 9\n\nThe remaining core cells stay as they were:\n\n- (7,5), (7,6), (7,7) remain `3`.\n\nSo the core becomes:\n\n```\nrow5 col5\u20137: 9 9 9\nrow6 col5\u20137: 9 9 9\nrow7 col5\u20137: 3 3 3\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Final output grid\n\nApplying both sets of changes (outer 9\u21927 and core filling) to the test input yields:\n\nRow 1: unchanged  \n`6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6`\n\nRow 2: unchanged  \n`6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6`\n\nRow 3: (3,1),(3,3),(3,9) turned to 7  \n`7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7`\n\nRow 4: unchanged  \n`7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9`\n\nRow 5: core updated at cols 5\u20137  \n`7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7`\n\nRow 6: core updated at cols 5\u20137  \n`7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9`\n\nRow 7: core bottom row unchanged  \n`7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7`\n\nRow 8: unchanged  \n`7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9`\n\nRow 9: (9,3),(9,6),(9,9) turned to 7  \n`7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7`\n\nRow10: unchanged  \n`7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6`\n\nRow11: unchanged  \n`7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6`\n\nSo the completed output grid is:\n\n```\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n```",

Got it.\n\nSo, first thing, I see a dominant background.  It's consistently filled with color `7`. That's the foundation.  Then, there are these rectangular shapes \u2013 hollow loops \u2013 always color `6`. They're like frames or boundaries.  Inside these frames, and sometimes standing alone, there's a distinct pattern I keep seeing:  a 3x3 block where the center pixel is color `2`, and the surrounding eight pixels are usually color `3`.  I'm going to call that the \"core\" pattern.  That `2` in the middle is like an eye or something, and the `3` surrounding it really stands out.\n\nThen there's this other element, the color `9`.  It's all over the place.  Sometimes it's just scattered individual pixels, or maybe small clusters.  Other times, it fills in a whole rectangular area, usually where I'd expect that `3/2` core pattern to be.  It seems flexible - it's either random noise or it replaces the \"inner\" parts of the structure.\n\nSo my object types are: the background (color `7`), the frames (color `6`), the core pattern (`2` center, `3` ring, usually in a 3x3), and the \"variable\" color `9` elements.\n\nHere's the final output:\nThe grids primarily contain a background field of color 7. Distinct geometric structures appear against this background.\nOne major object type is a hollow rectangular frame or boundary constructed from color 6. These frames vary in size and position.\nInside these frames, or sometimes appearing independently, is a composite square object, typically 3x3 in size. This composite object frequently features a central single pixel of color 2, surrounded by a ring of pixels of color 3.\nAnother object type consists of pixels of color 9. These appear in two forms: as scattered, isolated pixels or small clusters distributed across the color 7 background, and occasionally as a solid fill within the color 6 frames (replacing the color 3/2 pattern).\n\n<objects_summary>\n1. Background: Continuous field of color 7.\n2. Frames: Hollow rectangular loops made of color 6.\n3. Composite Squares: 3x3 blocks, typically with a center pixel of color 2 surrounded by a ring of color 3.\n4. Scattered/Fill Pixels: Color 9, appearing as small noise-like spots or filling rectangular regions.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Count the number of color 9 pixels that are topologically connected to the central 3x3 Core (through color 7/9, blocked by color 6). Limit this count to a maximum of 9 (prioritizing closest pixels).\n2. Change these identified source pixels from 9 to 7.\n3. Update the 3x3 Core pixels to color 9, filling in row-major order (top-left to bottom-right) based on the count from step 1.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "The training examples show a 3\u00d73 \u201ccore\u201d of 3s with a 2 in the middle sitting inside a region bounded by 6s. Color\u202f6 acts as a wall: if you flood\u2010fill from the core through any non\u20116 cells, you get a connected component. The transformation removes up to nine 9s in that component and uses them to overwrite the core cells in row\u2011major order with 9s; the removed 9s are turned into background 7s. In the test grid, the component containing the core reaches the 9s at (3,1), (3,3), (3,9), (9,3), (9,6) and (9,9). There are six of them, so those six are set to 7 and the first six positions of the core (row\u202f5\u202fcol\u202f5\u20137 and row\u202f6\u202fcol\u202f5\u20137) are set to 9.\n\nResulting grid:\n\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6",

The task is to describe the *types* of objects present, not to get into any rules about *how* they're arranged. I need to be general, not specific to each individual grid, and only use the numeric codes for the colors. No inferred relationships between the grids. And the output has to be text first, followed by a specific `<objects_summary>`. Got it.\n\nSo, first thing, I see a dominant background.  It's consistently filled with color `7`. That's the foundation.  Then, there are these rectangular shapes \u2013 hollow loops \u2013 always color `6`. They're like frames or boundaries.  Inside these frames, and sometimes standing alone, there's a distinct pattern I keep seeing:  a 3x3 block where the center pixel is color `2`, and the surrounding eight pixels are usually color `3`.  I'm going to call that the \"core\" pattern.  That `2` in the middle is like an eye or something, and the `3` surrounding it really stands out.\n\nThen there's this other element, the color `9`.  It's all over the place.  Sometimes it's just scattered individual pixels, or maybe small clusters.  Other times, it fills in a whole rectangular area, usually where I'd expect that `3/2` core pattern to be.  It seems flexible - it's either random noise or it replaces the \"inner\" parts of the structure.\n\nSo my object types are: the background (color `7`), the frames (color `6`), the core pattern (`2` center, `3` ring, usually in a 3x3), and the \"variable\" color `9` elements.\n\nHere's the final output:\nThe grids primarily contain a background field of color 7. Distinct geometric structures appear against this background.\nOne major object type is a hollow rectangular frame or boundary constructed from color 6. These frames vary in size and position.\nInside these frames, or sometimes appearing independently, is a composite square object, typically 3x3 in size. This composite object frequently features a central single pixel of color 2, surrounded by a ring of pixels of color 3.\nAnother object type consists of pixels of color 9. These appear in two forms: as scattered, isolated pixels or small clusters distributed across the color 7 background, and occasionally as a solid fill within the color 6 frames (replacing the color 3/2 pattern).\n\n<objects_summary>\n1.

This serves as the canvas upon which all other objects are placed.\n\n**Frames**\nA primary structural object is the hollow rectangular frame made of color 6. These frames form closed loops of varying dimensions. They often delineate an interior space from the exterior background.\n\n**Composite Squares**\nLocated frequently within the color 6 frames, or occasionally isolated on the background, are 3x3 composite square objects. These objects generally exhibit a specific concentric pattern:\n*   **Center:** A single pixel of color 2 sits at the geometric center.\n*   **Surround:** A ring of 8 pixels surrounds the center. This ring is most commonly composed of color 3. However, in some instances, pixels of color 9 are integrated into or adjacent to this formation.\n\n**Scattered and Fill Elements**\nPixels of color 9 act as a variable element within the grids. They appear in two distinct ways:\n1.  **Scattered:** As single pixels or small irregular clusters (\"noise\") distributed randomly across the color 7 background or near the frames.\n2.  **Fill:** As solid rectangular blocks or patches, sometimes filling the interior of the color 6 frames.\n\n<objects_summary>\n1.

                "response": "**The Grid Transformation Challenge**\n\nOkay, so the challenge is to understand what's happening when a grid puzzle changes.  I need to figure out the rules of these transformations. It seems like I'm dealing with elements like a background, a frame, a central object (the \"core\"), and some noise \u2013 stray pixels of a specific color.\n\nI've been going through some examples, and it looks like a particular \"noise\" color (9) is key. The goal is to move those 9s onto the central core object (a 3x3 block).  The key is to track how these 9s are \"collected\" by the core, and understand what makes a 9 \"eligible\" to move and how the core is modified based on this collection. It's like a game of catch with some rules.\n\nHere's my current thinking on the rules:\n\n*   **Eligibility is crucial**: Not all 9s move.  Only those connected to the core area somehow are part of the transformation. The key element in eligibility is a frame (often a color 6, like a wall) that defines regions, where a connection to the Core can be established if a path to it is not interrupted.\n*   **The sink**: The Core is the target. The Core can \"absorb\" 9s.\n*   **Distance matters**: The core has a capacity of 9 pixels. Only up to 9 closest eligible 9s are selected to move.\n*   **Filling the Core**: The core fills with 9s in a specific order (reading order), starting from the top-left corner.\n*   **The transformation itself**:\n    1.  **Find the path**: Identify all 9 pixels in the grid that have a path (connected by non-frame pixels) to the central 3x3 Core.\n    2.  **Move the 9s**: Count these \"eligible\" 9s. Change their color to the background color (7).\n    3.  **Core fills**: Convert the first $N$ pixels (in row-major order) of the 3x3 core to 9, where $N$ is the number of eligible 9s from step 2 (cap at 9 if more).\n\nNow, I need to test this hypothesis on that Test Input and make a prediction. I'll need to work through it carefully, and see if I'm correct!\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the examples and the test input, the transformations follow a specific logic involving reachability and filling a container.\n\n**Identified Transformations:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Sink (Core):** The central 3x3 object, typically composed of color 3 pixels with a color 2 pixel in the center, acts as a \"Sink\" or container. It has a capacity of 9 pixels.\n2.  **Identify Accessible Sources:** Pixels of color 9 scattered across the grid are potential sources. A color 9 pixel is \"accessible\" if there exists an orthogonal path (moving up, down, left, or right) from that pixel to the Sink (the 3x3 area) consisting of non-blocking pixels.\n    *   **Blocking Pixels:** The frame (color 6) acts as a wall or barrier. Paths cannot pass through color 6.\n    *   **Path:** The path can traverse background pixels (color 7) and other color 9 pixels.\n3.  **Prioritize Sources:** If there are more accessible color 9 pixels than the Sink's capacity (9), they are prioritized by their shortest-path distance to the Sink (closest first).\n4.  **Move to Sink:** The accessible color 9 pixels (up to a maximum of 9) are \"moved\" to the Sink.\n    *   **Source Removal:** The original positions of these moved color 9 pixels are changed to the background color 7.\n    *   **Sink Filling:** The Sink (the 3x3 Core) is filled with color 9 pixels. The filling order is reading order: row by row, from left to right.\n        *   Example: If 2 pixels move, the top-left (0,0) and top-middle (0,1) of the 3x3 Core become 9. The rest remain their original color (3 or 2).\n        *   The central pixel (originally 2) is treated as the 5th pixel in the sequence and is overwritten if 5 or more pixels move.\n5.  **Unchanged Elements:**\n    *   Color 9 pixels that are completely blocked off from the Sink by color 6 walls remain unchanged.\n    *   Accessible color 9 pixels in excess of the Sink's capacity (if any, as seen in Example 2 where furthest accessible ones might stay if closest ones fill the sink) remain unchanged.\n    *   The color 6 frames and color 7 background (except where 9s were removed) remain unchanged.\n\n<transformation_summary>\n1.

The 3x3 core of 3s (with center 2) is transformed based on nearby 9s\n2. When 9s are directly aligned with the core center (same row/column), the entire core becomes 9s (including center 2)\n3. When 9s are diagonal to the core, cells fill with 9s from the opposite corner, count matching consumed 9s\n4. Without a 6-frame: count all 9s and fill that many core cells in reading order (skipping center)\n5. 9s within the 6-frame boundaries are removed after transformation\n6. 9s completely outside the frame structure typically remain unchanged\n7. The background color 7 and frame color 6 remain unchanged except where 9s are consumed\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Task Strategy: ARC Grid Transformation**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this ARC problem where I have to transform input grids into output grids. It seems pretty straightforward on the surface, with these grids having a consistent structure: an orange background, a green-centered red 3x3 block (the \"Core\"), sometimes magenta \"Frames,\" and maroon \"Markers.\" My goal is to figure out the rules for the transformation.\n\nAfter looking at a few examples, a few key things stand out. The Core often gets changed. These scattered markers are also changed in the output. The Frame and background colors mostly stay put. But the 9's *inside* the 6-structure are key to this.\n\nI've laid out the rules that describe the transformations provided by the task:\n\n1.  **Core:** Defined as the central 3x3 green block with a red center.\n2.  **Aligned 9s:** If a marker (9) is directly above, below, to the left, or right of the Core's center, the whole Core becomes 9s.\n3.  **Diagonal 9s**: If a marker (9) is located *diagonally* to the Core, the Core is filled from the \"opposite corner\", as defined in the examples.\n4.  **No Frame:** If there's no surrounding frame, you count all the 9s in the entire grid and use them to change the Core cells in reading order (skipping the center).\n5.  **Removal:** Any 9s found inside the Frame (the enclosing 6-structure) are removed/changed to background color.\n6.  **Outside 9s:** Any markers that are located outside the defined 6-structure will remain.\n\nNow, I'm going to carefully analyze the provided examples, especially focusing on how the markers are positioned relative to the Core and Frame.\n\n**Example 1**\n\nIn Example 1, I see this complex structure, there are two 6-structures. There are some 9s scattered around, but the ones *inside* this \"lower\" structure seem to be crucial. In this example, just *two* 9s were *consumed* by the lower frame. Using the prompt's Rule 3,  I'm now counting the 9s that are found within the defined 6-structure.  The markers in this structure are SE, and following the prompt's Rule 3 - this means the first cells of the Core (NW) will change. The transformation does not involve the center.\n\n**Example 2**\n\nExample 2 is interesting because the whole core turned into 9s. Following the Alignment rule, since the 9s are *vertically* aligned with the core's center, the *entire* Core becomes 9s, including the center! This confirms that alignment trumps the more general \"partial fill\" rule. The aligned 9s are consumed/removed.\n\n**Example 3**\n\nThis one has *no* Frame. Here, I'm using the \"No Frame\" rule. It's simply a matter of counting all 9s in the grid, removing them, and then filling those many Core cells in reading order, *skipping the center*.\n\nI've now gotten a handle on the rules.\n\nBased on the example analysis I now have this workflow:\n\n1.  **Identify Frame**: Find the connected structure made of 6s that surrounds or is adjacent to the Core. The whole grid is treated as the Frame if no 6s are present.\n2.  **Identify Markers**: Find all the 9s *within* the \"inside\" area defined by the Frame (or the whole grid if no frame exists).\n3.  **Check Alignment**: Are any of these markers in the *same row or column* as the Core's center?\n    *   **Yes**: Core Transformation = **Full**: The *entire* Core becomes 9s.\n    *   **No**: Core Transformation = **Count**: Count the number of markers (9s) within the defined Frame structure (if any). Let *N* be this number. Change the first N cells of the Core in reading order, *skipping the center*, to 9s.\n4.  **Clean Up**: Change all markers identified as being *inside* the Frame (or whole grid in a no-frame situation) to the background color 7. Markers outside the Frame are left unchanged.\n\nI think I've got this. Let's see if this logic holds true.\n\nI have to carefully apply these rules to the *Test Input*.\n\n**Test Input**\n\nAnalyzing this input, I notice this one has a defined, closed-off Frame (the big box of 6s on the edges). Within this box, I find\n\nThe transformation logic is based on the interaction between a central \"core\" (3x3 block), a \"frame\" (magenta 6s), and \"markers\" (maroon 9s).\n\n**1. Identify Objects:**\n*   **Core**: A 3x3 block centered at `(5,5)` containing green (3) and a red center (2). In the input, it spans rows 4-6 and columns 4-6.\n*   **Frame**: A structure of magenta (6) cells enclosing a central region. In the test input, the outer boundary of the frame is defined by row 1 (top), row 9 (bottom), column 1 (left), and column 9 (right).\n*   **Markers (Inside)**: Maroon (9) cells located within the frame's boundaries. In the test input, the markers at `(2,2)`, `(2,8)`, `(8,2)`, `(8,5)`, and `(8,8)` are inside this frame.\n*   **Markers (Outside)**: Maroon (9) cells outside the frame (e.g., at row 0, column 0, column 10). These remain unchanged.\n\n**2. Determine Transformation Rule:**\n*   Check for **Alignment**: Are any *inside* markers in the same row or column as the Core's center `(5,5)`?\n    *   The marker at `(8,5)` is in column 5, which is aligned with the center `(5,5)`.\n*   **Rule Application**: According to the problem description, if aligned markers exist, the **entire core** is transformed into maroon 9s (including the center).\n    *   If there were no alignment, we would count the markers and fill the core partially. Here, alignment triggers the full fill.\n\n**3. Apply Transformation:**\n*   **Core**: Change cells `(4,4)` through `(6,6)` to 9s.\n*   **Inside Markers**: Remove all markers identified as being inside the frame (change them to background color 7).\n    *   ` (2,2) -> 7`\n    *   ` (2,8) -> 7`\n    *   ` (8,2) -> 7`\n    *   ` (8,5) -> 7`\n    *   ` (8,8) -> 7`\n*   **Outside Markers**: Preserve them as 9.\n*   **Background/Frame**: Preserve as 7/6.\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\n*   **Row 2**: Input `9,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,7` becomes `9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7` (Inside 9s at col 2 and 8 removed).\n*   **Row 4**: Input `...3,3,3...` (Core) becomes `...9,9,9...`.\n*   **Row 5**: Input `...3,2,3...` (Core) becomes `...9,9,9...`.\n*   **Row 6**: Input `...3,3,3...` (Core) becomes `...9,9,9...`.\n*   **Row 8**: Input `7,6,9,7,7,9,7,7,9,6,7` becomes `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7` (Inside 9s at col 2, 5, 8 removed).\n*   Other rows remain unchanged or only retain outside 9s.\n\noutput:\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6",

The 3x3 core of 3s (with center 2) is transformed based on nearby 9s\n2. When 9s are directly aligned with the core center (same row/column), the entire core becomes 9s (including center 2)\n3. When 9s are diagonal to the core, cells fill with 9s from the opposite corner, count matching consumed 9s\n4. Without a 6-frame: count all 9s and fill that many core cells in reading order (skipping center)\n5. 9s within the 6-frame boundaries are removed after transformation\n6. 9s completely outside the frame structure typically remain unchanged\n7. The background color 7 and frame color 6 remain unchanged except where 9s are consumed\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to:\n1. Identify the 3x3 core with center 2\n2. Find the frame structure (6s)\n3. Locate all 9s and determine their relationship to the core and frame\n4. Apply the transformation rules\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n\nThe 3x3 core (3s with center 2) is at rows 4-6, columns 4-6:\n```\n3,3,3\n3,2,3\n3,3,3\n```\nThe center is at position (5,5).\n\nThe 6s form a rectangular frame with:\n- Outer boundaries at column 1 (left), column 9 (right), row 1 (top), row 9 (bottom)\n- Inner structure around the core at columns 3 and 7\n\n**Identifying 9s:**\n- Outside frame: (0,2), (0,8), (2,0), (3,10), (5,10), (7,10)\n- Inside frame: (2,2), (2,8), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8)\n\n**Checking alignment:**\n- (8,5) is at column 5, which is the same column as the center - this is **vertically aligned**\n- No 9s at row 5 inside the frame (only (5,10) which is outside)\n\nSince there is an aligned 9 at (8,5) inside the frame, **rule 2 applies**: the entire core becomes 9s.\n\n**Applying transformation:**\n1. All core cells (rows 4-6, cols 4-6) become 9s\n2. All 9s inside the frame are removed: (2,2), (2,8), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8)\n3. 9s outside the frame remain unchanged: (0,2), (0,8), (2,0), (3,10), (5,10), (7,10)\n\n**Constructing output:**\n- Row 0: unchanged (9s at positions 2,8 remain)\n- Row 2: 9 at position 0 remains, 9s at 2,8 removed\n- Rows 4-6: core becomes 9,9,9\n- Row 5: 9 at position 10 remains (outside frame)\n- Rows 3,7: 9 at position 10 remains\n- Row 8: all 9s removed (inside frame)\n\n```\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n```",

The 3x3 core of 3s (with center 2) is transformed based on nearby 9s\n2. When 9s are directly aligned with the core center (same row/column), the entire core becomes 9s (including center 2)\n3. When 9s are diagonal to the core, cells fill with 9s from the opposite corner, count matching consumed 9s\n4. Without a 6-frame: count all 9s and fill that many core cells in reading order (skipping center)\n5. 9s within the 6-frame boundaries are removed after transformation\n6. 9s completely outside the frame structure typically remain unchanged\n7. The background color 7 and frame color 6 remain unchanged except where 9s are consumed\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "First, I\u2019ll describe the transformation rule I inferred and then apply it to the test grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Interpreting the rule from the examples\n\nAcross all three examples, there is always:\n\n- A **3\u00d73 core** of color 3 with a color 2 in the center.\n- Optionally, a surrounding **frame of 6s** near that core.\n- Several **9s** scattered elsewhere.\n\nFrom the description plus the examples, the behavior of the 3\u00d73 core is:\n\n1. **Locate the core**: find the 3\u00d73 pattern\n\n   ```\n   3 3 3\n   3 2 3\n   3 3 3\n   ```\n\n2. **Check for a 6-frame**: if 6s are arranged around this 3\u00d73 block (as in Examples 1, 2, and the test), we are in the \u201cwith frame\u201d case.\n\n3. **Classify how 9s relate to the core**:\n\n   - **Case A: Aligned 9s (Example 2)**  \n     If there is at least one 9 on the **same row or the same column** as the center of the core *and* a 6-frame exists, then:\n     - **The entire 3\u00d73 core becomes 9**, including the center 2 \u2192 9, and all surrounding 3s \u2192 9.\n\n   - **Case B: Diagonal 9s (Example 1)**  \n     If there is a 6-frame but **no** 9 sharing the center\u2019s row/column, the behavior is different: some of the 3s in the core are turned into 9s, from the corner opposite to a nearby 9 cluster, and some corresponding external 9s are removed. (We don\u2019t need this case for the test input.)\n\n   - **Case C: No 6-frame (Example 3)**  \n     Count all 9s in the grid, remove them, and then fill that many non-center cells of the 3\u00d73 core with 9s in reading order (top-left to bottom-right, skipping the center). The center 2 remains 2.\n\n4. **About 9s elsewhere**:\n\n   - 9s that participate in the transformation (near the core, \u201cwithin the frame structure\u201d) may be removed.\n   - 9s \u201cfar\u201d from the frame or core generally stay where they are.\n   - In the **test grid**, crucially, there are **no 9s immediately adjacent to or inside** the 6-frame region around the 3\u00d73 core, so after classifying the case, we don\u2019t need to delete any external 9s to match the described behavior.\n\nFor solving the test, we only need **Case A**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying the rule to the test input\n\n### 2.1. Locate the 3\u00d73 core\n\nTest input (with rows numbered 1\u201311, columns 1\u201311):\n\nRow5: `7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7`  \nRow6: `7,6,7,7,3,2,3,7,7,6,9`  \nRow7: `7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7`\n\nSo the 3\u00d73 core is at **rows 5\u20137, columns 5\u20137**:\n\n```\n(5,5) (5,6) (5,7)   3 3 3\n(6,5) (6,6) (6,7)   3 2 3\n(7,5) (7,6) (7,7)   3 3 3\n```\n\n### 2.2. Check for 6-frame\n\nAround this core we see 6s forming a frame-like structure:\n\n- Row4 columns 4\u20135 and 7\u20138 have 6s.\n- Row5 columns 4 and 8 are 6.\n- Row7 columns 4 and 8 are 6.\n- Row8 columns 4\u20135 and 7\u20138 are 6.\n\nSo we are in the **\u201cwith 6-frame\u201d** scenario.\n\n### 2.3. Check for aligned 9s\n\nThe center of the core is at (6,6).\n\nLook for 9s sharing this row or column:\n\n- Same row (row 6): there is a 9 at **(6,11)**.\n- Same column (column 6): there is a 9 at **(9,6)**.\n\nSo there **are** 9s directly aligned with the core center in row and column.\n\nTherefore, this is **Case A (aligned 9s with 6-frame)** \u2192 **entire 3\u00d73 core becomes 9s**.\n\n### 2.4. Effect on other 9s\n\nWe now check whether there are any 9s **inside** the immediate 6-frame around the core (the 5\u00d75 window rows 4\u20138, columns 4\u20138):\n\nSubgrid rows 4\u20138, cols 4\u20138:\n\nRow4: `6,6,7,6,6`  \nRow5: `6,3,3,3,6`  \nRow6: `7,3,2,3,7`  \nRow7: `6,3,3,3,6`  \nRow8: `6,6,7,6,6`\n\nThese contain only 6, 7, 3, and 2 \u2014 **no 9s**.  \n\nSo by the given description (\u201c9s within the 6-frame boundaries are removed\u201d but \u201c9s completely outside the frame structure typically remain unchanged\u201d), in this test there are **no 9s that need to be deleted**: all existing 9s lie outside that local frame region.\n\nThus, the only change for the test grid is: **all nine cells of the 3\u00d73 core become 9**.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Constructing the output grid\n\nStarting from the input and replacing the 3\u00d73 core at rows 5\u20137, cols 5\u20137 by 9s:\n\n- Row5: `7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7` \u2192 `7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7`\n- Row6: `7,6,7,7,3,2,3,7,7,6,9` \u2192 `7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9`\n- Row7: `7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7` \u2192 `7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7`\n\nAll other rows remain exactly as in the input.\n\nSo the final output grid is:\n\nRow1: `6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6`  \nRow2: `6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6`  \nRow3: `9,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,7`  \nRow4: `7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9`  \nRow5: `7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7`  \nRow6: `7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9`  \nRow7: `7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7`  \nRow8: `7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9`  \nRow9: `7,6,9,7,7,9,7,7,9,6,7`  \nRow10:`7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6`  \nRow11:`7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6`\n\n---\n\n### Final output grid\n\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n9,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,7  \n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9  \n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7  \n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9  \n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7  \n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9  \n7,6,9,7,7,9,7,7,9,6,7  \n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6",

The 3x3 core of 3s (with center 2) is transformed based on nearby 9s\n2. When 9s are directly aligned with the core center (same row/column), the entire core becomes 9s (including center 2)\n3. When 9s are diagonal to the core, cells fill with 9s from the opposite corner, count matching consumed 9s\n4. Without a 6-frame: count all 9s and fill that many core cells in reading order (skipping center)\n5. 9s within the 6-frame boundaries are removed after transformation\n6. 9s completely outside the frame structure typically remain unchanged\n7. The background color 7 and frame color 6 remain unchanged except where 9s are consumed\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "To solve the task, I first looked at the three solved examples to identify the rules. In each case the small \\(3\\times 3\\) block of colour\u202f3 with a 2 in the centre was the target of the change. Colour\u202f6 acts as a wall or frame: I treat all 6\u2011cells as obstacles that partition the grid. I find the connected component of non\u20116 cells that contains the core. Only 9s in this component are \u201cavailable\u201d to move; 9s in other components (for example, separated by a complete row or column of 6s) are left alone and act as fixed markers.\n\nFrom the available 9s, I count how many there are. If there is an unobstructed 9 in the same row or column as the core centre within this component, the centre cell is eligible to be filled; otherwise it stays 2. I lay out the potential fill positions of the core in row\u2011major order (top left across and then down), including the centre if it is eligible. I take as many positions from this list as there are available 9s, and set those core cells to 9. The original available 9s are consumed and turned into background 7; cells outside the core\u2019s component remain unchanged.\n\nIn the test grid, the row of all 6s at row\u202f2 and the full column of 6s at column\u202f10 split the grid into components. The core\u2019s component contains six 9s at (3,1), (3,3), (3,9), (9,3), (9,6) and (9,9). There is a clear 9 in the same column as the centre at (9,6), so the centre is included. Using the six available 9s, I fill the first six core positions in row\u2011major order, and turn those six original 9s into 7. The rest of the grid stays the same.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6",

When 9s are diagonal to the core, cells fill with 9s from the opposite corner, count matching consumed 9s\n4. Without a 6-frame: count all 9s and fill that many core cells in reading order (skipping center)\n5. 9s within the 6-frame boundaries are removed after transformation\n6. 9s completely outside the frame structure typically remain unchanged\n7. The background color 7 and frame color 6 remain unchanged except where 9s are consumed\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
