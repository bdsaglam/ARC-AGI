            "Full raw LLM response": "**Okay, here's my breakdown of how I'd approach this ARC task.**\n\nThe goal is to analyze a series of examples and build a rule-based system to predict the output of the task.  My process will involve exploring the given examples, identifying patterns, formulating hypotheses, and then testing those hypotheses against the examples to create a generalized rule.  I'll start by analyzing the structure and content of the input grids. I'll identify distinct objects/shapes and examine how they map to the outputs.  Key areas of focus will be \"hollow\" shapes and their filling, and the \"noise block\" that seems to contain key information.\n\nInitially, I'll trace through a set of examples. I'll compare inputs and outputs for changes. I will focus on which parts of the input are filled with new colors in the output. I'll then examine the relationships between the shapes and the noise block - for color references. I will attempt to identify the logic that links these elements.\nSpecifically, I'll pay attention to any geometric properties, like shapes, sizes, and their relative positions.\nI'll also keep track of what stays the same.\n\nThe primary hypothesis I'm currently working with is that \"Hollow shapes are filled, and the fill color comes from a related source.\"\nI have noticed a tendency for interior 0s to transform into another color. I'm exploring whether there's a specific pattern for the source of that fill color and why some containers are filled and others aren't.\n\nOne early idea is that there's a \"key/legend\" or something similar.  I think the noise block might be playing this role.\nI will examine its relation to filled and unchanged shapes. I will evaluate the noise block, and see if the position and/or neighboring colours determine which color is used for filling.\nThe second, related hypothesis is that maybe color is mapped based on the orientation of the shape to the noise block (right, below, etc.). The rule, I will seek, might involve mapping the key color's neighbor in a legend (the noise block).\n\nI'll check the hypothesis with additional examples to see whether it holds, and refine or discard it based on results.\nThe core of the logic may be based on shapes in general.\n\nI will formulate a rule based on what I observe, i.e., whether the dimensions of the noise block matter, or some sort of mapping function exists. This will also have to consider cases with non-square shapes, like the Green \"C-shape.\"\nIn these cases, there is a question of whether all input shapes act the same.\n\nIn summary: I'm dissecting the problem, trying to construct a model that would accurately predict the output. This model will build upon analyzing input and output shape colors and positions and mapping relationships.\n\n\nThe solution involves identifying a \"legend\" or \"key\" block within the grid that dictates how to fill the hollow \"container\" shapes.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** The grid contains several hollow shapes (containers) of specific colors and a distinct rectangular block of diverse colors (the \"noise block\" or \"legend\").\n    *   In the test input, the containers are:\n        *   Orange (1) shape at top-left.\n        *   Green (3) shape at top-right.\n        *   Red (2) diamond at bottom-left.\n        *   Grey (5) blob at middle-right.\n    *   The legend block is at the bottom-left, consisting of a 5x2 area:\n        Row 11: `5, 4, 6, 7, 8`\n        Row 12: `9, 8, 3, 1, 2`\n\n2.  **Determine Transformation Rule:** By analyzing the solved examples, we deduce the rule for interpreting the legend block based on its dimensions:\n    *   **Wide or Square Legend (Width $\\ge$ Height):** The mapping is **Vertical (Top Row $\\to$ Bottom Row)**. The colors in the top row are the \"Keys\", and the colors directly below them are the \"Values\".\n    *   **Tall Legend (Height > Width):** The mapping is **Horizontal (Left Column $\\to$ Right Column)**.\n\n    *Verification with Examples:*\n    *   *Example 1 (Wide Legend):* Key 4 (Top) maps to Value 6 (Bottom). The Yellow (4) container is filled with 6. Key 3 maps to 3. The Green (3) container is filled with 3. Key 7 is in the bottom row (not a Top Key), so the Orange (7) container is not filled.\n    *   *Example 2 (Tall Legend):* Key 4 (Left) maps to Value 5 (Right). The Yellow (4) container is filled with 5. Key 8 maps to 1. The Teal (8) container is filled with 1.\n    *   *Example 3 (Square Legend):* Key 2 (Top) maps to Value 7 (Bottom). The Red (2) container is filled with 7.\n\n3.  **Apply to Test Input:**\n    *   The legend is 5x2 (Wide), so we use the **Vertical (Top $\\to$ Bottom)** rule.\n    *   **Keys (Top Row):** 5, 4, 6, 7, 8\n    *   **Values (Bottom Row):** 9, 8, 3, 1, 2\n    *   **Mappings:**\n        *   `5 -> 9`\n        *   `4 -> 8`\n        *   `6 -> 3`\n        *   `7 -> 1`\n        *   `8 -> 2`\n\n4.  **Execute Fills:**\n    *   **Orange (1) Container:** Color 1 is in the bottom row of the legend, not the top. It is not a Key. -> **Unchanged.**\n    *   **Green (3) Container:** Color 3 is in the bottom row. Not a Key. -> **Unchanged.**\n    *   **Red (2) Container:** Color 2 is in the bottom row. Not a Key. -> **Unchanged.**\n    *   **Grey (5) Container:** Color 5 is in the top row. It is a Key. Its value is 9. -> **Fill with 9.**\n\n    The Grey (5) container is located roughly at rows 5-8, columns 7-12. Its interior 0s are at `(6,8), (6,9), (6,10)` and `(7,8), (7,9), (7,10), (7,11)`. These cells become 9. All other cells remain unchanged.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,5,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,9,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to identify:\n1. A \"legend\" or key that maps shape colors to fill colors\n2. Shapes with holes that may need filling\n\n**Analyzing the Examples:**\n\nIn each example, there's a small 2-row (or 2-column) grid that serves as a color mapping legend:\n- Example 1: Legend at top-right (2\u00d75), read by columns: (3\u21923), (4\u21926), (6\u21927), (9\u21922), (5\u21929)\n- Example 2: Legend at top-left (4\u00d72), read by rows: (2\u21926), (4\u21925), (6\u21928), (8\u21921)  \n- Example 3: Legend at top-left (2\u00d72), read by columns: (2\u21927), (6\u21921)\n\nThe transformation rule: For shapes whose border color appears as a \"key\" in the legend, fill interior holes with the corresponding mapped color. Filling occurs both row-wise and column-wise (between pairs of boundary cells).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\nThe legend is at rows 11-12, cols 0-4:\n```\n5,4,6,7,8\n9,8,3,1,2\n```\n\nReading by columns: (5\u21929), (4\u21928), (6\u21923), (7\u21921), (8\u21922)\n\nShape colors that get filled: 5, 4, 6, 7, 8\n\nLooking at shapes in the grid:\n- **1-shape** (rows 0-3): Color 1 NOT in legend \u2192 unchanged\n- **3-shape** (rows 0-3): Color 3 NOT in legend \u2192 unchanged  \n- **5-shape** (rows 5-9): Color 5 IS in legend \u2192 fill holes with 9\n- **2-patterns**: Color 2 NOT in legend \u2192 unchanged\n\n**Filling the 5-shape:**\n- Row 6: 5 at cols 7 and 11 \u2192 fill cols 8,9,10 with 9\n- Row 7: 5 at cols 7 and 12 \u2192 fill cols 8,9,10,11 with 9\n- Column-wise fills confirm the same cells\n\n```\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,5,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,9,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**My approach to solving this ARC task involves a deep dive into the patterns of color transformation within the provided examples and test input.**  I start by examining the provided grid, noting the shapes, their colors, and any \"key blocks\" that stand out as unusual or non-uniform in their color distribution. My initial thought process revolves around identifying shapes with \"holes\" or unfilled interiors and attempting to correlate their filling with nearby colored blocks.\n\nI begin by dissecting the first example, and look at several test cases and examples. I meticulously analyze the color data row by row, keeping a keen eye for relationships between the colors in the key block and the colors appearing in the hollow shapes.  I quickly see a relationship between the \"key block\" and the modifications applied to shapes with holes or interiors. I then realize I am looking for a mapping, perhaps from one row or column of the block to another.\n\nFrom this analysis, I formulate a hypothesis: **the key block acts as a mapping key, where colors from one side of the block are transformed into colors on the opposite side of the block, and the shapes which are impacted are those that are of the color appearing on the key**. The dimension of the key block is essential to determine the mapping direction (row to row or column to column). I start to generalize my finding. I check for edge-proximity. If the block has a row or column touching a grid edge, that side is the input side. I confirm this with several examples. The rule is consistent across cases.\n\n**Ultimately, I generalize the process to define a concrete procedure for solving the task:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Block:** This block stands out as a rectangular group of non-zero pixel colors.\n2.  **Determine Mapping Orientation:** The key block has dimensions that give us clues to a mapping direction.\n3.  **Find the Source:** This side of the block is closest to the grid boundary and will define the input values for the map.\n4.  **Define Mapping Rule:**  Determine the mapping based on the key, where a color in the Source side maps to the corresponding color in the opposite Target.\n5.  **Apply Transformation:** Examine any hollow shape in the grid. If its border color is a Source color, then fill that shapes holes with the corresponding target color.\n6.  **Immutable Key block:** The key block itself never changes.\n\nTo test my theory, I applied it to the provided test input.  After considering all of the shapes, I carefully traced the pixels in the input, and then began working through the transformations as per the defined mapping rules.  The most important step is to be rigorous in testing the logic of applying the mappings to all appropriate shapes within the grid. This allows me to predict the output grid.\nI then meticulously build the output, verifying that each pixel is in the correct color.  I reviewed the key block, confirming that it's left unchanged in the final output. The procedure works for every part of the test case, which solidifies the rule.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on a set of solved examples. Let's analyze the underlying logic.\n\n**1. Object Decomposition and Pattern Identification:**\nIn all examples, we can identify two distinct types of objects:\n*   **Hollow Shapes:** These are closed loops or frames of a single color enclosing empty space (0s).\n*   **Key Block:** This is a solid, rectangular block of non-zero numbers that is usually multicolored and distinct from the hollow shapes. It acts as a \"legend\" or \"cipher\" for the transformation.\n\n**2. Deciphering the Key Block Rule:**\nThe Key Block defines a mapping between colors. The transformation involves filling the interior of the hollow shapes with a new color determined by this mapping.\n*   **Structure:** The Key Block is always a rectangle of size $2 \\times L$ or $L \\times 2$.\n*   **Directionality:** The mapping relates one vector of colors (Source) to the parallel vector (Target).\n    *   **Source:** The row or column of the Key Block that is closest to the outer boundary of the grid (the \"edge\" side).\n    *   **Target:** The adjacent inner row or column.\n    *   The mapping is element-wise: The $n$-th element of the Source vector maps to the $n$-th element of the Target vector.\n*   **Application:** For each hollow shape, we check if its border color exists in the Source vector. If it does, we fill the shape's interior (the 0s) with the corresponding color from the Target vector. If the color is not in the Source, the shape remains unchanged.\n\n**3. verifying with Examples:**\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Key Block: $2 \\times 5$ at Top Right.\n    *   Edge: Top Row (Row 0). Source = Row 0, Target = Row 1.\n    *   Mapping (partial): Color 4 is in Source, maps to 6 (Target). Color 3 is in Source, maps to 3. Color 7 is not in Source (it's in Target, but not Source).\n    *   Result: Yellow (4) shape filled with 6. Green (3) shape filled with 3. Orange (7) shape unchanged. Matches example.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Key Block: $4 \\times 2$ at Top Left.\n    *   Edge: Left Column (Col 0). Source = Col 0, Target = Col 1.\n    *   Mapping (partial): Color 8 is in Source, maps to 1. Color 4 is in Source, maps to 5. Color 5 is not in Source.\n    *   Result: Teal (8) shape filled with 1. Yellow (4) shape filled with 5. Grey (5) shape unchanged. Matches example.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Key Block: $2 \\times 2$ at Top Left.\n    *   Edge: Top Row (Row 0). Source = Row 0, Target = Row 1.\n    *   Mapping: 2 (Source) $\\to$ 7 (Target).\n    *   Result: Red (2) shape filled with 7. Matches example.\n\n**4. Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Identify Key Block:** A $2 \\times 5$ block located at the **Bottom Left** (Rows 11-12, Cols 0-4).\n    *   Row 11: `5, 4, 6, 7, 8`\n    *   Row 12: `9, 8, 3, 1, 2`\n*   **Determine Mapping:**\n    *   The block is at the bottom edge. Thus, **Row 12** is the Source (closest to boundary) and **Row 11** is the Target.\n    *   Mapping Pairs (Source $\\to$ Target):\n        *   $9 \\to 5$\n        *   $8 \\to 4$\n        *   $3 \\to 6$\n        *   $1 \\to 7$\n        *   $2 \\to 8$\n*   **Apply to Shapes:**\n    *   **Blue Shape (Color 1):** Located at Top Left. Color 1 is in Source. Maps to **7**. Fill interior with 7.\n    *   **Green Shape (Color 3):** Located at Top Right. Color 3 is in Source. Maps to **6**. Fill interior with 6.\n    *   **Red Shape (Color 2):** Two instances (one diamond at middle-left, one at bottom-right). Color 2 is in Source. Maps to **8**. Fill interiors with 8.\n    *   **Grey Shape (Color 5):** Located at Middle Right. Color 5 is **not** in Source (it is in Target, but that doesn't count). Shape remains unchanged.\n\n**Final Transformation:**\nWe fill the holes of the Blue shape with 7, the Green shape with 6, and the Red shapes with 8. The Grey shape and the Key Block itself remain as they are.\n\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,7,7,7,1,0,0,3,6,6,3,0\n0,1,1,7,7,1,0,0,3,6,6,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n0,2,8,2,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,8,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "The transformation uses a \"legend\" of color mappings and then fills enclosed holes inside regions of certain colors according to that legend.\n\nIn each training example, there is a small 2\u00d7N or N\u00d72 rectangle of non-zero cells that never changes; this is the legend. Each column (for 2\u00d7N) or row (for N\u00d72) gives a pair: source color \u2192 target color. Then, elsewhere in the grid, any 4-connected region of zeros that is completely enclosed by a single color `c` is filled with the mapped color `f(c)` if `c` appears as a source in the legend. Regions enclosed by colors that are not sources in the legend are left unchanged.\n\nFor the test grid:\n\n- The legend is the 2\u00d75 block at rows 12\u201313, columns 1\u20135:\n\n  - 5\u21929  \n  - 4\u21928  \n  - 6\u21923  \n  - 7\u21921  \n  - 8\u21922  \n\n- We look for holes (zero regions fully surrounded by a single color) outside this legend.\n- The only such hole whose border color is in the legend is the central zero cluster inside the 5-shaped region in rows 7\u20138, columns 9\u201312. This zero region is surrounded by 5s, and since 5\u21929, all those enclosed zeros are changed to 9.\n- Other holes (inside the 1-region and the 3-frame at the top) are enclosed by colors 1 and 3, which are not sources in the legend, so they remain zero.\n\nApplying this gives the following output grid:\n\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,5,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,9,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0",

For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

            "Full raw LLM response": "The transformation is driven by \u201clegend\u201d pixels placed on the grid\u2019s border. A single coloured cell on the outermost row or column, separate from the main shape, pairs with its inward neighbour to define a fill colour for that legend\u2019s colour. For bottom\u2011edge legends the inward neighbour is directly above; for top\u2011edge legends it is directly below; for left or right legends it is to the right or left respectively. For any other component of the same colour, each row is examined: between the leftmost and rightmost cells of that component in that row, any zeros are replaced with the legend\u2019s fill colour. Components without a border legend are left unchanged.\n\nIn the test grid, colour\u202f1 has a bottom\u2011edge legend at (12,3) with a 7 above, so its fill colour is 7. Colour\u202f3 has a bottom\u2011edge legend at (12,2) with a 6 above, so its fill colour is 6. Applying the row\u2011wise fill to the corresponding top shapes yields the final result below; other colours either lack suitable legends or have no horizontal gaps to fill and thus remain unchanged.\n\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,7,7,7,1,0,0,3,6,6,3,0\n0,1,1,7,7,1,0,0,3,6,6,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, here's what I'm thinking:** I'm given an ARC task with three examples, and my goal is to figure out the underlying transformation rule.  I need to generalize from these specific cases.\n\n**Observations & Initial Hypothesis:** I'm seeing rectangular \"palettes\" in these examples, alongside other shapes (frames, enclosures). My immediate guess is that the palette is key \u2013 it somehow defines a mapping between colors.  Let's see:\n\n*   **Example 1:** I see a 12x12 grid. I identify a palette at the top right, a yellow frame, a green enclosure, and an orange frame. The palette's colors seem to be linked to how the frames and enclosures are filled or not filled. For instance, the yellow frame's holes turn magenta, and this magenta (color 6) seems related to the palette. Let's see if there is any mapping there.\n*   **Example 2:** I immediately see a different palette structure: It's a 4x2 block at the top left. The other shapes are a cyan frame, a gray C-shape, and a yellow frame. The cyan frame fills with a blue, a yellow frame fills with gray and the gray shape remains unchanged. The colors in these shapes seem to map in a particular way to the palette as well.\n*   **Example 3:** 2x2 palette, yellow frame (unchanged), red frame filled with orange.\n\n**Unraveling the Palette's Role:** I'm starting to think the palettes are defining some kind of colour mapping. In the examples, there's a strong correlation between colors in the palette and colors that fill shapes. Example 2's palette makes it easier to understand. The rule seems to be: if the shape's color is on the left column (key), then fill the shape with the color on the right (value). The examples show a \"key-value\" system embedded within this palette structure.\n\n**Formalizing the Rule:** I'm honing in on a rule.\n\n*   **Locate Palette:** Find the compact rectangle of colors. Usually it's not a frame, but a solid block.\n*   **Orientation:** If the palette is a tall (H > W), then left-to-right is the mapping. Else if its wide, the mapping is top to bottom.\n*   **Mapping:** If a shape has color C and if C is a 'Key' colour of the palette, fill the inside with the corresponding 'Value'.\n\n**Applying the Rule to the Test Input:**\n\nI start by applying my rule to the provided test input. The palette is on the bottom left, shaped as a wide rectangle, the horizontal dimension being the one. My mappings are: 5->9, 4->8, 6->3, 7->1, 8->2.\n\nThen, for each shape, I check its color against the palette's keys. I find the shape made of color 5. This shape's color is in the keys, and thus it must be filled by 9.\n\nSo, finally, the shape has the 0s pixels inside it, and a color 5. These 0s should become a 9.\n\n**Final checks:**\n\nI confirm that this is consistent. I am now confident about the solution.\n\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on a pattern observed in the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** The grids contain two types of objects:\n    *   **Shapes/Enclosures:** These are frames or outlines made of a single color enclosing a region of empty space (0s).\n    *   **Palette/Key:** This is a solid rectangular block of non-zero pixels. It acts as a lookup table or legend for coloring the shapes.\n\n2.  **Determine the Palette Mapping Rule:**\n    *   The palette defines a mapping from a \"Shape Color\" to a \"Fill Color\".\n    *   The orientation of the mapping depends on the dimensions of the palette.\n        *   **Vertical Mapping (Top -> Bottom):** If the palette's width is greater than or equal to its height (Width $\\ge$ Height), the first row contains the keys (Shape Colors) and the second row contains the corresponding values (Fill Colors).\n            *   *Example 1:* Palette is $2 \\times 5$. Mapping is Top Row $\\to$ Bottom Row. (e.g., Color 4 is above Color 6 $\\to$ Yellow shape fills with Magenta).\n            *   *Example 3:* Palette is $2 \\times 2$. Mapping is Top Row $\\to$ Bottom Row. (e.g., Color 2 is above Color 7 $\\to$ Red shape fills with Orange).\n        *   **Horizontal Mapping (Left -> Right):** If the palette's height is greater than its width (Height $>$ Width), the first column contains the keys and the second column contains the values.\n            *   *Example 2:* Palette is $4 \\times 2$. Mapping is Left Column $\\to$ Right Column. (e.g., Color 8 is left of Color 1 $\\to$ Cyan shape fills with Blue).\n\n3.  **Apply Transformation:**\n    *   Identify all frame-like shapes in the grid.\n    *   For each shape, check its color.\n    *   Look up this color in the **Keys** of the palette (Top Row for vertical mapping, Left Column for horizontal).\n    *   If the color is found, fill the empty interior (0s) of the shape with the corresponding **Value** color from the palette.\n    *   If the color is not found in the Keys, the shape remains unchanged.\n    *   The palette itself remains unchanged.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Locate Palette:** There is a solid block of pixels in the bottom-left corner (Rows 11-12, Columns 0-4).\n    *   Row 11: `5, 4, 6, 7, 8`\n    *   Row 12: `9, 8, 3, 1, 2`\n    *   Dimensions: Height = 2, Width = 5.\n    *   Since Width $\\ge$ Height, we use **Vertical Mapping** (Top $\\to$ Bottom).\n\n2.  **Define Mapping:**\n    *   5 $\\to$ 9\n    *   4 $\\to$ 8\n    *   6 $\\to$ 3\n    *   7 $\\to$ 1\n    *   8 $\\to$ 2\n    *   **Keys (colors to fill):** 5, 4, 6, 7, 8.\n\n3.  **Process Shapes:**\n    *   **Blue Shape (Color 1):** Located at Top Left. Color 1 is NOT in the Keys. -> **No Change.**\n    *   **Green Shape (Color 3):** Located at Top Right. Color 3 is NOT in the Keys. -> **No Change.**\n    *   **Red Shape (Color 2):** Two diamond shapes at Middle/Bottom. Color 2 is NOT in the Keys. -> **No Change.**\n    *   **Gray Shape (Color 5):** Located at Middle Right (Rows 5-9, Cols 7-12). Color 5 **IS** a Key. The corresponding Value is **9** (Maroon). -> **Fill Interior with 9.**\n\n4.  **Execute Fill on Gray Shape:**\n    *   The shape is defined by Gray (5) pixels. We fill the enclosed 0s with 9.\n    *   Based on the grid analysis:\n        *   Row 6: Zeros at indices 8, 9, 10 are enclosed by 5s at 7 and 11. Replace with 9.\n        *   Row 7: Zeros at indices 8, 9, 10, 11 are enclosed by 5s at 7 and 12. Replace with 9.\n        *   Other rows do not have enclosed zeros.\n\n**Constructed Output:**\n\nThe output grid is identical to the input grid, except for the specific 0s inside the Gray shape which turn into 9s.\n\ninput:\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0  <- Fill 0s at 8,9,10 with 9\n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5  <- Fill 0s at 8,9,10,11 with 9\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n\noutput:\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,5,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,9,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**The task at hand is an ARC problem involving grids with shapes and a color key.**  My initial thoughts are that I need to identify the shapes, understand how the color \"key\" works, and then apply that knowledge to fill the shapes.  I'm seeing a pattern where empty space inside outlines gets filled with a specific color, but which color depends on the key.\n\nThe key seems to be a block of colors, but its orientation (horizontal or vertical, number of rows/columns) matters.  I've noticed that for the key, if its height is 2, the colors should map according to columns, top color mapped with bottom color.\nIf the key has a width of 2, the colours are mapped according to rows, where the colors map the left color to the right color.\n\nExample 1 taught me to carefully examine the key and how shapes are filled (or not).  I realized the color to fill a shape with can be derived from the corresponding color in the key, if the shape color is present in the key. Some shapes don't get filled at all and this seems determined by the source color of shapes vs key.\n\nExample 2 showed me a more compact palette arrangement: a 4x2 block (key) instead of a standalone block. I found, based on the grid shape and the arrangement of key colors, the rule to figure out the map: when a shape color is adjacent to the left or top color of the key, that shape is filled by the adjacent color.\n\nIn Example 3, the key appeared embedded within the grid. I confirmed the logic by carefully analyzing the shape colors and the key's position. This confirmed the key is defined by vertical pairs (top-to-bottom) for the fill-in process.\n\nAnalyzing the Test Input, I identified a 2-row, 5-column key.  I found that shapes could only be filled if the color of the shape was found in the top row. The key's organization suggests a Top-to-Bottom mapping, where source colors are on top and fill colors are on the bottom, in columns. Shapes corresponding to source colors will be filled with fill colors, and other shapes will not be filled. If not, if the color of a shape is not found in the key's first (source) row, the shape remains empty.  The key is always a Top-to-Bottom source color to fill color map. The colors in the source row correspond to the shape colors. If any shape colors were not in the top row, they were not filled, thus confirming the source to fill mapping.  This explains why some shapes remained unfilled in the examples and the Test Input. Based on this logic, I determined only the Gray shape (5) should be filled with Maroon (9), while all other shapes (Blue, Green, Red) remain unchanged. I traced all the coordinates and the output is confirmed to fill the Gray shape only with Maroon.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the rule for filling the hollow shapes in the grid based on the provided \"key\" or \"palette\" block, and then apply this rule to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key:** In each example, there is a distinct rectangular block of pixels that acts as a lookup table (key).\n    *   Example 1: A 2x5 block.\n    *   Example 2: A 4x2 block.\n    *   Example 3: A 2x2 block.\n\n2.  **Determine Key Orientation:** The orientation of the mapping depends on the dimensions of the key.\n    *   If the key is wider than it is tall (or if Height=2 and Width!=2), the mapping is **vertical** (Top Row $\\to$ Bottom Row). The columns represent pairs.\n    *   If the key is taller than it is wide (or if Width=2 and Height!=2), the mapping is **horizontal** (Left Column $\\to$ Right Column). The rows represent pairs.\n    *   Example 3 (2x2) follows the vertical mapping (Top $\\to$ Bottom), consistent with the logic for Example 1.\n\n3.  **Determine the Mapping Rule:**\n    *   The mapping defines: **Input Color $\\to$ Fill Color**.\n    *   We look for the color of the hollow shape in the **Input side** of the key (Top Row for vertical keys, Left Column for horizontal keys).\n    *   If the shape's color is found in the Input side, we fill the shape's empty interior with the corresponding color from the **Output side** (Bottom Row or Right Column).\n    *   If the shape's color is **not** found in the Input side, the shape is **not filled** (remains 0).\n\n    *Verification with Example 1 (Key: 2x5):*\n    *   Top Row (Input): 3, 4, 6, 9, 5.\n    *   Bottom Row (Output): 3, 6, 7, 2, 9.\n    *   Shapes present: Green (3), Yellow (4), Orange (7).\n    *   Green (3) is in Top Row. Map to 3. Result: Green shape filled with Green. (Matches).\n    *   Yellow (4) is in Top Row. Map to 6. Result: Yellow shape filled with Magenta. (Matches).\n    *   Orange (7) is *not* in Top Row. Result: Orange shape not filled. (Matches).\n\n    *Verification with Example 2 (Key: 4x2):*\n    *   Left Col (Input): 2, 4, 6, 8.\n    *   Right Col (Output): 6, 5, 8, 1.\n    *   Shapes present: Yellow (4), Teal (8), Gray (5).\n    *   Yellow (4) is in Left Col. Map to 5. Result: Filled with Gray. (Matches).\n    *   Teal (8) is in Left Col. Map to 1. Result: Filled with Blue. (Matches).\n    *   Gray (5) is *not* in Left Col. Result: Not filled. (Matches).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Key:** The key is the block at the bottom-left, spanning rows 11-12 and columns 0-4.\n    *   Row 11: `5, 4, 6, 7, 8`\n    *   Row 12: `9, 8, 3, 1, 2`\n\n2.  **Determine Orientation:** The key is 2x5 (Height 2, Width 5). This follows the vertical mapping rule (Top $\\to$ Bottom).\n\n3.  **Apply Mapping:**\n    *   **Source (Top Row):** 5, 4, 6, 7, 8.\n    *   **Target (Bottom Row):** 9, 8, 3, 1, 2.\n    *   **Shapes in Grid:**\n        *   Blue (1)\n        *   Green (3)\n        *   Gray (5)\n        *   Red (2)\n\n    *   **Check Shapes against Source:**\n        *   **Gray (5):** Found in Source (Top Row). Corresponding Target is **9**. -> **Fill Gray shape with 9.**\n        *   **Blue (1):** Not in Source. -> Do not fill.\n        *   **Green (3):** Not in Source. -> Do not fill.\n        *   **Red (2):** Not in Source. -> Do not fill.\n\n4.  **Execution:** We locate the Gray (5) shape in the grid (rows 5-9) and fill its enclosed empty pixels (0) with Maroon (9). All other pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**Output Grid Generation:**\nThe Gray shape encloses pixels at (6,8), (6,9), (6,10) and (7,8), (7,9), (7,10), (7,11). These become 9.\n\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,5,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,9,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1. Each input contains a \"legend\" (a small 2-row grid of colors) that maps shape colors to fill colors\n2. The legend has keys (top row) and values (bottom row)  \n3. For shapes whose border color appears as a KEY in the legend, the interior holes get filled with the corresponding VALUE color\n4. Shapes whose color doesn't appear as a key remain unchanged\n\n**Examining the Examples:**\n\n- Example 1: Legend maps 3\u21923, 4\u21926, etc. The 4s rectangle gets holes filled with 6; the 3s rectangle gets holes filled with 3\n- Example 2: Legend maps 4\u21925, 8\u21921, etc. The 8s rectangle fills with 1; the 4s rectangle fills with 5\n- Example 3: Legend maps 2\u21927, 6\u21921. The 2s rectangle fills with 7\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\nThe legend is at rows 11-12, columns 0-4:\n```\n5,4,6,7,8  (keys)\n9,8,3,1,2  (values)\n```\n\nMapping: 5\u21929, 4\u21928, 6\u21923, 7\u21921, 8\u21922\n\n**Shapes in the input:**\n- 1s shape (top-left): 1 is NOT a key \u2192 stays unchanged\n- 3s shape (top-right): 3 is NOT a key \u2192 stays unchanged  \n- 5s shape (middle-right): 5 IS a key \u2192 fill interior with 9\n\n**Finding the 5s shape interior:**\nThe 5s form an irregular closed region. The enclosed cells (surrounded by 5s in all cardinal directions) are:\n- Row 6: columns 8, 9, 10\n- Row 7: columns 8, 9, 10, 11\n\nThese get filled with 9.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,5,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,9,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Find the \u201clegend\u201d (color\u2011mapping board).**  \n   In each training example there is a small rectangular area that is only 2 cells thick:\n   - Example 1: a 2\u00d75 block at the top right.\n   - Example 2: a 4\u00d72 block at the top left.\n   - Example 3: a 2\u00d73 block at the top left.\n\n   In these boards, each *pair* of cells along the thin dimension encodes a mapping:\n   - The cell that is nearer to the global top\u2011left corner (row 0 or column 0) is the **source (frame) color**.\n   - The paired cell (farther from the top\u2011left) is the **fill color**.\n\n   For example:\n   - Example 1 board (2\u00d75, read by columns):  \n     3\u21923, 4\u21926, 6\u21927, 9\u21922, 5\u21929.\n   - Example 2 board (4\u00d72, read by rows):  \n     2\u21926, 4\u21925, 6\u21928, 8\u21921.\n   - Example 3 board (2\u00d73, by columns):  \n     2\u21927, 6\u21921, 0\u21920.\n\n2. **Effect of the mapping.**  \n   For every connected component of a **source color**:\n   - Take its axis\u2011aligned bounding box.\n   - Look at cells with value 0 inside that box that are *fully enclosed* by that component (i.e. 0\u2011cells not 4\u2011connected to any 0 on the boundary of the box).\n   - Recolor those enclosed 0\u2011cells with the corresponding **fill color** from the board.\n\n   This exactly explains:\n   - Example 1:  \n     - Color 4 frame\u2019s interior zeros become 6 (4\u21926).  \n     - Color 3 shape\u2019s enclosed zeros become 3 (3\u21923).  \n     - The 7\u2011shape is not in the mapping, so its holes stay 0.\n   - Example 2:  \n     - Color 8 ring\u2019s interior zeros become 1 (8\u21921).  \n     - Color 4 frame in the 4\u2011region gets interior zeros filled with 5 (4\u21925).  \n     - The big color\u20115 object has holes but 5 is not a source color, so it is untouched.\n   - Example 3:  \n     - Color 2 ring gets its two interior zeros filled with 7 (2\u21927).  \n     - Color 4 ring is not in the mapping\u2019s source set, so its holes remain.\n\n3. **Locate the board in the test input.**  \n   At the bottom\u2011left of the test grid, rows 11\u201312 and columns 0\u20134 form a 2\u00d75, non\u2011zero patch:\n\n   Row 11: 5,4,6,7,8  \n   Row 12: 9,8,3,1,2  \n\n   This is a horizontal board like in Examples 1 and 3.  \n   The row closer to the top\u2011left (row 11) is the **source**; row 12 is the **fill** row.\n\n   So the mappings are:\n   - 5 \u2192 9  \n   - 4 \u2192 8  \n   - 6 \u2192 3  \n   - 7 \u2192 1  \n   - 8 \u2192 2  \n\n4. **Find components of source colors outside the board.**\n\n   Source colors: {5,4,6,7,8}.\n\n   Outside the 2\u00d75 board at the bottom-left:\n   - Color 4, 6, 7, 8 appear only inside the board.\n   - Color 5 appears in the middle/bottom area (rows 5\u20139, columns around 7\u201312).\n\n   Decompose color\u20115 pixels into connected components (4\u2011connectivity):\n\n   - Component A: row 5, columns 8\u201310 (a 1\u00d73 bar).\n   - Component B: (6,7) and (7,7) (vertical 2\u00d71).\n   - Component C: single cell (6,11).\n   - Component D/E: a cluster forming an L/\u2510 shape around rows 7\u20139, cols 8\u201312.\n\n   For each component, take its bounding box and check for interior zeros:\n   - A: 1\u00d73 bar; no interior cells \u21d2 no holes.\n   - B: 2\u00d71 column; no interior cells \u21d2 no holes.\n   - C: 1\u00d71; no interior.\n   - D/E: bounding box rows 7\u20139, cols 8\u201312 gives:\n\n     ```\n     r7: 0 0 0 0 5\n     r8: 5 5 5 5 5\n     r9: 5 0 0 0 0\n     ```\n\n     All zeros lie on the boundary rows/columns of this box; there are **no interior 0\u2011cells** that are completely surrounded by that single connected component. Hence no holes according to the rule used in the examples.\n\n   Thus, **no connected 5\u2011component has enclosed 0\u2011cells**.\n\n5. **Apply the rule.**  \n   Since none of the source\u2011color components (5,4,6,7,8) outside the board contain enclosed zeros, there is nothing to recolor. The mapping board itself is never modified in the examples, so it stays as is.\n\n   Therefore the **output equals the input grid**.\n\n---\n\n**Output grid**\n\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0  \n0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0  \n0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0  \n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0  \n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0  \n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5  \n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0  \n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0  \n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Identify the \u201cpalette\u201d block**\n\n   In every training example there is a small rectangular block that:\n   - is made only of non\u2011zero colors,\n   - is a 2\u00d7N or N\u00d72 rectangle,\n   - does not change from input to output.  \n\n   This block acts as a color\u2011mapping legend.\n\n   - Example 1: palette is rows 1\u20132, cols 9\u201312 \u2192 a 2\u00d74 block.\n   - Example 2: palette is rows 1\u20134, cols 1\u20132 \u2192 a 4\u00d72 block.\n   - Example 3: palette is rows 1\u20132, cols 2\u20133 \u2192 a 2\u00d72 block.\n\n   In the **test** grid the only 2\u00d7N / N\u00d72 all\u2011non\u2011zero block is at rows 12\u201313, cols 1\u20135:\n\n   ```\n   5 4 6 7 8\n   9 8 3 1 2\n   ```\n\n   So that is the palette.\n\n2. **Derive the mapping from the palette**\n\n   From the solved examples we can infer how to turn the palette into a mapping:\n\n   - If the palette is **wider than tall** (2\u00d7N), use **vertical** pairs:\n     map (top cell) \u2192 (bottom cell) for each column.\n   - If the palette is **taller than wide** (N\u00d72), use **horizontal** pairs:\n     map (left cell) \u2192 (right cell) for each row.\n\n   Checking:\n   - Example 1 (2\u00d74, wide): columns give mappings  \n     4\u21926, 6\u21927, 9\u21922, 5\u21929.  \n     Only 4 is used as a frame color, giving 4\u21926, which matches the filled 6s.\n   - Example 2 (4\u00d72, tall): rows give mappings  \n     2\u21926, 4\u21925, 6\u21928, 8\u21921.   \n     Frames are 8 and 4, mapping to 1 and 5, exactly as in the outputs.\n   - Example 3 (2\u00d72, wide): columns give  \n     2\u21927, 6\u21921.  \n     Frame color is 2, mapped to 7, matching the filled 7s.\n\n   For the **test palette** (2\u00d75, wide) we therefore take column\u2011wise (top\u2192bottom) mappings:\n\n   - 5 \u2192 9\n   - 4 \u2192 8\n   - 6 \u2192 3\n   - 7 \u2192 1\n   - 8 \u2192 2\n\n   These are the only colors that can act as \u201cframe colors\u201d in rule 3.\n\n3. **Which shapes are affected?**\n\n   From the examples, the rule is:\n\n   - Find connected components of a single color that form an **axis\u2011aligned rectangular frame** (a solid border of that color, with one or more interior cells that are 0 and completely enclosed).\n   - If the border color `c` is a **source color in the palette mapping**, recolor **all interior 0 cells** of that frame to the mapped color `f(c)`.\n\n   (Separately, in Example 1 color 3 is not present in the palette at all; gaps between 3s in the same row/column are filled with 3. That \u201cbridge gaps for colors absent from the palette\u201d rule never triggers for the test because every non\u2011zero color appears in the palette.)\n\n   Check this matches training:\n\n   - Example 1:\n     - 4\u2011frame at top left \u2192 frame color 4, mapping 4\u21926, so interior zeros become 6.\n     - 7\u2011frame exists, but 7 is not a mapping **source** (only 6\u21927), so it is untouched.\n     - Color 3 is not in palette; its internal gaps are bridged with 3s (separate rule).\n   - Example 2:\n     - 8\u2011frame \u2192 8\u21921 \u2192 interior 1s.\n     - 4\u2011frame \u2192 4\u21925 \u2192 interior 5s.\n     - No other rectangular frames with mapped colors, so nothing else changes.\n   - Example 3:\n     - 2\u2011frame \u2192 2\u21927 \u2192 interior 7s.\n     - No other qualifying frames.\n\n4. **Apply to the test grid**\n\n   Palette mapping: {5\u21929, 4\u21928, 6\u21923, 7\u21921, 8\u21922}.\n\n   Now scan the test grid for **rectangular frames** whose border color is one of {5,4,6,7,8} and that are **not** the palette itself.\n\n   - The only 4s, 6s, 7s, 8s outside the palette do **not** exist; those colors appear only in the palette block.\n   - The 5s outside the palette form an irregular \u201ccross / cluster\u201d in the lower\u2011right region (rows 6\u201310, cols 8\u201313). That cluster does **not** have a single rectangular border enclosing only zeros inside; its pattern is open and asymmetric. So it is **not** a rectangular frame in the sense used in training.\n\n   Therefore, there is **no rectangular frame** in the test grid whose border color is mapped by the palette.\n\n   Colors 1,2,3 are **targets** (bottom row of palette) but not sources, so they never act as frame colors in rule 3. Also, since every non\u2011zero color appears somewhere in the palette, the \u201cbridge gaps for colors absent from the palette\u201d rule never applies.\n\n   Consequently, **no cells satisfy the conditions to change**, so the transformation is the identity map for this test.\n\n5. **Result**\n\n   The output grid is identical to the input grid.\n\n---\n\n**Output grid**\n\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0  \n0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0  \n0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0  \n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0  \n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0  \n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5  \n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0  \n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0  \n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "The three worked examples all contain a little \u201cpalette\u201d block of coloured squares that is a solid rectangle of non\u2011zero values with one side of length 2. You read this palette as a set of colour\u2011to\u2011colour mappings: if the palette is taller than it is wide you transpose it, otherwise you use it as is. The first row (or left column, after transposing) supplies the outline colours (keys) and the second row (or right column) supplies the fill colours (values).\n\nYou then look at each connected component of cells whose colour is one of the keys. If that component is a hollow outline with internal 0\u2011valued holes, you leave the border unchanged and replace the 0s that are completely enclosed by that component with the mapped fill colour. Components of colours not in the palette, or components with no enclosed holes, are left untouched. The palette block itself is not modified.\n\nIn the test grid the only full, solid rectangle of non\u2011zeros is the 2\u00d75 block in the bottom left, giving the mapping 5\u21929,\u202f4\u21928,\u202f6\u21923,\u202f7\u21921,\u202f8\u21922. None of the components of these colours outside the palette form closed outlines with internal holes, and the hollow outlines at the top are of colours not in the key set. Therefore no cells need to be changed and the output is identical to the input.\n\nThe completed output grid is:\n```\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "After studying the three worked examples it becomes clear that each puzzle consists of two parts: a \u201clegend\u201d block of solid colour sitting off to one side, and one or more hollow shapes elsewhere. The legend is the only completely filled rectangle of non\u2011zero cells with one side exactly two cells long. If the legend is two rows high (as in examples 1 and 3), its columns define source\u2192target mappings from the top row to the bottom row. If the legend is two columns wide (as in example\u00a02), its rows define the mappings from the left column to the right column. For every connected hollow shape whose colour appears as a source in the legend, you fill the enclosed zero holes with the corresponding target colour. Shapes whose colour is not mapped, or mapped colours with no enclosed holes, are left unchanged; the legend itself is left untouched.\n\nIn the test grid the only fully filled 2\u2011row rectangle is at rows\u00a012\u201313, columns\u00a01\u20135. This yields the vertical mappings 5\u21929, 4\u21928, 6\u21923, 7\u21921 and 8\u21922. The only non\u2011legend components of those colours are the scattered 5\u2011components, none of which form a closed loop with any enclosed holes. The hollow shapes present (colours\u00a01 and\u00a03) are not in the mapping. Therefore nothing is filled and the output matches the input.\n\nThe completed output grid is:\n\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task Solution Strategy**\n\nAlright, let's break down this ARC problem. The goal is to transform an input grid into an output grid based on a set of examples and a test case.  I'm focusing on identifying the underlying logic or algorithm.\n\n**Identifying the Key:**  The core seems to revolve around a \"Key,\" which acts as a map or lookup table.  The initial hint points to a multi-colored block within each example. This block isn't just decoration, it's central to the transformations. The task becomes pinpointing the key's role and structure.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n*   **Example 1:** This is the initial \"Key\" block, distinct colors, and shapes. The pattern is a lookup table, and the multi-colored block becomes the \"Key.\"   Analyzing various shapes and the holes.  \"Lookup Table\" hypothesis starts to take shape. The keys have two rows, top is the border color, bottom row is the fill color.\n*   **Example 2:** In Example 2, the \"Key\" is at the Top Left. This helps cement the 2-row table structure, with a left-to-right (horizontal) read for pairs, suggesting that a portrait key should map top to bottom.\n*   **Example 3:** In Example 3, it's a square key but also a 2x2.   \"Lookup Table\" structure has really taken shape.\n\n**Hypothesis Formulation:** The \"Key\" represents a 2-column table.  The border color maps to fill color.  Dimensions matter, as the mapping is relative to the key structure, i.e., vertical or horizontal key mapping.\n\n*   Key format: The longer dimension (height or width) is the list of rules. If key has more rows (vertically longer), it is vertical pair (columnwise mapping) from top to bottom. If key has more columns (horizontally longer), the mapping from left to right.\n*   Shape transformation: Look at the border color, finds the corresponding color based on the key, and then use that corresponding color to fill enclosed black holes, i.e., replace zeros inside a specific shape with that fill color.\n\n**Test Input application and Verification:** I then moved on to the test input. Identified the \"Key\", and proceeded with shape-by-shape fill analysis. The enclosed hole concept remains the core transformation step. Confirmed logic consistency across the examples.\n\n**The output grid is constructed, based on the above rule.**\n\n\nThe problem asks us to fill enclosed \"black holes\" (0s) within colored shapes. The fill color is determined by a \"Key\" or \"Map\" present in the grid.\n\n**Solution Logic:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key:**\n    *   Locate the distinct multi-colored rectangular block in the grid that stands apart from the outlined shapes.\n    *   In the Test Input, this is the 2x5 block in the bottom-left corner (Rows 11-12, Cols 0-4).\n    *   The block contents are:\n        Row 11: `5, 4, 6, 7, 8`\n        Row 12: `9, 8, 3, 1, 2`\n\n2.  **Decode the Key:**\n    *   Based on the solved examples, the Key acts as a lookup table defining a mapping from **Border Color** to **Fill Color**.\n    *   The orientation of the mapping depends on the Key's dimensions.\n        *   If the Key is wider than it is tall (like in Example 1 and the Test Input), the mapping is column-wise: The **Top Row** contains the Border Colors, and the **Bottom Row** contains the corresponding Fill Colors.\n        *   (If the Key were taller than wide, as in Example 2, the mapping would be row-wise: Left Column = Border, Right Column = Fill).\n    *   For the Test Input (Key is 2x5, wider than tall), the mapping is:\n        *   `5` -> `9`\n        *   `4` -> `8`\n        *   `6` -> `3`\n        *   `7` -> `1`\n        *   `8` -> `2`\n\n3.  **Apply Transformation to Shapes:**\n    *   Identify each shape in the grid and its border color.\n    *   **Shape 1 (Top Left):** Blue rectangular frame. Border color is **1**.\n        *   Check Key Top Row (`5, 4, 6, 7, 8`): **1** is not present.\n        *   Action: Do not fill.\n    *   **Shape 2 (Top Right):** Green rectangular frame. Border color is **3**.\n        *   Check Key Top Row: **3** is not present.\n        *   Action: Do not fill.\n    *   **Shape 3 (Middle Right):** Grey irregular shape. Border color is **5**.\n        *   Check Key Top Row: **5** is present (1st column).\n        *   Corresponding Fill Color (Bottom Row): **9**.\n        *   Action: Fill the enclosed holes inside the Grey shape with **9**.\n    *   **Shape 4 (Bottom/Middle):** Red diamond-like shapes. Border color is **2**.\n        *   Check Key Top Row: **2** is not present.\n        *   Action: Do not fill.\n\n4.  **Execute the Fill:**\n    *   The Grey shape (color 5) is located roughly at rows 5-9, columns 7-12.\n    *   The enclosed holes (0s) are located at:\n        *   Row 6: Columns 8, 9, 10.\n        *   Row 7: Columns 8, 9, 10, 11.\n    *   Change these specific 0s to 9s. All other cells remain unchanged.\n\n**Completed Output Grid:**\n\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,5,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,9,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment and Hypothesis Generation:**\n\nMy task is to solve an ARC problem based on examples and a test input. I need to figure out the transformation logic. I've noticed the inputs are grids with shapes, some containing \"holes\" (cells with value 0). There seem to be hints about a multi-colored block (\"Key\"), enclosed holes, and a fill logic that uses the Key. My initial guess is that the Key somehow provides a mapping for filling those holes.\n\n**Example Analysis and Refinement of the Key Concept:**\n\nLet's verify this hypothesis with the examples. Examining Example 1, I see different colored shapes, some with holes, and a \"Key\" block, which I've identified.  The Key appears to be a 2x5 block of colors at the top-right.  By looking at Example 2, the key is the 4x2 block at top left. The hint mentions projecting the Key onto the grid.  In Example 1, the Key values don't seem to correlate spatially. After carefully examining Example 2, and the hints, I'm starting to think the Key defines pairs of `(Border Color, Fill Color)`. The examples show that it fills holes *not* based on surrounding colors but based on the Key. I believe the Key determines the border color, which is then filled with a second color associated with that border in the key.  Now, the examples are also revealing the relationship between shape dimensions (width and height), and if we need to map horizontally or vertically.\n\n**Hypothesis Refinement and Rules:**\n\nMy current hypothesis is that the Key defines pairs of border colors and fill colors. The key shape dimensions are either vertical or horizontal, depending on the Key.  In more specific terms, for a shape with holes, I'll find its color (e.g., 4) in the key and fill the holes with the color adjacent to it.  If the shape color isn't in the key, I default to filling with 0.\n\n**Test Input Analysis and Confirmation/Rejection of Hypothesis:**\n\nNow, let's look at the Test Input. It's a 13x13 grid with several shapes.  The \"Key\" is at the bottom left. The shape colors in the grid don't perfectly align with the spatial distribution or adjacent colors within the key block, throwing out that aspect of projection.  After analyzing the example behavior, this problem seems to depend on the Key's dimensions - how to interpret it.  It looks like Wide keys use vertical pairs, and Tall Keys use horizontal pairs.  I will apply my lookup-table logic and see what emerges.  My key rule now seems to be: 1. Find the Key. 2. Horizontal (Tall) or Vertical (Wide)? 3. Identify Border Shape, fill the Holes with Color on the Right for Tall or Bottom for Wide keys.  If the shape color is not present in the Key, fill with 0.  \n\nWhen applying this to the Test Input, only the grey shape color 5 is present in the top row of the Key, and I have found the pairs. Thus the holes in the Grey (color 5) shape get filled with 9, per the vertical pairing I identified. The holes in the other shapes remain 0.\n\n**Final Solution and Reasoning:**\n\nMy final conclusion is that the core logic is not the spatial hint about the Key scaling or overlaying the image. I believe the Key is a lookup table of *pairs* (top row, bottom row) or (left, right). Wide Keys use vertical pairs; Tall keys, horizontal pairs. The problem is a specific pattern matching problem.  The test input has the 2x5 Key at the bottom-left of the grid.  Holes of 1, 2, 3 don't map so they fill with 0. The holes of Grey (5) fill with the mapped pair, which is 9. This aligns perfectly with the examples.\n\n\nTo solve this task, we must identify the \"Key\" or \"Map\" block in the grid, decode its logic, and use it to fill the enclosed \"holes\" (black cells, 0) within the colored shapes.\n\n**Analysis of the Rules from Examples:**\n1.  **Identify the Key:** The Key is a rectangular block of multicolored pixels, distinct from the shapes.\n    *   In Example 1, it's a 2x5 block at the top-right.\n    *   In Example 2, it's a 4x2 block at the top-left.\n    *   In Example 3, it's a 2x2 block at the top-left.\n    *   In the Test Input, there is a 2x5 block at the bottom-left (Rows 11-12, Cols 0-4).\n\n2.  **Determine Mapping Direction:** The dimensions of the Key determine how pairs are formed (Border Color -> Fill Color).\n    *   **Wide Key (Width > Height):** Vertical pairing. The top pixel is the Border Color, and the pixel directly below it is the Fill Color. (Seen in Example 1).\n    *   **Tall Key (Height > Width):** Horizontal pairing. The left pixel is the Border Color, and the pixel to its right is the Fill Color. (Seen in Example 2).\n    *   **Square Key (Height = Width):** Vertical pairing. (Seen in Example 3, verified by 2->7).\n\n3.  **Apply Mapping:**\n    *   Identify shapes with enclosed holes.\n    *   Find the shape's border color in the \"Key\" position (Top row for Vertical, Left col for Horizontal).\n    *   Fill the holes with the corresponding \"Value\" color (Bottom row for Vertical, Right col for Horizontal).\n    *   If the shape's border color is not found in the Key position, the holes are filled with 0 (or remain 0), as seen with Shape 7 in Ex 1 and Shape 5 in Ex 2.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n1.  **Key Identification:** The block is at the bottom-left:\n    Row 11: `5, 4, 6, 7, 8`\n    Row 12: `9, 8, 3, 1, 2`\n    Dimensions: 2 rows, 5 columns. This is a **Wide Key**.\n\n2.  **Mapping Logic (Vertical):**\n    *   5 -> 9\n    *   4 -> 8\n    *   6 -> 3\n    *   7 -> 1\n    *   8 -> 2\n\n3.  **Shape Processing:**\n    *   **Blue Shape (Color 1):** Located at Top-Left. Holes at (1,2-4), (2,3-4).\n        *   Check Key: Is 1 in the Top Row `5, 4, 6, 7, 8`? No.\n        *   Action: Fill with 0 (No change).\n    *   **Green Shape (Color 3):** Located at Top-Right. Holes at (1,9-10), (2,9-10).\n        *   Check Key: Is 3 in the Top Row? No.\n        *   Action: Fill with 0 (No change).\n    *   **Red Shape (Color 2):** Located at Middle/Bottom. Holes at (7,2), (11,10).\n        *   Check Key: Is 2 in the Top Row? No.\n        *   Action: Fill with 0 (No change).\n    *   **Grey Shape (Color 5):** Located at Middle-Right. Enclosed holes at (6,8), (6,9), (6,10) and (7,8), (7,9), (7,10), (7,11).\n        *   Check Key: Is 5 in the Top Row? Yes, first column. Mapping is 5 -> 9.\n        *   Action: Fill holes with 9.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOnly the holes inside the Grey shape (5) are filled with Maroon (9). All other holes remain Black (0).\n\n**Constructing the Output Grid:**\nThe input grid is copied, and the pixels at `(6,8), (6,9), (6,10)` and `(7,8), (7,9), (7,10), (7,11)` are changed from 0 to 9.\n\ninput:\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n\noutput:\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,5,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,9,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "First I\u2019ll explain the rule inferred from the training examples, then apply it to the test grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the examples are doing\n\nAcross all three examples the same two ideas appear:\n\n1. There is a special small **rectangular \u201ckey\u201d block** of non\u2011zero, multi\u2011colored cells.\n2. The program **fills holes (0\u2011regions) inside some colored shapes**, and the fill color is determined from the key.\n\n### 1.1. Finding the key\n\nIn each example you can see one conspicuous rectangle of non\u2011zero, varied colors, not part of the big \u201cframe\u2011like\u201d shapes:\n\n- **Example 1**: rows 1\u20132, columns 8\u201312:\n\n  ```\n  3 4 6 9 5\n  3 6 7 2 9\n  ```\n\n  A 2\u00d75 block, all non\u2011zero, multi\u2011colored \u2192 this is the key.\n\n- **Example 2**: rows 1\u20134, columns 1\u20132:\n\n  ```\n  2 6\n  4 5\n  6 8\n  8 1\n  ```\n\n  A 4\u00d72 all\u2011non\u2011zero, multi\u2011colored rectangle \u2192 key.\n\n- **Example 3**: rows 1\u20132, columns 2\u20133:\n\n  ```\n  2 6\n  7 1\n  ```\n\n  2\u00d72, all non\u2011zero, multi\u2011colored \u2192 key.\n\nFor the **test grid**, the unique such block is at the **bottom\u2011left**, rows 12\u201313, columns 1\u20135:\n\n```\nrow12: 5 4 6 7 8\nrow13: 9 8 3 1 2\n```\n\nThis is a 2\u00d75 rectangle, all non\u2011zero, with many different colors. That is the key for the test.\n\n### 1.2. Reading the key as a color mapping\n\nThe key always has one dimension equal to 2. The mapping is taken **across that 2\u2011cell dimension**:\n\n- If the key is **2\u00d7N** (2 rows), we map **top row \u2192 bottom row per column**.\n- If the key is **N\u00d72** (2 columns), we map **left column \u2192 right column per row**.\n\nSo we always map from \u201cfirst\u201d to \u201csecond\u201d along the size\u20112 dimension.\n\n#### Example 1 (2\u00d75 key)\n\nKey:\n\n```\nTop:    3 4 6 9 5\nBottom: 3 6 7 2 9\n```\n\nMapping (top \u2192 bottom by column):\n\n- 3 \u2192 3\n- 4 \u2192 6\n- 6 \u2192 7\n- 9 \u2192 2\n- 5 \u2192 9\n\nOnly colors that appear in the **top row** are in the domain of the mapping.\n\n#### Example 2 (4\u00d72 key)\n\nKey:\n\n```\n2 6\n4 5\n6 8\n8 1\n```\n\nHere the size\u20112 dimension is **width**, so we map **left \u2192 right** for each row:\n\n- 2 \u2192 6\n- 4 \u2192 5\n- 6 \u2192 8\n- 8 \u2192 1\n\nAgain, only colors in the left column are mapped (2,4,6,8).\n\n#### Example 3 (2\u00d72 key)\n\nKey:\n\n```\nTop:    2 6\nBottom: 7 1\n```\n\nMapping:\n\n- 2 \u2192 7\n- 6 \u2192 1\n\n### 1.3. Detecting holes and deciding whether to fill them\n\nFor each **color region** (connected component of a non\u2011zero color, using 4\u2011connectivity):\n\n1. Find any connected components of 0\u2011cells that are **completely surrounded by that color**:\n   - i.e. the 0\u2011component has no 4\u2011connected path through 0s out to the exterior of that color region.\n   - These 0\u2011components are the **holes** of that colored shape.\n2. If the region\u2019s color **has a mapping in the key** (i.e. it appears on the \u201csource\u201d side of the key),\n   then every 0 in its holes is changed to the mapped color.\n3. If the region\u2019s color is **not in the domain of the key mapping**, its holes are **left as 0**.\n\nCheck against the provided examples:\n\n- **Example 1:**\n  - Key mapping: 3\u21923, 4\u21926, 6\u21927, 9\u21922, 5\u21929.\n  - The big **4\u2011rectangle** (top left) has two interior 0s; 4 is mapped to 6 \u2192 those holes become 6.\n  - The big **3\u2011blob** (middle left) has an internal 0\u2011region; 3 is mapped to 3 \u2192 those holes become 3.\n  - The **7\u2011region** (bottom right) has a clear 0\u2011hole, but 7 is **not** in the top row of the key \u2192 unmapped, hole stays 0.\n\n- **Example 2:**\n  - Key mapping: 2\u21926, 4\u21925, 6\u21928, 8\u21921.\n  - The **8\u2011rectangle** (top right) has a 2\u00d72 0\u2011hole; 8\u21921 \u2192 fill with 1.\n  - The **4\u2011rectangle** (bottom right) has two interior 0s; 4\u21925 \u2192 fill with 5.\n  - The large **5\u2011shape** (middle left) *does* have an interior 0\u2011cluster, but 5 is only on the *right* column of the key (target side), not on the left \u2192 no 5\u2192x mapping \u2192 those 0s stay 0.\n\n- **Example 3:**\n  - Key mapping: 2\u21927, 6\u21921.\n  - The right\u2011hand **2\u2011square frame** has two interior 0s; 2\u21927 \u2192 they become 7.\n  - The central **4\u2011rectangle** has an internal 0 cross, but 4 never appears in the key\u2019s top row \u2192 no mapping \u2192 holes remain 0.\n\nSo the rule is consistent: \u201conly shapes whose color is on the *source* side of the key get their holes filled, and they get filled with the corresponding target color\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying the rule to the test grid\n\n### 2.1. Identify the key and its mapping\n\nThe unique all\u2011non\u2011zero multi\u2011color rectangle is:\n\nRows 12\u201313, columns 1\u20135:\n\n```\nRow12: 5 4 6 7 8\nRow13: 9 8 3 1 2\n```\n\nThis is a 2\u00d75 key, so we map **top row \u2192 bottom row** by column:\n\n- Column 1: 5 \u2192 9\n- Column 2: 4 \u2192 8\n- Column 3: 6 \u2192 3\n- Column 4: 7 \u2192 1\n- Column 5: 8 \u2192 2\n\nSo the mapping is:\n\n\\[\nf = \\{5\\mapsto 9,\\ 4\\mapsto 8,\\ 6\\mapsto 3,\\ 7\\mapsto 1,\\ 8\\mapsto 2\\}\n\\]\n\nDomain (source colors): **{5,4,6,7,8}**.\n\nOnly shapes of those colors are eligible for hole filling.\n\n### 2.2. Locate shapes and their holes\n\nNow examine the rest of the grid.\n\n#### 2.2.1. Shapes of colors with mappings\n\nColors with mappings: 5,4,6,7,8.\n\n- **4,6,7,8** outside the key:\n\n  Looking at rows 1\u201311, none of these colors appear; they only appear inside the key block at (12,1\u20135) and (13,1\u20135).  \n  The key itself is solid (no internal 0s), so **no holes** for 4,6,7,8.\n\n- **Color 5**:\n\n  5\u2019s positions (outside the key) are:\n\n  - Row 6: columns 9,10,11\n  - Row 7: columns 8,12\n  - Row 8: columns 8,13\n  - Row 9: columns 9,10,11,12,13\n  - Row10: column 9\n\n  Grouped into 4\u2011connected components:\n\n  1. Component A: (6,9),(6,10),(6,11) \u2014 a short horizontal line.\n  2. Component B: (7,8),(8,8) \u2014 a vertical pair.\n  3. Component C: (7,12) \u2014 single cell.\n  4. Component D: (8,13),(9,9),(9,10),(9,11),(9,12),(9,13),(10,9) \u2014 the \u201c\u0393\u201d/corner shape near bottom right.\n  5. Component E: (12,1) \u2014 in the key.\n\n  For each component, we check for enclosed 0\u2011regions:\n\n  - **A (6,9\u201311)**: just a 3\u2011cell line; cannot enclose any 0 \u2192 no holes.\n  - **B (7,8 & 8,8)**: 2 cells; again no closed loop \u2192 no holes.\n  - **C (7,12)**: 1 cell \u2192 no possibility of a hole.\n  - **D (8\u201310,9\u201313)**:  \n    Bounding box rows 8\u201310, cols 9\u201313:\n\n    ```\n    r8: 0 0 0 0 5\n    r9: 5 5 5 5 5\n    r10:5 0 0 0 0\n    ```\n\n    Any 0 in this box (e.g. (8,9), (10,10), etc.) can reach the outside by a path of 0s (for example, 8,9 \u2192 7,9 \u2192 row 7\u2019s zeros, etc.), so none of these 0\u2011components is completely surrounded by 5s.  \n    \u21d2 **No interior 0\u2011component** \u2192 no holes.\n  - **E (12,1)**: one 5 inside key, no surrounding 0s.\n\n  Therefore, **no 5\u2011component contains a hole** in the sense used in the examples.\n\nSo **none** of the colors in the mapping domain (5,4,6,7,8) have any holes to fill.\n\n#### 2.2.2. Shapes of colors *without* mappings\n\nFor completeness:\n\n- **Color 1** (top\u2011left frame) and **color 3** (top\u2011right frame) both clearly form \u201crectangular frame\u201d shapes with internal 0s.  \n  Those 0\u2011regions are *holes*, but:\n  - 1 is not in {5,4,6,7,8},\n  - 3 is not in {5,4,6,7,8} (3 only appears on the key\u2019s **bottom** row).\n  So they have **no key mapping** and must be left as 0, just like:\n  - the 7\u2011block in Example 1,\n  - the large 5\u2011shape in Example 2,\n  - and the central 4\u2011block in Example 3.\n\n- There\u2019s also a little **\u201cplus\u201d of 2\u2019s** near bottom right:\n\n  Coordinates (11,11), (12,10), (12,12), (13,11), encircling a single 0 at (12,11).  \n  That 0 is a real hole inside the union of those 2s, but since **2 is not a mapped source color** (it\u2019s only on the bottom row of the key), this hole, too, stays 0.\n\nAll of these holes belong to **unmapped colors**, so according to the rule established from the examples, **they must not be filled**.\n\n### 2.3. Result for the test grid\n\nSince no shape whose color is in the key\u2019s source row has any enclosed 0\u2011regions, **no cell is changed**.\n\nSo the output grid is exactly the same as the input grid.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Below is the reasoning I actually used, so you can reconstruct what I did, followed by the final grid.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Identifying the shapes and their holes in the test input\n\nFirst I rewrote the test grid with coordinates (rows and columns 0\u2011indexed, 13\u00d713):\n\n```\nr0:  0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 3 3 3 3 0\nr1:  0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\nr2:  0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\nr3:  0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 3 3 3 3 0\nr4:  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nr5:  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0\nr6:  0 0 2 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0\nr7:  0 2 0 2 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5\nr8:  0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5\nr9:  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\nr10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\nr11: 5 4 6 7 8 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0\nr12: 9 8 3 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n```\n\nNow find *enclosed* zero-regions (holes), i.e. 0\u2011components not connected (4\u2011connected) to the outer border of the whole grid.\n\n#### 1.1. The `1`-frame at the top-left\n\nThe `1`-shape occupies rows 0\u20133, cols 1\u20135:\n\n```\nr0 c1..5: 1 1 1 1 1\nr1        1 . . . 1\nr2        1 1 . . 1\nr3        . 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nInside that frame the zeros that are fully surrounded by 1\u2019s are at:\n\n- (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)\n- (2,3), (2,4)\n\nThese five 0s form a single interior region and are holes inside the `1`-shape.\n\n#### 1.2. The `3`-frame at the top-right\n\nThe `3`-shape occupies rows 0\u20133, cols 8\u201311:\n\n```\nr0 c8..11: 3 3 3 3\nr1         3 . . 3\nr2         3 . . 3\nr3         3 3 3 3\n```\n\nThe interior zero cells are:\n\n- (1,9), (1,10), (2,9), (2,10)\n\nThey form a 2\u00d72 hole completely surrounded by 3\u2019s.\n\n#### 1.3. The `2`-cross in the middle-left\n\nThe 2\u2019s at rows 6\u20138, cols 1\u20133:\n\n```\nr6 c1..3: . 2 .\nr7        2 . 2\nr8        . 2 .\n```\n\nAt the centre (7,2) is a 0 that has all four neighbors = 2. It is a single-cell hole inside the `2`-shape.\n\nOther 2\u2019s in the bottom rows are isolated dots and do not form rings, so they have no holes.\n\n#### 1.4. The large `5`-shape in the mid-right\n\nConsider rows 5\u20139, cols 7\u201312 (showing 5 as `#`, 0 as `.`):\n\n```\nr5: . # # # . .\nr6: # . . . # .\nr7: # . . . . #\nr8: . # # # # #\nr9: . # . . . .\n```\n\nChecking 4\u2011connectivity of zeros, the set\n\n- (6,8), (6,9), (6,10),\n- (7,8), (7,9), (7,10), (7,11)\n\nforms one 0\u2011component that is completely enclosed by 5\u2019s \u2014 there is no 0\u2011path from any of these cells out to the grid border without passing through a 5. Those seven cells are holes inside the `5`-shape.\n\nZeros such as (5,7), (5,11), (8,7), (9,9) etc. all connect via zeros to the outer border, so they are *not* holes and remain 0.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Filling the holes\n\nBecause I couldn\u2019t reconstruct a reliable coordinate-wise projection from the key in the solved examples, I used a simpler, shape-based abstraction here:  \nfor each enclosed 0\u2011region, fill it with the color of the shape that encloses it, making each loop solid.\n\nSo in this test grid:\n\n- Holes inside the `1`-shape \u2192 fill with 1.\n- Holes inside the `3`-shape \u2192 fill with 3.\n- Hole inside the `2`-shape cross \u2192 fill with 2.\n- Holes inside the `5`-shape \u2192 fill with 5.\n\nApplying that:\n\n1. In row 1:\n\n   - (1,2),(1,3),(1,4) become 1.\n   - (1,9),(1,10) (in the 3-frame) become 3.\n\n   Row 1 becomes: `0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0`.\n\n2. In row 2:\n\n   - (2,3),(2,4) become 1.\n   - (2,9),(2,10) become 3.\n\n   Row 2 becomes: `0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0`.\n\n3. In row 7:\n\n   - (7,2) becomes 2 (center of the 2\u2011cross).\n\n4. In rows 6\u20137, the 5-shape holes:\n\n   - Row 6: (6,8),(6,9),(6,10) become 5.\n   - Row 7: (7,8),(7,9),(7,10),(7,11) become 5.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Final output grid\n\nPutting all of the above together, the completed grid is:\n\n```\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0\n0,2,2,2,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n```",

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "To solve these tasks I first locate the small, isolated, multicoloured block \u2013 that is the \u201ckey\u201d.  \nThe key is a 2\u00d7N or N\u00d72 rectangle not touching the other shapes. The shorter dimension of the key tells you the mapping direction: you look across that two\u2011cell dimension to derive pairs of colours. The side of the key that sits on the outer edge of the whole grid supplies the \u201csource\u201d colours; the opposite side supplies the \u201cfill\u201d colours.\n\nFor the test case the key is the 2\u00d75 block in the bottom\u2011left corner. Its shorter dimension is the height (2), and it touches the bottom edge, so the bottom row is the source and the top row the fill. Reading column\u2011wise gives the mapping:\n\n- 9\u202f\u2192\u202f5  \n- 8\u202f\u2192\u202f4  \n- 3\u202f\u2192\u202f6  \n- 1\u202f\u2192\u202f7  \n- 2\u202f\u2192\u202f8\n\nNext, for each colour that appears as a source, find its connected components and the 0\u2011cells completely enclosed by that colour. Those enclosed holes are replaced by the corresponding fill colour from the mapping above. Other cells are left unchanged.\n\nApplying this to the test grid, only the 1\u2011frame on the left and the 3\u2011frame on the right contain enclosed 0s. The 1\u2011holes become 7s, and the 3\u2011holes become 6s. Everything else, including the key block, stays as given.\n\nThe completed output grid is:\n\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,7,7,7,1,0,0,3,6,6,3,0\n0,1,1,7,7,1,0,0,3,6,6,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analyzing ARC-AGI Input-Output Pairs**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking, based on this image. First, I need to understand what's happening and figure out a general rule that works across all three pairs. The goal isn't to solve the specific examples but to see the pattern.\n\n1.  **Breaking Down the Request:** I'm given three ARC-AGI scenarios, each with an input and an output. My job is to find the common thread between these, not just for this set, but a rule that would apply to similar tasks. The output needs to be structured and cover what the transformation does, what categories this fits into, key points, my guess, how to check it, and a helpful hint.\n\n2.  **Looking at the Images:**\n    *   **Image 1:** It looks like there are two parts: a color palette and objects with holes in a black background. The yellow object has two holes. The palette has Green, Magenta, Grey, Red...Hmm, it seems like the colors in the palette are related to the colors filling the holes! The yellow thing's holes are filled with magenta. The green thing's holes are filled with green. Orange fills with orange.\n    *   **Image 2:** Here, the palette is the same. The objects are a blue frame, a grey shape, and a yellow shape. The blue frame's hole is filled with light blue. The grey shape is filled with grey, and the yellow shape is filled with grey. Wait, the yellow shape is filled with grey and the palette doesn't have grey!\n    *   **Image 3:** It's a strip with a palette block on the left and two objects. The Yellow Object remains untouched. The Red Object gets orange.\n\n    I see that holes are getting filled in, and there's a color palette. The color seems to come from the palette.\n\n    *   **Is it about the object color?** Let's re-examine image 2. The Yellow object has grey filling but the original object is Yellow. The Blue object also doesn't match the fill. It's not about container color.\n    *   **Is it about object count or sequence?** No because the result of the hole filling doesn't depend on the count in the Input.\n\n    *   Okay, there has to be some spatial mapping.\n        *   The Key (palette) seems to map sectors of the grid.\n        *   Alternative Idea: Is it based on the color of the object?\n        *   If the palette has two colors and the Red shape is filled by one of the key colors (Orange).\n\n3.  **Hypothesis: Mapping & Spatial Projection:**\n    *   Maybe the images are divided into regions.\n    *   Each color in the key corresponds to a region, and any object in that region has its holes filled with that color.\n    *   If the key color of a region is Black/Transparent/No color, then maybe it fills in the objects themselves.\n\n    Let's test this in Image 1. It seems like a 2x3 grid. The top-left object is Yellow and filled Magenta. The key has Magenta as the top-middle color. The green object (Bottom-Left) fills with green. And the Orange object, Bottom-Right fills in its same color as the Key.\n\n    Image 2 has Top-Right - Blue Frame fills with top-center Light Blue. Bottom-Left - Grey Object fills with middle-bottom Grey. But the Bottom-Right - Yellow Object fills with the Middle-Bottom- Grey.\n\n    Input 3: Key (Left: Orange, Blue). The Red Object is on the Right but gets filled in Orange. The yellow object remains black.\n    It's an inversion. Objects on the right get the Left key colors.\n\n    Okay, looking at the pattern, it seems as though this spatial mapping idea is the closest. Holes get filled with the color from the key that corresponds with the location. It's not a strict correspondence because the holes can be anywhere in the \"Sector\" and also the yellow hole in Image 2 fills differently. It can also fill the original object if the \"Key\" color is null.\n\n    Maybe this is why Input 3 has an odd result? Maybe the red object is on the left relative to an assumed Key that maps a full row, but the Key only maps columns? Maybe I misread the specific colors on Input 3 and the key is projected only on the Red side?\n\n4.  **Final Hypothesis (and refined):**\n    *   The core thing: Hole filling using a *spatial* correspondence.\n    *   The scene is divided into a layout. (Could be full screen, just the object, etc).\n    *   There\n\nBased on the visual analysis of the provided training examples, here is the breakdown of the transformation logic.\n\n### **1. Describe the observable structures**\n\n*   **Objects:**\n    *   **\"Palette\" / \"Key\" Object:** In every input, there is one rectangular object composed of a grid of multiple different solid colors (e.g., a 2x3 block of colored tiles). This object is preserved in the output.\n    *   **\"Container\" Shapes:** There are other shapes (Yellow, Green, Orange, Blue, Grey, Red) that act as containers. These shapes usually have thick monochromatic borders and contain black (empty) \"holes\" or cavities inside them.\n*   **Arrangement:**\n    *   The \"Palette\" is located in a corner (Top-Right in Input 1, Top-Left in Input 2, Left in Input 3).\n    *   The \"Container\" shapes are distributed across the rest of the grid, occupying different quadrants or areas.\n*   **Changes:**\n    *   The internal black holes of the \"Container\" shapes are filled with solid colors in the output.\n    *   The borders of the shapes remain unchanged.\n    *   The \"Palette\" remains unchanged.\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   The colors used to fill the holes appear to be drawn from the \"Palette\" object.\n    *   Sometimes the fill color matches the container's border (e.g., Green shape filled with Green in Input 1), but often it does not (e.g., Yellow shape filled with Magenta in Input 1).\n\n### **2. Identify transformation categories**\n\n*   **Object movement:** Absent\n*   **Object recoloring:** Present (specifically filling internal regions)\n*   **Bordering / outlining:** Absent (borders exist, but aren't created)\n*   **Filling holes or cavities:** **Present** (Primary Action)\n*   **Removing noise / extracting main shape:** Absent\n*   **Copying / pasting / repositioning:** Maybe (Colors are copied from the Palette)\n*   **Using a key anchor location:** **Present** (The Palette acts as a key)\n*   **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors:** Absent\n*   **Size-based filtering or selection:** Absent\n*   **Symmetry or reflection operations:** Absent\n*   **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion:** Absent\n*   **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping:** Absent\n\n### **3. Extract the key non-obvious insights**\n\n*   **The Palette is a Spatial Map:** The location of a specific color tile within the \"Palette\" corresponds to a specific region or sector of the main grid.\n*   **Projective Coloring:** The transformation projects the Palette's layout onto the entire grid. A hole in a specific location on the grid is filled with the color found at the corresponding relative position in the Palette.\n*   **Container Color is Irrelevant:** The color of the container's border (Yellow, Blue, etc.) does *not* dictate the fill color. For example, in Input 2, the Yellow shape is filled with Grey, not Yellow, and not a complementary color, but the color dictated by its position.\n*   **Centroid/Overlap Logic:** Since the grid resolution is higher than the Palette resolution, the fill color is likely determined by which \"Palette Zone\" the centroid of the hole (or the majority of the hole) falls into. For instance, in Input 2, both bottom shapes are filled with the color from the bottom-middle of the palette (Grey), suggesting they both fall within that central projection zone.\n\n### **4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)**\n\nThe task treats the multi-colored \"Palette\" object as a low-resolution map or legend for the entire grid. The grid is conceptually divided into regions matching the dimensions of the Palette (e.g., if the Palette is 2x3, the grid is divided into a 2x3 projection).\n\nThe transformation identifies all \"hollow\" or enclosed areas within the main shapes. For each hole, it determines its position relative to the grid and fills it with the color found in the corresponding \"sector\" of the Palette. The Palette itself and the borders of the shapes are left unchanged.\n\n### **5. List checks you would perform when solving**\n\n*   **Grid Division Check:** Calculate the width/height of the Palette (e.g., 3 columns, 2 rows) and divide the main grid dimensions by these numbers to define the \"zones.\"\n*   **Centroid Test:** Check if the fill color of a hole matches the Palette color of the zone containing the hole's center of mass.\n*   **Consistency Check:** Verify if two distinct objects falling in the same zone (e.g., bottom-left and bottom-right both snapping to 'bottom-center') receive the same fill color.\n*   **Self-Fill Verification:** Confirm that cases where the fill color matches the border color (like the Green object in Input 1) are coincidental (i.e., the Green object happened to be in the \"Green zone\") rather than a separate rule.\n\n### **6. Summarize final insights**\n\nHINT_START\n*   Identify the multi-colored block; it acts as a \"Key\" or \"Map\" for the entire image.\n*   The transformation detects enclosed black holes inside other shapes and fills them.\n*   The fill color is not random or based on the border; it is determined by projecting the Key's layout onto the full grid dimensions.\n*   Ideally, imagine the Key scaling up to cover the image; the color appearing \"under\" a hole is the color used to fill it.\nHINT_END",

All objects are set against a color 0 background. Key attributes include color (0-9), size, shape completeness (whole vs. partial), fill status (hollow vs. solid), and interior content (empty vs. containing other elements).\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. **Locate the color palette**: A 2-row (horizontal) or 2-column (vertical) block containing color pairs where row/column 1 = keys, row/column 2 = values.\n\n2. **Build color mapping**: Each key color in the first row/column maps to the value color directly below/beside it.\n\n3. **Fill qualifying frames**: For each hollow or eroded rectangular frame:\n   - Check if the frame's color appears in the KEY position of the palette\n   - If yes: fill all interior 0s with the corresponding VALUE color\n   - If no: leave the frame unchanged\n\n4. **Test input palette** (rows 11-12, cols 0-4): 5\u21929, 4\u21928, 6\u21923, 7\u21921, 8\u21922\n\n5. **Test transformations**:\n   - 1-frame (cols 1-5): NOT filled (1 is a value, not key)\n   - 3-frame (cols 8-11): NOT filled (3 is a value, not key)  \n   - 5-frame (cols 7-12): FILL interior with 9 (5 is a key)\n   - 2-diamonds: NOT filled (2 is a value, not key)\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Let's break this down.** The task is to solve an ARC puzzle based on provided examples and a description. My job is to act as a logic engine and step-by-step follow the instructions to get the correct output for the test input.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the objects described. The key part here is understanding *how* to apply the transformations to them based on the rules. This involves locating the \"palette,\" figuring out the mapping between colors (the \"key-value pairs\"), and identifying which objects need to be \"filled.\" The test input has a clear structure to follow.\n\nThe \"palette\" is a dedicated section within the grid that defines the color mapping, it could be either horizontal or vertical. I will search for the palette in the test input and derive the correct mapping from the information. In our case, the palette is at the bottom left. After mapping the corresponding values of the palette (5->9, 4->8, 6->3, 7->1, 8->2), I must analyze the sample objects given in the prompt, that is a frame composed of ones, a frame composed of threes, a frame composed of fives, and diamonds. Only one of these will need to be filled because only this one matches the palette.\n\nNext, I'll go through the test input and identify the frames. Based on the palette mapping, I must determine which frames need to be filled. The ones that need to be filled are those that start with colors found in the palette. In our example, the key is the five-frame at columns 7-12 (that is 5s) because '5' is a key on the palette. The ones that don't need to be filled are the ones composed of the rest of the colors: 1, 3, 2. The instruction mentions \"fill interior 0s\". In other words, to fill the interior, I must find the 0s inside. The instruction specifies that I must substitute the 0s inside the five-frame for 9s as 5-->9 is the color substitution from the palette.\n\nAfter identifying the key objects, I need to ensure the transformation is correct by double-checking the result. I must check that the interior zero-filled regions are those contained withing the five frame, and not something different. In this case, Row 6 and Row 7, Cols 8-11. Finally, construct the full output grid by applying the transformations to the input and returning the output.\n\nI'm ready to produce the result!\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we follow the transformation rules derived from the solved examples and the provided description.\n\n### Analysis of the Transformation\n\n1.  **Locate the Color Palette**:\n    The palette serves as the instruction key for the transformation. It is a rectangular block of pixels where the first row/column represents \"Key\" colors and the second row/column represents \"Value\" colors.\n    - In the **Test Input**, the palette is located at the bottom-left corner (Rows 11-12, Columns 0-4).\n    - **Row 11 (Keys)**: 5, 4, 6, 7, 8\n    - **Row 12 (Values)**: 9, 8, 3, 1, 2\n    - **Mapping**: 5 \u2192 9, 4 \u2192 8, 6 \u2192 3, 7 \u2192 1, 8 \u2192 2.\n\n2.  **Identify Objects and Apply Transformation**:\n    We need to identify \"hollow rectangular frames\" or \"eroded shapes\" and check if their color matches a Key in the palette. If it does, we fill the interior 0s with the corresponding Value color.\n\n    - **Object 1: 1-frame (Top Left, cols 1-5)**\n        - Color: 1.\n        - Is 1 a Key? No (Keys are 5, 4, 6, 7, 8).\n        - Action: Leave unchanged.\n\n    - **Object 2: 3-frame (Top Right, cols 8-11)**\n        - Color: 3.\n        - Is 3 a Key? No.\n        - Action: Leave unchanged.\n\n    - **Object 3: 2-diamonds (Left and Bottom Right)**\n        - Color: 2.\n        - Is 2 a Key? No.\n        - Action: Leave unchanged.\n\n    - **Object 4: 5-frame (Middle Right, cols 7-12)**\n        - Color: 5.\n        - Is 5 a Key? Yes. From the palette, 5 maps to 9.\n        - Action: Fill the interior 0s of this shape with color 9.\n\n3.  **Executing the Fill on the 5-frame**:\n    We examine the 5-frame to identify the interior pixels (0s enclosed by the 5s).\n    - **Row 6**: The shape has 5s at col 7 and col 11. The pixels between them (cols 8, 9, 10) are 0s. These are interior.\n    - **Row 7**: The shape has 5s at col 7 and col 12. The pixels between them (cols 8, 9, 10, 11) are 0s. These are interior.\n    - **Check Bounds**:\n        - Row 5 has 5s at cols 8, 9, 10 (capping the top of Row 6's interior).\n        - Row 8 has 5s at cols 8-12 (capping the bottom of Row 7's interior).\n        - This confirms that the 0s at (Row 6, Cols 8-10) and (Row 7, Cols 8-11) are fully enclosed.\n\n### Final Grid Construction\n\nWe copy the input grid and modify only the interior of the 5-frame.\n\n- **Row 6**: Change `0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0` to `0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,5,0`.\n- **Row 7**: Change `0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5` to `0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,9,5`.\n\nAll other rows remain identical to the input.\n\n### Output Grid\n\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,5,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,9,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0",

All objects are set against a color 0 background. Key attributes include color (0-9), size, shape completeness (whole vs. partial), fill status (hollow vs. solid), and interior content (empty vs. containing other elements).\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. **Locate the color palette**: A 2-row (horizontal) or 2-column (vertical) block containing color pairs where row/column 1 = keys, row/column 2 = values.\n\n2. **Build color mapping**: Each key color in the first row/column maps to the value color directly below/beside it.\n\n3. **Fill qualifying frames**: For each hollow or eroded rectangular frame:\n   - Check if the frame's color appears in the KEY position of the palette\n   - If yes: fill all interior 0s with the corresponding VALUE color\n   - If no: leave the frame unchanged\n\n4. **Test input palette** (rows 11-12, cols 0-4): 5\u21929, 4\u21928, 6\u21923, 7\u21921, 8\u21922\n\n5. **Test transformations**:\n   - 1-frame (cols 1-5): NOT filled (1 is a value, not key)\n   - 3-frame (cols 8-11): NOT filled (3 is a value, not key)  \n   - 5-frame (cols 7-12): FILL interior with 9 (5 is a key)\n   - 2-diamonds: NOT filled (2 is a value, not key)\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "The training examples all hide a small \u201cpalette\u201d block of two rows or two columns: the first row/column supplies key colours and the second supplies the value they should be replaced with. You then scan the scene for hollow or eroded rectangular outlines drawn in one of the key colours. For each such frame, take the bounding box of that connected outline and fill any 0s strictly inside that box with the mapped value colour; leave borders and other non\u2011zero interior pixels untouched. Colours not present as keys in the palette are ignored.\n\nIn the test grid the palette sits in rows\u202f11\u201312, cols\u202f0\u20134, giving the mapping 5\u21929,\u202f4\u21928,\u202f6\u21923,\u202f7\u21921,\u202f8\u21922. The only non\u2011palette frame in a key colour is the eroded 5\u2011outline spanning rows\u202f5\u20139, cols\u202f7\u201312. Its interior (rows\u202f6\u20138, cols\u202f8\u201311) contained seven zeroes, which are filled with 9. All other shapes remain as they were.\n\nThe completed output grid is:\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,5,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,9,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0",

All objects are set against a color 0 background. Key attributes include color (0-9), size, shape completeness (whole vs. partial), fill status (hollow vs. solid), and interior content (empty vs. containing other elements).\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. **Locate the color palette**: A 2-row (horizontal) or 2-column (vertical) block containing color pairs where row/column 1 = keys, row/column 2 = values.\n\n2. **Build color mapping**: Each key color in the first row/column maps to the value color directly below/beside it.\n\n3. **Fill qualifying frames**: For each hollow or eroded rectangular frame:\n   - Check if the frame's color appears in the KEY position of the palette\n   - If yes: fill all interior 0s with the corresponding VALUE color\n   - If no: leave the frame unchanged\n\n4. **Test input palette** (rows 11-12, cols 0-4): 5\u21929, 4\u21928, 6\u21923, 7\u21921, 8\u21922\n\n5. **Test transformations**:\n   - 1-frame (cols 1-5): NOT filled (1 is a value, not key)\n   - 3-frame (cols 8-11): NOT filled (3 is a value, not key)  \n   - 5-frame (cols 7-12): FILL interior with 9 (5 is a key)\n   - 2-diamonds: NOT filled (2 is a value, not key)\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Infer the general rule from the examples**\n\n   - In each example there is a **2-row or 2-column palette** of colors:\n     - Example 1: rows 0\u20131, cols 7\u201311 \u2192  \n       keys (row 0): 3,4,6,9,5  \n       values (row 1): 3,6,7,2,9  \n       so 3\u21923, 4\u21926, 6\u21927, 9\u21922, 5\u21929\n     - Example 2: rows 0\u20133, cols 0\u20131 (vertical palette) \u2192  \n       keys (col 0): 2,4,6,8  \n       values (col 1): 6,5,8,1  \n       so 2\u21926, 4\u21925, 6\u21928, 8\u21921\n     - Example 3: rows 0\u20131, cols 1\u20132 \u2192  \n       keys (row 0): 2,6  \n       values (row 1): 7,1  \n       so 2\u21927, 6\u21921\n\n   - For each **key color** that appears as a hollow or eroded frame (or enclosing loop), its **interior 0-cells** are filled with the mapped value color:\n     - Example 1:\n       - Color 4 frame gets filled with 6 (4\u21926).\n       - Color 3 eroded frame gets filled with 3 (3\u21923).\n       - Color 7 frame is *not* in the key row \u2192 not filled.\n     - Example 2:\n       - Color 8 frame gets filled with 1 (8\u21921).\n       - Color 4 frame gets filled with 5 (4\u21925).\n       - The irregular 5 ring is not a key color in that palette \u2192 not filled.\n     - Example 3:\n       - Color 2 rectangular frame gets filled with 7 (2\u21927).\n\n   - Geometrically, \u201cinterior\u201d means all 0-cells that are **4-connectedly enclosed by that frame color**, i.e. their 4-connected zero-region cannot reach the outside of the frame without crossing that color.\n\n2. **Identify the palette in the test input**\n\n   Test grid rows 11\u201312, cols 0\u20134:\n\n   - Row 11: 5,4,6,7,8\n   - Row 12: 9,8,3,1,2\n\n   So the mapping is:\n\n   - 5 \u2192 9  \n   - 4 \u2192 8  \n   - 6 \u2192 3  \n   - 7 \u2192 1  \n   - 8 \u2192 2  \n\n   Only these colors, when forming frames, may cause filling.\n\n3. **Find frame-like shapes using key colors**\n\n   Scan the grid:\n\n   - Top-left: a 1-colored \u201cframe\u201d (rows 0\u20133, cols 1\u20135).  \n     - Color 1 is **not a key** (it appears only as a value: 7\u21921), so we **do not fill** it.\n   - Top-right: a 3-colored hollow rectangle (rows 0\u20133, cols 8\u201311).  \n     - Color 3 is also only a value (6\u21923), **not a key**, so we **do not fill** it.\n   - Middle-right: a complex cluster of 5\u2019s (rows 5\u20139, roughly cols 7\u201312).  \n     - Color 5 **is a key** (5\u21929), so this is a candidate frame.\n   - No visible frames made of 4, 6, 7, or 8 outside the palette region.\n\n4. **Determine the interior of the 5-frame**\n\n   Consider all 5-cells outside the palette:\n\n   - Row 5: (5,8),(5,9),(5,10)\n   - Row 6: (6,7),(6,11)\n   - Row 7: (7,7),(7,12)\n   - Row 8: (8,8),(8,9),(8,10),(8,11),(8,12)\n   - Row 9: (9,8)\n\n   The minimal bounding box covering these is rows 5\u20139, cols 7\u201312, with 5\u2019s arranged as:\n\n   ```\n   r5: 0 5 5 5 0 0\n   r6: 5 0 0 0 5 0\n   r7: 5 0 0 0 0 5\n   r8: 0 5 5 5 5 5\n   r9: 0 5 0 0 0 0\n        c7 c8 c9 c10 c11 c12\n   ```\n\n   Treating color 5 as **walls**, and considering 4-connectivity on 0-cells:\n\n   - Boundary 0-cells on the edges of this box (e.g., (5,7), (5,11), (6,12), (8,7), (9,7), (9,9\u201312)) are connected to the outside.\n   - There is a distinct 4-connected **interior zero-region** that cannot reach the boundary without crossing a 5:\n\n     Interior zero positions (global coordinates):\n\n     - (6,8), (6,9), (6,10)\n     - (7,8), (7,9), (7,10), (7,11)\n\n   These are exactly the enclosed interior of the 5-frame. Since 5 is a key mapping to 9, these 0s must become 9.\n\n   All other zeros remain unchanged because:\n   - They belong to frames of non-key colors (1 or 3), or\n   - They are not enclosed by a key-colored frame.\n\n5. **Apply the mapping**\n\n   Only update those seven cells:\n\n   - Row 6: cols 8,9,10 \u2192 9\n   - Row 7: cols 8,9,10,11 \u2192 9  \n\n   Everything else stays as in the input.\n\n---\n\n**Output grid**\n\nRow-by-row:\n\n0. `0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0`  \n1. `0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0`  \n2. `0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0`  \n3. `0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0`  \n4. `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \n5. `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0`  \n6. `0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,5,0`  \n7. `0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,9,5`  \n8. `0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5`  \n9. `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0`  \n10. `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0`  \n11. `5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0`  \n12. `9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0`",

                "response": "Looking at the examples, I can identify the following transformations:\n\n## Transformation Analysis\n\n### 1. Color Palette Identification\nEach grid contains a small rectangular color palette (2 rows \u00d7 N columns, or N rows \u00d7 2 columns):\n- **Example 1**: Rows 0-1, cols 7-11 form a 2\u00d75 horizontal palette\n- **Example 2**: Rows 0-3, cols 0-1 form a 4\u00d72 vertical palette  \n- **Example 3**: Rows 0-1, cols 1-2 form a 2\u00d72 palette\n\n### 2. Key-Value Color Mapping\nThe palette establishes mappings between colors:\n- **Horizontal palette**: First row = key colors, Second row = value colors\n- **Vertical palette**: First column = key colors, Second column = value colors\n\nMappings from examples:\n- Ex1: 3\u21923, 4\u21926, 6\u21927, 9\u21922, 5\u21929\n- Ex2: 2\u21926, 4\u21925, 6\u21928, 8\u21921\n- Ex3: 2\u21927, 6\u21921\n\n### 3. Interior Filling of Frames Based on Palette Keys\nFor hollow/eroded rectangular frames:\n- If the frame's color appears as a **key** in the palette, fill interior 0s with the corresponding **value** color\n- If the color only appears as a value (or not at all), the frame is NOT modified\n\n**Example 1**: 4-frame filled with 6 (4 is key), 3-frame filled with 3 (3 is key), 7-frame unchanged (7 is not a key)\n\n**Example 2**: 8-frame filled with 1, 4-frame filled with 5, 5-frame unchanged (5 not a key)\n\n**Example 3**: 2-frame filled with 7, 4-frame unchanged (4 not in palette)\n\n### 4. Eroded Shape Handling\nEven incomplete/eroded rectangular frames have their \"logical interior\" filled - areas that would be interior if the rectangle were complete.\n\n### 5. Preservation Rules\n- Palettes remain unchanged\n- Small non-frame patterns (like diamond shapes) remain unchanged\n- Frames with colors not in key position remain unchanged\n\n<transformation_summary>\n1. **Locate the color palette**: A 2-row (horizontal) or 2-column (vertical) block containing color pairs where row/column 1 = keys, row/column 2 = values.\n\n2. **Build color mapping**: Each key color in the first row/column maps to the value color directly below/beside it.\n\n3. **Fill qualifying frames**: For each hollow or eroded rectangular frame:\n   - Check if the frame's color appears in the KEY position of the palette\n   - If yes: fill all interior 0s with the corresponding VALUE color\n   - If no: leave the frame unchanged\n\n4. **Test input palette** (rows 11-12, cols 0-4): 5\u21929, 4\u21928, 6\u21923, 7\u21921, 8\u21922\n\n5. **Test transformations**:\n   - 1-frame (cols 1-5): NOT filled (1 is a value, not key)\n   - 3-frame (cols 8-11): NOT filled (3 is a value, not key)  \n   - 5-frame (cols 7-12): FILL interior with 9 (5 is a key)\n   - 2-diamonds: NOT filled (2 is a value, not key)\n</transformation_summary>",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, here's the game plan for this ARC task:**\n\nI've been given a set of examples and a description to understand how a specific image transformation works. My goal is to figure out the underlying logic and apply it to a new input.\n\n**First things first, I'm going to carefully analyze the input/output pairs:**\n\n*   **Key Identification:** I'm looking for a \"dense\" block of colors in each example \u2013 this seems to be the core of the transformation. The size and shape of this block (tall, wide, square) are critical. I need to note the position of the key block in each example.\n*   **Mapping Direction:** The shape of the block (tall, wide or square) dictates whether I read the block *vertically* (top-to-bottom) or *horizontally* (left-to-right). \"Wide\" or \"square\" means *vertical* mapping, and \"Tall\" means *horizontal* mapping.\n*   **Rule Extraction:** Once the orientation is clear, I create a mapping. For vertical blocks, it's `Top Color -> Bottom Color`. For horizontal blocks, it's `Left Color -> Right Color`. This tells me what color replaces what.\n*   **Target Shapes:** I then look at other objects (usually monochromatic or \"framed\" by a single color with a background of 0's) in the input. I identify the primary color of each object.\n*   **Rule Application:** The core of the transformation is the `Frame Color -> Fill Color` rule. If the shape's color matches a \"Frame Color\" in the mapping, all the *internal* 0s (within the boundaries of the shape) are replaced with the corresponding \"Fill Color\". 0's outside are untouched.\n\n**The Strategy (in more detail):**\n\n1.  **Locate the Key Block:** Identify the dense, multi-colored rectangular block in the input. Its orientation (width vs height) tells me if I'm reading it top-to-bottom or left-to-right to build my color substitution rules.\n2.  **Extract the Rules:** From the Key block's orientation and colors, I create a mapping/dictionary of color pairs. This is the crucial part: `Frame_Color -> Fill_Color`. It's what drives the entire transformation.\n3.  **Find the Shapes:** Identify all the closed areas in the input grid that have a consistent border color and 0's inside.\n4.  **Match and Apply:** For each shape, I check if its border (frame) color is in my rule mapping. If it is, then I replace all the interior 0s with the mapped \"fill\" color. If not, the shape remains unchanged.\n\nThis entire process is about finding this core rule or mapping in the key and applying it based on shape boundaries.\n\nFor example, I will treat 0s within a color boundary as an interior and replace them based on the rules.\n\nIn my test case, the bottom left corner is the key. The shape is wide, hence it is vertical and gives the following rule. 5 -> 9; 4 -> 8; 6 -> 3; 7 -> 1; 8 -> 2. The grey shape in the middle has frame color 5. There's a 5 -> 9 rule for it. This means I replace all zeros inside that shape with 9. The other colors do not have a rule and I do not change their zero interior.\n\n\nTo solve this challenge, we need to understand the relationship between the \"dense multi-colored block\" (the key) and the other shapes in the grid. Based on the solved examples and the problem description, here is the step-by-step logical derivation:\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Block**:\n    We look for a small, dense rectangular block of mixed colors. In the test input, this block is located at the bottom-left corner, occupying rows 11 and 12, and columns 0 to 4.\n    The block is:\n    Row 11: `5, 4, 6, 7, 8`\n    Row 12: `9, 8, 3, 1, 2`\n\n2.  **Determine Orientation and Mapping Rules**:\n    The problem description states that the orientation of the key block determines the reading direction.\n    -   **Wide or Square blocks** (Width $\\ge$ Height) imply a **Vertical** (top-to-bottom) mapping.\n    -   **Tall blocks** (Height > Width) imply a **Horizontal** (left-to-right) mapping.\n    \n    The identified key block has a width of 5 and a height of 2. Since $5 > 2$, it is a **wide** block.\n    Therefore, we read the pairs vertically (Top cell $\\rightarrow$ Bottom cell).\n    \n    The pairs define the `Frame Color -> Fill Color` rules:\n    -   Col 0: `5` $\\rightarrow$ `9`\n    -   Col 1: `4` $\\rightarrow$ `8`\n    -   Col 2: `6` $\\rightarrow$ `3`\n    -   Col 3: `7` $\\rightarrow$ `1`\n    -   Col 4: `8` $\\rightarrow$ `2`\n    \n    The set of Frame Colors that trigger a change is `{5, 4, 6, 7, 8}`.\n\n3.  **Apply Rules to Target Shapes**:\n    We examine the other shapes in the grid to see if their primary \"Frame Color\" matches any key in our set.\n    \n    -   **Blue Shape (Color 1)** [Top-Left]: Frame color is 1. `1` is not in the key set. **No change.**\n    -   **Green Shape (Color 3)** [Top-Right]: Frame color is 3. `3` is not in the key set. **No change.**\n    -   **Grey Shape (Color 5)** [Middle-Right]: Frame color is 5. `5` IS in the key set. The rule is **5 $\\rightarrow$ 9**. We must fill the interior `0`s of this shape with `9`.\n    -   **Red Shapes (Color 2)** [Bottom-Left and Bottom-Right]: Frame color is 2. `2` is not in the key set. **No change.**\n\n4.  **Execute the Transformation**:\n    We apply the fill operation only to the Grey (5) shape.\n    \n    Scanning the Grey shape's interior (the 0s strictly inside the boundaries formed by 5s):\n    -   **Row 6**: The 0s at columns 8, 9, and 10 are enclosed by 5s. They change from `0` to `9`.\n    -   **Row 7**: The 0s at columns 8, 9, 10, and 11 are enclosed by 5s. They change from `0` to `9`.\n    \n    All other cells in the grid, including the key block itself, remain exactly as they are in the input.\n\n**Output Generation**:\nRows 0-5 remain unchanged.\nRow 6: `...5, 9, 9, 9, 5...`\nRow 7: `...5, 9, 9, 9, 9, 5`\nRows 8-12 remain unchanged.\n\noutput:\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,5,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,9,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0",

The orientation of the key block determines the reading direction: wide or square blocks imply a vertical (top-to-bottom) mapping, while tall blocks imply a horizontal (left-to-right) mapping. Based on this direction, pairs of adjacent colors in the key define \"Frame Color -> Fill Color\" rules. The interior 0s of any shape matching a \"Frame Color\" are replaced with the corresponding \"Fill Color\". Shapes whose colors do not appear as a \"Frame Color\" in the key remain unchanged.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

The orientation of the key block determines the reading direction: wide or square blocks imply a vertical (top-to-bottom) mapping, while tall blocks imply a horizontal (left-to-right) mapping. Based on this direction, pairs of adjacent colors in the key define \"Frame Color -> Fill Color\" rules. The interior 0s of any shape matching a \"Frame Color\" are replaced with the corresponding \"Fill Color\". Shapes whose colors do not appear as a \"Frame Color\" in the key remain unchanged.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "First extract the rule from the examples, then apply it.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Inferring the rule from the examples\n\nAcross the three solved examples, there is always:\n\n- A small, dense, rectangular, multi-colored block with **no zeros**.  \n- One or more larger **single-colored shapes** that are hollow (contain interior 0s).\n\nFrom the examples:\n\n- **Identify the key block**:\n  - Example 1: rows 1\u20132, cols 8\u201312:\n    - Top row: `3,4,6,9,5`\n    - Bottom row: `3,6,7,2,9`\n    - It\u2019s wide (2\u00d75), so we use **vertical mapping** (top \u2192 bottom per column).\n    - Mappings: `3\u21923`, `4\u21926`, `6\u21927`, `9\u21922`, `5\u21929`.\n  - Example 2: rows 1\u20134, cols 1\u20132:\n    - Tall block (4\u00d72), so use **horizontal mapping** (left \u2192 right per row).\n    - Mappings: `2\u21926`, `4\u21925`, `6\u21928`, `8\u21921`.\n  - Example 3: rows 1\u20132, cols 2\u20133:\n    - Square (2\u00d72), so like \u201cwide\u201d: **vertical mapping**.\n    - Mappings: `2\u21927`, `6\u21921`.\n\n- **Apply the mapping**:\n  - For every color that appears as a \u201cframe\u201d color in the key (the left/top element of each pair), find all **0-components that are completely enclosed** by that color and do **not** touch the outside.\n  - Replace all such interior 0s with the mapped \u201cfill\u201d color.\n  - Shapes whose border color is **not** a frame color in the key are left unchanged, even if they have enclosed 0s (e.g., the 7-shape in Example 1, the 5-rectangle in Example 2, the 4-rectangle in Example 3).\n\nThis matches all given input/output pairs.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Find the key and mapping for the test input\n\nThe test grid has, at the bottom-left, this 2\u00d75 colored block:\n\nRows 12\u201313, cols 1\u20135:\n\n- Row 12: `5,4,6,7,8`\n- Row 13: `9,8,3,1,2`\n\nNo zeros inside; it\u2019s rectangular and wide (2 rows \u00d7 5 columns), so use **vertical mapping** (top row = frame, bottom row = fill):\n\n- `5 \u2192 9`\n- `4 \u2192 8`\n- `6 \u2192 3`\n- `7 \u2192 1`\n- `8 \u2192 2`\n\nOnly shapes whose border color is one of `{5,4,6,7,8}` can have their interior 0s filled.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Identify candidate shapes and their holes\n\nNon-zero colors present elsewhere:\n\n- Color 1 (big hollow shape at top-left)\n- Color 3 (big hollow rectangle at top-right)\n- Color 2 (scattered)\n- Color 5 (cluster in the middle-bottom)\n- Key colors 4,6,7,8 otherwise appear only in the key block.\n\nWe check which of these colors are frame colors in the key:\n\n- Frame colors: `{5,4,6,7,8}`\n- So only **color 5** shapes (outside the key) are relevant; 1- and 3-shapes must remain unchanged.\n\n### 3.1. Color-5 region\n\nAll 5s (outside the key) are here:\n\n- (6,9), (6,10), (6,11)\n- (7,8), (7,12)\n- (8,8), (8,13)\n- (9,9), (9,10), (9,11), (9,12), (9,13)\n- (10,9)\n\nVisualizing rows 6\u201310, cols 8\u201313 (5 = X, 0 = .):\n\n- Row 6: `.` `X` `X` `X` `.` `.`\n- Row 7: `X` `.` `.` `.` `X` `.`\n- Row 8: `X` `.` `.` `.` `.` `X`\n- Row 9: `.` `X` `X` `X` `X` `X`\n- Row10: `.` `X` `.` `.` `.` `.`\n\nNow find zero-components enclosed by these 5s. Starting BFS from a central 0 like (7,9):\n\n- The connected 0-region you reach is exactly the set:\n  - (7,9), (7,10), (7,11),\n  - (8,9), (8,10), (8,11), (8,12)\n\nCheck neighbors of each of these zeros: every neighbor outside this set is a 5. There is **no path through zeros** from this region to the grid boundary. So this is a genuine interior 0-hole surrounded by color 5.\n\nAll other zeros adjacent to 5s (e.g., (5,9), (6,8), (10,10), etc.) connect, via other zeros, to the outer background and therefore are not interior holes.\n\n### 3.2. Other holes\n\n- The 1-shape at top-left has a 0-hole inside (cells (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5)), bounded entirely by color 1.\n- The 3-rectangle at top-right (rows 1\u20134, cols 9\u201312) has a 2\u00d72 hole of zeros inside.\n\nBut colors 1 and 3 are **not** frame colors in the key, so these holes must remain 0.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Apply the mapping\n\nOnly one relevant frame color: **5**, with mapping `5 \u2192 9`.\n\nSo we replace the interior 0s in the 5-shape by 9:\n\n- (7,9)  : 0 \u2192 9\n- (7,10) : 0 \u2192 9\n- (7,11) : 0 \u2192 9\n- (8,9)  : 0 \u2192 9\n- (8,10) : 0 \u2192 9\n- (8,11) : 0 \u2192 9\n- (8,12) : 0 \u2192 9\n\nEverything else stays as in the input.\n\n---\n\n## 5.

The orientation of the key block determines the reading direction: wide or square blocks imply a vertical (top-to-bottom) mapping, while tall blocks imply a horizontal (left-to-right) mapping. Based on this direction, pairs of adjacent colors in the key define \"Frame Color -> Fill Color\" rules. The interior 0s of any shape matching a \"Frame Color\" are replaced with the corresponding \"Fill Color\". Shapes whose colors do not appear as a \"Frame Color\" in the key remain unchanged.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "To solve the task I first looked for the \u201ccipher key,\u201d which in all the given examples is a small dense rectangle of mixed, non\u2011zero colours. In the test grid the only such block is the 2\u00d75 patch in the bottom left:\n\n```\nrow12: 5 4 6 7 8\nrow13: 9 8 3 1 2\n```\n\nBecause this block is wider than it is tall, I use vertical (top\u2011to\u2011bottom) pairs to define frame\u2192fill mappings:\n5\u21929, 4\u21928, 6\u21923, 7\u21921, 8\u21922.\n\nNext, for each frame colour I treat all cells of that colour as walls and flood\u2013fill the grid from the outside; any 0\u2011cells not reachable without crossing those walls are interior holes and are replaced by the corresponding fill colour. In this test only frame colour 5 appears in actual shapes, and its walls form a closed loop around seven zero cells in rows\u202f7\u20138. Those seven zeros are filled with 9. No other frame colours enclose any holes.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,5,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,9,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0",

                "response": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this:**\n\nOkay, so I've got these grids and my job is to categorize the visual components within them, without overstepping and making up rules or relationships. I need to keep this very specific and use only the numeric color values. Let's break it down:\n\nFirst, I looked at each grid one by one, taking note of what visually \"popped\" out. In the first grid, for instance, I noticed these shapes made of single colors, like a \"1\" shape and a \"3\" shape. There's also this big, complex \"5\" shape. Then there's this weird block, filled with many colors. I call it a \"multi-colored block\" for now.\n\nAcross all the grids, the same kinds of shapes seem to reoccur. There are always these solid regions of the same number (1s, 2s, etc.). Sometimes they're just outlines, like a frame around an empty space (which I'm seeing as color 0, or \"background\"). Sometimes, those solid shapes have little random pixels of other numbers inside them \u2013 \"inclusions\", I'll call those.\n\nThen, there are those \"multi-colored blocks\". They're dense, usually rectangular, and are just a mix of different numbers. It doesn't look like they're a single, defined object.\n\nThe background is a consistent '0', which separates those objects.\n\nSo, I have two broad categories: shapes made of single colors (which can be solid or hollow, and have those \"inclusions\") and these dense, multi-colored blocks.\n\nI'll refine the terminology slightly: instead of \"shapes,\" let's call them \"monochromatic regions,\" to sound more formal. For the multi-colored ones, \"heterogeneous blocks\" sounds better. Then I can just write up a summary, describing what these objects are, including how they can look. And, crucially, only using those numbers (0-9) to describe their color content, so I don't get sidetracked with anything else. Let's make the XML tag to be very descriptive of the object characteristics.\n\n\nBased on the visual data provided in the grids, the objects can be categorized into the following types:\n\n**1. Background**\n*   **Description:** The canvas or negative space upon which all other objects exist.\n*   **Attribute:** It is consistently represented by **color 0**.\n\n**2. Monochromatic and Semi-Monochromatic Shapes**\n*   **Description:** Distinct geometric regions defined by a primary non-zero color (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, or 8).\n*   **Attributes:**\n    *   **Geometry:** These appear as rectangular blocks, irregular blobs, or defined frames/loops.\n    *   **Fill State:**\n        *   **Solid:** The shape is completely filled with its primary color.\n        *   **Hollow/Framed:** The shape forms an outline (e.g., a box of color 8 or color 4) enclosing a center of **color 0**.\n        *   **filled/Inclusion:** The shape forms an outline or field that encloses pixels of a *different* non-zero color (e.g., a frame of color 8 filled with color 1, or a block of color 4 containing scattered pixels of color 6).\n\n**3. Multi-colored Dense Blocks**\n*   **Description:** Small, compact rectangular regions (often located near the edges or corners of the grid) that do not consist of a single primary color.\n*   **Attributes:**\n    *   **Composition:** These blocks are a heterogeneous mix of many different colors (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) packed tightly together without a unifying pattern.\n    *   **Dimensions:** They typically appear as distinct rectangular patches (e.g., 2x5 or 2x6 pixels).\n\n<objects_summary>Background (color 0); Monochromatic and Semi-Monochromatic Shapes (varying primary colors, can be solid, hollow/framed with color 0, or containing inclusions of other colors); Multi-colored Dense Blocks (small rectangles composed of heterogeneous mixed colors).</objects_summary>",

                "response": "**Initial Thoughts and Problem Decomposition:**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with these grids and object descriptions, and my task is to figure out the transformation rules applied to them. I need to break this down. First, let's analyze the examples one by one, focusing on the changes from input to output. I'll need to look at shapes, colors, and their positions within the grids, and especially at the relationships between what I'm calling \"noise blocks\" - those mixed-color blocks.\n\n**Example 1: Initial Observations and Hypothesis Formation**\n\nIn Example 1, I see that the hollow interiors of shapes are being filled with specific colors. The yellow shape fills with magenta (6), the green with green (3). The orange stays empty. Hmmm. I notice a \"noise block\" that contains the color 6. Could that be relevant? Maybe the fill color is derived from the \"noise block\" somehow. But why doesn't the orange shape fill?\n\nI'm thinking: is there a pattern based on the frequency or position of the fill color in the \"noise block\" relative to the shape's own color? Or maybe it's the shape's color itself that matters? Is this color adjacency? The shapes and the \"noise block\" are not necessarily touching.\n\nI am suspecting the shapes are filled with a color adjacent to their own color in the noise block.\n\n**Example 2: Refining the Hypothesis**\n\nExample 2 reinforces the idea of fill colors coming from the \"noise block\". Here, the cyan frame fills with blue (1), and the yellow shape fills with grey (5).  The \"noise block\" has colors 1 and 5 in it. The grey shape remains unchanged. This is interesting... I need to work out the role of color position and its relation to the fill shape.\n\n**Hypothesis Testing and Refinement**\n\nThe pattern seems to be: shapes with holes are filled with a color derived from this \"noise block\". Okay, how? What's the link?\n\nI can define the process like this:\nThe noise block acts as a key for this type of transformation. I notice that the numbers are always paired up. If the shape has the color A, and the \"key\" links A to B, the hollow part of A is filled with B.\n\nLet's test this in Ex 1.\nThe \"noise block\" pairs are: 3/4, 4/6, etc.\nYellow shape (4): Filled with 6. Okay, 4 is before 6 (horizontal).\nGreen shape (3): Filled with 3. 3/3 pair.\nOrange shape (7): Not filled. 7 is in the block but is not paired?\n\nNow Ex 2:\nNoise Block: 2/6, 4/5, 6/8, 8/1.\nCyan (8) - fills with 1.\nGrey (5) - doesn't fill.\nYellow (4) - fills with 5.\n\nIf I consider the directionality of those pairs:\nIn horizontal, 4->5, 8->1. Consistent.\n\nOkay. The key is in these paired relationships in the noise block. The color is assigned in the block directionally.\n\n**Edge Cases and Complexities**\n\nBut Example 3 throws a wrench in this. The yellow shape stays unfilled.  But the red shape fills. In the block is: 2/6 and 7/1. I need to figure out which direction is preferred.\n\nOkay, let's go back and use vertical in Ex 2. I have two columns: 2/4/6/8 and 6/5/8/1\nThen 2 to 4, 4 to 6. Does this mean Yellow (4) can be mapped to 6? No. So, Horizontal or Vertical may depend on something.\n\nIn Ex 1, I can see 3 to 3. Vertical! So is this just a directional thing? Top to bottom, left to right. Is it the key block size?\n\nSo maybe it's not simply direction, it is about the key block aspect ratio (height vs. width). I can't think of anything else.\n\nSo it must be...\n\n**Formulating the Core Rule**\n\nNow the rule appears like this:\n\n1.  **Identify the \"Key Block\".**\n2.  **Identify the Frames/Hollow Shapes.**\n3.  **Determine Mapping Direction based on the Key Block's Aspect Ratio:**\n    *   If Width >= Height, use Vertical (Down) neighbor.\n    *   If Height > Width, use Horizontal (Right) neighbor.\n4.  **Apply Mapping:** For each shape:\n    *   Locate the shape's color in the Key\n\nBased on the analysis of the input/output grids and the objects description, the transformations involve filling the hollow interiors of monochromatic shapes based on a \"key\" provided by the multi-colored dense block.\n\n**Transformations:**\n\n1.  **Identify Key and Orientation**:\n    *   Locate the \"Multi-colored Dense Block\" (the key).\n    *   Determine the mapping direction based on the aspect ratio of this block.\n        *   If the block is **Wide** (Width > Height) or **Square** (Width = Height), use a **Vertical** mapping (Top row cell maps to Bottom row cell).\n        *   If the block is **Tall** (Height > Width), use a **Horizontal** mapping (Left column cell maps to Right column cell).\n\n2.  **Establish Color Mappings**:\n    *   Read pairs of adjacent colors in the determined direction from the key block.\n    *   A pair `(A, B)` defines a rule: \"Shapes of color A should have their hollow interiors filled with color B\".\n    *   **Vertical Mode (Wide/Square Key)**: For each column in the key, the Top color is the Frame color, and the Bottom color is the Fill color.\n    *   **Horizontal Mode (Tall Key)**: For each row in the key, the Left color is the Frame color, and the Right color is the Fill color.\n\n3.  **Apply Filling**:\n    *   Identify all \"Monochromatic and Semi-Monochromatic Shapes\" in the grid.\n    *   For each shape, check if its color exists as a \"Frame color\" in the established mappings.\n    *   If a mapping exists, change the 0s (background) inside the shape's hollow interior to the corresponding \"Fill color\".\n    *   If no mapping exists for the shape's color, the interior remains 0.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Key Block**: Located at the bottom left. Dimensions are 2 rows x 5 columns (Wide).\n*   **Direction**: Vertical (Top -> Bottom).\n*   **Mappings**:\n    *   Col 0: 5 -> 9\n    *   Col 1: 4 -> 8\n    *   Col 2: 6 -> 3\n    *   Col 3: 7 -> 1\n    *   Col 4: 8 -> 2\n*   **Shapes**:\n    *   Blue (1) Shape (Top Left): Color 1 is not in the top row of the key. No change.\n    *   Green (3) Shape (Top Right): Color 3 is not in the top row of the key. No change.\n    *   Grey (5) Shape (Right): Color 5 is in the top row of the key, mapping to 9. **Fill interior with 9**.\n    *   Red (2) Shapes (Left/Bottom): Color 2 is not in the top row of the key. No change.\n\n<transformation_summary>\nThe transformation rules involve using the dense multi-colored block as a cipher key to fill the hollow interiors of shapes. The orientation of the key block determines the reading direction: wide or square blocks imply a vertical (top-to-bottom) mapping, while tall blocks imply a horizontal (left-to-right) mapping. Based on this direction, pairs of adjacent colors in the key define \"Frame Color -> Fill Color\" rules. The interior 0s of any shape matching a \"Frame Color\" are replaced with the corresponding \"Fill Color\". Shapes whose colors do not appear as a \"Frame Color\" in the key remain unchanged.\n</transformation_summary>",
