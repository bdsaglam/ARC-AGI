        "Full raw LLM response": "**I've got a handle on this ARC problem!** The user wants me to solve this based on examples.  I see a pattern-based transformation here.  First, I'm identifying \"markers\" in the input grid.  These markers, each with a specific color, seem to trigger the output of a pre-defined \"pattern\" or \"sprite\".  Each pattern is 4x4, and is defined by blocks of color in the input.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n*   **Mapping:** The key is figuring out the mapping between input marker color and output pattern. I found that different input colors trigger specific output patterns. The mappings are as follows:\n    *   `2` (Red) triggers a Yellow (4) Hollow Square.\n    *   `3` (Green) triggers a Blue (1) Hollow Circle/Diamond.\n    *   `5` triggers a Magenta (6) Steps pattern.\n    *   `8` (from Example 4 and the Test Input) triggers an Orange (7) \"X\" or Hourglass pattern.\n*   **Pattern Definition:** Importantly, the input grid seems to *define* these patterns through blocks of color. Each input block with a unique pattern (like the \"Steps\" pattern) is tied to a specific marker (like 5 or 8). Where there's a marker and pattern in the input, the output replaces the marker with the pattern. The original pattern, if present in the input *without* a marker, is removed (replaced with zeros).\n*   **Test Input Strategy:** The Test Input grid has specific locations where a pattern is defined, and where the markers are located.  For this specific test case, the problem is about replacing markers and keeping the same definition throughout the grid.\n\n**Applying the Rules:**\n\nThe solution strategy is:\n\n1.  **Identify Marker Locations:** I'll locate the instances of marker `8` in the Test Input (at rows 1, 5, 9, 13, and 17).\n2.  **Locate Pattern definition:** I found the \"hourglass\" pattern in the Test Input, at Rows 5-8, Cols 4-7.\n3.  **Draw Patterns:** For each marker `8`, I will place the Orange \"X\" pattern at that location. Note: if the boundary of the grid would be exceeded, I have to *clip* to the boundary, as is the ARC way. Where the pattern definition itself is, if there is no corresponding marker, fill the region with 0s.\n4.  **No Overlap:** The way the markers are placed guarantees that there will be no overlap, so each pattern is in its own space.\n\nThis should give me the correct output, which is the Orange \"X\" pattern repeated across the grid at the marker locations, with the pattern defined area replaced with zeros.  I have double-checked the logic and the calculations, and I'm ready to produce the solution!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid containing \"markers\" and a \"pattern definition\" into a completed grid where the markers are replaced by the pattern.\n\n**Analysis of the Transformation Rule:**\n1.  **Identify Markers:** In the input grid, single non-zero pixels act as markers. Their color indicates which pattern they should be replaced with. In the solved examples:\n    *   Marker `2` (Red) $\\rightarrow$ Yellow (`4`) Hollow Square pattern.\n    *   Marker `3` (Green) $\\rightarrow$ Blue (`1`) Diamond/Circle pattern.\n    *   Marker `5` (Gray) $\\rightarrow$ Magenta (`6`) Steps pattern.\n    *   Marker `8` (Azure) $\\rightarrow$ Orange (`7`) X/Hourglass pattern.\n2.  **Identify Pattern Definitions:** The input grid may contain a fully drawn example of a pattern. In the output, this definition is removed (replaced by `0`s) unless a marker is present at its top-left corner.\n    *   In the Test Input, we see a pattern made of color `7` (Orange) located at rows 5-8, columns 4-7.\n    *   The shape of this pattern is:\n        ```\n        7,0,0,7\n        0,7,7,0\n        0,7,7,0\n        7,0,0,7\n        ```\n    *   The markers in the Test Input are color `8` (Azure). Based on Example 4 and the presence of the `7` pattern, we infer that marker `8` triggers the Orange X pattern.\n3.  **Apply Transformation:**\n    *   Locate every `8` in the input grid.\n    *   Replace each `8` with the 4x4 Orange X pattern, anchored with the top-left of the pattern at the position of the `8`.\n    *   Any area not covered by a pattern expansion (including the original definition area if it lacks a marker) becomes `0` (Black).\n    *   If a pattern extends beyond the grid boundaries, it is clipped.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Grid Size:** 20x20.\n*   **Pattern:** Orange X (color 7).\n*   **Marker Locations (Color 8):**\n    *   Row 1: Columns 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n    *   Row 5: Columns 0, 16. (Note: The definition at col 4 is removed).\n    *   Row 9: Columns 0, 8, 16.\n    *   Row 13: Columns 0, 12, 16.\n    *   Row 17: Columns 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n*   **Clipping:** The markers on Row 17 will generate a 4-high pattern at rows 17, 18, 19, 20. Since the grid ends at row 19, the last row of the pattern is clipped.\n\n**Step-by-Step Construction:**\n\n*   **Row 0:** No markers. Output is all `0`s.\n*   **Rows 1-4:** Markers at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition:**\n\nOkay, the goal is to interpret a transformation rule from a set of examples and apply it to a test input. The core challenge is deciphering how the input grids (made of numbers 0-9) are mapped to output grids, which also contain numbers. I suspect a key is to identify specific \"markers\" in the input that trigger the generation of particular patterns or shapes in the output. Based on this, it's a pattern recognition plus execution task.\n\n**Deconstructing the Example Transformations:**\n\nLet's begin by deconstructing each example step by step, focusing on mapping input values to output patterns. The initial goal is to find a recurring relationship. Looking at the examples, the outputs seem to consist of distinct shapes or \"glyphs\" composed of specific numbers. A quick scan of the first few rows shows 2D grids as input and output. The task is to infer the transformation.\n\n*   **Example 1**:\n    *   Looking at example 1, it's 20x20 in both input and output. It appears the rule is not row-based processing. The output features distinct shapes or \"glyphs\", such as a hollow 4x4 squares (value 4), and another pattern that is hard to determine initially. But also the diamond/circle shape with 1s.\n    *   I've noticed something. I need to index 0-indexed as opposed to 1-indexed. The input's numbers form a grid. Specifically, it's obvious to me that the shapes or glyphs in output are related to numbers in the input. For instance, input has a 6x6, and in the output, you can find diagonal lines, with 6 values. 2 input seems to correspond to the rectangular shapes on output.\n    *   Let's check the relation of input-output. Top-Left: a block of 6 in input maps to a diagonal line-looking glyph.\n    *   Hypothesis: A particular input number (e.g., 6) maps to a distinct shape in the output. I should check which input number generates which output shape. This is likely how the task has been solved.\n    *   I'll refer to specific input-output pairs as the pairs of number and their respective shapes.\n*   **Example 2**:\n    *   Going to Example 2 (smaller 10x10 grids).\n    *   The 3 in the top left in input generates a distinct pattern (circle of 1s) in output.\n    *   Input 2, at another location, also generates another shape.\n    *   It seems each input number corresponds to a unique output shape.\n    *   In the input, there are some patterns, for example, the pattern \"0, 0, 3, 0\" in a row. It is related to shape 1 in the output.\n\n**Establishing the Marker-to-Shape Mapping:**\n\n*   Based on these preliminary observations from Example 1 and Example 2, I form a hypothesis: specific input numbers (\"markers\") define what and where to draw shapes in the output. The shape themselves will be predetermined. So now, my goal is to figure out each specific input-output map, and the relationship of the numbers, input numbers with locations on output.\n*   **Example 1 Again**:\n    *   Input: A 6 maps to some Checkers, and 2 to 4.\n    *   Input: 3 is producing an output that looks like the \"circle of 1s\".\n*   **Example 2**:\n    *   I see a '3' generating the circle and '2' generating a 'box'.\n*   I can state my current hypothesis:\n    *   **2 -> 4** (\"Box\")\n    *   **3 -> 1** (\"Circle\")\n    *   **5 -> 6** (\"Checkers\" / diagonal).\n*   **Example 4**:\n    *   Example 4 uses all values. The Input has an 8 mapped to what looks like a pattern of 7's at the output.\n    *   **8 -> 7** (\"X\" / Orange pattern).\n*   In summary, these are the current mappings:\n\n    *   **2 -> 4 (Box)**\n    *   **3 -> 1 (Circle)**\n    *   **5 -> 6 (Checkers)**\n    *   **8 -> 7 (X)**\n*   From observation, input looks like a grid. I suspect the markers are at the corners of a grid.\n*   Ex 4 tells me they are at positions r%4==0, c%4==0, where r,c is index.\n\n**Identifying the Grid and Marker\n\nThe problem asks us to infer a transformation rule from examples and apply it to a test input. The input and output grids represent colors using integers 0-9.\n\n### Analysis of Examples\n\n1.  **Markers and Shapes**:\n    By comparing the inputs and outputs, we can observe that specific single pixels in the input act as \"markers\" or \"seeds\" that generate 4x4 patterns in the output. The color of the marker determines the color and shape of the output pattern.\n    \n    *   **Marker 2** generates a yellow (4) **Hollow Box**:\n        ```\n        4 4 4 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 4 4 4\n        ```\n    *   **Marker 3** generates a blue (1) **Hollow Circle/Diamond**:\n        ```\n        0 1 1 0\n        1 0 0 1\n        1 0 0 1\n        0 1 1 0\n        ```\n    *   **Marker 5** generates a pink (6) **Checkers** pattern:\n        ```\n        6 6 0 0\n        6 6 0 0\n        0 0 6 6\n        0 0 6 6\n        ```\n    *   **Marker 8** generates an orange (7) **X** pattern (deduced from Example 4):\n        ```\n        7 0 0 7\n        0 7 7 0\n        0 7 7 0\n        7 0 0 7\n        ```\n\n2.  **Positioning**:\n    The position of the marker in the input grid corresponds exactly to the **top-left corner** (row, column) of the 4x4 shape in the output grid.\n    *   In Example 4, markers are at indices like (0,0), (0,4), etc., and the shapes perfectly fill the 4x4 blocks starting at those coordinates.\n    *   In Example 3, a marker 2 at (6,0) produces a shape starting at row 6, col 0.\n\n3.  **Noise and Cleanup**:\n    *   The input grids often contain \"debris\" or pre-existing shapes (e.g., solid blocks of 6s in Example 1, a partial shape of 1s in Example 2, or a shape of 4s in Example 3).\n    *   The transformation **clears the grid** to 0 (black) and only draws the shapes generated by valid markers.\n    *   Valid markers are isolated pixels of values 2, 3, 5, or 8. If a shape is present in the input but its corresponding marker is missing (like the box of 4s in Example 3 which lacks a marker 2), it is removed.\n\n### Application to Test Input\n\n1.  **Identify Markers**:\n    We scan the test input (20x20 grid) for markers. The only valid markers present are **8s**.\n    The positions of the 8s are:\n    *   **Row 1**: Cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n    *   **Row 5**: Cols 0, 16.\n    *   **Row 9**: Cols 0, 8, 16.\n    *   **Row 13**: Cols 0, 12, 16.\n    *   **Row 17**: Cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n\n    *Note: There is a pre-existing orange (7) \"X\" shape at Row 5, Col 4. However, there is no marker '8' at (5,4) to generate it. Based on the rules (specifically Example 3), this pre-existing shape is treated as debris and removed.*\n\n2.  **Generate Output**:\n    We create a blank 20x20 grid and draw the 4x4 \"X\" shape (color 7) at each marker location.\n    \n    *   **Row 1 markers**: Generate a continuous strip of patterns from row 1 to 4.\n    *   **Row 5 markers**: Generate patterns at the left and right edges (cols 0-3 and 16-19).\n    *   **Row 9 markers**: Generate patterns at edges and the center (cols 8-11).\n    *   **Row 13 markers**: Generate patterns at edges and col 12-15.\n    *   **Row 17 markers**: Generate a continuous strip starting at row 17. Since the grid ends at row 19, the 4th row of these shapes (which would be at row 20) is clipped.\n\n### Completed Output Grid Construction\n\n*   **Row 0**: All 0s.\n*   **Rows 1-4**: Five shapes side-by-side.\n*   **Rows 5-8**: Shapes at far left and far right. Center area is 0s.\n*   **Rows 9-12**: Shapes at left, middle, right.\n*   **Rows 13-16**: Shapes at left, (gap), right-middle, right.\n*   **Rows 17-19**: Five shapes side-by-side, bottom row clipped.\n\nHere is the final output grid:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0",

Each marker value maps to a specific 4x4 pattern with a specific color:\n   - Marker 2 \u2192 hollow rectangle (color 4)\n   - Marker 3 \u2192 hollow X corners (color 1)  \n   - Marker 5 \u2192 diagonal blocks (color 6)\n   - Marker 8 \u2192 X pattern (color 7)\n\n3. If there's an original shape in the input, it corresponds to one of these predefined patterns\n\nFor the test input:\n- Markers are at rows 1, 5, 9, 13, 17 and columns 0, 4, 8, 12, 16\n- Most markers are 8\n- There's a 7-colored X pattern at rows 5-8, cols 4-7 (this matches the pattern for marker 8)\n- Some cells have no marker (value 0) and should remain empty\n\nThe marker grid is:\n```\n8 8 8 8 8\n8 [shape] 0 0 8\n8 0 8 0 8\n8 0 0 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8\n```\n\nFor marker 8 and the shape position, I place the 7 X pattern:\n```\n7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7\n```\n\nFor marker 0 positions, the cell remains empty.\n\n```json\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation:\n\n1. **Grid Structure**: The input has a grid defined by marker positions (single colored pixels) at regular intervals\n2. **Shape Template**: There's a 4x4 pattern defined somewhere in the input\n3. **Marker-to-Pattern Mapping**: Each marker color maps to a specific output color and pattern:\n   - 2 \u2192 4 (hollow square pattern)\n   - 3 \u2192 1 (edge outline pattern)\n   - 5 \u2192 6 (diagonal 2x2 blocks pattern)\n   - 8 \u2192 7 (X/cross pattern)\n\n4. **Drawing Rule**: For each grid cell with a marker, draw the corresponding pattern. Cells without markers (including the original shape location if no marker exists there) are left empty.\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n\n- Grid markers are at rows 1, 5, 9, 13, 17 and cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 (5\u00d75 grid of 4\u00d74 cells)\n- The 7-shape at (5,4)-(8,7) defines the X/cross pattern for marker 8\n- All markers are 8s, which map to 7-patterns\n\n**Marker positions:**\n- Row 1: 8 at all columns (0,4,8,12,16)\n- Row 5: 8 at cols 0,16; shape (no marker) at col 4; empty at cols 8,12\n- Row 9: 8 at cols 0,8,16; empty at cols 4,12\n- Row 13: 8 at cols 0,12,16; empty at cols 4,8\n- Row 17: 8 at all columns (0,4,8,12,16)\n\nThe 7-pattern (X/cross):\n```\n7 0 0 7\n0 7 7 0\n0 7 7 0\n7 0 0 7\n```\n\nDrawing patterns at marker positions and leaving empty cells where there's no marker:\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Identify the basic patterns from the solved examples**\n\nAcross the four training examples, all outputs are made from just four distinct 4\u00d74 patterns, always aligned so that their top\u2011left corner is at a \u201cmarker\u201d cell in the input. I\u2019ll denote them by their geometry (using the output color that appears in the examples):\n\n- **Pattern P2 (hollow square)** \u2014 color 4  \n  ```\n  4 4 4 4\n  4 0 0 4\n  4 0 0 4\n  4 4 4 4\n  ```\n  Seen in:\n  - Example 3 input (as a template in color 4) and output at each 2.\n  - Example 1, 2, 4 outputs at each input color 2.\n\n- **Pattern P1 (diamond-ish)** \u2014 color 1  \n  ```\n  0 1 1 0\n  1 0 0 1\n  1 0 0 1\n  0 1 1 0\n  ```\n  Seen in:\n  - Example 2 input (as a template in color 1) around a 3, and output at each 3.\n  - Example 1 and 4 outputs at each input color 3.\n\n- **Pattern P3 (two diagonal 2\u00d72 blocks)** \u2014 color 6  \n  ```\n  6 6 0 0\n  6 6 0 0\n  0 0 6 6\n  0 0 6 6\n  ```\n  Seen in:\n  - Example 1 input as a cluster of 6s (template), and in output at certain 5s.\n  - Example 4 outputs at every input 5.\n\n- **Pattern P4 (corners + central 2\u00d72)** \u2014 color 7  \n  ```\n  7 0 0 7\n  0 7 7 0\n  0 7 7 0\n  7 0 0 7\n  ```\n  Seen in:\n  - Example 4 outputs at each input 8 (no template in input).\n  - The test input has exactly this shape in color 7 at rows 5\u20138, cols 4\u20137.\n\n2. **Map marker colors \u2192 patterns**\n\nFrom the examples, the mapping is consistent:\n\n- Input color **2** \u2192 pattern **P2**, drawn in color **4**.\n- Input color **3** \u2192 pattern **P1**, drawn in color **1**.\n- Input color **5** \u2192 pattern **P3**, drawn in color **6**.\n- Input color **8** \u2192 pattern **P4**, drawn in color **7**.\n\nThe colors 1,4,6,7 are \u201cpattern colors\u201d (used to draw the shapes); 2,3,5,8 are \u201cmarker colors\u201d.\n\n3. **Placement rules**\n\nFrom all examples:\n\n- For each marker cell of one of the marker colors, place the corresponding 4\u00d74 pattern with its **top\u2011left corner at that cell**, as long as the whole 4\u00d74 block fits inside the grid.\n  - Example 2: the 3 at (9,9) does nothing because a 4\u00d74 from (9,9) would go off the 10\u00d710 grid.\n  - Example 4: all markers are at rows/cols 0,4,8,12,16, so every 4\u00d74 fits.\n- If the pattern does not fit (i.e. row > H\u22124 or col > W\u22124), **ignore that marker**.\n- The final grid is made **only** of these patterns; original markers and any template shapes in the input are removed (Example 3: the original 4\u00d74 hollow square at the top\u2011left disappears; Example 1: original P3 cluster of 6s disappears). Effectively we start from an all\u20110 grid and stamp patterns.\n\n4. **Apply to the test input**\n\nThe test grid is 20\u00d720.\n\n**Non-zero colors in test input:**\n\n- Color **7**: forms a 4\u00d74 block at rows 5\u20138, cols 4\u20137:\n\n  ```\n  rows 5\u20138, cols 4\u20137:\n  7 0 0 7\n  0 7 7 0\n  0 7 7 0\n  7 0 0 7\n  ```\n\n  This is exactly pattern **P4**, in color 7. This serves as an in\u2011input example of P4 but, by the global rule, **it is not copied unless its color\u2019s marker (8) appears there**. It will be removed in the output if no stamp lands there.\n\n- Color **8**: appears at the following coordinates (row, col) (0\u2011based indices):\n\n  - Row 1: (1,0), (1,4), (1,8), (1,12), (1,16)\n  - Row 5: (5,0), (5,16)\n  - Row 9: (9,0), (9,8), (9,16)\n  - Row 13: (13,0), (13,12), (13,16)\n  - Row 17: (17,0), (17,4), (17,8), (17,12), (17,16)\n\nAccording to the learned mapping, each 8 should generate a **P4** stamp (pattern of 7s) with its top\u2011left at that cell, **if** the 4\u00d74 fits.\n\n- The grid size is 20\u00d720, so valid top\u2011left anchors satisfy row \u2264 16, col \u2264 16.\n- Thus, **all 8s in row 17 are invalid** as anchors (17+3=20, off the bottom), so those markers are ignored.\n- All 8s in rows 1,5,9,13 are valid (rows 1,5,9,13 \u226416; cols 0,4,8,12,16 \u226416).\n\nSo we will stamp P4 at these anchors:\n\n- A: (1,0)\n- B: (1,4)\n- C: (1,8)\n- D: (1,12)\n- E: (1,16)\n- F: (5,0)\n- G: (5,16)\n- H: (9,0)\n- I: (9,8)\n- J: (9,16)\n- K: (13,0)\n- L: (13,12)\n- M: (13,16)\n\n**Pattern P4 coordinates relative to anchor (r,c):**\n\nWe place 7 at:\n- (r+0, c+0), (r+0, c+3)\n- (r+1, c+1), (r+1, c+2)\n- (r+2, c+1), (r+2, c+2)\n- (r+3, c+0), (r+3, c+3)\n\nStamping each of the valid anchors, and knowing there is no overlap (the anchors are spaced so each 4\u00d74 region is disjoint), we get the following 7\u2011positions by row:\n\n- Row 0: none\n- Row 1: from A\u2013E \u2192 cols 0,3,4,7,8,11,12,15,16,19\n- Row 2: from A\u2013E \u2192 cols 1,2,5,6,9,10,13,14,17,18\n- Row 3: same as row 2\n- Row 4: same as row 1\n- Row 5: from F,G \u2192 cols 0,3,16,19\n- Row 6: from F,G \u2192 cols 1,2,17,18\n- Row 7: same as row 6\n- Row 8: same as row 5\n- Row 9: from H,I,J \u2192 cols 0,3,8,11,16,19\n- Row 10: from H,I,J \u2192 cols 1,2,9,10,17,18\n- Row 11: same as row 10\n- Row 12: same as row 9\n- Row 13: from K,L,M \u2192 cols 0,3,12,15,16,19\n- Row 14: from K,L,M \u2192 cols 1,2,13,14,17,18\n- Row 15: same as row 14\n- Row 16: same as row 13\n- Rows 17\u201319: none, because row\u201117 markers are invalid and we start from 0.\n\nThe original P4 of 7s at rows 5\u20138, cols 4\u20137 is **not** tied to any 8 marker, so under the learned rule it is removed (just like the original hollow square in Example 3).\n\n5. **Final output grid**\n\nNow write each row as 20 comma\u2011separated integers (0 or 7):\n\nRow 0:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 1:\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 2:\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 3:\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 4:\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 5:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 6:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 7:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 8:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 9:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 10:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 11:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 12:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 13:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 14:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 15:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 16:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 17:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 18:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 19:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "First I\u2019ll describe the pattern that\u2019s common to the training examples, then apply it to the test input.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the training examples are doing\n\nAcross the examples you can see that the outputs are built from a small set of **fixed 4\u00d74 patterns (\u201ctiles\u201d)**, always in the same colors and shapes:\n\n### The four 4\u00d74 tiles\n\nI\u2019ll write `x` for a colored cell and `.` for 0.\n\n1. **Tile A (border square, color 4)**  \n\n   ```\n   xxxx\n   x..x\n   x..x\n   xxxx\n   ```\n\n2. **Tile B (ring without corners, color 1)**  \n\n   ```\n   .xx.\n   x..x\n   x..x\n   .xx.\n   ```\n\n3. **Tile C (two 2\u00d72 blocks on the main diagonal, color 6)**  \n\n   ```\n   xx..\n   xx..\n   ..xx\n   ..xx\n   ```\n\n4. **Tile D (corners + central 2\u00d72 block, color 7)**  \n\n   ```\n   x..x\n   .xx.\n   .xx.\n   x..x\n   ```\n\nYou see these clearly in Example 4\u2019s output: it is a 5\u00d75 grid of 4\u00d74 tiles; each input number from {2,3,5,8} selects one of the four tiles:\n\n- Input 2 \u2192 Tile A (color 4)\n- Input 3 \u2192 Tile B (color 1)\n- Input 5 \u2192 Tile C (color 6)\n- Input 8 \u2192 Tile D (color 7)\n\nExample 2 and Example 1 show only some of these tiles (because their inputs use only some of the codes), but the mapping is consistent:\n\n- In Example 2:\n  - Input cells with value 2 generate Tile A (4s) at that location.\n  - Input cells with value 3 generate Tile B (1s) at that location.\n- In Example 3:\n  - We see Tile A (4s) replicated at each input 2-cell, except for the one 2-cell that is used as the \u201ctraining\u201d association with the prototype 4\u00d74 square in the input.\n- In Example 1:\n  - Input 2s produce Tile A (4s).\n  - Input 3s produce Tile B (1s).\n  - Input 5s produce Tile C (6s), again except for a single 5 which is used adjacent to a prototype pattern of 6s to \u201cdefine\u201d the mapping 5\u2192Tile C.\n\nThose \u201cprototype shapes\u201d (clusters of 4s, 1s, 6s etc. in the inputs) are just there to show what each tile looks like; the outputs themselves are constructed only from the code colors {2,3,5,8}, using the dictionary above. Where a code is too close to the bottom or right border so that a full 4\u00d74 tile would not fit, it is simply ignored (as in Example 2 for the 3 at the bottom-right).\n\nSo the operational rule is:\n\n> Start with an all\u2011zero grid.  \n> For every cell whose value is 2, 3, 5, or 8, if a 4\u00d74 tile placed with its top-left corner at that cell fits entirely inside the grid, draw the corresponding 4\u00d74 tile there using colors 4,1,6,7 as per the mapping.  \n> Ignore all other input cells (including the \u201cprototype\u201d shapes).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Understand the test input\n\nTest input (20\u00d720) uses values 8 and 7:\n\n- Many **8s** laid out in a 5\u00d75 grid (rows 1,5,9,13,17; columns 0,4,8,12,16).\n- A cluster of **7s** forming exactly Tile D (4\u00d74 \u201ccorner+center\u201d pattern) at rows 5\u20138, columns 4\u20137.\n\nGiven the training, we interpret:\n\n- 8 is a **code** value, which should generate **Tile D** (color 7).\n- 7s here are **a prototype shape** for Tile D and are not themselves codes, so they should not directly appear in the output unless overlapped by a tile.\n\nWe also must apply the border rule: a 4\u00d74 tile with top-left at (r,c) fits only if `r+3 \u2264 19` and `c+3 \u2264 19`. That is, valid anchors must satisfy `r \u2264 16` and `c \u2264 16`.\n\n### 8-cells in the test input\n\nList all 8s and check whether their tile would fit:\n\n- Row 1: (1,0), (1,4), (1,8), (1,12), (1,16) \u2014 all valid (1 \u2264 16, columns \u2264 16).\n- Row 5: (5,0), (5,16) \u2014 valid.\n- Row 9: (9,0), (9,8), (9,16) \u2014 valid.\n- Row 13: (13,0), (13,12), (13,16) \u2014 valid.\n- Row 17: (17,0), (17,4), (17,8), (17,12), (17,16) \u2014 **invalid** (17+3 = 20 > 19), so we ignore these.\n\nNo other nonzero codes 2,3,5 appear, so we only need to draw Tile D at these 13 valid 8-cells.\n\nThe prototype 7-shape at rows 5\u20138, cols 4\u20137 is not at a code location, so under the rule we do **not** copy it; those 7s disappear in the output (unless some tile happens to overwrite that region, which in this case they do not).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Constructing the output\n\nWe start with a 20\u00d720 grid of 0s.\n\nFor each valid 8 at (r,c), we draw Tile D (color 7) with its top-left at (r,c):\n\nTile D pattern:\n\n- Row r:     7,0,0,7\n- Row r + 1: 0,7,7,0\n- Row r + 2: 0,7,7,0\n- Row r + 3: 7,0,0,7\n\nBecause the 8s are spaced every 4 cells both horizontally and vertically, these 4\u00d74 tiles **abut but do not overlap**, so we can just place them all; between them and at top/bottom there remain all-0 rows/segments.\n\nDoing this for all valid 8s yields:\n\n- Row 0: no tile covers it \u2192 all 0.\n- Rows 1\u20134: a full row of tiles across columns 0\u201319.\n- Rows 5\u20138: tiles only at columns 0\u20133 and 16\u201319.\n- Rows 9\u201312: tiles at columns 0\u20133, 8\u201311, 16\u201319.\n- Rows 13\u201316: tiles at columns 0\u20133, 12\u201315, 16\u201319.\n- Rows 17\u201319: no tiles \u2192 all 0.\n\nWriting the resulting grid explicitly:\n\nRow 0:\n`0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 1 (dr0 repeated 5\u00d7):\n`7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7`\n\nRow 2 (dr1 repeated 5\u00d7):\n`0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0`\n\nRow 3 (same as row 2):\n`0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0`\n\nRow 4 (same as row 1):\n`7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7`\n\nRow 5 (tiles at c=0 and c=16):\n`7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7`\n\nRow 6:\n`0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0`\n\nRow 7 (same as row 6):\n`0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0`\n\nRow 8 (same as row 5):\n`7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7`\n\nRow 9 (tiles at c=0,8,16):\n`7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7`\n\nRow 10:\n`0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0`\n\nRow 11 (same as row 10):\n`0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0`\n\nRow 12 (same as row 9):\n`7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7`\n\nRow 13 (tiles at c=0,12,16):\n`7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7`\n\nRow 14:\n`0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0`\n\nRow 15 (same as row 14):\n`0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0`\n\nRow 16 (same as row 13):\n`7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7`\n\nRow 17:\n`0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 18:\n`0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 19:\n`0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\nHere is the completed output grid in the required format:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "From the four solved pairs you can see that the output is built from standard 4\u00d74 \u201cstamps\u201d. Only the input colours 2,\u202f3,\u202f5 and\u202f8 are used; other input values are ignored. Each of those four input values maps to a fixed stamp and output colour:\n\n- 2 \u2192 colour\u202f4, full hollow square  \n  ```\n  4 4 4 4\n  4 0 0 4\n  4 0 0 4\n  4 4 4 4\n  ```\n- 3 \u2192 colour\u202f1, border without the corners  \n  ```\n  0 1 1 0\n  1 0 0 1\n  1 0 0 1\n  0 1 1 0\n  ```\n- 5 \u2192 colour\u202f6, two filled 2\u00d72 blocks on the main diagonal  \n  ```\n  6 6 0 0\n  6 6 0 0\n  0 0 6 6\n  0 0 6 6\n  ```\n- 8 \u2192 colour\u202f7, corners and centre filled  \n  ```\n  7 0 0 7\n  0 7 7 0\n  0 7 7 0\n  7 0 0 7\n  ```\n\nStamps are placed with their top\u2011left corner at the coordinate of the triggering input cell. Processing is done from bottom rows to top so that earlier stamps can block later ones: before placing a stamp you check that the 4\u00d74 area lies wholly inside the grid and that none of its cells in the output are already non\u2011zero. If either condition fails the stamp is skipped. The output starts as all zeros and only these stamps are drawn.\n\nIn the test grid only value\u202f8 is relevant. The 8s on row\u202f17 would overrun the bottom of the grid so they are skipped; the rest fit and do not overlap. Ignoring the input 7\u2011pattern, the resulting output grid is:\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "The outputs in the examples are created by laying down fixed 4\u00d74 motifs at the positions of certain input colours. Each input colour has its own motif drawn in a fixed output colour:\n\n* 2 \u2192 hollow 4\u00d74 square border of colour\u202f4.\n* 3 \u2192 4\u00d74 border without the corners of colour\u202f1.\n* 5 \u2192 two 2\u00d72 blocks in the top\u2011left and bottom\u2011right of a 4\u00d74 of colour\u202f6.\n* 8 \u2192 an \u2018X\u2019 across a 4\u00d74 (both diagonals) of colour\u202f7.\n\nThe motifs are anchored with their top\u2011left corner at the input pixel. Drawing proceeds over an initially empty grid, and a motif is only placed if none of its cells would overwrite an already\u2011drawn non\u2011zero; otherwise it is skipped. When a motif would extend beyond the grid, it is simply clipped to the grid. All other input colours are ignored.\n\nIn the test grid only colour\u202f8 appears among the triggering colours, so we place the 4\u00d74 \u201cX\u201d motif of colour\u202f7 at each 8, clipping those anchored at row\u202f18 to the bottom of the grid. The resulting 20\u00d720 output grid is:\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n```",
