        "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment & Strategy**\n\nOkay, so the task is to figure out the rules of this ARC puzzle based on a few examples, and I've got to explain my thinking as if it's all one coherent thought process. The core seems to be predicting the movement of some special pixel (the \"agent\") within a grid, based on the grid's initial state and some encoded \"clue\" within the same grid. I'm going to start by breaking down each example, identify the core elements, and look for patterns. The dimensions of the input/output grids (20x20) are the same, which is good.\n\n**Example 1 Breakdown**\n\nExample 1 is where I am starting, and this grid seems to contain several distinct objects, so I need to understand them.  The pixels have colors (numbers), and some groups look like \"objects\" because they are made of connected pixels of the same color.  I'm trying to figure out which pixels are important to figure out how other pixels move.\n\n*   **Identifying the Objects**:\n    *   Top-left: There's a 5x5 box with an inner pattern. Seems important. Color 7 (orange).\n    *   Top-right: Another 5x5 box, but color 5 (grey) with a different inner pattern. Still important, I think.\n    *   Center: A more irregular shape, also color 7. This is the \"room\".\n    *   There is a yellow pixel at (6,9) that seems to move. It's inside the room made of color 7.\n*   **The Yellow Pixel Agent**:  I can see that a yellow pixel (color 4) is moving. It goes from (6, 9) to (6, 11). Another one at (10, 4) goes to (10, 8). Interesting that they always move horizontally right.\n*   **Key Idea: Structure and Movement**: The yellow agents seem to be confined within the orange (7) structures and move. The patterns inside the 5x5 boxes might relate to that movement.\n\n**Analyzing the \"Keys\" (Inner Patterns in 5x5 Boxes)**\n\nThe patterns inside those 5x5 boxes in Example 1, or those \"keys\", have to have some meaning. I'm going to look deeper into it.\n\n*   Orange Key (Color 7): Inside pattern of `1, 1, 2`. Blue (1) and Red (2).  Are they telling the pixels what to do?\n*   Grey Key (Color 5): `2, 1, 1`. The pixel that moves in grey enclosure.\n\nMy first guess is that the key inside each structure (5x5 box) might directly influence the motion of the agent inside each respective structure (room). Let's see if that's what's going on.\n\n**Hypothesis: Key-Based Movement**\n\n*   I'm thinking the 1s and 2s are directions. Maybe 2 means \"right\" and 1 \"stay\" or something. This does seem consistent with the movements in the Orange key (Right) and Grey key (Left).\n\n**Further Analysis and Refinement**\n\nOkay, there is more that I can tell now:\n\n*   The Orange pixel (moved right): Input: (6, 9) Output: (6, 11), +2. (10, 4) -> (10, 8) +4. The key is `1,1,2`, so 2 is associated with +2.  Seems that there could be some formula to get that value.\n*   The grey pixel (moving left): Input: (15, 4) to (15, 2) to get -2, and (16, 13) to (16, 7) to get -6 or -4 (this one is confusing). The key is `2,1,1` so 2 is associated with -2 and -4.\n\nIs there a pattern? Ok, The orange agents moved to adjacent walls, so 2 can also mean slide to the right wall, which is +2 and +4 from where they started. The grey agents moved until they hit a left wall: -2 and -6, where 6,18 ->7? Or is this relative? I am still not clear on what's going on here.\n\n**Checking the Walls**\n\nOkay, I need to see what this has to do with walls:\n\n*   The Orange pixels move to the right until they hit a wall.\n*   The Grey pixels move to the left until they hit a wall.\n*   The 2s in the keys seem to be linked to the movements\n\nBased on the solved examples, the puzzle logic is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Structures**: The grid contains structures made of specific colors (e.g., Pink/6, Green/3, Orange/7, Grey/5). Inside these structures or bounded areas, there are yellow pixels (value 4) which act as \"agents\".\n\n2.  **Identify Keys**: For each structure color, there is a distinct rectangular \"key\" block (usually 5x5 or similar) that contains the structure's color and a pattern of inner pixels with values 1 (Blue) and 2 (Red).\n    *   **Direction Decoding**: The position of the **Red (2)** pixels within the key's interior determines the direction of movement for the agents of that color.\n        *   If '2' is on the **Right** (relative to the key's center), the direction includes **Right**.\n        *   If '2' is on the **Left**, the direction includes **Left**.\n        *   If '2' is at the **Top**, the direction includes **Up**.\n        *   If '2' is at the **Bottom**, the direction includes **Down**.\n        *   If there are multiple '2's, the directions are combined (e.g., Top and Left becomes Up-Left).\n\n3.  **Apply Transformation**: All yellow agents (4) associated with a structure color move in the decoded direction until they act adjacent to a wall (a pixel of the structure's color or the grid boundary). They \"slide\" in the given direction as far as possible without overlapping a wall.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Pink Structure (Color 6)**:\n    *   **Key**: The 5x5 box at the top-left (Rows 0-4, Cols 0-4).\n    *   **Pattern**: Row 1 of the interior (Grid Row 1) contains `2, 6, 2`. The '2's are at the top-left and top-right of the interior.\n    *   **Direction**: The '2's are in the top row, signifying **UP**. (The Left/Right components cancel out or imply a spread that defaults to the vertical component 'Up' as seen in Example 1).\n    *   **Agents**:\n        *   Agent at (5, 16): Moves **UP** until adjacent to the wall at (3, 16). New position: **(4, 16)**.\n        *   Agent at (8, 18): Moves **UP** until adjacent to the wall at (1, 18). New position: **(2, 18)**.\n\n*   **Green Structure (Color 3)**:\n    *   **Key**: The 5x7 block at the bottom-right (Rows 15-19, Cols 13-19).\n    *   **Pattern**: Row 15 (Top of block) has a '2' at the center (`...3,2,3...`). Row 16 has a '2' at the left (`...2,3...`).\n    *   **Direction**: The '2's indicate **UP** and **LEFT**. Combined direction: **UP-LEFT** (Diagonal).\n    *   **Agents**:\n        *   Agent at (7, 9): Moves **UP-LEFT** (diagonal steps) -> (6, 8) -> (5, 7). The next step (4, 6) is a wall (3). New position: **(5, 7)**.\n        *   Agent at (8, 11): Moves **UP-LEFT** -> (7, 10) -> (6, 9) -> (5, 8) -> (4, 7). The next step (3, 6) is a wall.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Understanding the Task & Initial Observations:**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at these grids, and it seems like there are various shapes and colors involved.  The main thing I'm picking up on is the yellow pixels (color 4) that are doing some kind of movement.  In the examples, it looks like these yellow pixels are *contained* within shapes and then *relocate*. There are also these \"reference boxes\" which could hold the key. Let's dig in.\n\n**Analyzing Example 1 and Hypothesizing the Core Logic:**\n\nExample 1 has shapes with colors 7 and 5, and the key is tracing the yellow pixels (4). They seem to move horizontally, sometimes left, sometimes right. Then, there's a connection to shapes around those 4 pixels. The 7 and 5 shapes each appear with inside a smaller shape:  a box with 1's and 2's.\n\nI hypothesize that the 4s move relative to these boxes. The content of those little boxes (with the 1's and 2's inside the larger ones) may be dictating the move. The 1s represent an empty space. Maybe the 2's indicate a shift?\n\n**More Hypothesis Refinement Based on Example 1:**\n\nI am seeing clear movement based on the 1s and the 2s and the enclosed shapes. The 2s in these \"reference\" boxes are actually indicating the *direction* of movement for the 4s. The 4s move to the end of open space in that direction, based on the shape color.\n\n*   If the 2 is on the right, the 4 moves right.\n*   If the 2 is on the left, the 4 moves left.\n\nThis directional movement seems to be the core idea. I am now looking at coordinates to check this.\n\n**Examining Example 2 for Directional Confirmation:**\n\nExample 2 reinforces the idea of directional movement. I see the same patterns of walls surrounding the 4's. The 4's are no longer just shifting horizontal, now moving diagonal in the example. So, in the new hypothesis. If the pattern is from bottom-right to top-left, the move is UP-LEFT.\n\n**Example 3 and Solidifying the Rule:**\n\nIn Example 3, I am seeing a clear down movement because of the bottom location of the `2` in the reference box. Now I understand: these 1's and 2's point to the *final* location of the yellow pixel (4). This finalizes my understanding of the direction and walls.\n\n**Summary of the Rule:**\n\n1.  Find the \"reference boxes.\"\n2.  Use the `2` relative position (compared to `1`s) inside the box to calculate the direction.\n3.  Move each `4` pixel within the shape in that direction, through any empty space.\n4.  Stop at a \"wall\" or edge.\n\n**Applying the Rule to the Test Input:**\n\nI apply my logic to the input grid. First, I identify the 6 and 3 reference blocks and the 4's location within. The block with the 6's has the 2 on top of the 1s. This means a UP movement. The block with the 3's points also UP. I find the 4's. Then I trace up to the first stopping point (a non-0 or wall) in the path.\n\n**Building the Output:**\n\nI place the new 4 locations, clearing out the originals.\n\n**Final Check and Output:**\n\nOkay, I make some checks again. The numbers make sense. I verify the walls. It looks correct. I create the transformed output grid.\n\n\nThe problem involves moving the yellow pixels (color 4) based on directional cues provided by \"reference blocks\" in the grid.\n\n**Logic:**\n1.  **Reference Blocks:** The grid contains specific rectangular structures (usually 5x5) made of a specific color (e.g., 6 or 3) that act as keys. Inside these blocks, there are pixels of color 1 (blue) and 2 (red). The spatial arrangement of 1s and 2s defines a movement vector:\n    *   The direction is from **1 to 2**.\n    *   In the Test Input, the top-left block (color 6) has 2s in the top row of its interior and 1s below. This indicates a direction of **UP**.\n    *   The bottom-right block (color 3) has 2s in the upper section and 1s in the lower section. This also indicates a direction of **UP**.\n2.  **Movement:** Every yellow pixel (4) is contained within a \"room\" or vertical/horizontal channel defined by one of the reference colors. The yellow pixel moves in the direction specified by its container's color reference block.\n3.  **Pathfinding:** The yellow pixel travels through empty space (0) in the specified direction until it hits a wall (a non-zero pixel). It settles in the last empty cell before the wall.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\nThe direction for both Color 6 and Color 3 enclosures is **UP**.\n\n*   **Pixel at (5, 16)** (inside color 6): Moves UP. The first wall above is at row 3 (color 6). It stops at **(4, 16)**.\n*   **Pixel at (7, 9)** (inside color 3): Moves UP. The first wall above is at row 1 (color 3). It stops at **(2, 9)**.\n*   **Pixel at (8, 11)** (inside color 3): Moves UP. The first wall above is at row 1 (color 3). It stops at **(2, 11)**.\n*   **Pixel at (8, 18)** (inside color 6): Moves UP. The first wall above is at row 1 (color 6). It stops at **(2, 18)**.\n*   **Pixel at (13, 6)** (inside color 3): Moves UP. The first wall above is at row 10 (color 3). It stops at **(11, 6)**.\n*   **Pixel at (17, 5)** (inside color 3): Moves UP. The first wall above is at row 10 (color 3). It stops at **(11, 5)**.\n\nAll original yellow pixels are removed (become 0) and placed at their new coordinates.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,4,0,4,0,3,0,0,6,0,4,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,6,6,6,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,0,4,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,0,6\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,3,4,4,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3",

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to analyze the solved examples to understand the transformation pattern.\n\n**Key observations from examples:**\n\n1. There are \"template\" patterns in corners made of solid colored rectangles (5s, 7s, or 6s) containing internal patterns with 1s and 2s.\n\n2. There are irregular regions bounded by the same colors (5s, 7s, etc.) elsewhere in the grid, containing 4s.\n\n3. The transformation moves each 4 within its bounded region based on the template pattern.\n\n4. The direction of movement is determined by the position of 2 relative to 1 in the template:\n   - Example 1: 7-template has \"1,1,2\" (2 is RIGHT of 1s) \u2192 4s in 7-regions move RIGHT\n   - Example 1: 5-template has \"2,1,1\" (2 is LEFT of 1s) \u2192 4s in 5-regions move LEFT\n   - Example 3: 5-template has 2s BELOW 1s \u2192 4s move DOWN\n\n5. The 4 moves in that direction until it's adjacent to the region boundary.\n\n**Applying to test input:**\n\n**Templates identified:**\n- 6-template (top-left): 2s are ABOVE 1s \u2192 direction is UP\n- 3-template (bottom-right): 2s are UP-LEFT of 1s \u2192 direction is UP-LEFT\n\n**4s to move:**\n- (5,16) in 6-region \u2192 moves UP to (4,16)\n- (8,18) in 6-region \u2192 moves UP to (2,18)\n- (7,9) in 3-region \u2192 moves UP-LEFT to (5,7)\n- (8,11) in 3-region \u2192 moves UP-LEFT to (4,7)\n- (13,6) in 3-region \u2192 moves UP-LEFT to (12,5)\n- (17,5) in 3-region \u2192 moves UP-LEFT to (15,3)\n\n```\n6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,6,0,4,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,6,6,6,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,0,4,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,0,6\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "To solve this family of tasks I looked at what actually changed between the given inputs and outputs. In all three examples nothing but the cells of colour\u202f4 ever moved. The rest of each grid was untouched. The movement was not arbitrary: in each training example the small pattern of 1s and 2s embedded in the main coloured region defines a direction vector \u2013 the vector from the average position of the 1s to the average position of the 2s. For the left blue 7\u2011region in example\u202f1 that vector points right; for the red 5\u2011region it points left. In example\u202f2 the 1\u21922 vector points down\u2011right; in example\u202f3 it points straight down.\n\nEach 4 is associated with the nearest \u201cbase\u201d colour (any non\u2011zero colour other than 1,\u202f2 or 4). It is then slid step by step along that base colour\u2019s arrow direction until the next cell in that direction would be outside the grid or non\u2011zero; it stops on the last zero before that obstacle. The original 4 is erased and a 4 is written at the new position.\n\nIn the test grid there are two base colours. The cluster of 1s and 2s in the top\u2011left six\u2011block lies in the 6\u2011region; their mean gives a direction of up. The cluster of 1s and 2s in the lower 3\u2011region gives a direction of up\u2011left. Associating each 4 with the nearest base colour and sliding accordingly yields the following output:\n\n6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,6,0,4,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,6,6,6,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,0,4,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,0,6\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3",

        "Full raw LLM response": "The training pairs show that nothing in the grids changes except the position of the cells with value\u202f4. For each colour region there is a little \u201carrow\u201d drawn into it in the form\n\n```\nC,1,1,2,C\n```\n\nlying along a straight line (horizontal, vertical or diagonal), where C is the colour of that region. The direction from the pair of 1\u202fs towards the 2 defines the direction of motion for that colour: every 4 associated with that colour is slid step by step along that direction through zeroes until just before the first non\u2011zero cell is reached, and the original 4 is erased.\n\nIn the test grid there are two such arrows. In the 6\u2011coloured region, columns\u202f2 and\u202f4 contain vertical patterns 6,1,1,2,6, so the direction for colour\u202f6 is north. In the 3\u2011coloured region there are diagonal patterns 3,1,1,2,3 running from bottom\u2011right to top\u2011left (direction north\u2011west). Each 4 is assigned to the nearer coloured region: the two 4s adjacent to 6s move north, the remaining four near the 3\u2011region move north\u2011west. Moving each 4 along its assigned direction until just before the first non\u2011zero yields the output below.\n\nOutput grid:\n6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,6,0,4,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,6,6,6,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,0,4,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,0,6\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3",

        "Full raw LLM response": "From the three solved examples, the only cells that ever change are those of color 4.  \nAll other colors remain fixed. So the task is: **move each 4 to a new position**, according to a rule.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Finding the direction of motion\n\nIn each training task there are small patterns of 1s and 2s embedded inside a larger region of a single main color:\n\n- Example 1: 1s and 2s inside a big 7\u2013region and a big 5\u2013region.\n- Example 2: 1s and 2s inside a 5\u2013region.\n- Example 3: 1s and 2s inside a 5\u2013region.\n\nThe layout of 1s and 2s encodes a **direction vector**:\n\n- Compute the average position (barycenter) of all 1s in that region.\n- Compute the average position of all 2s in the same region.\n- The vector from the 1\u2011barycenter to the 2\u2011barycenter, reduced to signs of components, gives a discrete direction \\(D = (\\text{sign}(\\Delta r), \\text{sign}(\\Delta c))\\), which is one of\n  \\((0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0),(1,1),(-1,1),(1,-1),(-1,-1)\\).\n\nChecking the examples:\n\n- Example 1:\n  - In the left 7\u2011region, 1s are left of 2s \u21d2 \\(D = (0, +1)\\) (east).\n  - In the right 5\u2011region, 1s are right of 2s \u21d2 \\(D = (0, -1)\\) (west).\n  - 4s near the 7\u2011region move horizontally right; 4s near the 5\u2011region move horizontally left.\n- Example 2:\n  - 1s lie up\u2011left of 2s inside the 5\u2011block \u21d2 \\(D = (1,1)\\) (down\u2011right).\n  - Each 4 moves down\u2011right along that diagonal.\n- Example 3:\n  - 1s are above 2s \u21d2 \\(D = (1,0)\\) (down).\n  - Each 4 moves straight downward.\n\nSo: **each main colored region that contains 1s and 2s has its own direction \\(D\\) from 1s to 2s.**\n\n---\n\n## 2. How the 4s move along that direction\n\nFor each 4:\n\n1. Decide which main region it belongs to by the **nearest non\u2011zero color** (other than 4) around it.  \n   In the examples this always correctly assigns 4s to the nearest large 7/5/5 block.\n2. Take that region\u2019s direction vector \\(D\\).\n3. Starting from the 4\u2019s position, walk step\u2011by\u2011step along \\(D\\) (adding \\((dr,dc)\\) to the coordinates).\n4. As long as you are on 0s, keep going.\n5. When you reach the **first non\u2011zero cell** (in all examples this is in the main region\u2019s color), stop.  \n   Place the 4 on the **last 0 cell before that non\u2011zero**.\n6. The original 4 position becomes 0.\n\nThis reproduces all the example outputs:\n\n- Example 2, 4 at (10,4):\n  - \\(D=(1,1)\\). Path: (11,5)=0, (12,6)=0, (13,7)=5 \u21d2 stop; put 4 at (12,6).\n- Example 3, 4 at (7,6):\n  - \\(D=(1,0)\\). Path: (8,6)=0, (9,6)=0, (10,6)=0, (11,6)=5 \u21d2 stop; put 4 at (10,6).\n- Example 1:\n  - Left\u2011region \\(D=(0,1)\\), right\u2011region \\(D=(0,-1)\\).  \n    E.g. 4 at (11,5) in 7\u2011region: rightwards 0,0,0, then 7 at (11,10) \u21d2 place 4 at (11,9).\n\n---\n\n## 3.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning**\n\n1. **What changes between input and output?**  \n   In all three training examples, only the cells with value `4` move; all other colors stay fixed.  \n   The number of `4` cells is preserved.\n\n2. **How do the `4`s move?**  \n   Examining each example:\n\n   - The `4`s always move in a **straight line** (purely horizontal, purely vertical, or along a 45\u00b0 diagonal).\n   - For a given \u201cmain color region\u201d, all its `4`s move in the **same direction**.\n   - The direction is determined by a small pattern of `1`s and `2`s embedded inside a block of some main color.\n\n3. **Finding the direction from `1` and `2`:**\n\n   In every training grid there is at least one patch where a uniform color (like `5` or `7`) contains a small pattern of `1`s and `2`s.  \n  \n   For a given host color `h` (e.g. `5`, `7`):\n\n   - Collect all cells that are `1` and that have a 4-neighbor of color `h`.  \n     (These `1`s \u201cbelong\u201d to host color `h`.)\n   - Collect all cells that are `2` with a 4-neighbor of color `h`.\n   - Compute the centroids:\n     - \\( (r_1, c_1) \\) = average row and column of all those `1`s.\n     - \\( (r_2, c_2) \\) = average row and column of all those `2`s.\n   - Direction vector for color `h` is:\n     \\[\n     dr = \\text{sign}(r_2 - r_1), \\quad dc = \\text{sign}(c_2 - c_1)\n     \\]\n     So \\(dr,dc \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}\\).  \n     - Example2: `1`s above-left of `2`s \u2192 direction `(dr,dc) = (1,1)` (down-right).  \n     - Example3: `1`s above `2`s in same column \u2192 `(1,0)` (straight down).  \n     - Example1: color `7` has `1`s left of `2`s \u2192 `(0,1)` (right); color `5` has `1`s right of `2`s \u2192 `(0,-1)` (left).\n\n   This reproduces the directions in all training examples.\n\n4. **Assigning each `4` to a host color:**\n\n   There can be more than one host color with a direction (e.g. Example1 has `7` and `5`).  \n   For each `4`:\n\n   - Find which host color region it is closest to (by minimal Manhattan distance to any cell of that host color).\n   - That host color\u2019s direction vector \\((dr,dc)\\) is used for that `4`.\n\n   In Example1, `4`s near the big `7` block move right (direction from 7\u2019s `1\u21922`), those nearer the `5` blocks move left (from 5\u2019s `1\u21922`), exactly matching the outputs.\n\n5. **Sliding rule for a single `4`:**\n\n   Given a starting position \\((r,c)\\) for a `4` and direction \\((dr,dc)\\):\n\n   - Repeatedly:\n     - Look at the next cell \\((r+dr, c+dc)\\).\n     - If it is **outside the grid** or **non-zero** (any color other than `0`), **stop**.\n     - Otherwise (it is `0`), move the `4` there: update \\((r,c) := (r+dr, c+dc)\\) and repeat.\n   - The `4` ends on the **last `0` cell before the first non-zero** in that direction.\n\n   This exactly matches all training moves:\n   - Example3: vertical drops until just above a `5`.\n   - Example2: diagonal down-right slides until just before a `5`.\n   - Example1: horizontal slides left or right until just before `5`/`7`.\n\n6. **Apply this to the test grid**\n\n   **a. Identify host colors and their directions**\n\n   Colors present (besides `0` and `4`): `6`, `3`, `1`, `2`.  \n   Check which colors host `1` and `2` inside them:\n\n   - Top-left block (color `6`):\n     ```\n     6 2 6 2 6\n     6 1 6 1 6\n     6 1 6 1 6\n     6 6 6 6 6\n     ```\n     These `1`s and `2`s are embedded in color `6`.\n\n     1s of host 6: (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4)  \n     2s of host 6: (2,2), (2,4)\n\n     Centroids:\n     - 1s: \\( r_1 = (3+3+4+4)/4 = 3.5,\\ c_1 = (2+4+2+4)/4 = 3\\)\n     - 2s: \\( r_2 = (2+2)/2 = 2,\\ c_2 = (2+4)/2 = 3\\)\n\n     Vector from 1s to 2s:  \n     \\(r_2 - r_1 = -1.5 \\Rightarrow dr = -1\\) (up)  \n     \\(c_2 - c_1 = 0 \\Rightarrow dc = 0\\)\n\n     \u2192 **Direction for color 6: \\((dr,dc) = (-1,0)\\)** (straight up).\n\n   - Bottom-right block (color `3`):\n\n     1s: (17,18), (18,16), (18,19), (19,17)  \n     2s: (16,17), (17,15)\n\n     Centroids:\n     - 1s: \\( r_1 = (17+18+18+19)/4 = 18,\\ c_1 = (18+16+19+17)/4 = 17.5\\)\n     - 2s: \\( r_2 = (16+17)/2 = 16.5,\\ c_2 = (17+15)/2 = 16\\)\n\n     Vector:  \n     \\(r_2 - r_1 = -1.5 \\Rightarrow dr = -1\\) (up)  \n     \\(c_2 - c_1 = -1.5 \\Rightarrow dc = -1\\) (left)\n\n     \u2192 **Direction for color 3: \\((dr,dc) = (-1,-1)\\)** (up-left diagonal).\n\n   So:\n   - host color 6: move `4`s upward.\n   - host color 3: move `4`s up-left.\n\n   **b.
