Each of the moved components had exactly two colours: a \u201cfiller\u201d colour used several times and a single \u201cspecial\u201d pixel of a different colour. In each example there is also an isolated single\u2011pixel component of the special colour which acts as an anchor. The transformation is to translate every component containing that special colour so that its special pixel lies on the same row or the same column as the anchor, moving the whole component rigidly. If the anchor lies on the left or right border you align rows (vertical shift), if it lies on the top or bottom border you align columns (horizontal shift). The anchor itself doesn\u2019t move; other colours not involved in such components are left where they are.\n\nIn the test grid the background is 8. There are two special colours fitting the pattern: 6 has an isolated pixel at row\u202f4,\u202fcol\u202f1 and appears as the unique centre of several 4/3\u2011filled shapes; 4 has an isolated pixel at row\u202f11,\u202fcol\u202f1 and appears uniquely in one 6\u2011filled shape. Both anchors are on the left edge so I aligned rows. Each 6\u2011component was shifted vertically so its 6 landed on row\u202f4, carrying its fillers; the 4\u2011component was shifted so its 4 landed on row\u202f11. Isolated 2\u2019s and the anchors themselves stay put.

Identify multi\u2011color components and their centers\n\nCompute 4\u2011connected components of non\u20118 cells and look at color counts:\n\n- **Component A** (top left cap of 6s with a 4):\n  - Cells: `(1,4),(1,5),(1,6),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6)` with colors `6,6,6,6,4,6`.\n  - Minority color: a single `4` at `(2,5)` \u2192 center color 4.\n\n- **Component D** (near top right):\n  - Cells: `(2,14),(2,15),(2,16),(3,14),(3,15),(3,16),(4,15)`\n  - Colors: six 4\u2019s and one 6 at `(2,15)` \u2192 center color 6.\n\n- **Component E** (block of 4s with 6 at bottom, around col 4\u20136):\n  - Cells: `(6,5),(7,4),(7,5),(7,6),(8,4),(8,6),(9,4),(9,5),(9,6),(10,5)`\n  - Nine 4\u2019s and one 6 at `(10,5)` \u2192 center color 6.\n\n- **Component G** (4\u2019s around a 6 in the middle, near col 9\u201311):\n  - Cells: `(7,11),(8,9),(8,10),(8,11),(9,9),(9,10),(9,11),(10,11)`\n  - Seven 4\u2019s and one 6 at `(9,11)` \u2192 center color 6.\n\n- **Component H** (right\u2011side 3\u2019s with a 6 in the middle):\n  - Cells: `(7,18),(7,19),(7,20),(8,18),(8,20),(9,18),(9,20),(10,18),(10,19),(10,20)`\n  - Nine 3\u2019s and one 6 at `(10,19)` \u2192 center color 6.\n\nAll other non\u20118 singletons are just isolated 2\u2019s or the 4 at `(11,1)` or 6 at `(4,1)` (our anchors), not multi\u2011color patterns.\n\nSo pattern centers:\n\n- Color 4 center: `(2,5)` from component A.\n- Color 6 centers: `(2,15)` (D), `(10,5)` (E), `(9,11)` (G), `(10,19)` (H).\n\n#### 3. Compute translations from anchors\n\nAll relevant anchors are on the **left edge**, so we use **vertical alignment**:\n\n- **For color 4**: anchor at row 11 \u2192 every 4\u2011centered pattern has its center\u2019s row set to 11.\n  - Center `(2,5)` must move to `(11,5)`  \n    \u2192 \u0394row = 11 \u2212 2 = +9, \u0394col = 0 for component A.\n\n- **For color 6**: anchor at row 4 \u2192 every 6\u2011centered pattern has its center\u2019s row set to 4.\n  - D: center `(2,15)` \u2192 `(4,15)` \u2192 \u0394row = +2 (component D shifts down 2).\n  - E: center `(10,5)` \u2192 `(4,5)` \u2192 \u0394row = \u22126 (component E shifts up 6; its topmost 4 at row 6 moves to row 0 and disappears outside the grid; the visible part is still a translated copy).\n  - G: center `(9,11)` \u2192 `(4,11)` \u2192 \u0394row = \u22125 (component G shifts up 5).\n  - H: center `(10,19)` \u2192 `(4,19)` \u2192 \u0394row = \u22126 (component H shifts up 6).\n\nColumns are unchanged for all these moves.\n\nAll components are erased from their original positions and redrawn (translated) at their new positions; anchors remain where they were.\n\nNo component is centered on color 2, so the 2\u2019s do not move.\n\n#### 4. Resulting grid\n\nAfter removing the moved components from their original locations, then redrawing them with the above translations (and keeping the anchors and isolated 2\u2019s fixed), the final grid is:\n\nRow 1: 8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3  \nRow 2: 8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3  \nRow 3: 8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3  \nRow 4: 6,8,8,8,6,8,2,8,4,4,6,8,8,4,6,4,8,3,6,3  \nRow 5: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8  \nRow 6: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8  \nRow 7: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \nRow 8: 8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \nRow 9: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \nRow10: 8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \nRow11: 4,8,8,6,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \nRow12: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \nRow13: 2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2  \nRow14: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\n---\n\n### Final output grid\n\nHere is the output grid in the required format:\n\n8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3  \n8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3  \n8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3  \n6,8,8,8,6,8,2,8,4,4,6,8,8,4,6,4,8,3,6,3  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n4,8,8,6,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_G>\n<REASONING_MODEL_H model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_8_step_5_image\">\nLooking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n1. In each example, there are \"patterns\" (shapes made of one color with a different colored marker inside)\n2. There are also \"lone markers\" - isolated single cells of specific colors at the grid edges\n3. When a lone marker is at column 0 (left edge), patterns shift **vertically** to align their internal marker to the same row as the lone marker\n4. When a lone marker is at row 0 or bottom (top/bottom edge), patterns shift **horizontally** to align their internal marker to the same column\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n- Lone 6 at (3, 0) - indicates patterns with 6 center should align to row 3\n- Lone 4 at (10, 0) - indicates patterns with 4 center should align to row 10\n- Both are at column 0, so vertical shifts apply\n\n**Identified Patterns:**\n1. Pattern of 6s with 4 center at (1,4) \u2192 shifts down 9 rows to align 4 at row 10\n2. Pattern of 4s with 6 center at (1,14) \u2192 shifts down 2 rows to align 6 at row 3  \n3. Pattern of 4s with 6 center at (9,4) \u2192 shifts up 6 rows to align 6 at row 3\n4. Pattern of 4s with 6 center at (8,10) \u2192 shifts up 5 rows to align 6 at row 3\n5. Pattern of 3s with 6 center at (9,18) \u2192 shifts up 6 rows to align 6 at row 3\n\n**Lone markers (2s) remain in place:** (3,6), (5,7), (7,1), (10,12), (12,0), (12,19)\n\n```\n8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n6,8,8,8,6,8,2,8,4,4,6,8,8,4,6,4,8,3,6,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,8,8,6,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_H>\n</CANDIDATE 2>\n<CANDIDATE 3>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 14x20\n88866688888888888888\n88864688888884648888\n88888888888884448888\n68888888888888488888\n88888888888888888888\n88884888888888888888\n88844488884888888333\n88848488444888888383\n88844488446888888383\n88886888884888888363\n48888888888888888888\n88888888888888888888\n22888822888828888882\n88888888888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gpt-5.1-high_2_step_1\">\n**High\u2011level rule inferred from the examples**\n\nFrom the three training examples I extracted this pattern:\n\n1. There is a **special \u201cmarker\u201d color**:\n   - Example 1: color `4`\n   - Example 2: color `1` (and also `6`, but the key idea is the \u201cmarker\u201d)\n   - Example 3: color `2`\n\n   This special color has the property that **any connected non\u2011background object that contains it has at most one such cell**. Often there are also some isolated single pixels of this color.\n\n2. The transformation:\n   - **Align all occurrences of the marker color on a single straight line**,\n   - Leaving their **columns fixed** if we decide on a horizontal line (same row), or\n   - Leaving their **rows fixed** if we decide on a vertical line (same column).\n   - Any larger object containing a marker pixel is treated as a rigid block and moved with that marker.\n\n3. Choosing whether the line is horizontal or vertical:\n   - For the marker color, collect all its positions.\n   - Measure its spread in rows vs. columns:\n     - If the **row spread** (max row \u2212 min row) is **smaller** than the column spread, it is more natural to align them **horizontally** (same row).\n     - If the **column spread** is smaller, align them **vertically** (same column).\n   - This matches:\n     - Ex.1 (color 4): row spread is large, column spread is small \u2192 align vertically.\n     - Ex.3 (color 2): row spread large, column spread small \u2192 align vertically.\n     - Ex.2 (color 1): row spread small, column spread large \u2192 align horizontally.\n\n4. Choosing the target row/column:\n   - Among the marker pixels, there is at least one that already lies on the outer border of the grid (top row, bottom row, leftmost column, or rightmost column).\n   - We use one of these **border markers** as the reference:\n     - If we are aligning horizontally, we take its **row** as the target row.\n     - If we are aligning vertically, we take its **column** as the target column.\n   - Other marker instances (and their attached shapes) are slid in the chosen direction so their marker pixel comes to that row/column.\n   - The isolated border marker itself usually stays in place (it already lies on the line).\n\nThis explains:\n- Ex.1: special color 4, vertical alignment to column of the bottom lone 4.\n- Ex.3: special color 2, vertical alignment to column of the top lone 2.\n- Ex.2: special color 1, horizontal alignment to row of the leftmost lone 1 (the other shifts in that example are more complex, but the key marker\u2011alignment pattern is still there).\n\n---\n\n## Applying the rule to the test input\n\n### 1. Identify background and marker color\n\nTest grid uses colors `{8, 6, 4, 2, 3}`.\n\n- `8` is clearly background (dominates the grid).\n- The non\u2011background colors form several connected components (4\u2011connected, ignoring color).\n- Color `2` appears at:\n  - (4,7)\n  - (6,8)\n  - (8,2)\n  - (11,13)\n  - (13,1)\n  - (13,20)\n\nEach of these `2` cells is **isolated** (its four neighbors are all `8`), so:\n- every connected component that contains a `2` consists of **exactly that one `2` cell**;\n- there are no other colors attached to them.\n\nNo other color has this \u201csingleton or absent per component\u201d property, so **`2` is the marker color**.\n\n### 2. Decide horizontal vs vertical alignment\n\nRows of the `2`s: 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 13  \n\u2192 row spread = 13 \u2212 4 = 9\n\nColumns of the `2`s: 7, 8, 2, 13, 1, 20  \n\u2192 column spread = 20 \u2212 1 = 19\n\nRow spread (9) < column spread (19), so **we align them horizontally in one row** (same row, keep columns).\n\n### 3. Choose the target row\n\nWe now choose a **reference marker on the left/right border** (since we\u2019re aligning horizontally):\n\nBorder `2`s:\n- (13,1) on the left border\n- (13,20) on the right border\n\nBoth lie on **row 13**, so that row is the natural horizontal line.\n\nThus the **target row** for all 2\u2019s is **row 13**.\n\n### 4. Move the marker cells\n\nWe slide each marker `2` vertically to row 13, keeping its column:\n\nOriginal `2` positions \u2192 new positions:\n\n- (4,7)  \u2192 (13,7)\n- (6,8)  \u2192 (13,8)\n- (8,2)  \u2192 (13,2)\n- (11,13)\u2192 (13,13)\n- (13,1) \u2192 remains (13,1)\n- (13,20)\u2192 remains (13,20)\n\nAt the same time, we turn the old positions back into background `8`.\n\nSince each `2` is isolated (its component is size 1), we only move those pixels, and **all other colors (4, 6, 3) and their structures remain fixed**.\n\n### 5.

The colour chosen had two key properties:\n- it appears at most once in any connected component, so you can unambiguously \u201caim\u201d that component by moving that one pixel, and\n- there is at least one occurrence of the colour on the border of the grid; the border occurrence defines which coordinate is used as the target.\n\nIf the border occurrence is on the top or bottom edge (row\u202f1 or the last row) the components are shifted horizontally so that all of those special pixels share the same column as the border pixel. If the border occurrence is on the left or right edge (column\u202f1 or the last column) the components are shifted vertically so that all of the special pixels share the same row as the border pixel. The component is translated as a whole, and its original cells are replaced by background.\n\nIn the test grid the background is 8. The only colour satisfying the \u201cone per component\u201d condition and with border occurrences is 2: there are isolated 2s at (4,\u202f7), (6,\u202f8), (8,\u202f2), (11,\u202f13), (13,\u202f1) and (13,\u202f20). The border occurrences are on columns\u202f1 and\u202f20 at row\u202f13, so we align along a row: the target row is 13.

In each example there is a \u201cspecial\u201d colour which appears only once in each connected component that contains it. One instance of that colour lies on the border of the grid and serves as an anchor. The transformation shifts each component containing that special colour along the axis perpendicular to the edge on which the anchor lies, so that the special colour in every component lines up with the anchor\u2019s row or column. Cells vacated by the move are returned to the background colour.\n\nIn the test grid, the only colour that appears at most once per component is 2. There are border instances of 2 at row\u00a013, columns\u00a01 and\u00a020, so the target line is row\u00a013.

Background cells fill the vacated spots.\n\n   Thus, the rule is:\n\n   > For each non\u2011background color whose pixels are all isolated from each other (no 4\u2011connected same\u2011color neighbors), align all of its pixels along a straight line parallel to the longer side of the grid, using as anchor the border pixel(s) of that color. Move entire connected components that contain those pixels.\n\n2. **Analyse the test input**\n\n   - Grid size: 14 rows \u00d7 20 columns.  \n     The shorter dimension is the **height (14)** \u2192 we align along **rows** (all chosen marker pixels will end up on the same row).\n   - Background: clearly color **8**.\n   - Non\u2011background colors present: **2, 3, 4, 6**.\n\n   Check which colors are \u201cmarker colors\u201d (all occurrences isolated from each other in 4\u2011connectivity):\n\n   - Color 3: appears in clusters at the bottom right \u2192 not isolated.\n   - Color 4: many touching 4s (lines and blocks) \u2192 not isolated.\n   - Color 6: there is a 3\u2011cell 6\u2011cluster in the top row and other 6s \u2192 not isolated.\n   - Color **2**: occurrences at\n     - (4,7), (6,8), (8,2), (11,13), (13,1), (13,20)\n     and each of these has only 8s as orthogonal neighbors \u2192 **every 2 is a single\u2011pixel connected component of color 2**.\n\n   So **color 2** is the only marker color.\n\n3. **Find the anchor row for color 2**\n\n   Since we align along rows, we look for 2\u2011pixels that touch the grid in the **other axis**, i.e. on the left or right border (column 1 or 20):\n\n   - Border 2s: (13,1) and (13,20).  \n     Both lie on **row 13**.\n\n   Therefore the **target row** for all 2s is **row 13**.\n\n4. **Translate components containing color 2**\n\n   Each 2 is an isolated single\u2011pixel component; moving the component means moving only that 2 itself.\n\n   For each 2 not already on row 13, move it vertically to row 13, same column:\n\n   - (4,7) \u2192 (13,7)\n   - (6,8) \u2192 (13,8)\n   - (8,2) \u2192 (13,2)\n   - (11,13) \u2192 (13,13)\n   - (13,1) and (13,20) already lie on row 13 \u2192 stay in place.\n\n   The original locations of these moved 2s are replaced with background color 8.\n\n   All other colors (3, 4, 6, and 8) remain where they are.\n\n5. **Construct the output grid**\n\nApplying the moves above gives:\n\nRow 1:  8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \nRow 2:  8,8,8,6,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,6,4,8,8,8,8  \nRow 3:  8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8  \nRow 4:  6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8  \nRow 5:  8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \nRow 6:  8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \nRow 7:  8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3  \nRow 8:  8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3  \nRow 9:  8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,4,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3  \nRow10:  8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3  \nRow11:  4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \nRow12:  8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \nRow13:  2,2,8,8,8,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,2  \nRow14:  8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\n**Final output grid:**\n\n8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,6,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,6,4,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8  \n6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3  \n8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3  \n8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,4,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3  \n8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3  \n4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n2,2,8,8,8,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,2  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_D>\n<REASONING_MODEL_E model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_8_step_5_image\">\nTo solve this task I looked for the \u201cspecial\u201d colour in each puzzle. In all three examples the colour that is aligned is the one that occurs exactly once in any object and also appears as a lone pixel on the outer border of the grid.

You translate any component containing that colour so that its special coloured pixel lies on the anchor\u2019s row or column; everything else stays the same.\n\nIn the test grid the background is 8.

I\u2019m zeroing in on this \"T\" or cross-like shape in the top, noting its pixel locations.\n\nOkay, let's look closer at the grid itself. The inputs are 18 rows and 8 columns. I\u2019m noticing there are grouped pixels that aren\u2019t the background. There are clusters of teal and yellow pixels. I\u2019m trying to discern a rule. I can see a big shape made of teal pixels with a central yellow pixel. Let's analyze the shapes in the image. I\u2019m grouping things that seem logically together and looking for a pattern. It looks like these shapes may be rectangles or other kinds of shapes, but I\u2019m really just looking for how those non-background pixels are grouped together and anything special about the pattern.\n\nIt\u2019s becoming apparent there are three identifiable groups of non-background pixels. I need to figure out how they are moving relative to the input. Let\u2019s re-read the input carefully to extract the group structure again. My attention is drawn to those bright yellow pixels. I\u2019m trying to figure out where they are, what kind of shapes are built around them, and if this matters later on in the task.\n\nNow, let's carefully read the output to see what has changed. The output has background 1. What changed in the shapes? The top shape moved right. The second and third moved left and right respectively.\n\nNow I\u2019m wondering, what makes these groups move? Is there some attractor or target? Looking at Example 1 output, the yellow pixel that was on the right is now in a consistent column. Now I\u2019m suspecting there's some attractor that these things align themselves to. Maybe column 5 is the attraction? I\u2019m looking very closely at that column to see if it makes some sense.\n\nSo I\u2019m noticing now the yellow 4 pixel is the \"center\" of each of the three shapes. It appears that the rule may be that the location of the yellow pixel is the important piece. Is there anything else? Row 17 has an isolated yellow pixel.\n\nI formulate a hypothesis: There are \"moveable shapes\" and \"anchor points\". It looks like the rule is: Align the '4' within each shape vertically with the anchor pixel. Let's verify this on another example. It's got a background 8. I will look for shapes and any singular pixels as potential anchors. I\u2019m realizing that this strategy may be helpful to get a grasp on the entire class of such problems.\n\nIn Example 2, background is 8, and there are pixels of 3 and 4 and 6 and 1. I\u2019m going to now extract these shapes and attempt to discern an anchor point. After some close reading, it looks like there are some \"anchors\" for all the \"moveable shapes\", for this second example.\n\nIn this second example, there are the vertical strips of 4s and the other shapes. They have single 1s embedded within them. It seems like a consistent color pixel might be the key to the pattern. It is becoming clear that single pixels or those pixels that are not part of shapes are important. The vertical strip seems to move up a row. I\u2019m starting to think the shape is trying to align to some reference point.\n\nOk, let's examine Example 2's output again. The vertical strip aligns its 6 to a reference 6. The \"blob with 1\" moved so its 1 aligns with the reference 1. I\u2019m going to work toward writing a more generalizable algorithm. This third image further emphasizes this concept. The shapes, containing those distinct colored pixels, all move to align with a consistent column. I can see in these two examples the anchors can be on the side, at the top, or at the bottom.\n\nSo the rule I\u2019ve developed is that the singular pixels are the reference, and shapes containing pixels of the same color will align to the same row or column as this singular pixel. Now, it's time to refine this rule. The rule is:\n\n1.  Find the background color.\n2.  Find anchor pixels (single pixels)\n3.  Find all the non-background pixel groupings and describe them.\n4.  Each group contains a\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on a rule inferred from the solved examples.\n\n**Rule Inference:**\n1.  **Background & Anchors:** The grid consists of a background color (8 in the test case) and foreground objects. There are specific \"Anchor\" pixels that determine the target position for the foreground objects.\n    *   In Example 1, a single anchor pixel (4) at the bottom (Row 17, Col 5) dictated that all shapes containing a '4' align their '4' vertically to Column 5.\n    *   In Example 2, anchors in the left column (Col 0) at Row 4 (Color 1) and Row 8 (Color 6) dictated that shapes containing '1' align to Row 4, and shapes containing '6' align to Row 8.\n    *   In Example 3, an anchor (Color 2) at the top (Row 0, Col 4) dictated vertical alignment to Column 4.\n    *   **Heuristic:** Anchors are isolated single pixels of a unique color, typically on the border. If anchors share a column (as in Ex 2 and the Test Input), alignment is Horizontal (Row-based). If they share a row or are unique, alignment is Vertical (Column-based).\n\n2.  **Mapping Objects to Anchors:**\n    *   Identify connected shapes (excluding anchors).\n    *   For each shape, determine its \"Key Color\" based on the colors present in the shape that match the Anchor colors.\n    *   **Priority Rule:**\n        *   If the shape contains the Anchor color as its **Majority** color, use that color for alignment.\n        *   If the Majority color is not an Anchor, use the **Minority** (or next frequent) color that matches an Anchor.\n        *   (This resolves conflicts where a shape contains multiple anchor colors, like shapes A, B, D, E in the test input, and ensures shapes like D stay within grid boundaries).\n    *   **Alignment:** Calculate the shift required to move the shape so that the pixel(s) of the Key Color align with the Anchor's Row (or Column).\n        *   For horizontal alignment (Test Input), `Shift = AnchorRow - ShapeKeyPixelRow`. All pixels of the Key Color in the shape align to the Anchor Row (typically the bottom-most pixel of that color aligns).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Anchors (Column 0):**\n    *   Row 3: Color 6\n    *   Row 10: Color 4\n    *   Row 12: Color 2\n    *   *Transformation Rule:* Align Key Pixels to these Target Rows.\n\n*   **Object Analysis & Transformation:**\n    1.  **Object A (Top-Left):** Colors 6 (Majority) and 4. Matches Anchor 6.\n        *   Key Color: 6.\n        *   Bottom-most 6 at Row 1. Target Row 3.\n        *   **Shift: +2 rows.**\n    2.  **Object B (Top-Right):** Colors 4 (Majority) and 6. Matches Anchor 4.\n        *   Key Color: 4.\n        *   Bottom-most 4 at Row 3. Target Row 10.\n        *   **Shift: +7 rows.**\n    3.  **Object D (Middle-Left):** Colors 4 (Majority) and 6. Matches Anchor 4. (Note: Using 6 would move it out of bounds).\n        *   Key Color: 4.\n        *   Bottom-most 4 at Row 8. Target Row 10.\n        *   **Shift: +2 rows.**\n    4.  **Object E (Middle-Center):** Colors 4 (Majority) and 6. Matches Anchor 4.\n        *   Key Color: 4.\n        *   Bottom-most 4 at Row 9. Target Row 10.\n        *   **Shift: +1 row.**\n    5.  **Object F (Middle-Right):** Colors 3 (Majority) and 6. Anchor 3 doesn't exist. Matches Anchor 6.\n        *   Key Color: 6.\n        *   Pixel 6 at Row 9. Target Row 3.\n        *   **Shift: -6 rows.**\n    6.  **Isolated 2s:**\n        *   (3,6), (5,7), (7,1), (10,12), (12,19).\n        *   Key Color: 2. Matches Anchor 2 (Row 12).\n        *   All move to **Row 12**, preserving their column.\n\n**Final Grid Construction:**\n*   Object A moves from Rows 0-1 to Rows 2-3.\n*   Object B moves from Rows 1-3 to Rows 8-10.\n*   Object D moves from Rows 5-9 to Rows 7-11.\n*   Object E moves from Rows 6-9 to Rows 7-10.\n*   Object F moves from Rows 6-9 to Rows 0-3.\n*   Isolated 2s move to Row 12.\n*   Anchors remain in Col 0.\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n6,8,8,6,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,4,6,4,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,4,4,6,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8\n4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,8,8,8,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,2\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n<REASONING_MODEL_B model_id=\"gemini-3-high_8_step_5_image\">\n**Here's my thought process as I tackled this ARC task:**\n\nOkay, the goal is to figure out the pattern in these examples and apply it. Let's dig in!\n\nFirst, I looked at Example 1 and focused on the shapes with the special color (4).  I noticed they all seemed to *move*. I started by comparing the input and output grids and traced how the '4's moved. My initial thought was they might be moving toward each other, but the horizontal alignment seemed more important. The key was that the '4's inside the shapes were aligning with an isolated '4' pixel. The *column* seemed to be the key, so I started looking for the isolated '4' pixel at the bottom. The shapes were moving so their '4's lined up with that isolated one, horizontally.\n\nWith that rule in mind, I tried it on Example 2. Here, it got more complex. There were multiple 'special' colors, and the '4' was not at the bottom - there was a single '1' at the far left as well. The shapes had '1's in them, '4's, and '6's. Okay, this is getting complex, so I decided to look at the isolated pixels first. Aha! The shapes *moved to align with the isolated pixels*, but this time, the *rows* were important. Shapes moved vertically to line up with the row of the isolated pixel.\n\nThis is a good start. I refined my rule to say, \"Identify the marker pixels (single isolated ones). Shapes with a color matching a marker must move to align *horizontally (column)* or *vertically (row)*.\"\n\nMoving to Example 3 was a test. The isolated '2' was at the top, and all the shapes contained a '2'. The output showed them aligning horizontally with the top '2' pixel, the rule from Example 1 worked.\n\nNow, to the Test Input! I focused on identifying the background, which was teal '8'. Next, I scanned for isolated pixels - I wanted my 'Markers'. There they are! They are all on the left edge. I have three \"markers\". Next, the objects were shapes composed of 4's, 6's. But which color? I decided the key was the shape's \"body.\" I hypothesized that objects would move to the marker that matched a color *within* them. For the test grid, I had the following potential objects to map:\n\n1. **Top-Left Shape**: Body '6'. Target Marker is 6 (Row 3, column 0).\n2. **Top-Right Shape**: Body '4'. Target Marker is 4 (Row 10, column 0).\n3. **Mid-Left Scattered**: 2 (at the edge). Must Align with 2 Marker!\n4. **Scattered 2s, Rightside**: Marker `2` on the right side.\n5. **Mid-Left Object:** Body '4'. Target Marker is 4 (Row 10, column 0).\n6. **Mid-Right Shape:** Body '4'. Target Marker is 4 (Row 10, column 0).\n7. **Far-Right Object:** Body (the \"body is 3s\"). 3 has no marker. But it *has* the '6'. So I thought the '6' would match the 6-marker.\n\nWith each object, I figured out how to shift to the marker's row or column. But a clash occurred!  Two objects *wanted* to go to Row 10 (the 4-Marker). I had an idea to solve the problem:\n\nIf you are a shape that *wants* to go to *Marker X*, and can't, for any reason, try Marker Y, since X does not work. This made perfect sense, and I realized there could be a case where clipping happens. The most important pixel will stay.\n\nAfter careful calculations, I wrote down all of the shifts. With the shifts worked out, I built the output grid based on where things *landed*. It got complex, but the steps I found.\n\n\nThe task involves identifying objects in the grid and moving them vertically to align with specific \"marker\" pixels located in the leftmost column.\n\n**Logic derived from examples:**\n1.  **Identify Markers:** In the test input, the leftmost column (Column 0) contains single isolated pixels that act as markers for vertical alignment:\n    *   Row 3: Color 6 (Magenta)\n    *   Row 10: Color 4 (Yellow)\n    *   Row 12: Color 2 (Red)\n    (There is also a marker 2 at the bottom right, confirming Row 12 for red objects).\n\n2.  **Identify Objects:** Identify the distinct shapes in the grid.\n    *   **Shape A (Top-Left):** A box of 6s with a 4 inside. (Body Color: 6).\n    *   **Shape B (Top-Right):** A shape of 4s with a 6 inside. (Body Color: 4).\n    *   **Shape C (Mid-Left):** A \"rocket\" shape of 4s with a 6 at the bottom tip. (Body Color: 4).\n    *   **Shape D (Mid-Right):** A shape of 4s with a 6 in the corner. (Body Color: 4).\n    *   **Shape E (Far-Right):** A shape of 3s with a 6 inside. (Body Color: 3).\n    *   **Scattered Pixels:** Several isolated pixels of color 2.\n\n3.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   **Primary Rule:** Move each object vertically so that the bottom row of its \"Body\" aligns with the row of the Marker corresponding to its Body Color.\n    *   **Secondary Rule (if Body Color has no marker):** Move the object so that its contained \"minority\" pixel aligns with the Marker of that pixel's color.\n    *   **Scattered Pixels:** Move isolated pixels to the row of the Marker corresponding to their color.\n\n**Applying the rules:**\n\n*   **Shape A (Body 6):** Target Marker 6 (Row 3).\n    *   Current Bottom of Body (Row 1) moves to Row 3. (Shift +2).\n    *   New Position: Rows 2-3.\n*   **Shape B (Body 4):** Target Marker 4 (Row 10).\n    *   Current Bottom of Body (Row 3) moves to Row 10. (Shift +7).\n    *   New Position: Rows 8-10.\n*   **Shape C (Body 4):** Target Marker 4 (Row 10).\n    *   Current Bottom of Body (Row 8) moves to Row 10. The tip (6) is at Row 9, which is an appendage, not body. (Shift +2).\n    *   New Position: Rows 7-11.\n*   **Shape D (Body 4):** Target Marker 4 (Row 10).\n    *   Current Bottom of Body (Row 9) moves to Row 10. (Shift +1).\n    *   New Position: Rows 7-10.\n*   **Shape E (Body 3):** No Marker 3. Contains 6. Target Marker 6 (Row 3).\n    *   Align the 6 pixel (at Row 9) to Row 3. (Shift -6).\n    *   New Position: Rows 0-3.\n*   **Scattered 2s:** Target Marker 2 (Row 12).\n    *   All isolated 2s move to Row 12, keeping their column.\n\n**Completed Output Grid Generation:**\n\n*   **Background:** 8\n*   **Markers:** (3,0):6, (10,0):4, (12,0):2, (12,19):2\n*   **Row 0:** Shape E (3,3,3) at cols 17-19.\n*   **Row 1:** Shape E (3,8,3) at cols 17-19.\n*   **Row 2:** Shape A (6,6,6) at cols 3-5.

Shapes move horizontally so their 2s align to column 4.\n\n**Key Rule**: When there's a vertical reference line (like column 0 with markers), shapes align by ROW to the standalone marker of their interior color.\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n- Background: 8\n- Column 0 has markers: 6 at row 3, 4 at row 10, 2 at row 12 (vertical reference)\n- Shapes identified:\n  - Shape A (6-boundary, 4-interior): rows 0-1, cols 3-5 \u2192 interior 4 at (1,4)\n  - Shape B (4-boundary, 6-interior): rows 1-3, cols 13-15 \u2192 interior 6 at (1,14)\n  - Shape C (4-boundary, 6-interior): rows 5-9, cols 3-5 \u2192 interior 6 at (9,4)\n  - Shape D (4-boundary, 6-interior): rows 6-9, cols 8-10 \u2192 interior 6 at (8,10)\n  - Shape E (3-boundary, 6-interior): rows 6-9, cols 17-19 \u2192 interior 6 at (9,18)\n\n**Transformations:**\n- Shapes with 6-interior align to row 3 (standalone 6)\n- Shapes with 4-interior align to row 10 (standalone 4)\n- Shape C can only move up 5 rows (boundary limit), placing its 6 at row 4\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n6,8,8,4,4,4,2,8,4,4,6,8,8,4,6,4,8,3,6,3\n8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,8,8,6,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_B>\n<REASONING_MODEL_C model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_7_step_5_image\">\nThe background stays the same.  \nIn each training pair there is a colour that appears as a solitary \u201ckey\u201d pixel and also as a unique contrasting pixel inside each multicoloured shape.  \nDepending on whether the canvas is taller or wider, all the shapes are slid rigidly so that their contrasting pixel lines up with the key pixel\u2019s coordinate along the short axis; the key pixels themselves remain in place.  \nHere the grid is wider than it is tall, and the key colours are 4 and 6.

I've been presented with three examples and a test input, and my approach will involve carefully analyzing the examples to understand the transformation rules and then applying those rules to the test input.\n\n**Key Observations and Hypotheses:**\n\n1.  **\"Open Container\" Definition:** The task seems to revolve around identifying shapes formed by a specific color (C) that \"cup\" or enclose a pixel of a different color (F) that is not the background color (B). \"Cup\" is key, implies more than 2 sides.\n2.  **Sealing Mechanism:** The core transformation is \"sealing\" the open container by drawing a straight line across the opening using the shape's color (C). This action closes the container and changes its topological features.\n3.  **Position Shift (Potential Red Herring):** I've noticed a pattern of position shifts in the examples. But I believe position is secondary and might be an artifact. The hints I was provided don't mention movement, so I choose to focus on how the containers *change* and not where.\n4.  **Local Transformation:** The hints strongly suggest a local transformation \u2013 changes occur within the immediate vicinity of the identified container.\n\n**Process:**\n\n1.  **Background Identification:** I must first determine the background color. In the test input, 8 is the most prevalent color, so 8 is the background color.\n2.  **Shape Detection:** I then scan the grid to detect contiguous regions of non-background colors. Each region represents a potential container.\n3.  **Cup/Enclosure Check:** For each shape, I check if it forms a \"cup\" or \"U\"-shape that encloses a foreign pixel. A \"cup\" must have an opening, which represents a side with direct access to the interior.\n4.  **Sealing Logic:** If a shape is a cup and has a foreign pixel within, I seal it by drawing a line across the opening. This sealing uses the container's color and completes the bounding box.\n5.  **Output Grid Generation:** I'll create the output grid by applying these changes in-place. Other pixels which are not part of an open container will remain in their initial position.\n\n**Applying to the Test Input:**\n\nI scanned the provided test input and will follow the algorithm:\n\n**Object A:**\nRows 0-1, Cols 3-5 (6s enclosing 4) -> Seal Bottom Row\n\n**Object B:**\nRows 1-2, Cols 13-15 (4s enclosing 6) -> Seal Top Row\n\n**Object D:**\nRows 7-9, Cols 8-10 (4s enclosing 6 and 8) -> Seal Rightmost Column\n\n**Object E:**\nRows 6-9, Cols 17-19 (3s enclosing 6,8s) -> Seal the Bottom Row\n\n**Constructing and Outputting the Result:**\n\nI carefully built the output row by row according to the determined actions and the known grid size.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to identify \"open containers\" in the grid and \"seal\" them. An open container is a shape of a specific color that partially encloses a \"foreign\" pixel (a pixel of a different color). The transformation requires drawing a straight line across the opening using the container's color to turn the \"bay\" containing the foreign pixel into a \"hole\".\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis of the test input:\n\n1.  **Identify Background:** The grid is predominantly filled with `8` (teal), which serves as the background.\n\n2.  **Locate Shapes and Analyze Connectivity:** We scan the grid for connected shapes of non-background colors (`6`, `4`, `2`, `3`) and check if they enclose a foreign pixel.\n\n    *   **Shape 1 (Top Left):** A magenta shape (`6`).\n        *   Row 0: `6 6 6` (Cols 3-5)\n        *   Row 1: `6 4 6` (Cols 3-5)\n        *   Inside is `4` (yellow) at (1, 4).\n        *   The shape encloses the `4` on the top, left, and right. It is open at the **bottom**.\n        *   **Action:** Seal the bottom at Row 2, Cols 3-5 with `6`.\n\n    *   **Shape 2 (Top Right):** A yellow shape (`4`).\n        *   Row 1: `4 6 4` (Cols 13-15)\n        *   Row 2: `4 4 4` (Cols 13-15)\n        *   Connected to `4` at (3, 14), forming a wine-glass shape, but the cup part is Rows 1-2.\n        *   Inside is `6` (magenta) at (1, 14).\n        *   The shape encloses the `6` on the bottom, left, and right. It is open at the **top**.\n        *   **Action:** Seal the top at Row 0, Cols 13-15 with `4`.\n\n    *   **Shape 3 (Middle Right):** A yellow shape (`4`).\n        *   Row 7: `4 4 4` (Cols 8-10)\n        *   Row 8: `4 4 6` (Cols 8-10) -> Intruder `6` at (8, 10).\n        *   Row 9: `... 4` (Col 10)\n        *   The `6` at (8, 10) is bounded by `4` on the top (7, 10), left (8, 9), and bottom (9, 10).\n        *   It is open to the **right**.\n        *   **Action:** Seal the right side at Col 11. The opening spans Rows 7 to 9. We fill (7, 11), (8, 11), and (9, 11) with `4`.\n\n    *   **Shape 4 (Right Side):** A green shape (`3`).\n        *   Row 6: `3 3 3` (Cols 17-19)\n        *   Row 7: `3 8 3`\n        *   Row 8: `3 8 3`\n        *   Row 9: `3 6 3` -> Intruder `6` at (9, 18).\n        *   The shape encloses the column of pixels (including the `6`) on the top, left, and right.\n        *   It is open at the **bottom**.\n        *   **Action:** Seal the bottom at Row 10, Cols 17-19 with `3`.\n\n    *   **Other Shapes:**\n        *   The box at Rows 6-8, Cols 3-5 is already closed (`4 4 4` / `4 8 4` / `4 4 4`), so it remains unchanged.\n        *   Various isolated pixels (`2`s, `6`s) do not form cups enclosing foreign pixels and are ignored.\n\n3.  **Construct Output:** Apply the \"sealing\" patches to the input grid.\n\noutput:\n8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,6,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,6,4,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8\n6,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n8,2,8,4,8,4,8,8,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,4,4,6,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3\n4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n<REASONING_MODEL_B model_id=\"gpt-5.1-high_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\nBelow is how I approached it and the resulting grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Interpreting the transformation\n\nFrom the description and examples, the intended transformation is:\n\n- Identify **objects** that act as **\u201copen containers\u201d**: a connected set of pixels of one color (the *container color*) that partially surrounds a pixel of another color (the *foreign color*) in a concave \u201cbay\u201d.\n- The foreign pixel is adjacent to the container\u2019s inner boundary, and there is a direct path from it to the outside of the container (the container has an *opening*).\n- The task is to **\u201cseal\u201d** the container by drawing a **straight line** (horizontal or vertical) of the container\u2019s color **across the opening**, so the foreign pixel ends up completely enclosed (inside a \u201chole\u201d rather than a \u201cbay\u201d).\n- The foreign pixel is **not recolored**; it remains the same color, just now in a fully enclosed region.\n- Shapes that are not acting as open containers are left unchanged.\n\nIn the test grid, the background color is 8. The non-background colors are 4, 6, 2, 3. I looked for connected components where one of these colors forms a C- or U-shaped outline around a differently colored pixel, with a clear, axis-aligned opening.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Finding and sealing the containers in the test input\n\nI\u2019ll describe each detected container and the line that seals it.\n\n### Container 1: 6s around a 4 at the top-left\n\nLocal pattern (rows 1\u20132, cols 4\u20136):\n\n- Row 1: `6 6 6`\n- Row 2: `6 4 6`\n- Row 3 (originally): `8 8 8`\n\nSo we have:\n\n```\nrow1: 6 6 6\nrow2: 6 4 6\nrow3: 8 8 8   (background)\n```\n\nColor 6 forms a 3\u00d72 \u201ccup\u201d open **downwards**, with a 4 inside the bay.\n\nTo **seal** this, draw a horizontal line of 6s across the opening, on row 3, columns 4\u20136:\n\n- Change `(3,4)`, `(3,5)`, `(3,6)` from 8 \u21d2 6.\n\nAfter this, that 3\u00d73 block looks like:\n\n```\n6 6 6\n6 4 6\n6 6 6\n```\n\nThe 4 is now inside a fully closed loop of 6s.\n\n---\n\n### Container 2: 4s around a 6 near top-right\n\nLocal pattern (rows 2\u20134, cols 14\u201316) before change:\n\n- Row 2: `4 6 4` (cols 14\u201316)\n- Row 3: `4 4 4`\n- Row 4: `. 4 .` (here `.` is 8)\n\nIn block form:\n\n```\nrow1: . . .

                "response": "**Deep Dive into ARC Logic: A Journey of Rules and Exceptions**\n\nAlright, let's get down to brass tacks. I've got a challenge before me: acting as an ARC Logic Auditor. Six candidates, each offering a potential solution to this visual puzzle. My mission? To dissect their reasoning, back-test their claims, and ultimately, crown the champion.\n\nMy focus is to find the core principle that governs these geometric transformations. It's about spotting patterns and crystallizing them into an actionable rule. I need to be a digital detective, scrutinizing examples, and using the insights to test the candidates.\n\n**Early Clues and Hypothesis:**\n\nStarting with the examples, it became clear: isolated pixels on the edges are key. These \"Anchors\" dictate the movements of shapes. Think of them as magnetic north for the visual landscape. The colors of these anchors are vital; shapes with the same color, or a specific relation to it, tend to align with the edge where the anchor is located. I have the strong intuition that this rule applies universally. Let me explain.\n\n**The Evidence and The \"Aha!\" Moment:**\n\nExample 1 made me realize the rule revolves around the horizontal or vertical shifts. The central focus is aligning patterns based on color. Example 2 validated the vertical shift hypothesis. Each example reinforces the idea of identifying the anchor, identifying the relevant pixels, and shifting them into alignment.\n\n**The Test Input: A Field of Possibilities:**\n\nMoving onto the test input, I meticulously analyzed each shape, its color, and its position. The goal here is to use my findings from examples and see if each candidate respects that framework.\n\n**Candidate Analysis - Seeking the Golden Ticket:**\n\nCandidate 8's reasoning stood out like a beacon. The rule about aligning objects and isolated pixels was sound. I verified against the test input and noticed an interesting point about the \"noise\" (isolated pixels). The correct implementation includes these noise pixels. It was evident that some candidates split the shape unnecessarily. Others seemed to make a faulty match.\n\nMy deep analysis of Candidates 2 and 8 revealed the key distinction: their approach to handling isolated pixels. Candidate 2 took an \"exception\" approach. Candidate 8, on the other hand, treated the lone pixels as *objects* in their own right, aligning them consistently with the established rule.\n\nCandidate 16 lost some points by using the \"majority\" color, which is inconsistent with the examples. Candidates 3, 20, and 22, well, they just didn't get it at all. Invalid.\n\nIn the end, Candidate 8 emerged as the clear victor. They did well against the examples. And they handled edge cases, and it respected the overall intention of the ARC problem.\n\n\n<AUDIT_LOG>\n**PHASE 1: LOGIC SELECTION & CRYSTALLIZATION**\n\n*   **Candidate 8:**\n    *   **Selected Logic:** Reasoning Model A (\"Markers at edges determine alignment direction... Left/right edge markers -> shapes move vertically to match the marker's row\").\n    *   **Crystallized Rule:**\n        1.  Identify \"Anchors\": Isolated pixels on the grid boundary.\n        2.  Identify \"Objects\": Connected groups of pixels (including isolated pixels).\n        3.  For each Object, determine its \"Marker Color\" (the unique or minority color inside it, or the color of the pixel itself if isolated).\n        4.  Match Object Marker Color to Anchor Color.\n        5.  If Anchor is on a vertical edge (Col 0/Max), shift the Object vertically so its Marker pixel aligns with the Anchor's Row.\n        6.  If Anchor is on a horizontal edge (Row 0/Max), shift the Object horizontally so its Marker pixel aligns with the Anchor's Column.\n        7.  Clip pixels that move out of bounds.\n\n*   **Candidate 2:**\n    *   **Selected Logic:** Reasoning Model A. Similar to Candidate 8 but explicitly excludes \"isolated internal pixels\" (lone pixels) from moving.\n    *   **Crystallized Rule:** Same as above, but with an exception: \"Standalone pixels of the marker color that are not part of a larger shape remain in place.\"\n\n*   **Candidate 16:**\n    *   **Selected Logic:** Reasoning Model B.\n    *   **Crystallized Rule:** Uses \"Majority Color\" to match Anchors first, then falls back to Minority. (e.g., Matches the 4-majority/6-minority object to Anchor 4).\n\n*   **Candidate 23:**\n    *   **Selected Logic:** Reasoning Model B.\n    *   **Crystallized Rule:** Similar to Candidate 2, but fails to segment Object C correctly (splits it into a frame and a marker).\n\n*   **Candidate 3, 20, 22:**\n    *   Marked as Tier 4 (Invalid Logic/Hallucination). Candidate 3 selects the wrong anchor (2) and ignores others. Candidate 22 invents a \"sealing\" rule unrelated to examples. Candidate 20 logic is okay, but execution fails.\n\n**PHASE 2: THE GROUND TRUTH AUDIT**\n\n*   **Test on Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** Blue background. Teal objects with Yellow center. Anchor: Yellow at bottom edge.\n    *   **Rule (Cand 8 & 2):** Match Yellow center to Yellow Anchor. Anchor on horizontal edge -> Horizontal alignment.\n    *   **Observation:** Objects move horizontally to align centers with Anchor column.\n    *   **Verdict:** **Pass.**\n\n*   **Test on Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** Teal background. Green objects with Blue center. Strip of Yellows with Magenta end. Anchors: Blue and Magenta on left edge.\n    *   **Rule (Cand 8 & 2):** Match Blue center to Blue Anchor. Match Magenta unique pixel to Magenta Anchor. Anchor on vertical edge -> Vertical alignment.\n    *   **Observation:** Objects move vertically to align markers with Anchor rows.\n    *   **Verdict:** **Pass.**\n    *   **Rule (Cand 16):** Uses Majority Color. The Green objects have Majority Green. There is no Green Anchor. Fallback to Blue? Maybe works. The Yellow strip has Majority Yellow. There is no Yellow Anchor. Fallback to Magenta? Maybe works.\n    *   **Verdict (Cand 16):** **Weak Pass/Partial.** The logic is over-complicated and risks failure if a Majority Anchor existed (e.g. if there was a Green anchor, it would align to that, which contradicts the \"Marker/Center\" pattern seen in Ex 1 and 3).\n\n*   **Test on Example 3:**\n    *   **Input:** Green background. Blue objects with Red center. Anchor: Red at top edge.\n    *   **Rule (Cand 8 & 2):** Match Red center to Red Anchor. Anchor on horizontal edge -> Horizontal alignment.\n    *   **Observation:** Objects move horizontally to align centers.\n    *   **Verdict:** **Pass.**\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The Core Rule (Align Marker to Anchor) is robust. The difference lies in the handling of \"lone pixels\" (Candidate 8 moves them, Candidate 2 doesn't) and \"majority color\" (Candidate 16). Since the Solved Examples don't contain \"extra\" lone pixels of the marker color (only the anchor itself), we cannot strictly falsify Candidate 2's exception. However, we can judge based on consistency: ARC rules are usually universal. If \"Blue Objects align to Blue Anchor\", a single Blue pixel is a Blue Object of size 1. Candidate 8 is logically purer.\n\n**PHASE 3: EXECUTION CONSISTENCY**\n\n*   **Candidate 8 (Tier 1 Candidate):**\n    *   **Input Analysis:**\n        *   Anchor 6 at Row 3. Anchor 4 at Row 10. Anchor 2 at Row 12.\n        *   Obj A (Center 4) -> Target Row 10.\n        *   Obj B (Center 6) -> Target Row 3.\n        *   Obj C (Center 6) -> Target Row 3.\n        *   Obj D (Center 6) -> Target Row 3.\n        *   Obj E (Center 6) -> Target Row 3.\n        *   Lone 2s -> Target Row 12.\n    *   **Grid Check:**\n        *   Row 3: Contains 6s at Cols 4, 10, 14, 18. Matches Obj C, D, B, E markers. Correct.\n        *   Row 9/10: Contains Obj A (666/646). Marker 4 at Row 10. Correct.\n        *   Row 12: Contains all 2s. Correct.\n    *   **Verdict:** Perfect Execution.\n\n*   **Candidate 2 (Tier 2 Candidate):**\n    *   **Logic:** Same as 8 but static 2s.\n    *   **Grid Check:**\n        *   Row 3: Matches.\n        *   Row 10: Matches.\n        *   Row 12: Only Anchor 2s. Scattered 2s remain in original spots (e.g., Row 3 Col 6).\n    *   **Verdict:** Consistent with its own (slightly stricter) rule.\n\n*   **Candidate 16 (Tier 3 Candidate):**\n    *   **Logic:** Majority color.\n    *   **Grid Check:** Moves Obj A (Center 4) to Row 10. Moves Obj C (Center 6, Majority 4) to Row 10 (Anchor 4).\n    *   **Critique:** Obj C has a Magenta (6) marker. In Example 2, the strip of 4s with a 6-marker aligned to the 6-Anchor, NOT the 4-Anchor (if there was one). Candidate 16's decision to move Obj C to Anchor 4 contradicts the \"Unique Marker\" precedence established in Example 2.\n    *   **Verdict:** Logic Failure on Test Input.\n\n*   **Candidate 23:**\n    *   **Grid Check:** Missing parts of Obj C.\n    *   **Verdict:** Execution Failure.\n\n**PHASE 4: STACK RANKING**\n\n1.  **Candidate 8:** Best Logic (Occam's razor applied to lone pixels) + Perfect Execution. Gathering the scattered 2s to the anchor row creates a highly ordered state typical of ARC solutions.\n2.  **Candidate 2:** Good Logic, but the exception for lone pixels creates a less ordered output.\n3.  **Candidate 16:** Flawed logic (Majority vs Minority).\n4.  **Others:** Invalid.\n\n</AUDIT_LOG>\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 8,\n      \"score\": 9.8,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Correctly identifies the rule: Objects align their unique 'marker' pixel to the row/column of the matching isolated 'anchor' pixel.

Each of the moved components had exactly two colours: a \u201cfiller\u201d colour used several times and a single \u201cspecial\u201d pixel of a different colour. In each example there is also an isolated single\u2011pixel component of the special colour which acts as an anchor. The transformation is to translate every component containing that special colour so that its special pixel lies on the same row or the same column as the anchor, moving the whole component rigidly. If the anchor lies on the left or right border you align rows (vertical shift), if it lies on the top or bottom border you align columns (horizontal shift). The anchor itself doesn\u2019t move; other colours not involved in such components are left where they are.\n\nIn the test grid the background is 8. There are two special colours fitting the pattern: 6 has an isolated pixel at row\u202f4,\u202fcol\u202f1 and appears as the unique centre of several 4/3\u2011filled shapes; 4 has an isolated pixel at row\u202f11,\u202fcol\u202f1 and appears uniquely in one 6\u2011filled shape. Both anchors are on the left edge so I aligned rows. Each 6\u2011component was shifted vertically so its 6 landed on row\u202f4, carrying its fillers; the 4\u2011component was shifted so its 4 landed on row\u202f11. Isolated 2\u2019s and the anchors themselves stay put. This yields the following output grid:\n\n```\n8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n6,8,8,8,6,8,2,8,4,4,6,8,8,4,6,4,8,3,6,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,8,8,6,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n      8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n      6,8,8,8,6,8,2,8,4,4,6,8,8,4,6,4,8,3,6,3\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,8,8,6,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"E\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_6_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.

Edge markers in the test grid\n\nNon\u2011background border pixels that are **isolated singles**:\n\n- `(4,1) = 6`  \u2192 color 6, left edge\n- `(11,1) = 4` \u2192 color 4, left edge\n- `(13,1) = 2` and `(13,20) = 2` \u2192 color 2, left/right edges\n\nWe also have runs of 6 or 3 on borders (e.g. row 1: `6,6,6`; right side 3\u2019s), but those are not isolated single pixels (they\u2019re part of bigger components), so they are **not** reference markers.\n\nThus the effective anchor markers used for alignment are:\n\n- Color 6 anchor at row 4, col 1 (left edge) \u2192 **vertical alignment** for 6\u2011centered patterns.\n- Color 4 anchor at row 11, col 1 (left edge) \u2192 **vertical alignment** for 4\u2011centered patterns.\n\nColor 2 appears on the border but there is **no multi\u2011color component** where 2 is the unique minority center (all 2\u2019s are isolated single pixels), so no 2\u2011centered patterns to move.\n\n#### 2. Identify multi\u2011color components and their centers\n\nCompute 4\u2011connected components of non\u20118 cells and look at color counts:\n\n- **Component A** (top left cap of 6s with a 4):\n  - Cells: `(1,4),(1,5),(1,6),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6)` with colors `6,6,6,6,4,6`.\n  - Minority color: a single `4` at `(2,5)` \u2192 center color 4.\n\n- **Component D** (near top right):\n  - Cells: `(2,14),(2,15),(2,16),(3,14),(3,15),(3,16),(4,15)`\n  - Colors: six 4\u2019s and one 6 at `(2,15)` \u2192 center color 6.\n\n- **Component E** (block of 4s with 6 at bottom, around col 4\u20136):\n  - Cells: `(6,5),(7,4),(7,5),(7,6),(8,4),(8,6),(9,4),(9,5),(9,6),(10,5)`\n  - Nine 4\u2019s and one 6 at `(10,5)` \u2192 center color 6.\n\n- **Component G** (4\u2019s around a 6 in the middle, near col 9\u201311):\n  - Cells: `(7,11),(8,9),(8,10),(8,11),(9,9),(9,10),(9,11),(10,11)`\n  - Seven 4\u2019s and one 6 at `(9,11)` \u2192 center color 6.\n\n- **Component H** (right\u2011side 3\u2019s with a 6 in the middle):\n  - Cells: `(7,18),(7,19),(7,20),(8,18),(8,20),(9,18),(9,20),(10,18),(10,19),(10,20)`\n  - Nine 3\u2019s and one 6 at `(10,19)` \u2192 center color 6.\n\nAll other non\u20118 singletons are just isolated 2\u2019s or the 4 at `(11,1)` or 6 at `(4,1)` (our anchors), not multi\u2011color patterns.\n\nSo pattern centers:\n\n- Color 4 center: `(2,5)` from component A.\n- Color 6 centers: `(2,15)` (D), `(10,5)` (E), `(9,11)` (G), `(10,19)` (H).\n\n#### 3. Compute translations from anchors\n\nAll relevant anchors are on the **left edge**, so we use **vertical alignment**:\n\n- **For color 4**: anchor at row 11 \u2192 every 4\u2011centered pattern has its center\u2019s row set to 11.\n  - Center `(2,5)` must move to `(11,5)`  \n    \u2192 \u0394row = 11 \u2212 2 = +9, \u0394col = 0 for component A.\n\n- **For color 6**: anchor at row 4 \u2192 every 6\u2011centered pattern has its center\u2019s row set to 4.\n  - D: center `(2,15)` \u2192 `(4,15)` \u2192 \u0394row = +2 (component D shifts down 2).\n  - E: center `(10,5)` \u2192 `(4,5)` \u2192 \u0394row = \u22126 (component E shifts up 6; its topmost 4 at row 6 moves to row 0 and disappears outside the grid; the visible part is still a translated copy).\n  - G: center `(9,11)` \u2192 `(4,11)` \u2192 \u0394row = \u22125 (component G shifts up 5).\n  - H: center `(10,19)` \u2192 `(4,19)` \u2192 \u0394row = \u22126 (component H shifts up 6).\n\nColumns are unchanged for all these moves.\n\nAll components are erased from their original positions and redrawn (translated) at their new positions; anchors remain where they were.\n\nNo component is centered on color 2, so the 2\u2019s do not move.\n\n#### 4. Resulting grid\n\nAfter removing the moved components from their original locations, then redrawing them with the above translations (and keeping the anchors and isolated 2\u2019s fixed), the final grid is:\n\nRow 1: 8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3  \nRow 2: 8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3  \nRow 3: 8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3  \nRow 4: 6,8,8,8,6,8,2,8,4,4,6,8,8,4,6,4,8,3,6,3  \nRow 5: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8  \nRow 6: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8  \nRow 7: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \nRow 8: 8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \nRow 9: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \nRow10: 8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \nRow11: 4,8,8,6,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \nRow12: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \nRow13: 2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2  \nRow14: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\n---\n\n### Final output grid\n\nHere is the output grid in the required format:\n\n8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3  \n8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3  \n8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3  \n6,8,8,8,6,8,2,8,4,4,6,8,8,4,6,4,8,3,6,3  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n4,8,8,6,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n      8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n      6,8,8,8,6,8,2,8,4,4,6,8,8,4,6,4,8,3,6,3\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,8,8,6,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"H\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_8_step_5_image\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n1.

When a lone marker is at column 0 (left edge), patterns shift **vertically** to align their internal marker to the same row as the lone marker\n4. When a lone marker is at row 0 or bottom (top/bottom edge), patterns shift **horizontally** to align their internal marker to the same column\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n- Lone 6 at (3, 0) - indicates patterns with 6 center should align to row 3\n- Lone 4 at (10, 0) - indicates patterns with 4 center should align to row 10\n- Both are at column 0, so vertical shifts apply\n\n**Identified Patterns:**\n1. Pattern of 6s with 4 center at (1,4) \u2192 shifts down 9 rows to align 4 at row 10\n2. Pattern of 4s with 6 center at (1,14) \u2192 shifts down 2 rows to align 6 at row 3  \n3. Pattern of 4s with 6 center at (9,4) \u2192 shifts up 6 rows to align 6 at row 3\n4. Pattern of 4s with 6 center at (8,10) \u2192 shifts up 5 rows to align 6 at row 3\n5. Pattern of 3s with 6 center at (9,18) \u2192 shifts up 6 rows to align 6 at row 3\n\n**Lone markers (2s) remain in place:** (3,6), (5,7), (7,1), (10,12), (12,0), (12,19)\n\n```\n8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n6,8,8,8,6,8,2,8,4,4,6,8,8,4,6,4,8,3,6,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n4,8,8,6,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n      8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n      6,8,8,8,6,8,2,8,4,4,6,8,8,4,6,4,8,3,6,3\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      4,8,8,6,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"3\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-high_2_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**High\u2011level rule inferred from the examples**\n\nFrom the three training examples I extracted this pattern:\n\n1. There is a **special \u201cmarker\u201d color**:\n   - Example 1: color `4`\n   - Example 2: color `1` (and also `6`, but the key idea is the \u201cmarker\u201d)\n   - Example 3: color `2`\n\n   This special color has the property that **any connected non\u2011background object that contains it has at most one such cell**. Often there are also some isolated single pixels of this color.\n\n2. The transformation:\n   - **Align all occurrences of the marker color on a single straight line**,\n   - Leaving their **columns fixed** if we decide on a horizontal line (same row), or\n   - Leaving their **rows fixed** if we decide on a vertical line (same column).\n   - Any larger object containing a marker pixel is treated as a rigid block and moved with that marker.\n\n3. Choosing whether the line is horizontal or vertical:\n   - For the marker color, collect all its positions.\n   - Measure its spread in rows vs. columns:\n     - If the **row spread** (max row \u2212 min row) is **smaller** than the column spread, it is more natural to align them **horizontally** (same row).\n     - If the **column spread** is smaller, align them **vertically** (same column).\n   - This matches:\n     - Ex.1 (color 4): row spread is large, column spread is small \u2192 align vertically.\n     - Ex.3 (color 2): row spread large, column spread small \u2192 align vertically.\n     - Ex.2 (color 1): row spread small, column spread large \u2192 align horizontally.\n\n4. Choosing the target row/column:\n   - Among the marker pixels, there is at least one that already lies on the outer border of the grid (top row, bottom row, leftmost column, or rightmost column).\n   - We use one of these **border markers** as the reference:\n     - If we are aligning horizontally, we take its **row** as the target row.\n     - If we are aligning vertically, we take its **column** as the target column.\n   - Other marker instances (and their attached shapes) are slid in the chosen direction so their marker pixel comes to that row/column.\n   - The isolated border marker itself usually stays in place (it already lies on the line).\n\nThis explains:\n- Ex.1: special color 4, vertical alignment to column of the bottom lone 4.\n- Ex.3: special color 2, vertical alignment to column of the top lone 2.\n- Ex.2: special color 1, horizontal alignment to row of the leftmost lone 1 (the other shifts in that example are more complex, but the key marker\u2011alignment pattern is still there).\n\n---\n\n## Applying the rule to the test input\n\n### 1. Identify background and marker color\n\nTest grid uses colors `{8, 6, 4, 2, 3}`.\n\n- `8` is clearly background (dominates the grid).\n- The non\u2011background colors form several connected components (4\u2011connected, ignoring color).\n- Color `2` appears at:\n  - (4,7)\n  - (6,8)\n  - (8,2)\n  - (11,13)\n  - (13,1)\n  - (13,20)\n\nEach of these `2` cells is **isolated** (its four neighbors are all `8`), so:\n- every connected component that contains a `2` consists of **exactly that one `2` cell**;\n- there are no other colors attached to them.\n\nNo other color has this \u201csingleton or absent per component\u201d property, so **`2` is the marker color**.\n\n### 2. Decide horizontal vs vertical alignment\n\nRows of the `2`s: 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 13  \n\u2192 row spread = 13 \u2212 4 = 9\n\nColumns of the `2`s: 7, 8, 2, 13, 1, 20  \n\u2192 column spread = 20 \u2212 1 = 19\n\nRow spread (9) < column spread (19), so **we align them horizontally in one row** (same row, keep columns).\n\n### 3. Choose the target row\n\nWe now choose a **reference marker on the left/right border** (since we\u2019re aligning horizontally):\n\nBorder `2`s:\n- (13,1) on the left border\n- (13,20) on the right border\n\nBoth lie on **row 13**, so that row is the natural horizontal line.\n\nThus the **target row** for all 2\u2019s is **row 13**.\n\n### 4. Move the marker cells\n\nWe slide each marker `2` vertically to row 13, keeping its column:\n\nOriginal `2` positions \u2192 new positions:\n\n- (4,7)  \u2192 (13,7)\n- (6,8)  \u2192 (13,8)\n- (8,2)  \u2192 (13,2)\n- (11,13)\u2192 (13,13)\n- (13,1) \u2192 remains (13,1)\n- (13,20)\u2192 remains (13,20)\n\nAt the same time, we turn the old positions back into background `8`.\n\nSince each `2` is isolated (its component is size 1), we only move those pixels, and **all other colors (4, 6, 3) and their structures remain fixed**.\n\n### 5.

The colour chosen had two key properties:\n- it appears at most once in any connected component, so you can unambiguously \u201caim\u201d that component by moving that one pixel, and\n- there is at least one occurrence of the colour on the border of the grid; the border occurrence defines which coordinate is used as the target.\n\nIf the border occurrence is on the top or bottom edge (row\u202f1 or the last row) the components are shifted horizontally so that all of those special pixels share the same column as the border pixel. If the border occurrence is on the left or right edge (column\u202f1 or the last column) the components are shifted vertically so that all of the special pixels share the same row as the border pixel. The component is translated as a whole, and its original cells are replaced by background.\n\nIn the test grid the background is 8. The only colour satisfying the \u201cone per component\u201d condition and with border occurrences is 2: there are isolated 2s at (4,\u202f7), (6,\u202f8), (8,\u202f2), (11,\u202f13), (13,\u202f1) and (13,\u202f20). The border occurrences are on columns\u202f1 and\u202f20 at row\u202f13, so we align along a row: the target row is 13. All the 2\u2011components are single\u2011cell, so we simply move each 2 straight down to row\u202f13, leaving its column unchanged. Other components do not contain 2, so they stay where they are.\n\nApplying this gives the following output grid:\n\n8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,6,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,6,4,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8\n6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,4,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3\n4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,8,8,8,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,2\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,6,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,6,4,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8\n      6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n      8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,4,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n      8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3\n      4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      2,2,8,8,8,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,2\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"C\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_4_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nI looked for a consistent rule that explains the given examples. In each example there is a \u201cspecial\u201d colour which appears only once in each connected component that contains it. One instance of that colour lies on the border of the grid and serves as an anchor. The transformation shifts each component containing that special colour along the axis perpendicular to the edge on which the anchor lies, so that the special colour in every component lines up with the anchor\u2019s row or column. Cells vacated by the move are returned to the background colour.\n\nIn the test grid, the only colour that appears at most once per component is 2. There are border instances of 2 at row\u00a013, columns\u00a01 and\u00a020, so the target line is row\u00a013. All 2s are single\u2011cell components, so they are moved vertically to row\u00a013, keeping their columns. All other cells remain unchanged.\n\nApplying this gives the following output grid:\n\n8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,6,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,6,4,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8\n6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,4,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3\n4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,8,8,8,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,2\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,6,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,6,4,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8\n      6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n      8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,4,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n      8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3\n      4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      2,2,8,8,8,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,2\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"D\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-high_8_step_5_image\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Look at the solved examples**\n\n   In every example there is:\n   - one dominant *background* color,\n   - some larger shapes made of another color (or colors),\n   - and one or more *marker* colors that appear only as isolated single pixels (no two pixels of that color touch orthogonally).\n\n   For each marker color:\n\n   - All of its pixels end up aligned on a straight line.\n   - The direction of this line is along the **shorter grid dimension**:\n     - Examples 1 and 3 are tall (height < width? actually height > width), so the shorter dimension is the width \u2192 all marker pixels share the **same column**.\n     - Example 2 is wide (width > height), so the shorter dimension is the height \u2192 all marker pixels share the **same row**.\n   - Which specific row/column is used?\n     - Take the marker pixel(s) that lie on the **outer border along the other axis**, and use that coordinate.\n     - Example 1: color 4 is the marker, there is a 4 on the bottom border at column 6 \u2192 all 4s move to column 6.\n     - Example 3: color 2 is the marker, there is a 2 on the top border at column 5 \u2192 all 2s move to column 5.\n     - Example 2: there are two marker colors (1 and 6).  \n       - For color 1, there is a pixel on the left border at row 5 \u2192 all 1s move to row 5.  \n       - For color 6, there is a pixel on the left border at row 9 \u2192 all 6s move to row 9.\n   - When a marker pixel belongs to a multi\u2011color object, the **whole connected component of non\u2011background cells containing that marker** is translated rigidly so that its marker reaches the target row/column. Background cells fill the vacated spots.\n\n   Thus, the rule is:\n\n   > For each non\u2011background color whose pixels are all isolated from each other (no 4\u2011connected same\u2011color neighbors), align all of its pixels along a straight line parallel to the longer side of the grid, using as anchor the border pixel(s) of that color. Move entire connected components that contain those pixels.\n\n2. **Analyse the test input**\n\n   - Grid size: 14 rows \u00d7 20 columns.  \n     The shorter dimension is the **height (14)** \u2192 we align along **rows** (all chosen marker pixels will end up on the same row).\n   - Background: clearly color **8**.\n   - Non\u2011background colors present: **2, 3, 4, 6**.\n\n   Check which colors are \u201cmarker colors\u201d (all occurrences isolated from each other in 4\u2011connectivity):\n\n   - Color 3: appears in clusters at the bottom right \u2192 not isolated.\n   - Color 4: many touching 4s (lines and blocks) \u2192 not isolated.\n   - Color 6: there is a 3\u2011cell 6\u2011cluster in the top row and other 6s \u2192 not isolated.\n   - Color **2**: occurrences at\n     - (4,7), (6,8), (8,2), (11,13), (13,1), (13,20)\n     and each of these has only 8s as orthogonal neighbors \u2192 **every 2 is a single\u2011pixel connected component of color 2**.\n\n   So **color 2** is the only marker color.\n\n3. **Find the anchor row for color 2**\n\n   Since we align along rows, we look for 2\u2011pixels that touch the grid in the **other axis**, i.e. on the left or right border (column 1 or 20):\n\n   - Border 2s: (13,1) and (13,20).  \n     Both lie on **row 13**.\n\n   Therefore the **target row** for all 2s is **row 13**.\n\n4. **Translate components containing color 2**\n\n   Each 2 is an isolated single\u2011pixel component; moving the component means moving only that 2 itself.\n\n   For each 2 not already on row 13, move it vertically to row 13, same column:\n\n   - (4,7) \u2192 (13,7)\n   - (6,8) \u2192 (13,8)\n   - (8,2) \u2192 (13,2)\n   - (11,13) \u2192 (13,13)\n   - (13,1) and (13,20) already lie on row 13 \u2192 stay in place.\n\n   The original locations of these moved 2s are replaced with background color 8.\n\n   All other colors (3, 4, 6, and 8) remain where they are.\n\n5. **Construct the output grid**\n\nApplying the moves above gives:\n\nRow 1:  8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \nRow 2:  8,8,8,6,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,6,4,8,8,8,8  \nRow 3:  8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8  \nRow 4:  6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8  \nRow 5:  8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \nRow 6:  8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \nRow 7:  8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3  \nRow 8:  8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3  \nRow 9:  8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,4,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3  \nRow10:  8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3  \nRow11:  4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \nRow12:  8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \nRow13:  2,2,8,8,8,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,2  \nRow14:  8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\n**Final output grid:**\n\n8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,6,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,6,4,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8  \n6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3  \n8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3  \n8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,4,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3  \n8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3  \n4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n2,2,8,8,8,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,2  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,6,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,6,4,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8\n      6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n      8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,4,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n      8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3\n      4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      2,2,8,8,8,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,2\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"E\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_8_step_5_image\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nTo solve this task I looked for the \u201cspecial\u201d colour in each puzzle. In all three examples the colour that is aligned is the one that occurs exactly once in any object and also appears as a lone pixel on the outer border of the grid. The border occurrence is the anchor; if it lies on a horizontal edge you align columns, if it lies on a vertical edge you align rows. You translate any component containing that colour so that its special coloured pixel lies on the anchor\u2019s row or column; everything else stays the same.\n\nIn the test grid the background is 8. The only colour that occurs at most once per component and appears as isolated border pixels is 2, with anchors at (13,\u202f1) and (13,\u202f20), so the target row is 13. Each 2 is a singleton component, so we simply move those 2s vertically to row\u202f13, keeping their columns. All other cells remain unchanged.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n\n8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,6,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,6,4,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8\n6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,4,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3\n4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,8,8,8,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,2\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,6,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,6,4,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8\n      6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n      8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,4,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n      8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3\n      4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      2,2,8,8,8,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,2\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"8\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_3_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at this problem, I need to identify the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\nIn Example 1: Shapes made of 8s with 4 at center move horizontally to align their 4s with a lone 4 marker at row 17, column 5 (bottom edge).\n\nIn Example 2: Shapes made of 3s with 1 at center move vertically to align their 1s with a lone 1 marker at row 4, column 0 (left edge).

It looks like shapes are moving around, but there\u2019s a consistent rule at play. My initial thoughts are to break down the input and see if I can find repeating patterns between it and the output. Let\u2019s start by looking at a sample and noting things like shapes, and any elements, that seem to stay in place. The first example I'm looking at has these teal and yellow shapes with a blue background. I\u2019m zeroing in on this \"T\" or cross-like shape in the top, noting its pixel locations.\n\nOkay, let's look closer at the grid itself. The inputs are 18 rows and 8 columns. I\u2019m noticing there are grouped pixels that aren\u2019t the background. There are clusters of teal and yellow pixels. I\u2019m trying to discern a rule. I can see a big shape made of teal pixels with a central yellow pixel. Let's analyze the shapes in the image. I\u2019m grouping things that seem logically together and looking for a pattern. It looks like these shapes may be rectangles or other kinds of shapes, but I\u2019m really just looking for how those non-background pixels are grouped together and anything special about the pattern.\n\nIt\u2019s becoming apparent there are three identifiable groups of non-background pixels. I need to figure out how they are moving relative to the input. Let\u2019s re-read the input carefully to extract the group structure again. My attention is drawn to those bright yellow pixels. I\u2019m trying to figure out where they are, what kind of shapes are built around them, and if this matters later on in the task.\n\nNow, let's carefully read the output to see what has changed. The output has background 1. What changed in the shapes? The top shape moved right. The second and third moved left and right respectively.\n\nNow I\u2019m wondering, what makes these groups move? Is there some attractor or target? Looking at Example 1 output, the yellow pixel that was on the right is now in a consistent column. Now I\u2019m suspecting there's some attractor that these things align themselves to. Maybe column 5 is the attraction? I\u2019m looking very closely at that column to see if it makes some sense.\n\nSo I\u2019m noticing now the yellow 4 pixel is the \"center\" of each of the three shapes. It appears that the rule may be that the location of the yellow pixel is the important piece. Is there anything else? Row 17 has an isolated yellow pixel.\n\nI formulate a hypothesis: There are \"moveable shapes\" and \"anchor points\". It looks like the rule is: Align the '4' within each shape vertically with the anchor pixel. Let's verify this on another example. It's got a background 8. I will look for shapes and any singular pixels as potential anchors. I\u2019m realizing that this strategy may be helpful to get a grasp on the entire class of such problems.\n\nIn Example 2, background is 8, and there are pixels of 3 and 4 and 6 and 1. I\u2019m going to now extract these shapes and attempt to discern an anchor point. After some close reading, it looks like there are some \"anchors\" for all the \"moveable shapes\", for this second example.\n\nIn this second example, there are the vertical strips of 4s and the other shapes. They have single 1s embedded within them. It seems like a consistent color pixel might be the key to the pattern. It is becoming clear that single pixels or those pixels that are not part of shapes are important. The vertical strip seems to move up a row. I\u2019m starting to think the shape is trying to align to some reference point.\n\nOk, let's examine Example 2's output again. The vertical strip aligns its 6 to a reference 6. The \"blob with 1\" moved so its 1 aligns with the reference 1. I\u2019m going to work toward writing a more generalizable algorithm. This third image further emphasizes this concept. The shapes, containing those distinct colored pixels, all move to align with a consistent column. I can see in these two examples the anchors can be on the side, at the top, or at the bottom.\n\nSo the rule I\u2019ve developed is that the singular pixels are the reference, and shapes containing pixels of the same color will align to the same row or column as this singular pixel. Now, it's time to refine this rule. The rule is:\n\n1.  Find the background color.\n2.  Find anchor pixels (single pixels)\n3.  Find all the non-background pixel groupings and describe them.\n4.  Each group contains a\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on a rule inferred from the solved examples.\n\n**Rule Inference:**\n1.  **Background & Anchors:** The grid consists of a background color (8 in the test case) and foreground objects. There are specific \"Anchor\" pixels that determine the target position for the foreground objects.\n    *   In Example 1, a single anchor pixel (4) at the bottom (Row 17, Col 5) dictated that all shapes containing a '4' align their '4' vertically to Column 5.\n    *   In Example 2, anchors in the left column (Col 0) at Row 4 (Color 1) and Row 8 (Color 6) dictated that shapes containing '1' align to Row 4, and shapes containing '6' align to Row 8.\n    *   In Example 3, an anchor (Color 2) at the top (Row 0, Col 4) dictated vertical alignment to Column 4.\n    *   **Heuristic:** Anchors are isolated single pixels of a unique color, typically on the border. If anchors share a column (as in Ex 2 and the Test Input), alignment is Horizontal (Row-based). If they share a row or are unique, alignment is Vertical (Column-based).\n\n2.  **Mapping Objects to Anchors:**\n    *   Identify connected shapes (excluding anchors).\n    *   For each shape, determine its \"Key Color\" based on the colors present in the shape that match the Anchor colors.\n    *   **Priority Rule:**\n        *   If the shape contains the Anchor color as its **Majority** color, use that color for alignment.\n        *   If the Majority color is not an Anchor, use the **Minority** (or next frequent) color that matches an Anchor.\n        *   (This resolves conflicts where a shape contains multiple anchor colors, like shapes A, B, D, E in the test input, and ensures shapes like D stay within grid boundaries).\n    *   **Alignment:** Calculate the shift required to move the shape so that the pixel(s) of the Key Color align with the Anchor's Row (or Column).\n        *   For horizontal alignment (Test Input), `Shift = AnchorRow - ShapeKeyPixelRow`. All pixels of the Key Color in the shape align to the Anchor Row (typically the bottom-most pixel of that color aligns).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Anchors (Column 0):**\n    *   Row 3: Color 6\n    *   Row 10: Color 4\n    *   Row 12: Color 2\n    *   *Transformation Rule:* Align Key Pixels to these Target Rows.\n\n*   **Object Analysis & Transformation:**\n    1.  **Object A (Top-Left):** Colors 6 (Majority) and 4. Matches Anchor 6.\n        *   Key Color: 6.\n        *   Bottom-most 6 at Row 1. Target Row 3.\n        *   **Shift: +2 rows.**\n    2.  **Object B (Top-Right):** Colors 4 (Majority) and 6. Matches Anchor 4.\n        *   Key Color: 4.\n        *   Bottom-most 4 at Row 3. Target Row 10.\n        *   **Shift: +7 rows.**\n    3.  **Object D (Middle-Left):** Colors 4 (Majority) and 6. Matches Anchor 4. (Note: Using 6 would move it out of bounds).\n        *   Key Color: 4.\n        *   Bottom-most 4 at Row 8. Target Row 10.\n        *   **Shift: +2 rows.**\n    4.  **Object E (Middle-Center):** Colors 4 (Majority) and 6. Matches Anchor 4.\n        *   Key Color: 4.\n        *   Bottom-most 4 at Row 9. Target Row 10.\n        *   **Shift: +1 row.**\n    5.  **Object F (Middle-Right):** Colors 3 (Majority) and 6. Anchor 3 doesn't exist. Matches Anchor 6.\n        *   Key Color: 6.\n        *   Pixel 6 at Row 9. Target Row 3.\n        *   **Shift: -6 rows.**\n    6.  **Isolated 2s:**\n        *   (3,6), (5,7), (7,1), (10,12), (12,19).\n        *   Key Color: 2. Matches Anchor 2 (Row 12).\n        *   All move to **Row 12**, preserving their column.\n\n**Final Grid Construction:**\n*   Object A moves from Rows 0-1 to Rows 2-3.\n*   Object B moves from Rows 1-3 to Rows 8-10.\n*   Object D moves from Rows 5-9 to Rows 7-11.\n*   Object E moves from Rows 6-9 to Rows 7-10.\n*   Object F moves from Rows 6-9 to Rows 0-3.\n*   Isolated 2s move to Row 12.\n*   Anchors remain in Col 0.\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n6,8,8,6,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,4,6,4,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,4,4,6,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8\n4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,8,8,8,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,2\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n      8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n      6,8,8,6,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,4,6,4,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,4,4,6,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8\n      4,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      2,2,8,8,8,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,2\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"B\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_8_step_5_image\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Here's my thought process as I tackled this ARC task:**\n\nOkay, the goal is to figure out the pattern in these examples and apply it. Let's dig in!\n\nFirst, I looked at Example 1 and focused on the shapes with the special color (4).  I noticed they all seemed to *move*. I started by comparing the input and output grids and traced how the '4's moved. My initial thought was they might be moving toward each other, but the horizontal alignment seemed more important. The key was that the '4's inside the shapes were aligning with an isolated '4' pixel. The *column* seemed to be the key, so I started looking for the isolated '4' pixel at the bottom. The shapes were moving so their '4's lined up with that isolated one, horizontally.\n\nWith that rule in mind, I tried it on Example 2. Here, it got more complex. There were multiple 'special' colors, and the '4' was not at the bottom - there was a single '1' at the far left as well. The shapes had '1's in them, '4's, and '6's. Okay, this is getting complex, so I decided to look at the isolated pixels first. Aha! The shapes *moved to align with the isolated pixels*, but this time, the *rows* were important. Shapes moved vertically to line up with the row of the isolated pixel.\n\nThis is a good start. I refined my rule to say, \"Identify the marker pixels (single isolated ones). Shapes with a color matching a marker must move to align *horizontally (column)* or *vertically (row)*.\"\n\nMoving to Example 3 was a test. The isolated '2' was at the top, and all the shapes contained a '2'. The output showed them aligning horizontally with the top '2' pixel, the rule from Example 1 worked.\n\nNow, to the Test Input! I focused on identifying the background, which was teal '8'. Next, I scanned for isolated pixels - I wanted my 'Markers'. There they are! They are all on the left edge. I have three \"markers\". Next, the objects were shapes composed of 4's, 6's. But which color? I decided the key was the shape's \"body.\" I hypothesized that objects would move to the marker that matched a color *within* them. For the test grid, I had the following potential objects to map:\n\n1. **Top-Left Shape**: Body '6'. Target Marker is 6 (Row 3, column 0).\n2. **Top-Right Shape**: Body '4'. Target Marker is 4 (Row 10, column 0).\n3. **Mid-Left Scattered**: 2 (at the edge). Must Align with 2 Marker!\n4. **Scattered 2s, Rightside**: Marker `2` on the right side.\n5. **Mid-Left Object:** Body '4'. Target Marker is 4 (Row 10, column 0).\n6. **Mid-Right Shape:** Body '4'. Target Marker is 4 (Row 10, column 0).\n7. **Far-Right Object:** Body (the \"body is 3s\"). 3 has no marker. But it *has* the '6'. So I thought the '6' would match the 6-marker.\n\nWith each object, I figured out how to shift to the marker's row or column. But a clash occurred!  Two objects *wanted* to go to Row 10 (the 4-Marker). I had an idea to solve the problem:\n\nIf you are a shape that *wants* to go to *Marker X*, and can't, for any reason, try Marker Y, since X does not work. This made perfect sense, and I realized there could be a case where clipping happens. The most important pixel will stay.\n\nAfter careful calculations, I wrote down all of the shifts. With the shifts worked out, I built the output grid based on where things *landed*. It got complex, but the steps I found.\n\n\nThe task involves identifying objects in the grid and moving them vertically to align with specific \"marker\" pixels located in the leftmost column.\n\n**Logic derived from examples:**\n1.  **Identify Markers:** In the test input, the leftmost column (Column 0) contains single isolated pixels that act as markers for vertical alignment:\n    *   Row 3: Color 6 (Magenta)\n    *   Row 10: Color 4 (Yellow)\n    *   Row 12: Color 2 (Red)\n    (There is also a marker 2 at the bottom right, confirming Row 12 for red objects).\n\n2.  **Identify Objects:** Identify the distinct shapes in the grid.\n    *   **Shape A (Top-Left):** A box of 6s with a 4 inside. (Body Color: 6).\n    *   **Shape B (Top-Right):** A shape of 4s with a 6 inside. (Body Color: 4).\n    *   **Shape C (Mid-Left):** A \"rocket\" shape of 4s with a 6 at the bottom tip. (Body Color: 4).\n    *   **Shape D (Mid-Right):** A shape of 4s with a 6 in the corner. (Body Color: 4).\n    *   **Shape E (Far-Right):** A shape of 3s with a 6 inside. (Body Color: 3).\n    *   **Scattered Pixels:** Several isolated pixels of color 2.\n\n3.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   **Primary Rule:** Move each object vertically so that the bottom row of its \"Body\" aligns with the row of the Marker corresponding to its Body Color.\n    *   **Secondary Rule (if Body Color has no marker):** Move the object so that its contained \"minority\" pixel aligns with the Marker of that pixel's color.\n    *   **Scattered Pixels:** Move isolated pixels to the row of the Marker corresponding to their color.\n\n**Applying the rules:**\n\n*   **Shape A (Body 6):** Target Marker 6 (Row 3).\n    *   Current Bottom of Body (Row 1) moves to Row 3. (Shift +2).\n    *   New Position: Rows 2-3.\n*   **Shape B (Body 4):** Target Marker 4 (Row 10).\n    *   Current Bottom of Body (Row 3) moves to Row 10. (Shift +7).\n    *   New Position: Rows 8-10.\n*   **Shape C (Body 4):** Target Marker 4 (Row 10).\n    *   Current Bottom of Body (Row 8) moves to Row 10. The tip (6) is at Row 9, which is an appendage, not body. (Shift +2).\n    *   New Position: Rows 7-11.\n*   **Shape D (Body 4):** Target Marker 4 (Row 10).\n    *   Current Bottom of Body (Row 9) moves to Row 10. (Shift +1).\n    *   New Position: Rows 7-10.\n*   **Shape E (Body 3):** No Marker 3. Contains 6. Target Marker 6 (Row 3).\n    *   Align the 6 pixel (at Row 9) to Row 3. (Shift -6).\n    *   New Position: Rows 0-3.\n*   **Scattered 2s:** Target Marker 2 (Row 12).\n    *   All isolated 2s move to Row 12, keeping their column.\n\n**Completed Output Grid Generation:**\n\n*   **Background:** 8\n*   **Markers:** (3,0):6, (10,0):4, (12,0):2, (12,19):2\n*   **Row 0:** Shape E (3,3,3) at cols 17-19.\n*   **Row 1:** Shape E (3,8,3) at cols 17-19.\n*   **Row 2:** Shape A (6,6,6) at cols 3-5.

I've been presented with three examples and a test input, and my approach will involve carefully analyzing the examples to understand the transformation rules and then applying those rules to the test input.\n\n**Key Observations and Hypotheses:**\n\n1.  **\"Open Container\" Definition:** The task seems to revolve around identifying shapes formed by a specific color (C) that \"cup\" or enclose a pixel of a different color (F) that is not the background color (B). \"Cup\" is key, implies more than 2 sides.\n2.  **Sealing Mechanism:** The core transformation is \"sealing\" the open container by drawing a straight line across the opening using the shape's color (C). This action closes the container and changes its topological features.\n3.  **Position Shift (Potential Red Herring):** I've noticed a pattern of position shifts in the examples. But I believe position is secondary and might be an artifact. The hints I was provided don't mention movement, so I choose to focus on how the containers *change* and not where.\n4.  **Local Transformation:** The hints strongly suggest a local transformation \u2013 changes occur within the immediate vicinity of the identified container.\n\n**Process:**\n\n1.  **Background Identification:** I must first determine the background color. In the test input, 8 is the most prevalent color, so 8 is the background color.\n2.  **Shape Detection:** I then scan the grid to detect contiguous regions of non-background colors. Each region represents a potential container.\n3.  **Cup/Enclosure Check:** For each shape, I check if it forms a \"cup\" or \"U\"-shape that encloses a foreign pixel. A \"cup\" must have an opening, which represents a side with direct access to the interior.\n4.  **Sealing Logic:** If a shape is a cup and has a foreign pixel within, I seal it by drawing a line across the opening. This sealing uses the container's color and completes the bounding box.\n5.  **Output Grid Generation:** I'll create the output grid by applying these changes in-place. Other pixels which are not part of an open container will remain in their initial position.\n\n**Applying to the Test Input:**\n\nI scanned the provided test input and will follow the algorithm:\n\n**Object A:**\nRows 0-1, Cols 3-5 (6s enclosing 4) -> Seal Bottom Row\n\n**Object B:**\nRows 1-2, Cols 13-15 (4s enclosing 6) -> Seal Top Row\n\n**Object D:**\nRows 7-9, Cols 8-10 (4s enclosing 6 and 8) -> Seal Rightmost Column\n\n**Object E:**\nRows 6-9, Cols 17-19 (3s enclosing 6,8s) -> Seal the Bottom Row\n\n**Constructing and Outputting the Result:**\n\nI carefully built the output row by row according to the determined actions and the known grid size.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to identify \"open containers\" in the grid and \"seal\" them. An open container is a shape of a specific color that partially encloses a \"foreign\" pixel (a pixel of a different color). The transformation requires drawing a straight line across the opening using the container's color to turn the \"bay\" containing the foreign pixel into a \"hole\".\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis of the test input:\n\n1.  **Identify Background:** The grid is predominantly filled with `8` (teal), which serves as the background.\n\n2.  **Locate Shapes and Analyze Connectivity:** We scan the grid for connected shapes of non-background colors (`6`, `4`, `2`, `3`) and check if they enclose a foreign pixel.\n\n    *   **Shape 1 (Top Left):** A magenta shape (`6`).\n        *   Row 0: `6 6 6` (Cols 3-5)\n        *   Row 1: `6 4 6` (Cols 3-5)\n        *   Inside is `4` (yellow) at (1, 4).\n        *   The shape encloses the `4` on the top, left, and right. It is open at the **bottom**.\n        *   **Action:** Seal the bottom at Row 2, Cols 3-5 with `6`.\n\n    *   **Shape 2 (Top Right):** A yellow shape (`4`).\n        *   Row 1: `4 6 4` (Cols 13-15)\n        *   Row 2: `4 4 4` (Cols 13-15)\n        *   Connected to `4` at (3, 14), forming a wine-glass shape, but the cup part is Rows 1-2.\n        *   Inside is `6` (magenta) at (1, 14).\n        *   The shape encloses the `6` on the bottom, left, and right. It is open at the **top**.\n        *   **Action:** Seal the top at Row 0, Cols 13-15 with `4`.\n\n    *   **Shape 3 (Middle Right):** A yellow shape (`4`).\n        *   Row 7: `4 4 4` (Cols 8-10)\n        *   Row 8: `4 4 6` (Cols 8-10) -> Intruder `6` at (8, 10).\n        *   Row 9: `... 4` (Col 10)\n        *   The `6` at (8, 10) is bounded by `4` on the top (7, 10), left (8, 9), and bottom (9, 10).\n        *   It is open to the **right**.\n        *   **Action:** Seal the right side at Col 11. The opening spans Rows 7 to 9. We fill (7, 11), (8, 11), and (9, 11) with `4`.\n\n    *   **Shape 4 (Right Side):** A green shape (`3`).\n        *   Row 6: `3 3 3` (Cols 17-19)\n        *   Row 7: `3 8 3`\n        *   Row 8: `3 8 3`\n        *   Row 9: `3 6 3` -> Intruder `6` at (9, 18).\n        *   The shape encloses the column of pixels (including the `6`) on the top, left, and right.\n        *   It is open at the **bottom**.\n        *   **Action:** Seal the bottom at Row 10, Cols 17-19 with `3`.\n\n    *   **Other Shapes:**\n        *   The box at Rows 6-8, Cols 3-5 is already closed (`4 4 4` / `4 8 4` / `4 4 4`), so it remains unchanged.\n        *   Various isolated pixels (`2`s, `6`s) do not form cups enclosing foreign pixels and are ignored.\n\n3.  **Construct Output:** Apply the \"sealing\" patches to the input grid.\n\noutput:\n8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,6,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,6,4,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8\n6,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n8,2,8,4,8,4,8,8,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,4,4,6,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3\n4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,6,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,6,4,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8\n      6,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      8,2,8,4,8,4,8,8,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n      8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,4,4,6,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3\n      8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3\n      4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,3,3,3\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"B\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-high_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nBelow is how I approached it and the resulting grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Interpreting the transformation\n\nFrom the description and examples, the intended transformation is:\n\n- Identify **objects** that act as **\u201copen containers\u201d**: a connected set of pixels of one color (the *container color*) that partially surrounds a pixel of another color (the *foreign color*) in a concave \u201cbay\u201d.\n- The foreign pixel is adjacent to the container\u2019s inner boundary, and there is a direct path from it to the outside of the container (the container has an *opening*).\n- The task is to **\u201cseal\u201d** the container by drawing a **straight line** (horizontal or vertical) of the container\u2019s color **across the opening**, so the foreign pixel ends up completely enclosed (inside a \u201chole\u201d rather than a \u201cbay\u201d).\n- The foreign pixel is **not recolored**; it remains the same color, just now in a fully enclosed region.\n- Shapes that are not acting as open containers are left unchanged.\n\nIn the test grid, the background color is 8. The non-background colors are 4, 6, 2, 3. I looked for connected components where one of these colors forms a C- or U-shaped outline around a differently colored pixel, with a clear, axis-aligned opening.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Finding and sealing the containers in the test input\n\nI\u2019ll describe each detected container and the line that seals it.\n\n### Container 1: 6s around a 4 at the top-left\n\nLocal pattern (rows 1\u20132, cols 4\u20136):\n\n- Row 1: `6 6 6`\n- Row 2: `6 4 6`\n- Row 3 (originally): `8 8 8`\n\nSo we have:\n\n```\nrow1: 6 6 6\nrow2: 6 4 6\nrow3: 8 8 8   (background)\n```\n\nColor 6 forms a 3\u00d72 \u201ccup\u201d open **downwards**, with a 4 inside the bay.\n\nTo **seal** this, draw a horizontal line of 6s across the opening, on row 3, columns 4\u20136:\n\n- Change `(3,4)`, `(3,5)`, `(3,6)` from 8 \u21d2 6.\n\nAfter this, that 3\u00d73 block looks like:\n\n```\n6 6 6\n6 4 6\n6 6 6\n```\n\nThe 4 is now inside a fully closed loop of 6s.\n\n---\n\n### Container 2: 4s around a 6 near top-right\n\nLocal pattern (rows 2\u20134, cols 14\u201316) before change:\n\n- Row 2: `4 6 4` (cols 14\u201316)\n- Row 3: `4 4 4`\n- Row 4: `. 4 .` (here `.` is 8)\n\nIn block form:\n\n```\nrow1: . . .

Shapes containing foreign pixels MOVE so their internal foreign pixel aligns (same row or column) with the matching isolated anchor pixel\n4. Shapes without foreign pixels inside stay in place\n5.

                "response": "**My Analysis of ARC Task Candidate Solutions**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got. The user wants me to go over several possible solutions for this ARC task.  It's a transformation problem, and the goal is to pick the best rule that fits the given training examples and then predicts the output for a new test case.\n\n**Understanding the Task**\n\nI'm looking at three training examples to understand how objects are being transformed, and then I need to apply what I learn to a test input. I need to be able to identify patterns, see how the shape and colors are being changed, and figure out the general rule behind it all.\n\n**Training Example Decomposition**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   This one is pretty straightforward.  There are these shapes with a color inside them, and there's a standalone pixel with the same color on the edge.  The shapes shift so their inner pixel lines up with that isolated marker.  So, I hypothesize that the color of that lone pixel determines where the shape will move to, aligning with the marker's column.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   This expands on the first one.  Now there are multiple shapes, each with a pixel inside of them and there are separate markers on the left of the image.  The shape's interior pixel aligns with the column that the marker is in. I can tell that a marker on a vertical edge is now triggering a vertical movement.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   This is the same thing, just with the marker on the top, making the shape shift horizontally so its inner color aligns with the marker.  The rule I am building: look at colors, connect to components that are related by the color of its pixels, and see how the movement is defined by these isolated boundary color pixels.\n\n**Constructing the Core Rule**\n\nMy main idea is that the standalone pixels around the edge act as \"markers.\" I identify shapes that have a pixel of the same color inside of them. Those shapes then get shifted, but they stay in place with the same rigid positions of other pixels.\n\n*   If the marker is on a vertical edge (left or right), the shift is vertical (same column/changes row).\n*   If the marker is on a horizontal edge (top or bottom), the shift is horizontal (same row/changes column).\n\nIsolated markers generally stay put, but they are very important because they help tell us where to move the other shapes.\n\n**Test Case Prediction**\n\nIn the new input, the same basic idea should apply.\n\n*   I see a number of candidate markers along the edges (magenta, yellow, and red).\n*   I see shapes that include those colors (with 4, 6, and 2 inside them).\n*   Based on my rule, I will know where to move things.\n\n*   Shape A: Inside 4, move vertically to be on same row as a yellow marker.\n*   Shape B, C, D, E: Inside 6, move vertically to be on the same row as a magenta marker.\n*   The same goes for the isolated pixels, they act as their own component.\n\n**Analyzing Candidates**\n\n*   **Candidate 2:** This is the strongest candidate at first glance. It correctly identifies the markers and how to use the rule. It mostly gets the transformation of the complex shapes right, and it uses the color pixels inside the frame pixels to determine the alignment position. The main critique is the \"orphan\" 2s. The candidate seems to have skipped using the existing red markers and not transformed these.  Is that intentional? Or is there a different interpretation? I will need to look deeper into the examples and logic!\n*   **Candidate 3:** This fails to identify the importance of the color composition of the shapes. This looks at one color in the test input, ignoring the transformation that is the main component of the training.\n*   **Candidate 8:** Another very strong option. It has the same core logic as Candidate 2, and in addition it also correctly uses the rule to move the orphan pixels, and has the transformation of all pixels consistent with examples. This is the top candidate!\n*   **Candidate 16:** This one is a bit more complicated.  It tries to prioritize how the move happens.  The problem is this rule conflicts with all the examples, in particular there is no evidence that this kind of composition logic is a thing.\n*   **Candidates 20/22:** These are completely off base. They are trying to \"seal\" things, which has nothing to do with the training examples.\n\n**Candidate Refinement**\n\nLooking at the top two candidates, I can strengthen their interpretations:\n\n*   **Candidate 8:** Confirmed! This one is the best because it explains the transformation of all the pieces,\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 8,\n      \"score\": 10.0,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Perfectly captures the rule: identify edge markers and align objects containing the marker color to the marker's row/column.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Identify isolated marker pixels on the grid edge.
