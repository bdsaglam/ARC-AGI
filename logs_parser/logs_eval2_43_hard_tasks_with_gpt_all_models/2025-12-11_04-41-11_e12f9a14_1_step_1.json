        "Full raw LLM response": "**My Analytical Process for Solving the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process laid out, step by step. The goal is to solve an ARC task based on examples.\n\nFirst, I examine the provided example inputs and outputs. I'm focusing on identifying patterns and rules that connect them. In Example 1, I see teal backgrounds and shapes like rings of a specific color enclosing another. My initial thought is about identifying connected components in the input grid. But I notice something: the shapes in the output are preserved, and colors seem to \"leak\" outwards, creating rays.\n\nThen, I meticulously analyze the coordinates of the non-background pixels in the input, and their placement relative to the shapes. This reveals that the outer shapes have gaps or \"holes\" in the structure. Example 2's ring structure with a missing pixel really drives home the importance of these holes. It looks like the inner color shoots rays through them.\n\nHypothesis: The rule is that rays of the interior color emanate from the holes in the container's border. The rays travel until they hit another object or the grid's edge.\n\nI then study a second example, looking for confirmation of this idea and trying to understand how rays interact. Example 2 shows the ray concept perfectly. But then I get stuck on Example 1: What happens if rays collide? Do they stop? Bounce? Cross?\n\nAfter a second examination, I realized they *don't* cross - instead, adjacent rays become vertical in my examples. I revise the rule: Rays travel in their direction, but if two rays try to \"swap positions\" (cross paths adjacently) or land on the same spot, they interact, changing directions to prevent overlap. I call this \"collision\".\n\nTo test my collision hypothesis, I carefully go over Example 4.\n\nI then move on to the test input. I look for the shapes, the inner colors, and the holes in the surrounding borders. I carefully calculate ray paths and collisions based on my refined ray rules. I need to handle all edge cases so I can be sure my method works reliably. I list each ray with its initial direction and expected path, and any potential collisions, so I can check for collisions later. The Test Input is complex, so there are multiple ray collisions to account for.\n\nIn the Test Input, there are multiple rays, and several points where they *might* intersect or merge. I work through each case methodically, step by step. I make sure I am applying my rule of ray deflection or parallel displacement when there are collisions.\n\nFinally, I have a detailed list of all the pixels that need to be filled with the respective colors, based on the rays. It will be the \"solution\" to this ARC task.\n\n\nThe solution involves simulating rays of color emanating from the inner colored blocks through holes in the surrounding borders.\n\n**Rules inferred from examples:**\n1.  **Identify Structures:** Locate structures consisting of an \"inner\" block of color enclosed by a \"border\" of a different color (often teal/8).\n2.  **Locate Holes:** Identify gaps or holes in the border where the border color is missing (often replaced by background 0 or another color).\n3.  **Cast Rays:** Project a ray of the inner color from the inner block through the hole.\n    *   If the hole is diagonally adjacent to the inner block, the ray travels diagonally.\n    *   If the hole is orthogonally adjacent (vertical/horizontal), the ray travels orthogonally.\n4.  **Handle Collisions:**\n    *   **Crossing/Swapping:** If two rays (e.g., one moving NE, one moving NW) are adjacent and their next diagonal steps would cause them to swap columns (cross paths), they deflect and become parallel vertical lines going upwards. The deflection happens after the step where they become adjacent.\n    *   **Converging:** If two rays (e.g., one moving SE, one moving S) would land on the same pixel in the next step, the diagonal one deflects to become a parallel vertical line (downwards) next to the straight one.\n    *   **Obstacles:** Rays stop when they hit the grid edge or another solid structure (like the border of another shape).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Shape A (Red 2s, Top-Right):** Inner 2s, Border 8s.\n    *   Hole at (6,22) -> Ray **NW** from (6,22).\n    *   Hole at (6,25) -> Ray **NE** from (6,25).\n    *   Hole at (9,25) -> Ray **SE** from (9,25).\n*   **Shape B (Green 3s, Mid-Left):** Inner 3s, Border 8s.\n    *   Hole at (10,4) -> Ray **NW** from (10,4).\n    *   Hole at (10,7) -> Ray **NE** from (10,7).\n    *   Hole at (13,5) -> Ray **S** (South) from (13,5).\n    *   Hole at (13,7) -> Ray **SE** from (13,7).\n*   **Shape C (Yellow 4s, Mid-Center):** Inner 4s, Border 8s.\n    *   Hole at (10,10) -> Ray **NW** from (10,10).\n    *   Hole at (10,13) -> Ray **NE** from (10,13).\n    *   Hole at (13,11) -> Ray **S** (South) from (13,11).\n    *   Hole at (13,13) -> Ray **SE** from (13,13).\n*   **Shape D (Orange 7s, Bottom-Right):** Inner 7s, Border 8s.\n    *   Hole at (24,26) -> Ray **NE** from (24,26).\n    *   Hole at (27,24) -> Ray **S** (South) from (27,24).\n    *   Hole at (26,26) -> Ray **E** (East) from (26,26).\n\n**Processing Rays & Collisions:**\n\n1.  **Shape B NE (3) vs Shape C NW (4):**\n    *   Paths: B-NE `(10,7)->(9,8)` and C-NW `(10,10)->(9,9)`.\n    *   At Row 9, they are adjacent at columns 8 and 9.\n    *   Collision: They deflect UP vertically.\n    *   B (3) fills `(8,8)` to `(0,8)`.\n    *   C (4) fills `(8,9)` to `(0,9)`.\n2.  **Shape C NE (4) vs Shape A NW (2):**\n    *   Paths: C-NE `(10,13)...(4,19)` and A-NW `(6,22)...(4,20)`.\n    *   At Row 4, they are adjacent at columns 19 and 20.\n    *   Collision: They deflect UP vertically.\n    *   C (4) fills `(3,19)` to `(0,19)`.\n    *   A (2) fills `(3,20)` to `(0,20)`.\n3.  **Shape B SE (3) vs Shape C S (4):**\n    *   Paths: B-SE `(13,7)...(16,10)` and C-S `(13,11)...(16,11)`.\n    *   At Row 16, they are adjacent at columns 10 and 11. The diagonal B-SE tries to merge into col 11 but is blocked by C-S.\n    *   Collision: B-SE deflects DOWN vertically.\n    *   B (3) fills `(17,10)` to `(29,10)`.\n    *   C (4) continues South `(13,11)` to `(29,11)`.\n4.  **Other Rays:**\n    *   A-NE (2): `(6,25)->(2,29)`.\n    *   A-SE (2): `(9,25)->(13,29)`.\n    *   B-NW (3): `(10,4)->(6,0)`.\n    *   B-S (3): `(13,5)->(29,5)`.\n    *   C-SE (4): `(13,13)->(23,23)` (Stops at Shape D border).\n    *   D-NE (7): `(24,26)->(21,29)`.\n    *   D-S (7): `(27,24)->(29,24)`.\n    *   D-E (7): `(26,26)->(26,29)`.\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,2,0,2,8,8,2,0,0,0,0\n0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,8,2,2,8,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,2,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,8,8,3,0,0,4,8,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,3,8,0,0,8,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,3,8,0,0,8,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,8,3,0,0,0,8,4,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,4,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,4,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,7,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,7,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,7,7,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,7,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, so the task at hand is to solve an ARC puzzle based on given examples. My initial approach is to analyze the provided examples, identify patterns, and formulate a generalizable rule.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:** I started by examining the first example. The grid is 24x24 with a teal background (8). I noticed several shapes with green borders (3) and interior colors like maroon (9), blue (1), and yellow (4). Examining the output, I observed diagonal lines of colors extending from these shapes. It quickly became clear that the interior color of each shape somehow determined the color of a diagonal line that extended from that shape.\nThe diagonal lines, it seemed, didn't always have the same direction, but some extended downwards and right, others to the top left. Tracing a few lines and counting the row and column differences, it became apparent that it was a constant either along the main diagonal (r-c = constant, or along the anti-diagonal r+c= constant). After closer inspection, I realized that the diagonal lines extended outwards from the shapes and the colors seemed to be related to the interior color. The lines didn't actually start from the center of the shape but from the corner. It seems that the line emits from a \"corner\" defined by the bounding box of the shape. What if those corners were not there?\n\n**Hypothesis Formulation:** I formulated a hypothesis: **Shapes with an incomplete border leak their interior color through any gaps in their border**. The gaps are found on the bounding box (smallest rectangle that encompasses the shape) and are cells which the border color is missing. The shape's interior color, then, 'leaks' out of these gaps in the form of a line. If the gap happens to be a corner on the bounding box, the leak is diagonal.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:** I applied this hypothesis to example 2, another example. Here, the interior colors leaked and extended from cells outside of the box which had no border color.\n\n**Example 3 Analysis:** I further verified the hypothesis on additional examples, including Example 3. This one looked more complex, but I was able to observe and confirm the patterns. In example 3, some cells were part of multiple leaks or directions, which caused me to refine the hypothesis a little. The gaps are corners on a bounding box of a shape. The bounding box, in this case, would be a grid containing only the border color in its cells and any interior color in its cells.\n\n**Test Input application:** Given a 30x30 test input, there are a number of shapes, each with interior colors and incomplete borders. First, I identify each of the shapes, given its border color and interior color. Then, I define a bounding box for each shape. I examine the cells adjacent to the border and see if there are missing borders. Any edge cell with a missing border is considered a gap. If there is a corner cell, the leak is diagonal. If there is a side cell, then the leak is vertical or horizontal. Any leak goes until the edge of the grid. If there are conflicts (lines overlap), the higher-order shapes win over lower-order shapes.\n\n\nTo solve this task, we identify the shapes in the grid and their interactions with the background.\n\n**Rule Inference:**\n1.  **Identify Shapes:** The input grid contains distinct rectangular shapes defined by a border (usually color 8, sometimes 3) and an interior color (2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, etc.).\n2.  **Locate Gaps:** Inspect the border of each shape. Some cells on the border are \"missing\" (i.e., they are the background color, 0 or 8, instead of the border color). These are \"Gaps\".\n3.  **Fill and Project:**\n    *   **Fill:** The interior color of the shape \"leaks\" into these gaps. The gap cell itself takes the interior color.\n    *   **Project:** A line of the interior color extends from the gap outwards to the edge of the grid.\n    *   **Direction:**\n        *   If the gap is at a **Corner** of the shape's bounding box, the line extends **Diagonally** outwards (e.g., Top-Left corner $\\rightarrow$ Up-Left).\n        *   If the gap is on a **Side** (edge) of the shape's bounding box but not a corner, the line extends **Perpendicularly** outwards (e.g., Top edge $\\rightarrow$ Up, Right edge $\\rightarrow$ Right).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\nBackground is 0. Border is 8.\n\n**Shape 1 (Top-Right, Interior 2 - Red):**\n*   Bounding Box: Rows 6-9, Cols 22-25.\n*   **Gaps:**\n    *   (6, 24) [Top Side]: Projects **UP** (Color 2).\n    *   (6, 25) [Top-Right Corner]: Projects **UP-RIGHT** (Color 2).\n    *   (7, 25) [Right Side]: Projects **RIGHT** (Color 2).\n    *   (8, 25) [Right Side]: Projects **RIGHT** (Color 2).\n    *   (9, 25) [Bottom-Right Corner]: Projects **DOWN-RIGHT** (Color 2).\n\n**Shape 2 (Middle-Left, Interior 3 - Green):**\n*   Bounding Box: Rows 10-13, Cols 4-7.\n*   **Gaps:**\n    *   (10, 4) [Top-Left Corner]: Projects **UP-LEFT** (Color 3).\n    *   (10, 7) [Top-Right Corner]: Projects **UP-RIGHT** (Color 3).\n    *   (13, 5) [Bottom Side]: Projects **DOWN** (Color 3).\n    *   (13, 7) [Bottom-Right Corner]: Projects **DOWN-RIGHT** (Color 3).\n\n**Shape 3 (Middle, Interior 4 - Yellow):**\n*   Bounding Box: Rows 10-13, Cols 11-14.\n*   **Gaps:**\n    *   (10, 11) [Top-Left Corner]: Projects **UP-LEFT** (Color 4).\n    *   (10, 14) [Top-Right Corner]: Projects **UP-RIGHT** (Color 4).\n    *   (13, 12) [Bottom Side]: Projects **DOWN** (Color 4).\n    *   (13, 14) [Bottom-Right Corner]: Projects **DOWN-RIGHT** (Color 4).\n\n**Shape 4 (Bottom-Right, Interior 7 - Orange):**\n*   Bounding Box: Rows 25-28, Cols 23-26.\n*   **Gaps:**\n    *   (25, 26) [Top-Right Corner]: Projects **UP-RIGHT** (Color 7).\n    *   (27, 26) [Right Side]: Projects **RIGHT** (Color 7).\n    *   (28, 24) [Bottom Side]: Projects **DOWN** (Color 7).\n\n**Conflict Resolution:**\n*   At (0, 24), the UP line from Shape 1 (Color 2) and the UP-RIGHT line from Shape 3 (Color 4) intersect. We prioritize the top-most shape (Shape 1), so cell (0, 24) is 2.\n*   At (8, 9), the UP-RIGHT line from Shape 2 (Color 3) and the UP-LEFT line from Shape 3 (Color 4) intersect. We prioritize the left-most shape (Shape 2), so cell (8, 9) is 3.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0\n4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0\n0,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0\n3,0,0,0,0,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,8,8,2,2,0,0,0,0\n0,3,0,0,0,0,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,8,2,2,2,2\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,8,2,2,2,2\n3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,2,0,0,0,0\n3,0,0,0,3,8,8,3,0,0,0,4,8,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,3,8,0,0,8,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,3,8,0,0,8,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,8,3,0,0,0,8,4,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,0,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,4,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,7,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,7,7,8,7,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,7,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n1. Each input has small 4x4 patterns with an 8-frame (or 3-frame in examples) surrounding a 2x2 colored center\n2. Some positions in the frame have gaps (background color instead of frame color)\n3. The transformation draws lines of the center color extending outward from each gap:\n   - Corner gaps \u2192 diagonal lines at 45\u00b0\n   - Side gaps (middle of edge) \u2192 perpendicular lines (vertical/horizontal)\n4. When lines from different patterns would cross, they become parallel (usually vertical) to avoid intersection\n\n**Identifying patterns in test input:**\n- Pattern 1 (2s): rows 6-9, cols 22-25 - gaps at corners (6,22), (6,25), (9,25)\n- Pattern 2 (3s): rows 10-13, cols 4-7 - gaps at (10,4), (10,7), (13,5), (13,7)\n- Pattern 3 (4s): rows 10-13, cols 10-13 - gaps at (10,10), (10,13), (13,10), (13,12)\n- Pattern 4 (7s): rows 24-27, cols 23-26 - gaps at (24,26), (26,26), (27,24)\n\n**Line interactions:**\n- Pattern 2 and 3 diagonals meet around row 8-9 at cols 8-9, so they go vertical from there\n- Pattern 1 and 3 diagonals meet around row 3-4 at cols 19-20, so they go vertical from there\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,8,8,2,0,0,0,0\n0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,2,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,8,8,3,0,0,4,8,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,3,8,0,0,8,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,3,8,0,0,8,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,8,3,0,0,4,8,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,7,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,7,7,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,7,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. Each pattern has a 4x4 border (using color 3 or 8) with a 2x2 colored interior\n2. The border has \"gaps\" where the background color appears instead of the border color\n3. Lines extend outward from each gap:\n   - **Corner gaps**: diagonal lines extend outward in the corner direction\n   - **Edge gaps** (non-corner): perpendicular lines extend outward (vertical for top/bottom edges, horizontal for left/right edges)\n4. The gaps themselves are filled with the interior color\n\nFor the test input, I identify 4 patterns:\n- Pattern 1 (2s): rows 6-9, cols 22-25 - corner gaps at top-left, top-right, bottom-right\n- Pattern 2 (3s): rows 10-13, cols 4-7 - corner gaps at top-left, top-right, bottom-right; edge gap at bottom\n- Pattern 3 (4s): rows 10-13, cols 10-13 - corner gaps at top-left, top-right, bottom-left; edge gap at bottom\n- Pattern 4 (7s): rows 24-27, cols 23-26 - corner gap at top-right; edge gaps at right and bottom\n\nDrawing lines from each gap and filling the gaps with interior colors:\n\n```\n4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,2,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0\n3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,8,8,2,0,0,0,0\n0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,2,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,8,8,3,0,0,4,8,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,3,8,0,0,8,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,3,8,0,0,8,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,8,3,0,0,4,8,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7\n0,4,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,7,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,8,7,7,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,8,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,8,7,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,7,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning / reconstruction**\n\nI looked at the solved examples and tried to infer a local transformation rule that operates on the \u201clittle framed blocks\u201d:\n\n- In the examples the important sub\u2011objects are always **2\u00d72 solid blocks of some color `c`** (2,4,6,7,9,1, etc.) that are **immediately surrounded by a \u201cframe\u201d color** (in the examples, that frame is color `3` and the global background is `8`).\n- In the outputs, the framed 2\u00d72 block itself is left unchanged, but **rays of the inner color** shoot out of some corners, passing through background cells only, and stop when they hit non\u2011background or the grid edge.\n\nFrom Examples 2, 3 (7\u2011cluster), and 4, this ray rule is consistent if you interpret it corner\u2011by\u2011corner:\n\n1. Identify each **2\u00d72 block of a color `c`** that is framed by a different color (in the training, 3; in the test, it\u2019s 8) against a uniform background.\n2. Label its corners:\n   - TL = top\u2011left  \n   - TR = top\u2011right  \n   - BL = bottom\u2011left  \n   - BR = bottom\u2011right  \n3. For each corner, look at its **three \u201coutward\u201d neighbors** (relative to the block):\n   - TL: up, left, up\u2011left diagonal\n   - TR: up, right, up\u2011right diagonal\n   - BL: left, down, down\u2011left diagonal\n   - BR: right, down, down\u2011right diagonal\n4. Among those three, pick the **first direction where the neighbor is background**, in this priority order:\n   - First try the primary cardinal for that corner:  \n     TL: up; TR: up; BL: left; BR: right  \n   - If blocked, try the secondary cardinal:  \n     TL: left; TR: right; BL: down; BR: down  \n   - If still blocked, try the diagonal (up\u2011left / up\u2011right / down\u2011left / down\u2011right).\n   - If all three are non\u2011background (frame or other color), that corner does not produce a ray.\n5. When a corner has an open neighbor `b` in some direction vector `v`, start from `b` and **walk in that direction `v`**, one step at a time. At each step:\n   - If the cell is still background, recolor it to `c` and continue.\n   - If the cell is non\u2011background or would go off the grid, stop.\n\nIn the *training* tasks, the mapping is:\n\n- Background: `8`\n- Frame: `3`\n- Inner block colors: {2,4,6,7,9,1,...}\n\nIn the **test** task, the roles are re\u2011used with different numeric values:\n\n- Background is `0` (big sea of zeros).\n- Frame is `8` (the discrete square \u201cboxes\u201d).\n- Inner colors are `2`, `3`, `4`, `7` (each appearing as a 2\u00d72 inside a ring of 8s).\n\nSo I applied the same geometric ray rule with:\n\n- \u201cbackground\u201d = 0\n- \u201cframe\u201d = 8\n- Rays can recolor only 0s; they may not overwrite 8s or any other non\u2011zero color.\n\n---\n\n### Step\u2011by\u2011step on the test grid\n\nFirst I identified all framed 2\u00d72 blocks:\n\n1. **Top\u2011right 2\u2011block** (`c = 2`)\n   - Interior: rows 8\u20139, cols 24\u201325:\n     - (8,24), (8,25), (9,24), (9,25) = 2\n   - Surrounded by 8s at (7,24\u201325), (8,23 & 26), (9,23 & 26), (10,24\u201325).\n   - Corners and outward neighbors:\n     - TL = (8,24):\n       - up (7,24) = 8 (blocked)\n       - left (8,23) = 8 (blocked)\n       - up\u2011left (7,23) = 0 \u2192 ray starts at (7,23), dir = NW (\u22121,\u22121)\n     - TR = (8,25):\n       - up (7,25) = 8 (blocked)\n       - right (8,26) = 8 (blocked)\n       - up\u2011right (7,26) = 0 \u2192 ray from (7,26), dir = NE (\u22121,+1)\n     - BL = (9,24):\n       - left (9,23) = 8 (blocked)\n       - down (10,24) = 8 (blocked)\n       - down\u2011left (10,23) = 0 \u2192 ray from (10,23), dir = SW (+1,\u22121)\n     - BR = (9,25): all three outward neighbors are 8 \u2192 no ray.\n\n   Rays drawn (filling 0s with 2s):\n\n   - NW from (7,23):  \n     (7,23), (6,22), (5,21), (4,20), (3,19), (2,18), (1,17)\n   - NE from (7,26):  \n     (7,26), (6,27), (5,28), (4,29), (3,30)\n   - SW from (10,23):  \n     (10,23),(11,22),(12,21),(13,20),(14,19),(15,18),\n     (16,17),(17,16),(18,15),(19,14),(20,13),(21,12),\n     (22,11),(23,10),(24,9),(25,8),(26,7),(27,6),\n     (28,5),(29,4),(30,3)\n\n2. **Central\u2011left 3\u2011block** (`c = 3`)\n   - Interior: rows 12\u201313, cols 6\u20137 (2\u00d72 of 3s), framed by 8s.\n   - Corners:\n     - TL = (12,6):\n       - up (11,6)=8, left(12,5)=8, up\u2011left(11,5)=0  \n         \u2192 ray from (11,5), dir NW\n     - TR = (12,7):\n       - up (11,7)=8, right(12,8)=8, up\u2011right(11,8)=0  \n         \u2192 ray from (11,8), dir NE\n     - BL = (13,6):\n       - left(13,5)=8, down(14,6)=0 \u2192 ray from (14,6), dir South\n     - BR = (13,7):\n       - right(13,8)=8, down(14,7)=8, down\u2011right(14,8)=0  \n         \u2192 ray from (14,8), dir SE\n\n   Rays for color 3:\n\n   - NW from (11,5): (11,5),(10,4),(9,3),(8,2),(7,1)\n   - NE from (11,8): (11,8),(10,9),(9,10),(8,11),(7,12),\n                     (6,13),(5,14),(4,15),(3,16),(2,17),(1,18)\n   - South from (14,6): (14,6),(15,6),(16,6),(17,6),(18,6),\n                        (19,6),(20,6),(21,6),(22,6),(23,6),\n                        (24,6),(25,6),(26,6),(27,6),(28,6),\n                        (29,6),(30,6)\n   - SE from (14,8): (14,8),(15,9),(16,10),(17,11),(18,12),\n                     (19,13),(20,14),(21,15),(22,16),(23,17),\n                     (24,18),(25,19),(26,20),(27,21),(28,22),\n                     (29,23),(30,24)\n\n3. **Central\u2011right 4\u2011block** (`c = 4`)\n   - Interior: rows 12\u201313, cols 12\u201313, framed by 8s at col 11 & 14.\n   - Corners:\n     - TL = (12,12):\n       - up(11,12)=8,left(12,11)=8, up\u2011left(11,11)=0  \n         \u2192 ray from (11,11), dir NW\n     - TR = (12,13):\n       - up(11,13)=8,right(12,14)=8, up\u2011right(11,14)=0  \n         \u2192 ray from (11,14), dir NE\n     - BL = (13,12):\n       - left(13,11)=8, down(14,12)=8, down\u2011left(14,11)=0  \n         \u2192 ray from (14,11), dir SW\n     - BR = (13,13):\n       - right(13,14)=8, down(14,13)=0 \u2192 ray from (14,13), dir South\n\n   Rays for color 4 (stopping when hitting a non\u20110 that was already drawn by earlier rays):\n\n   - NW from (11,11): (11,11),(10,10),(9,9),(8,8),(7,7),\n                      (6,6),(5,5),(4,4),(3,3),(2,2),(1,1)\n   - NE from (11,14): (11,14),(10,15),(9,16),(8,17),(7,18),\n                      (6,19),(5,20),(4,21),(3,22),(2,23),(1,24)\n   - SW from (14,11): (14,11),(15,10),(16,9),(17,8),(18,7)  \n     (next step (19,6) is already 3 from the 3\u2011block\u2019s south ray, so we stop)\n   - South from (14,13): (14,13),(15,13),(16,13),(17,13),(18,13)  \n     (next step (19,13) is 3 from the 3\u2011block\u2019s SE ray, so we stop)\n\n4. **Bottom\u2011right 7\u2011block** (`c = 7`)\n   - Interior: rows 26\u201327, cols 25\u201326, with surrounding 8s and some gaps.\n   - Corners:\n     - TL = (26,25): up/left/up\u2011left are all 8 \u2192 no ray.\n     - TR = (26,26):\n       - up(25,26)=8, right(26,27)=8, up\u2011right(25,27)=0  \n         \u2192 ray from (25,27), dir NE\n     - BL = (27,25):\n       - left(27,24)=8, down(28,25)=0  \n         \u2192 ray from (28,25), dir South\n     - BR = (27,26):\n       - right(27,27)=0 \u2192 ray from (27,27), dir East\n\n   Rays for color 7:\n\n   - NE from (25,27): (25,27),(24,28),(23,29),(22,30)\n   - South from (28,25): (28,25),(29,25),(30,25)\n   - East from (27,27): (27,27),(27,28),(27,29),(27,30)\n\nAll rays only recolor 0s.

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "Below is the reasoning I used to construct a consistent transformation from the examples, and then apply it to the test grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the training examples are doing\n\nAcross all four solved examples, the common structure is:\n\n- There is a large *background* color (8 in the examples).\n- There is a distinct *frame* color (3 in the examples) that forms \u201cboxes\u201d around some small blocks.\n- Inside each such box there is a small solid 2\u00d72 block of a different color (2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 1, etc.).\n- The output keeps the frames and the inner 2\u00d72 blocks in place, and **adds rays of the inner color out into the background**.\n\nMore precisely, for each such 2\u00d72 block:\n\n1. Consider its 8-neighborhood: all cells touching any of the four inner cells.\n2. Among those neighbors, find the cells that are:\n   - background in the input,\n   - directly adjacent (4- or 8-neighbor) to one of the inner cells,\n   - and *not* the frame color.\n   These are \u201cexits\u201d from the box.\n3. For each such neighbor `q`, look at the inner cell `p` that it\u2019s next to. Define a direction vector  \n   `d = q - p` with components in {\u22121, 0, +1}; this is one of the eight compass directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW).\n4. Starting at `q`, step repeatedly by `d` in that same direction, coloring each background cell you pass with the inner color, **until** you run off the grid or hit any non-background cell (frame cells, other colored blocks, or previously drawn rays). When you hit a non-background cell, you stop just before it.\n\nApplying this rule to:\n\n- Example 2 (inner color 4, frame 3, background 8) gives exactly the vertical, horizontal, and diagonal 4-lines seen.\n- Example 4 (inner color 6, frame 3, background 8) gives the three 6-rays (upward, NE diagonal, SW diagonal) exactly.\n- Example 3 bottom cluster (7 inside a 3-box) gives the leftward 7-line.\n- Example 3 middle 4-cluster: accessible neighbors above and to the left, and one diagonal, produce the long horizontal 4-line and vertical 4-line (the diagonal gets truncated where it would cross into a 3-line).\n- Example 1 behaves similarly but with more colors and more interactions; the 9, 1, 4, and 6 rays obey the same \u201cshoot a ray from each exit until you hit something\u201d rule.\n\nThe only unusual behavior in Example 3 is the extra long diagonal of 2\u2019s, but it can also be understood as coming from an exit where the ray is allowed to run until it hits a non-background cell created by another color; the interactions get complicated, but the local rule above is still consistent.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Adapting this to the test input\n\nIn the test grid:\n\n- Background color is 0 (almost all cells are 0).\n- The color that forms \u201cframes\u201d around small 2\u00d72 blocks is 8 (instead of 3 in training).\n- There are four inner 2\u00d72 blocks:\n  - A 2\u00d72 block of 2s at rows 7\u20138, cols 24\u201325, surrounded on most sides by 8.\n  - A 2\u00d72 block of 3s at rows 11\u201312, cols 5\u20136, inside 8s.\n  - A 2\u00d72 block of 4s at rows 11\u201312, cols 11\u201312, inside 8s.\n  - A 2\u00d72 block of 7s at rows 26\u201327, cols 24\u201325, inside 8s.\n\nSo in the test we treat:\n\n- **Background** = 0  \n- **Frame** = 8  \n- **Inner colors** = 2, 3, 4, 7\n\nWe then apply the same ray-casting rule, one inner block at a time, treating any *non-zero* cell as an obstacle (frame 8s, inner 2\u00d72 blocks, and rays drawn earlier).\n\nI\u2019ll briefly summarize the exits and rays for each inner block.\n\n### 2.1. Inner 2\u00d72 block of 2s (rows 7\u20138, cols 24\u201325)\n\nCells: (7,24), (7,25), (8,24), (8,25) = 2.\n\nNeighbors that are background (0) and adjacent to these 2s:\n\n- Above (7,25): (6,25) is 0 \u2192 direction N.\n- NE of (7,25): (6,26) is 0 \u2192 direction NE.\n- SE of (8,25): (9,26) is 0 \u2192 direction SE.\n\nCasting rays:\n\n- From (6,25) north (d = \u22121,0):  \n  (6,25),(5,25),(4,25),(3,25),(2,25),(1,25),(0,25) become 2 (stop at top border).\n- From (6,26) NE (d = \u22121,+1):  \n  (6,26),(5,27),(4,28),(3,29) become 2.\n- From (9,26) SE (d = +1,+1):  \n  (9,26),(10,27),(11,28),(12,29) become 2.\n\nThese rays do not intersect any non-zero cells, so they run until they hit the border.\n\n### 2.2.

Inner 2\u00d72 block of 4s (rows 11\u201312, cols 11\u201312)\n\nInner 4s at (11,11),(11,12),(12,11),(12,12).\n\nBackground exits:\n\n- Below (12,12): (13,12) is 0 \u2192 direction S.\n- NW of (11,11): (10,10) is 0 \u2192 direction NW.\n- NE of (11,12): (10,13) is 0 \u2192 direction NE.\n- SW of (12,11): (13,10) is 0 \u2192 direction SW.\n\nRays (obeying obstacles such as the 3-rays drawn above):\n\n- From (13,12) south:  \n  (13,12),(14,12),(15,12),(16,12),(17,12) are 0 and become 4; next would be (18,12) which is already 3, so we stop before that.\n- From (10,10) NW:  \n  (10,10),(9,9),(8,8),(7,7),(6,6),(5,5),(4,4),(3,3),(2,2),(1,1),(0,0) are all 0 and become 4.\n- From (10,13) NE:  \n  (10,13),(9,14),(8,15),(7,16),(6,17),(5,18),(4,19),(3,20),(2,21),(1,22),(0,23) all 0 \u2192 4.\n- From (13,10) SW:  \n  (13,10),(14,9),(15,8),(16,7),(17,6) become 4; the next step (18,5) is 3, so we stop.\n\n### 2.4. Inner 2\u00d72 block of 7s (rows 26\u201327, cols 24\u201325)\n\nInner 7s at (26,24),(26,25),(27,24),(27,25).\n\nBackground exits:\n\n- Below (27,24): (28,24) is 0 \u2192 direction S.\n- Right of (27,25): (27,26) is 0 \u2192 direction E.\n\nRays:\n\n- From (28,24) S:  \n  (28,24),(29,24) \u2192 7.\n- From (27,26) E:  \n  (27,26),(27,27),(27,28),(27,29) \u2192 7.\n\nThese do not meet any other non-zero cells.\n\n---\n\n## 3.
