        "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Solution for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task. The user, who I assume is knowledgeable in the field, wants me to solve it based on examples.  I've got three examples and a test input, and I've got to figure out the transformation rule. My mind's working like this:\n\nFirst, let's break down Example 1. It's a 20x20 grid with four colored regions (maroon, orange, yellow, and green) separated by black.  I'm noting the shape and size of each region. It seems pretty straightforward\u2014find the layout, analyze the output. The output grid, a 6x6, seems to be a collage of the input regions. Each quadrant of the output corresponds to a specific region in the input, but there's mixing of colors in the quadrants.\n\nLooking closer, I spot a '5' within the orange region in the input.  This *must* be important. I see an intriguing pattern. The output, a 6x6 grid, appears to contain a collage of 3x3 blocks that are part of the original regions from the 20x20 input.\n\nHere comes the crucial part. I see the input regions' colors aren't placed to the same places in the output. The 7s, which were at top-right, are now at the top left. This suggests, a horizontal swap of the quadrants, and it's something I need to look into. Also, I look closely and see that there is something weird with the colors (the 5 in the output). This seems to be the key to the pattern.\n\nIt is now time to look at Example 2. I note the change in dimensions to 10x10. I see that the output is composed of the input regions \"pushed\" together, preserving the relative topology (TL, TR, BL, BR). I am looking for the reasons for the orientation of each sub-block. Here I see that the color 5 in the output is at a different corner than in the input.\n\nExample 2 is really something, because the transformation appears to be different. The regions have \"holes\", and that may influence something. Here I start to think that each quadrant of the 20x20 canvas is moved by an independent transformation.\n\nExample 3 comes into view. The output is a 4x4, and I start wondering, what's behind the difference in output size? The output is basically the input regions moved and combined into a small 4x4 canvas, but here I see that the output size is likely defined by the inputs, and the \"holes\" in each input can define the position of the output pixels. This is starting to look good. I start to wonder if each region may have a local transformation.\n\nLet me revisit my observations from the examples so far. The key: Each example has different transformations. Some regions have a local transformation (Horizontal flips, Vertical flips) to align the regions. But the position of each of the input quadrants in the output seems to be determined by a global movement. It is starting to feel that I need to look at what's the key \"marker\" of the transformation: The input color 5.\n\nHere comes a new idea:  I'm wondering if a \"Flip to Center\" rule applies. This seems like a promising direction to explore!\n\nBack to a key insight I had earlier. I realize each region is transformed, and there is a \"Global Swap\", but is is key to the 5 which defines how we rotate.\n\nNow I am going to try the test input to validate this theory and work out the transformation rule for the other regions. Here I am going to build it:\n\n1.  *Identify the regions* within the test input grid: top-left (2s), top-right (3s), bottom-left (7s), and bottom-right (8s). There are \"holes\" (zeros) in the 2s and 3s regions.\n2.  *Determine the basic layout:* A global vertical swap happens (a V-swap) due to the presence of the 5 inside the 7s region.\n3.  *Figure out the rotation or alignment.* The presence of a 5 inside the region means a rotation to align.\n\nHere's my refined logic: The transformation depends on whether a region is marked by a distinctive pixel like \"5\" or contains \"holes\" (zeros). This \"marker\" pixel is located in the bottom-right corner of the bottom-left (BL) 7s region. I infer that the overall transformation is a combination of horizontal and vertical flips. Also, the regions are transformed in a way that preserves their initial form while taking their local features into account. Now I am going to construct the\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation follows these rules:\n1.  **Identify the \"Marker\" Region:** In the input grid, one of the four colored regions contains a unique pixel (the \"marker\") that is different from the region's primary color (e.g., a '5' inside a region of '7's).\n2.  **Move Marker to Top-Left:** The entire set of regions is rearranged (swapped/moved) such that the quadrant containing the marker moves to the **Top-Left** in the output.\n    *   In the Test Input, the marker '5' is in the **Bottom-Left** region (7s). This implies a **Global Vertical Swap**, moving the Bottom regions to the Top and the Top regions to the Bottom.\n3.  **Orient the Marker:** The Marker Region is transformed (rotated or flipped) specifically to place the marker pixel at the **Top-Left (0,0)** coordinate of the output.\n    *   In the Test Input, the marker '5' is at the bottom-right of the '7' region. To move it to the top-left, the region must be **Rotated 180 degrees** (or flipped both vertically and horizontally).\n4.  **Transform Partner Region:** The region that shares the source row with the marker (the \"Partner\") undergoes the **same transformation** as the marker region.\n    *   In the Test Input, the Partner is the **Bottom-Right** region (8s). It will also be **Rotated 180 degrees** and placed in the **Top-Right**.\n5.  **Place Other Regions:** The regions from the other row (the non-marker row) are moved to the remaining spots (following the global swap) and appear to keep their original orientation (Identity transformation), or at least do not follow the marker's rotation if it contradicts fitting into the corner. Based on Example 1 (where the non-marker row was unchanged) and Example 3 (where the non-marker row regions mostly kept their structure relative to the corner, with one flip likely for fitting), we apply **Identity** to the regions moving from Top to Bottom.\n    *   **Top-Left** (2s) moves to **Bottom-Left**. (Identity).\n    *   **Top-Right** (3s) moves to **Bottom-Right**. (Identity).\n\n**Construction:**\n*   **Output Top-Left:** Derived from Input Bottom-Left (7s). Rotated 180\u00b0.\n*   **Output Top-Right:** Derived from Input Bottom-Right (8s). Rotated 180\u00b0.\n*   **Output Bottom-Left:** Derived from Input Top-Left (2s). Identity.\n*   **Output Bottom-Right:** Derived from Input Top-Right (3s). Identity.\n\n**Output Grid Details:**\n*   Size: 17 rows x 15 columns.\n*   **TL (0,0):** `5,7,7,7,7,7,7...` (Rotated 7s).\n*   **TR (0,8):** `0,0,0,0,0,0,8...` (Rotated 8s).\n*   **BL (10,0):** `0,2,2,2,0,2,2,2...` (Identity 2s).\n*   **BR (10,8):** `3,3,3,3,3,3,3...` (Identity 3s).\n\noutput:\n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,2,2,2,0,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,0,3,3,3\n0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,0,3,3,3\n0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,0,3,3,3",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**My thought process starts with analyzing the user's task to solve an ARC problem based on examples.** I examine the first example, noting the input's grid structure with its regions differentiated by color and the output's smaller grid size. I hypothesize that the output is a composite of the input regions, possibly scaled or cropped, or even a stitching of the parts. I try to understand the relationship between the colors and positions.\n\nI try to analyze Example 1 region by region, paying close attention to pixel positions and how they map to the output. I start by calculating the bounding boxes to understand the relationship of positions.  However, this doesn't directly map to the output dimensions or positions. I consider the output and its colors, comparing regions to the output structure. I get confused with overlapping and non-aligned elements in the output. I go back, re-reading the provided input, carefully noting the exact positions of each region. I create the internal structure of each region, but I still have no idea how it transforms to the output structure.\n\nMy intuition says it may be a rotation or a flip. I look at specific regions to try to find hints. I hypothesize that horizontal flipping might play a role in the arrangement. But I get stuck and confused with pixel positioning. I examine the output quadrants to understand their relationship. I consider rotations and translations and finally, I check the positions and colors of the output. I realize that the output quadrants are rearranged. This points me toward how the input is transformed.  This is when I discover that Example 1 and Example 2 may be distinct.\n\nExample 2 reinforces the idea that some sort of re-arrangement occurs. I consider that maybe the top two regions or a set of columns were swapping locations. I review the inputs again. I examine example 3 and discover some horizontal or row swapping happened. I discover the rows swapped and the columns flipped and it doesn't make total sense. \n\nI start to formulate a hypothesis. I decide I need a rule, a \"5-finder\". I discover that the presence of the pixel 5 might drive some reordering. I start looking at whether some shifts or transformations happen, and how that maps to the output.  Then I try again to figure out the output given all the transformations. I test the hypothesis with the examples.\n\nI focus on the special '5' value to find a pattern. I hypothesize a cyclic shift based on the '5' position. I test cyclic shifting with Example 1 and try to fit. I realize only a single row, or the row containing '5', is being modified. I refine the idea: move '5' to the Top-Left of the output. I formulate steps. I realize I have to separate the steps: row swaps, col swaps, and content. The rule becomes clearer: \"Find 5, move to top, flip if necessary\". This takes me towards the algorithm. I get a general idea, and then try to make sure I understand each operation.  I create a better set of steps. I try to combine my logic.\n\nI think the output size is critical to the output construction. I think the position is created using this bounding box of regions. I go back to understand what those rules might be. The '5' does not always go to the TL, but must go to the first spot in its row. I get closer to the final algorithm.\n\nAfter analyzing examples, I decide I need to look at specific input. I am starting to formalize:  flip rows? flip columns? rotate the contents within the region? I test each example and the rule against this logic. Then I test the output against the transformation to be very confident. I write the final list of steps.\n\nI re-examine the third test case, noting the final steps of building the outputs. I need to be careful with the orientation of the regions. The logic is complex, and the details and positions are critical.\n\nI finish this thought process with a firm set of algorithmic steps for output construction.  These are ready for programming. I have the output generation, which is a key part of the algorithm.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid containing four colored regions based on patterns observed in the examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Grid Identification:** The input always contains four distinct colored regions arranged in a 2x2 quadrant layout (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right).\n2.  **Special Marker:** In each example, exactly one region contains a unique \"marker\" pixel (a color different from the main region color, specifically '5').\n    *   Example 1: Marker '5' is in the Top-Right (TR) region.\n    *   Example 2: Marker '5' is in the Top-Left (TL) region.\n    *   Example 3: Marker '5' is in the Bottom-Left (BL) region.\n3.  **Transformation Rule:** The goal is to rearrange the regions so that the region containing the marker '5' ends up in the **Top-Left** of the output grid.\n    *   **Row Swap:** If the marker is in the Bottom row (BL or BR), the Top and Bottom rows of regions are swapped.\n    *   **Column/Flip Logic:**\n        *   If the row containing the marker (now at the top) needs to be adjusted to put the marker on the Left side (e.g., if it was in TR, or if it was in TL but on the right side of that region), the regions in that row are **Flipped Horizontally**.\n        *   Specifically, if the marker is on the right side of the logical pair, the pair is swapped and flipped.\n    *   **Bottom Row Treatment:**\n        *   If a row swap occurred (i.e., the original Top row moved to the Bottom), the regions in this new Bottom row undergo a **180-degree Rotation** (which is equivalent to swapping the positions of the two regions and rotating each region 180 degrees, or flipping the whole row horizontally and vertically).\n        *   If no row swap occurred (the original Bottom row stays at the bottom), it remains unchanged.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n1.  **Identify Regions:**\n    *   **TL:** Region 2 (Cyan), 7x7 block.\n    *   **TR:** Region 3 (Green), 7x7 block.\n    *   **BL:** Region 7 (Orange), 7x7 block. Contains the marker **'5'** at its bottom-right (local coords 6,6).\n    *   **BR:** Region 8 (Azure), 8x9 shape (mostly 8x8 with a tail).\n2.  **Identify Marker Location:** The marker '5' is in the **Bottom-Left** region.\n3.  **Step 1: Row Swap:** Since the marker is in the bottom row, we swap the rows.\n    *   New Top Row: [Region 7, Region 8]\n    *   New Bottom Row: [Region 3, Region 2] (Moved from Top).\n    *   *Note:* The row moving to the bottom (Regions 2 and 3) must be transformed (Rotated 180 degrees).\n4.  **Step 2: Top Row Adjustment:**\n    *   The marker '5' is in Region 7 (now New TL).\n    *   However, within Region 7, the marker is on the **Right** side (col 6). To satisfy the pattern of moving the marker to the \"start\" (Left), we must **Flip Horizontally** the regions in this row.\n    *   **Region 7 (New TL):** Flip Horizontal. '5' moves from bottom-right to bottom-left.\n    *   **Region 8 (New TR):** Flip Horizontal.\n5.  **Step 3: Bottom Row Adjustment:**\n    *   The row containing Region 2 and 3 moved from Top to Bottom.\n    *   Apply **180 Degree Rotation** to the regions and swap their positions (which happens naturally with a 180 rotation of the whole row's bounding box).\n    *   Original Top Row: [Region 2, Region 3].\n    *   Rotated/Swapped: [Rotate180(Region 3), Rotate180(Region 2)].\n    *   **New BL:** Rotate180(Region 3).\n    *   **New BR:** Rotate180(Region 2).\n\n**Construction of Output Grid:**\n*   **Grid 7 (TL):** 7x7. Flipped Horizontal.\n    *   '5' is now at (6,0).\n*   **Grid 8 (TR):** 8x9. Flipped Horizontal.\n*   **Grid 3 (BL):** 7x7. Rotated 180.\n*   **Grid 2 (BR):** 7x7. Rotated 180.\n\n**Layout:**\n*   The top row has height 9 (max of 7 and 9). Width 15 (7 + 8).\n*   The bottom row has height 7. Width 14 (7 + 7).\n*   Total Size: 15 wide x 16 high.\n*   **TL (0,0):** Grid 7.\n*   **TR (0,7):** Grid 8.\n*   **BL (9,0):** Grid 3.\n*   **BR (9,7):** Grid 2. (Left-aligned within the right column).\n\n**Detailed Grid Content:**\n*   **Grid 7 (Flip H):** '5' is at bottom-left. Row 3 has 0s at the end.\n*   **Grid 8 (Flip H):** Top row `0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8`. Tail at bottom is `0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0`.\n*   **Grid 3 (Rot 180):** Middle row `3 3 3 0 3 3 3`.\n*   **Grid 2 (Rot 180):** Row 3 `2 2 2 2 0 0 0`.\n\n**Final Output:**\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n3,3,3,0,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,0,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,0,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,0,2,2,2\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n3,3,3,0,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,0,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,0,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,0,2,2,2",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand the transformation from the examples:\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n1. There are 4 colored shapes in each input, with one shape containing a \"5\" marker\n2. The transformation combines all 4 shapes into a 2x2 arrangement\n3. The shape with \"5\" is positioned so that \"5\" ends up at the top-left corner of the output\n4. The position of \"5\" within its shape determines the rotation/flip needed\n5. The entire layout and all shapes are transformed consistently\n6. Where shapes overlap, holes (0s) in one shape are filled by the other shape\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n- 2s: top-left region (rows 0-6, cols 1-7)\n- 3s: top-right region (rows 1-7, cols 9-18)  \n- 7s: bottom-left region (rows 8-17, cols 0-6) - contains 5 at position (17,6) (bottom-right of shape)\n- 8s: bottom-right region (rows 11-19, cols 9-16)\n\n**Transformation:**\nSince 5 is at the bottom-right of the 7s shape, I need to rotate everything 180\u00b0 to place 5 at the top-left of the output.\n\nAfter 180\u00b0 rotation, the layout becomes:\n- 7s \u2192 Top-Left (with 5 at corner)\n- 8s \u2192 Top-Right  \n- 3s \u2192 Bottom-Left\n- 2s \u2192 Bottom-Right\n\nEach shape is also rotated 180\u00b0, and they overlap where holes in one shape are filled by adjacent shapes.\n\n**Output Construction:**\nThe shapes interlock with their hole patterns:\n- 7s has holes at certain positions that get filled by 8s, 3s\n- 8s has holes filled by 7s, 2s\n- 3s has a hole at col 3 filled by 7s\n- 2s has holes filled by 3s, 8s\n\n```\n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,7,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,7,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,7,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,8,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Below is how I reasoned about the transformation, followed by the final output grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Identify the \u201cobjects\u201d\n\nFrom each training input, there are four main non\u2011zero connected components (\u201cobjects\u201d).  \n\nColor 5 is always a single pixel that is *part of* one of those components (a marker cell, not its own object).\n\nFor the test input the non\u2011zero regions are:\n\n- A large region of 2\u2019s in the upper\u2011left.\n- A large region of 3\u2019s in the upper\u2011right.\n- A large region of 7\u2019s in the lower\u2011left, with a single 5 embedded in it (so this is the \u201c5\u2011cluster\u201d).\n- A large region of 8\u2019s in the lower\u2011right.\n\nSo the four objects are:\n\n- Object A: 2\u2011cluster (upper\u2011left)\n- Object B: 3\u2011cluster (upper\u2011right)\n- Object C: 7+5\u2011cluster (lower\u2011left, includes the 5)\n- Object D: 8\u2011cluster (lower\u2011right)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Determine the block size \\( B \\)\n\nFrom the examples, the output is always a 2\u00d72 tiling of 4 square blocks, each of size \\( B \\times B \\), where\n\n> \\( B = \\min\\big(\\min(\\text{height},\\text{width}) \\text{ over all four objects} \\big) \\)\n\nChecking that rule on the training examples gives:\n- Example 1: \\( B = 3 \\), output size \\( 6 \\times 6 \\)\n- Example 2: \\( B = 5 \\), output size \\( 10 \\times 10 \\)\n- Example 3: \\( B = 2 \\), output size \\( 4 \\times 4 \\)\n\nFor the test input:\n\n- Object 2 (A): rows 0\u20136, cols 1\u20137 \u2192 height 7, width 7 \u2192 min dim 7\n- Object 3 (B): rows 1\u20137, cols 9\u201318 \u2192 height 7, width 10 \u2192 min dim 7\n- Object 7+5 (C): rows 8\u201317, cols 0\u20136 \u2192 height 10, width 7 \u2192 min dim 7\n- Object 8 (D): rows 11\u201319, cols 9\u201315 \u2192 height 9, width 7 \u2192 min dim 7\n\nSo:\n- \\( B = 7 \\)\n- Output grid size = \\( 2B \\times 2B = 14 \\times 14 \\)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Place the four objects into quadrants\n\nIn the training examples, the four objects are conceptually arranged as quadrants ([TL, TR; BL, BR]) based on their positions (upper\u2011left, upper\u2011right, etc.). Then they are *permuted* so that:\n\n> the object that contains color 5 becomes the **top\u2011left** quadrant in the output.\n\nThe permutation pattern depends on where the 5\u2011object started:\n\n- Example 2: 5\u2011object already in TL \u2192 arrangement unchanged:  \n  `[A,B;C,D] \u2192 [A,B;C,D]`\n- Example 1: 5\u2011object originally in TR \u2192 TL and TR swapped:  \n  `[A,B;C,D] \u2192 [B,A;C,D]`\n- Example 3: 5\u2011object originally in BL \u2192 observed mapping:  \n  `[A,B;C,D] \u2192 [C,D;B,A]`\n\nIn our test case, the 5\u2011object is in the **BL** of the original layout:\n\nOriginal spatial quadrants of objects:\n\n- TL: A (2)\n- TR: B (3)\n- BL: C (7+5)\n- BR: D (8)\n\nSo this matches the Example\u20113 situation: 5\u2011object in BL.\n\nWe therefore apply the same permutation pattern:\n\n\\[\n[A,B;C,D] \\to [C,D;B,A]\n\\]\n\nSo the output quadrants (in terms of dominant color) will be:\n\n- TL: C \u2192 7\u2011cluster (with the single 5)\n- TR: D \u2192 8\u2011cluster\n- BL: B \u2192 3\u2011cluster\n- BR: A \u2192 2\u2011cluster\n\nEach of these is a \\(7 \\times 7\\) block.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Fill the \\(7 \\times 7\\) blocks (pattern from the \u201c5\u2011in\u2011BL\u201d case)\n\nFrom Example 3 (the only training case where the 5\u2011object started in BL), with \\( B = 2 \\), we can extract the *shape* of each quadrant\u2019s block in terms of **which object\u2019s color is used where**:\n\nFor that case (Example 3), after the permutation the quadrants were:\n\n- TL: 5+7 object (I\u2081)\n- TR: 8 object      (I\u2082)\n- BL: 6 object      (I\u2083)\n- BR: 2 object      (I\u2084)\n\nAnd their \\(2 \\times 2\\) patches (expressed as \u201cobject IDs\u201d rather than specific colors) were:\n\n- TL patch I\u2081:\n  ```\n  I\u2081 I\u2081\n  I\u2081 I\u2082\n  ```\n- TR patch I\u2082:\n  ```\n  I\u2081 I\u2082\n  I\u2082 I\u2082\n  ```\n- BL patch I\u2083:\n  ```\n  I\u2083 I\u2083\n  I\u2083 I\u2083\n  ```\n- BR patch I\u2084:\n  ```\n  I\u2082 I\u2084\n  I\u2084 I\u2084\n  ```\n\nInterpreting this pattern for the \u201c5\u2011object in BL\u201d situation:\n\n- The **BL block (I\u2083)** is completely uniform: just its own object\u2019s color.\n- The **TL block (I\u2081)**:\n  - Is filled with its own color.\n  - Has its **bottom\u2011right** cell overwritten by the TR object\u2019s color.\n  - Has its **top\u2011left** cell overwritten by the literal color 5 (the special marker), instead of the base color of that object.\n- The **TR block (I\u2082)**:\n  - Is filled with its own color.\n  - Has its **top\u2011left** cell overwritten by the TL object\u2019s color (but *not* 5, the base cluster color).\n- The **BR block (I\u2084)**:\n  - Is filled with its own color.\n  - Has its **top\u2011left** cell overwritten by the TR object\u2019s color.\n\nThis gives a **generic rule** for the \u201c5\u2011object in BL\u201d case, for any block size \\( B \\ge 2 \\):\n\n- TL block (size \\(B \\times B\\)):\n  - Fill with TL object\u2019s base color.\n  - Set cell \\((0,0)\\) to color 5.\n  - Set cell \\((B-1,B-1)\\) to the TR object\u2019s base color.\n- TR block:\n  - Fill with TR object\u2019s base color.\n  - Set cell \\((0,0)\\) (top\u2011left of the TR block) to the TL object\u2019s base color.\n- BL block:\n  - Fill uniformly with BL object\u2019s base color.\n- BR block:\n  - Fill with BR object\u2019s base color.\n  - Set cell \\((0,0)\\) (top\u2011left of the BR block) to the TR object\u2019s base color.\n\nWe now apply this to the test, with:\n\n- TL object base color: 7\n- TR object base color: 8\n- BL object base color: 3\n- BR object base color: 2\n- \\(B = 7\\)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Construct the 14\u00d714 output grid\n\nIndexing rows and columns from 0:\n\n1. Start with a 14\u00d714 grid of zeros.\n2. Fill quadrants with their base colors:\n\n   - TL (rows 0\u20136, cols 0\u20136): 7\n   - TR (rows 0\u20136, cols 7\u201313): 8\n   - BL (rows 7\u201313, cols 0\u20136): 3\n   - BR (rows 7\u201313, cols 7\u201313): 2\n\n3. Apply the special 5 and the \u201cinfiltration\u201d rules for the \u201c5\u2011in\u2011BL\u201d case:\n\n   - Put 5 at the global top\u2011left: TL block (0,0) = 5.\n   - TL bottom\u2011right: (B\u20111,B\u20111) = (6,6) set to TR\u2019s base color (8).\n   - TR top\u2011left: global (0,7) set to TL\u2019s base color (7).\n   - BR top\u2011left: global (7,7) set to TR\u2019s base color (8).\n\nThe resulting 14\u00d714 grid is:\n\nRow 0:  \n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 1:  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 2:  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 3:  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 4:  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 5:  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 6:  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 7:  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,2,2,2,2,2,2\n\nRow 8:  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n\nRow 9:  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n\nRow 10:  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n\nRow 11:  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n\nRow 12:  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n\nRow 13:  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\nHere is the completed output grid in CSV row form:\n\n```\n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n```",

Where one shape has 0, other shapes fill in.\n\nAfter applying transformations and combining:\n- 7-shape rotated places 5 at (0,0) with 7s filling the top-left\n- 8-shape fills the top-right region\n- 3-shape and 2-shape fill the bottom half\n- Shapes overlap at rows 7-9 where 7/8 meet 3/2\n\n```\n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,7,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,7,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,7,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n```",

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "Below is the line of reasoning I followed and the resulting grid.  \nNote that with only three training examples, the exact transformation rule is quite ambiguous. There are strong signs that the intended rule is:\n\n- Identify connected components of non\u2011zero cells (components may include multiple colors, e.g. {5,7}).\n- The total number of colored cells \\(N\\) is always a perfect square, so the output is an \\(n \\times n\\) square with \\(n=\\sqrt{N}\\).\n- All zeros are removed: the square is completely filled with colors.\n- The five colors always include a single cell of color 5, which is placed at the top\u2011left of the output.\n- There is a single multicolor component containing 5 and 7; that component is always placed in the top\u2011left \u201cquadrant\u201d of the square, and the remaining three single\u2011color components are arranged roughly as quadrants.\n\nHowever, working out the exact packing/orientation of each polyomino component so that you can replicate the *precise* 14\u00d714 arrangement for the test from only three examples is under\u2011determined; many different packings are consistent with those constraints.\n\nSo I used the following *approximate* rule that matches the coarse structure of the examples:\n\n1. Count all non\u2011zero cells; here:\n   - color 2: 45\n   - color 3: 49\n   - color 7: 49\n   - color 8: 52\n   - color 5: 1  \n   Total \\(N = 45+49+49+52+1 = 196 = 14^2\\), so the output is 14\u00d714.\n\n2. Divide the 14\u00d714 square conceptually into four 7\u00d77 quadrants.\n\n3. Place colors by quadrant, following the pattern suggested by the examples:\n   - Top\u2011left quadrant: primarily 7, with the single 5 at (1,1).\n   - Top\u2011right quadrant: primarily the largest \u201cother\u201d color, here 8.\n   - Bottom\u2011left quadrant: the medium color, here 3.\n   - Bottom\u2011right quadrant: the smallest color, here 2.\n\n4. Adjust within quadrants so that the exact color counts match:\n   - Quadrants are 7\u00d77=49 cells each.\n   - Put 5 at (1,1) and the remaining 48 cells of the top\u2011left quadrant as 7, but we need 49 cells of 7 total, so we add one extra 7 at the start of the top\u2011right quadrant.\n   - The 3\u2019s match perfectly: fill the entire bottom\u2011left 7\u00d77 with 3.\n   - For 8\u2019s: start with the 49 cells of the top\u2011right; after changing one of those to 7 we have 48 eights. We still need 4 more eights, so convert four 2\u2019s in the bottom\u2011right quadrant into 8\u2019s.\n   - That leaves exactly 45 remaining 2\u2019s in the bottom\u2011right quadrant.\n\nConcretely, that yields this 14\u00d714 output:\n\nRow 1: top\u2011left has 5 then six 7\u2019s; top\u2011right has a 7 then six 8\u2019s.  \nRows 2\u20137: 7\u2019s on the left, 8\u2019s on the right.  \nRows 8\u20139: 3\u2019s on the left; on the right, a 2\u2011block with a small 2\u00d72 block of 8\u2019s in its top\u2011left corner.  \nRows 10\u201314: 3\u2019s on the left, 2\u2019s on the right.\n\nThis satisfies the color counts exactly and preserves the \u201c7 at upper\u2011left, others by descending importance into other quadrants\u201d pattern suggested by the examples.\n\n---\n\n### Final output grid (14\u00d714)\n\nRow by row, comma\u2011separated:\n\n1. `5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \n2. `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \n3. `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \n4. `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \n5. `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \n6. `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \n7. `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \n8. `3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2`  \n9. `3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2`  \n10. `3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2`  \n11. `3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2`  \n12. `3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2`  \n13. `3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2`  \n14. `3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2`",

        "Full raw LLM response": "To solve the task I first identified the non\u2011zero connected components. Colour\u202f5 is a special marker and belongs to whichever component contains it; the four \u201creal\u201d components are the remaining colours.\n\nFor each of these four components I computed its bounding\u2011box height and width and took `maxdim = max(height,width)`. Let `S` be the minimum of these four `maxdim` values. In all given examples the outputs are of size `2S\u00d72S`.\n\nThe component containing the 5\u2011marker is anchored in the top\u2011left block. The component whose centroid row is closest to that anchor goes in the top\u2011right block. Of the two remaining components, the one with the smaller row difference goes in the bottom\u2011left, the other in the bottom\u2011right.\n\nThe output is initialised as four solid `S\u00d7S` quadrants filled with those four colours, and `output[0][0]` is set to 5.\n\nSmall \u201cspill\u201d adjustments are then made when component dimensions exceed `S`:\n- If the top\u2011right component\u2019s width is greater than `S`, set the middle row of the top band, last column of the TL block to the top\u2011right colour.\n- If the top\u2011right component\u2019s height is greater than `S`, set the top\u2011left cell of the BR block to the top\u2011right colour.\n- If the bottom\u2011left component\u2019s height is greater than `S`, set the last row of the top band, centre column of the TL block to the bottom\u2011left colour.\n- If the bottom\u2011right component\u2019s height is greater than `S`, set the last row of the top band, centre column of the TR block to the bottom\u2011right colour.\n- If the bottom\u2011left component\u2019s width is greater than `S`, set the first two columns of the BR block in the middle row of the bottom band to the bottom\u2011left colour.\n- If the anchor component\u2019s width is greater than `S`, set the top row, first column of the TR block to the anchor colour.\n\nFor the test input the four colours (excluding 5) are 7 (anchor), 8 (closest in row), 3 and 2. Their max dimensions give `S=7`, so the output is `14\u00d714`. Component sizes trigger spills for the top\u2011right (width and height) and bottom\u2011left (width) only. Applying the rules yields:\n\n```\n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n```",

Here it is at row\u202f17, column\u202f6.\n* Order the input rows starting from the anchor row and moving outward, taking one row above, then one row below, then two above, two below, and so on.
