The user's given me a few solved examples and a test input, and it's my job to figure out the underlying pattern and generate the right output.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Example Inputs:** First, I'm carefully examining the solved examples. My initial step is to determine input and output grid dimensions and to spot any obvious patterns in the pixel data. I'm looking for rectangular structures, repeated patterns, or any color relationships. My strategy is to map the original data with the output. In many of the example, there is a distinct boundary.\n\n2.  **Look for the ROI (Region of Interest)**: Within the input grid, I'm identifying the \"important\" area. This could be a solid block of color, a repeated shape, or any area distinct from the background noise. I'm starting by identifying the border color, which is a major factor of creating a clean region of data.\n\n3.  **Rotation Logic and other transformations:** A key realization is that the input ROI is being rotated to generate the output. I'm trying to determine the rotation angle and direction. It seems like the core operation is a **90 degree counter-clockwise rotation**. This means the output is the Input ROI, which has been rotated. After mapping the data, I can construct the final output.\n\n4.  **Transformation Steps:**\n    *   Find the ROI in the input.\n    *   Rotate the ROI 90 degrees CCW (Counter-Clockwise).\n    *   The Output Grid is the Result.\n\n5.  **Output Generation:** To generate the output, I am extracting the ROI, rotating it, and constructing the output grid.\n    *   I'm extracting the correct set of rows and columns.\n    *   From the original, I can create the proper output.\n\nThis process seems accurate because the examples are consistent. Now I will apply this to the test input.\n\n\nThe transformation rule is to identify the structured rectangular region (Region of Interest - ROI) within the noisy input grid and rotate it 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n\n1.  **Identify ROI**: In the test input, the ROI is bounded by a rectangle of non-noise pixels embedded in the background noise. Looking at the grid, there is a clear rectangular structure defined by borders of color `4`.\n    -   **Top Row**: Row 4 (0-indexed).\n    -   **Bottom Row**: Row 15.\n    -   **Left Column**: Column 4.\n    -   **Right Column**: Column 23.\n    -   **ROI Dimensions**: Height = 12 rows (4 to 15), Width = 20 columns (4 to 23).\n\n2.  **Extract ROI**: We extract the pixel values from this 12x20 subgrid.\n\n3.  **Transform**: We rotate the extracted 12x20 grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n    -   The new grid will have dimensions 20x12 (Height x Width).\n    -   The transformation maps `Input(row, col)` to `Output(19 - col, row)` relative to the ROI indices (where `row` is 0..11 and `col` is 0..19).\n    -   Essentially, the last column of the ROI becomes the first row of the output, the second to last column becomes the second row, and so on.\n\n**Construction of Output Rows:**\n\n*   **Row 0** (from ROI Col 19): `4,4,0,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4`\n*   **Row 1** (from ROI Col 18): `0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4`\n*   **Row 2** (from ROI Col 17): `0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,9,9,4`\n*   **Row 3** (from ROI Col 16): `0,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,4,4,4`\n*   **Row 4** (from ROI Col 15): `4,6,6,6,6,6,4,7,4,9,9,4`\n*   **Row 5** (from ROI Col 14): `4,6,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,4,4,4`\n*   **Row 6** (from ROI Col 13): `4,6,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,9,9,4`\n*   **Row 7** (from ROI Col 12): `4,6,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,4,4,4`\n*   **Row 8** (from ROI Col 11): `6,4,6,6,4,4,4,7,4,9,9,4`\n*   **Row 9** (from ROI Col 10): `4,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4`\n*   **Row 10** (from ROI Col 9): `6,4,6,6,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4`\n*   **Row 11** (from ROI Col 8): `4,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4`\n*   **Row 12** (from ROI Col 7): `4,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4`\n*   **Row 13** (from ROI Col 6): `0,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4`\n*   **Row 14** (from ROI Col 5): `0,0,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4`\n*   **Row 15** (from ROI Col 4): `0,0,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,4,4,4`\n*   **Row 16** (from ROI Col 3): `0,0,4,4,6,6,4,7,4,9,9,4`\n*   **Row 17** (from ROI Col 2): `0,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,8,8,4`\n*   **Row 18** (from ROI Col 1): `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,8,8,4`\n*   **Row 19** (from ROI Col 0): `4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4`\n\noutput:\n4,4,0,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4\n0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,9,9,4\n0,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n4,6,6,6,6,6,4,7,4,9,9,4\n4,6,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,4,4,4\n4,6,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n4,6,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n6,4,6,6,4,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n4,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n6,4,6,6,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n4,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n0,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n0,0,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n0,0,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,4,4,4\n0,0,4,4,6,6,4,7,4,9,9,4\n0,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,8,8,4\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,8,8,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 0>\n<CANDIDATE 1>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 20x12\n440044044444\n044444444444\n077777774994\n044444474444\n466666474994\n464446474444\n464444474994\n464444474444\n446444474994\n444444474444\n666664474994\n464464474444\n444464474994\n044466474444\n044446474994\n004464474444\n004466474994\n044444474884\n777777774884\n444444444444\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_2_step_1\">\n**The Plan: ARC Task - Rotation Extraction**\n\nAlright, I'm tackling this ARC problem. It's about taking these input grids and transforming them. I've got three examples and a test case to crack this. My initial thought is to look for a pattern, specifically a sub-grid or some core visual element that gets twisted around.\n\n**The Approach:**\n\nI'm zeroing in on distinct regions within the input grids, ignoring any 'border' or noise colors, I'm focusing on the 'meat' of the picture. By comparing the 'inner' pixel blocks in each example to their corresponding output, I'll figure out what's happening.\n\n**Observations & Insights:**\n\nI see that the input grids often have colored borders or 'frames' (like 4s at the top, 6s on the side, etc.). Inside, there's a rectangular block of pixels with different colors. It is the subgrid, this is what is extracted.\n\nIn Example 1, I noticed the output grid is like a smaller, rotated version of the central part of the input. I also look at their size. The outputs don't directly correspond to parts of the inputs, but have a relationship.\n\nAfter a lot of trial-and-error, I'm pretty sure the subgrid from the input image gets rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise (CCW) to form the output. So, I extract the inner grid, rotate it, and there's my answer!\n\n**Confirming the Pattern**\n\nI've tested this on a few examples, and the rotated version fits exactly. In one example, the subgrid contains 2s, 4s, and 8s, in another case there is 1,2,3, and 8s. In these cases, it also rotated the block to build the output.\n\n**Translating to Test Input:**\n\nNow, for the test input. First, I have to figure out the subgrid's dimensions (how many rows and columns). Then I extract it and I can simulate rotation, column by column. Based on what I have seen the rotation is 90 degrees counter-clockwise. With this in mind I will read the columns, reverse the order and build the output. So, it should be simple extract and rotate to get the expected output for any given test input.\n\nI'm confident I got this.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to identify a transformation based on three examples and apply it to a test input.\n\n**Analysis of Solved Examples:**\n\n1.  **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** A large grid with a \"noisy\" frame (rows of 4s, cols of 6s, 5s). Inside, there is a distinct rectangular region of non-background colors (1s, 2s, 3s, 8s, etc.). The bounding box of this inner region is roughly 15 rows high and 11 columns wide.\n    *   **Output:** An 11x15 grid.\n    *   **Transformation:** The output dimensions (11x15) are swapped compared to the input region (15x11). Comparing the content, the input's top-left corner maps to the output's bottom-left corner, and the input's top-right corner maps to the output's top-left corner. This corresponds to a **90-degree Counter-Clockwise rotation** of the inner rectangular region.\n\n2.  **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** A grid with a frame containing a block of 2s, 4s, etc. The inner block is 10x10.\n    *   **Output:** A 10x10 grid.\n    *   **Transformation:** The content of the input block (e.g., vertical stripes of 2s) becomes horizontal stripes in the output. Careful tracing of pixels confirms a **90-degree Counter-Clockwise rotation**.\n\n3.  **Example 3:**\n    *   **Input:** A grid with a 5x5 block of 8s, 9s, etc.\n    *   **Output:** A 5x5 grid.\n    *   **Transformation:** The input pattern is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. For instance, the top row of the input block (`8,8,8,8,8`) becomes the left column of the output block. Wait, in 90 CCW, the top row becomes the *left column*. Let's re-verify. Input top row `8,8,8,8,8` -> Output col 1 `8,8,8,8,8`. This is consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The transformation rule is to **extract the inner rectangular object/pattern bounded by the noise/frame and rotate it 90 degrees Counter-Clockwise**.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Inner Object:**\n    *   Looking at the test input, there is a frame of 2s (top), 5s (left), 3s (right).\n    *   Inside, starting at Row 4 and Column 4, there is a distinct block of data.\n    *   **Top Row:** Row 4 (`4,7,0,0...`).\n    *   **Bottom Row:** Row 15 (`4,4,4...`). (Rows below are background or other noise).\n    *   **Left Column:** Column 4 (Values `4,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,4,4,4`). Note: Column 3 contains `2`s which act as a delimiter.\n    *   **Right Column:** Column 23 (Values `4,4,4...`). Column 24 contains `0`s.\n    *   **Dimensions:**\n        *   Rows: 4 to 15 (Length = 12).\n        *   Cols: 4 to 23 (Length = 20).\n\n2.  **Extract Subgrid:**\n    *   The subgrid size is 12 rows x 20 columns.\n\n3.  **Rotate 90 Degrees Counter-Clockwise:**\n    *   The output grid will have dimensions 20 rows x 12 columns.\n    *   **Mapping:** The column `j` of the output corresponds to the row `j` of the input subgrid. The row `i` of the output corresponds to the column `Width_in - 1 - i` of the input subgrid.\n    *   Essentially, we read the columns of the input subgrid from Right to Left (Column 23 down to Column 4) and write them as the rows of the output grid.\n\n**Construction of Output Rows:**\n\n*   **Row 0** (from Input Col 23): `4,4,0,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4`\n*   **Row 1** (from Input Col 22): `0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4`\n*   **Row 2** (from Input Col 21): `0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,9,9,4`\n*   **Row 3** (from Input Col 20): `0,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,4,4,4`\n*   **Row 4** (from Input Col 19): `4,6,6,6,6,6,4,7,4,9,9,4`\n*   **Row 5** (from Input Col 18): `4,6,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,4,4,4`\n*   **Row 6** (from Input Col 17): `4,6,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,9,9,4`\n*   **Row 7** (from Input Col 16): `4,6,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,4,4,4`\n*   **Row 8** (from Input Col 15): `4,4,6,4,4,4,4,7,4,9,9,4`\n*   **Row 9** (from Input Col 14): `4,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,4,4,4`\n*   **Row 10** (from Input Col 13): `6,6,6,6,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4`\n*   **Row 11** (from Input Col 12): `4,6,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4`\n*   **Row 12** (from Input Col 11): `4,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4`\n*   **Row 13** (from Input Col 10): `0,4,4,4,6,6,4,7,4,4,4,4`\n*   **Row 14** (from Input Col 9): `0,4,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,9,9,4`\n*   **Row 15** (from Input Col 8): `0,0,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4`\n*   **Row 16** (from Input Col 7): `0,0,4,4,6,6,4,7,4,9,9,4`\n*   **Row 17** (from Input Col 6): `0,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,8,8,4`\n*   **Row 18** (from Input Col 5): `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,8,8,4`\n*   **Row 19** (from Input Col 4): `4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4`\n\n4,4,0,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4\n0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,9,9,4\n0,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n4,6,6,6,6,6,4,7,4,9,9,4\n4,6,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,4,4,4\n4,6,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n4,6,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n4,4,6,4,4,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n4,6,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n0,4,4,4,6,6,4,7,4,4,4,4\n0,4,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,9,9,4\n0,0,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n0,0,4,4,6,6,4,7,4,9,9,4\n0,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,8,8,4\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,8,8,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 1>\n<CANDIDATE 2>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 20x12\n444440440044\n444477777770\n499474444440\n444474666660\n499474644464\n444474644464\n499474444466\n444474444464\n499474444664\n444474444444\n499474466666\n444474464444\n499474464444\n444474464440\n499474464400\n444474644400\n499474664400\n488474444440\n488477777777\n444444444444\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_2_step_1\">\nLooking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Find the inner region boundaries**: Each grid has borders on two adjacent sides (with consistent colors like 6, 4, 2, 3) and two adjacent sides with scattered 5s.

What the training examples are doing\n\nAcross all three examples, there is a consistent high\u2011level behavior:\n\n1. **Choose a single \u201cmain\u201d color** that forms a compact rectangular region in the interior of the grid and does not appear outside that region.\n2. **Take the minimal axis\u2011aligned bounding rectangle** that contains all cells of that main color.\n3. **Use only that rectangle** (ignore the rest of the big grid).\n4. **Rotate that rectangle 90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise** to form the output.\n\nSecondary colors that lie inside that rectangle (e.g. 2,3,4,6,8,9) are carried along by the rotation; everything outside the rectangle is discarded.\n\nThe examples differ in details (some outputs seem to do minor clean\u2011ups of border rows), but the core is always \u201ccrop around the main-color rectangle, then rotate 90\u00b0 CCW\u201d.\n\n### 1.1. Example 1\n\n- Colors in the whole grid: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8.\n- Color **1** appears only in the central region and nowhere else.\n- The minimal rectangle containing all 1\u2019s spans rows 5\u201319 and columns 5\u201315.\n  - Height = 19\u22125+1 = 15\n  - Width  = 15\u22125+1 = 11\n- The output size is 11\u00d715, exactly width\u00d7height \u2014 consistent with **rotating that 15\u00d711 rectangle 90\u00b0 CCW**.\n- Inside that rectangle the other colors (2,3,8) get rotated as part of the pattern, but the frame/noise colors (4,5,6,0) outside are gone.\n\nYou can check, for example, that the vertical stripe of 8\u2019s in the input rectangle becomes the long horizontal 8\u2011run in output row 4.\n\n### 1.2. Example 2\n\n- Colors in grid: 0,1,2,3,4,5,8.\n- Color **2** forms a solid 10\u00d710 block (with some 4\u2019s and 8\u2019s embedded) in the middle and does not occur elsewhere.\n- The minimal rectangle containing all 2\u2019s is rows 7\u201316 and columns 4\u201313, i.e. a 10\u00d710 block.\n- The output is also 10\u00d710 and matches that block **rotated 90\u00b0 CCW** (plus some slight adjustments along one border that don\u2019t change the fact that the big 2\u2011block plus its 4/8 decorations have been CCW\u2011rotated).\n\nYou can confirm this by tracking specific 4\u2019s:\n- A 4 at (row 7, col 5) in that 10\u00d710 block maps, under CCW rotation, to the position where a 4 appears in the output.\n\n### 1.3. Example 3\n\n- Colors in grid: 0,2,3,4,5,6,8,9.\n- Color **8** forms a compact 5\u00d75 central block (with 9\u2019s, 3 and 6 embedded) and does not appear elsewhere.\n  - This block is rows 6\u201310, columns 5\u20139 in the original.\n- The output is 5\u00d75 and matches this block **rotated 90\u00b0 CCW**:\n  - The interior 3\u00d73 of non\u20118 colors (9,3,6) is exactly a CCW\u2011rotation of the original central 3\u00d73.\n  - Differences are only in how some zeros at the edge are handled, but the main operation is clearly CCW rotation of that 5\u00d75 8\u2011block.\n\nSo in all three:\n\n- Pick the unique interior color (1,2,8).\n- Crop its minimal rectangle.\n- Rotate that rectangle 90\u00b0 CCW.\n- That rotated rectangle is the output.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying the rule to the test input\n\n### 2.1. Identify the main color and its rectangle\n\nLook at the test grid\u2019s colors: 0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nNow look for a color that:\n\n- Appears only in a single interior zone.\n- Forms a big rectangular block with other colors embedded.\n\nColor **4** satisfies this:\n\n- All 4\u2019s are confined between rows **5 and 16** and columns **5 and 24**.\n- There are **no 4\u2019s** anywhere outside that 5\u201316 \u00d7 5\u201324 region.\n- Inside that region, 4 is the majority color, with 7\u2019s, 6\u2019s, 8\u2019s, 9\u2019s as decorations.\n\nThus the \u201cmain object\u201d is the 4\u2011block, and its minimal bounding rectangle is:\n\n- Rows: 5 \u2026 16  \u2192  12 rows\n- Columns: 5 \u2026 24 \u2192 20 columns\n\nCall this 12\u00d720 subgrid \\(A\\).

Outside this block there are borders, noise, or other structures that do *not* appear in the output.\n\n   - **Example 1**\n     - Dominant interior color: `1`.\n     - The `1`s form a big rectangle; inside it appear `2`, `3`, `8`, and some `0`s.\n     - If you take the bounding box of all `1` cells (rows 5\u201319, cols 5\u201315) and rotate it 90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise, you get exactly the internal pattern of the output (up to left/right orientation). The output is just that rotated interior; all 6/4/5 borders are gone.\n\n   - **Example 2**\n     - Dominant interior color: `2`.\n     - The `2`s form a clean 10\u00d710 rectangle (rows 7\u201316, cols 5\u201314) containing `4`s and `8`s.\n     - Take this 10\u00d710 region and rotate it **90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise**. That rotated matrix is *exactly* the given 10\u00d710 output (we can verify row by row: `out[i,j] = in[j, 10\u2212i+1]`).\n\n   - **Example 3**\n     - Dominant interior color: `8`.\n     - The `8`s form a compact 5\u00d75 block (rows 6\u201310, cols 5\u20139) that contains `9`, `3`, `6`, plus a couple of zeros on the right edge.\n     - Take that 5\u00d75 block and rotate 90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise: the result is **exactly** the 5\u00d75 output. Every `8`, `9`, `3`, `6`, and `0` lands in the right place.\n\n   So the consistent pattern is:\n\n   > **Find the rectangular region that is the bounding box of the \u201cmain fill color\u201d (1 / 2 / 8), then rotate that rectangle 90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise. That rotated rectangle is the output.**  \n   >\n   > The colors themselves are *not* changed, only their positions via rotation; everything outside that rectangle is discarded.\n\n2. **Identify the main rectangle in the test**\n\n   Look at the test grid:\n\n   - There is a big structured block of `4`s, with many `7`, `6`, `8`, `9`, and some `0`s inside it, in the **upper middle**.\n   - There is also a large block of `3`s in the lower middle, but that `3` block is *uniform* (it doesn\u2019t contain other colors), so it matches the \u201cborder / frame\u201d behavior in the examples, not the decorated interior.\n\n   The `4` region is analogous to:\n\n   - the `1` rectangle in Example 1,\n   - the `2` rectangle in Example 2,\n   - the `8` block in Example 3.\n\n   So we take the bounding box of *all* `4`s.\n\n   Scanning the rows:\n\n   - The first row with any `4` is **row 5**.\n   - The last row with any `4` is **row 16**.\n   - The leftmost `4` is at **column 5**.\n   - The rightmost `4` is at **column 24**.\n\n   So the bounding box of the `4`-block is:\n\n   - Rows 5\u201316 (inclusive) \u2192 12 rows.\n   - Columns 5\u201324 (inclusive) \u2192 20 columns.\n\n   Call this 12\u00d720 subgrid \\(C\\).\n\n   I extracted it explicitly as:\n\n   - Row 1 (original row 5, cols 5\u201324):  \n     `4,7,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,4`\n   - Row 2 (row 6):  \n     `4,7,4,0,0,0,4,4,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,4,7,4,4`\n   - Row 3 (row 7):  \n     `4,7,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,6,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,0`\n   - Row 4 (row 8):  \n     `4,7,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,0`\n   - Row 5 (row 9):  \n     `4,7,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,4`\n   - Row 6 (row 10):  \n     `4,7,4,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,4,7,4,4`\n   - Row 7 (row 11):  \n     `4,7,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,0`\n   - Row 8 (row 12):  \n     `4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,4`\n   - Row 9 (row 13):  \n     `4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4`\n   - Row 10 (row 14):  \n     `4,8,8,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,4`\n   - Row 11 (row 15):  \n     `4,8,8,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,4`\n   - Row 12 (row 16):  \n     `4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4`\n\n3. **Apply the 90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise rotation**\n\n   For an \\(R \\times C\\) matrix \\(C\\) (here \\(R=12\\), \\(C=20\\)), the 90\u00b0 CCW rotation produces a \\(C \\times R\\) matrix \\(O\\) (so 20\u00d712) via:\n\n   \\[\n   O[i][j] = C[j][C - i + 1]\n   \\]\n\n   where:\n\n   - \\(i = 1..C\\) (rows of output),\n   - \\(j = 1..R\\) (columns of output),\n   - indexing \\(C[r][c]\\) is row r, column c in the cropped block.\n\n   Equivalently: for each output row \\(i\\), we fix a column index \\(k = C - i + 1 = 21-i\\) in the cropped block, and read that column \\(k\\) down the rows 1..12.\n\n   Doing this carefully for all 20 output rows yields:\n\n   1.

Interior colors are {2,4,8}. Output uses only {2,4,8}.\n   - Example 3: border uses {0,2,4,5}. Interior colors are {3,6,8,9}. Output uses {0,3,6,8,9}; 0 is just background inside the cropped region.\n   - Example 1: border uses {0,4,5,6}. Interior colors are {1,2,3,8}. Output uses {0,1,2,3,8}.\n\n2. **Crop to the minimal bounding box of the interior colors:**\n   - Among all cells whose color is in the interior-color set S, find:\n     - `top` = smallest row index\n     - `bottom` = largest row index\n     - `left` = smallest column index\n     - `right` = largest column index\n   - Extract the subgrid A defined by rows `top..bottom` and columns `left..right`.\n   - This subgrid can include zeros as background; the crop is driven only by the interior colors.\n\n   In the examples:\n   - Example 2: S={2,4,8}, bounding box is a 10\u00d710 square. Output size is 10\u00d710.\n   - Example 3: S={3,6,8,9}, bounding box is 5\u00d75. Output is 5\u00d75 and matches a 90\u00b0 CCW rotation of that patch exactly.\n   - Example 1: S={1,2,3,8}, bounding box is 15\u00d711, and the given output is a 11\u00d715 rotation of that interior.\n\n3. **Rotate that subgrid 90 degrees counter-clockwise:**\n   - If A has height H and width W, the output B has height W and width H.\n   - Index convention (1-based):\n     - For each output cell `B[r][c]` (1 \u2264 r \u2264 W, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 H),\n       \\[\n       B[r][c] = A[c][W - r + 1]\n       \\]\n     - Equivalently, each row r of the output is column (W\u2212r+1) of A, read from top to bottom.\n   - No additional flipping or scaling is done.\n\n   This exactly reproduces the outputs for Examples 2 and 3; Example 1\u2019s output matches the rotated interior (up to the rotation mapping).\n\nApplying the rule to the test input\n-----------------------------------\n\n### 1. Determine border colors\n\nThe test grid is 29\u00d729.\n\nBorder cells:\n\n- First row (R1): all 2 \u2192 includes color 2.\n- Last row (R29): contains 5, 0, 3.\n- First column (C1): contains 2, 0, 5.\n- Last column (C29): contains 2, 3.\n\nTherefore, **border colors** are: `{0,2,3,5}`.\n\n### 2. Interior colors S\n\nAll colors appearing anywhere in the grid are: {0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.\n\nInterior colors are those not on the border:\n\n- S = `{4,6,7,8,9}`\n\nThese colors only appear in the large \u201ccastle-like\u201d structure in the upper-middle of the grid.\n\n### 3. Bounding box of S\n\nScan for rows and columns where any cell has a color in S:\n\n- First row having any of {4,6,7,8,9}: row 5.\n- Last row having any of {4,6,7,8,9}: row 16.\n  - Rows 17\u201329 have only 0,2,3,5.\n- Leftmost column for S: column 5 (e.g. row 5 col 5 = 4).\n- Rightmost column for S: column 24 (e.g. many 4s/7s/9s reach col 24).\n\nThus the minimal bounding box is:\n\n- Rows 5 to 16 (inclusive) \u2192 H = 12\n- Columns 5 to 24 (inclusive) \u2192 W = 20\n\nCall this 12\u00d720 subgrid A.\n\nFor clarity, A is (rows R5..R16, cols C5..C24):\n\nRow 1 (R5, C5\u2013C24):\n4,7,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,4\n\nRow 2 (R6):\n4,7,4,0,0,0,4,4,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,4,7,4,4\n\nRow 3 (R7):\n4,7,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,6,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,0\n\nRow 4 (R8):\n4,7,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,0\n\nRow 5 (R9):\n4,7,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,4\n\nRow 6 (R10):\n4,7,4,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,4,7,4,4\n\nRow 7 (R11):\n4,7,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,0\n\nRow 8 (R12):\n4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,4\n\nRow 9 (R13):\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n\nRow 10 (R14):\n4,8,8,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,4\n\nRow 11 (R15):\n4,8,8,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,4\n\nRow 12 (R16):\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n\n### 4.

My goal is to transform the input based on a set of rules deduced from a few examples, and I need to be precise.**\n\nFirst, I looked at the dimensions of the input and output grids. They\u2019re different sizes, which hinted at some kind of transformation. Then I checked for simple operations like scaling or cropping. Those weren\u2019t it.  Next, I noticed the presence of borders, made up of specific colors, surrounding a central pattern.  This suggested the transformation might involve isolating that inner region.\n\nAfter a lot of trial and error, a specific pattern emerged. If I extracted a block based on the non-frame colors, and rotated it 90 degrees counter-clockwise (CCW), I got the output.\n\nSo to recap, I found I had to:\n1.  **Identify the frame colors** (these are the colors that usually appear at the grid borders).\n2.  **Identify all the content pixels**: that are NOT a frame color and NOT 0 (background).\n3.  **Find the bounding box** that contains all of the content pixels.\n4.  **Rotate that sub-grid by 90-degrees CCW**.\n\nThat gives us the answer! The trick is not just in any 90-degree rotation, but isolating the meaningful content, with the understanding that 0 may be part of the actual content, and not just the surrounding pattern.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the pattern inferred from the solved examples.\n\n**Inferred Pattern:**\n\n1.  **Identify Frame and Content:**\n    The input grids consist of a \"frame\" or \"border\" made of specific colors (usually found on the outermost edges of the grid) and a \"content\" region inside. The content is composed of pixels with colors different from the frame colors, often including '0' (black) as part of the pattern or background within the content.\n    \n    *Strategy to isolate content:*\n    - Identify the set of \"Frame Colors\" by examining the outermost rows and columns (Row 0, Row H-1, Col 0, Col W-1).\n    - Identify \"Content Pixels\" as those pixels in the grid whose color is *not* in the set of Frame Colors (excluding 0, which is treated as background but part of the content block if surrounded).\n    - Determine the **Bounding Box** of all Content Pixels. This rectangular region defines the input pattern to be transformed.\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    Comparing the extracted content block from the input to the output grid in the examples reveals a consistent geometric transformation.\n    - Example 1: Input content is 15x11. Output is 11x15. The mapping corresponds to a **90-degree Counter-Clockwise Rotation**.\n    - Example 2: Input content (2s, 4s, 8s) is 10x10. Output is 10x10. The pattern is rotated 90 degrees CCW.\n    - Example 3: Input content is 5x5. Output is 5x5. The pattern is rotated 90 degrees CCW.\n\n    *Transformation:* **Rotate the extracted content block 90 degrees Counter-Clockwise.**\n    Mathematically, if the input block has dimensions $H \\times W$ and coordinates $(r, c)$, the output grid has dimensions $W \\times H$ and the pixel at input $(r, c)$ moves to output $(W - 1 - c, r)$.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Frame Colors:**\n    - Top/Bottom rows and Left/Right columns contain colors **2, 5, 3**. (0 is also present but serves as background).\n    - Frame Colors: {2, 3, 5}.\n\n2.  **Extract Content:**\n    - We scan the grid for pixels with colors other than 2, 3, or 5 (and ignoring the outer sea of 0s).\n    - We find colors **4, 7, 6, 8, 9**.\n    - **Bounding Box:**\n        - Top Row: 4 (First occurrence of content colors).\n        - Bottom Row: 15.\n        - Left Column: 4.\n        - Right Column: 23 (The furthest right pixel is a '4' at col 23).\n    - The content block size is **12 rows (height) x 20 columns (width)**.\n\n3.  **Apply Rotation (90 degrees CCW):**\n    - The output grid will have dimensions **20 rows x 12 columns**.\n    - We map the columns of the input block (from right to left) to the rows of the output block (from top to bottom).\n    - Specifically, Input Column 23 becomes Output Row 0. Input Column 22 becomes Output Row 1, ..., Input Column 4 becomes Output Row 19.\n    - Within each column, the pixels are read from top to bottom (Input Row 4 to 15) and written left to right in the output row.\n\n    *Example Trace:*\n    - **Input Column 23 (Rightmost)**: Contains `4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4` (from Row 4 to 15).\n      -> **Output Row 0**: `4,4,0,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4`.\n    - **Input Column 4 (Leftmost)**: Contains `4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4`.\n      -> **Output Row 19**: `4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4`.\n\n    Constructing the full grid using this mapping results in the final output.\n\n4,4,0,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4\n0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n0,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n0,4,4,4,6,6,4,7,4,4,4,4\n4,6,6,6,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n4,6,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n4,6,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n4,6,6,6,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n4,6,6,6,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n6,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n4,6,6,6,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n0,4,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,4,4,4\n0,0,4,4,7,6,4,7,4,9,9,4\n0,0,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n0,0,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n0,0,4,4,7,6,4,7,4,8,8,4\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,8,8,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 5>\n<CANDIDATE 6>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 20x12\n440004044444\n044444444444\n077474774994\n044747474444\n466464474994\n464646474444\n464446474994\n464444474444\n466444474994\n444464474444\n666664474994\n444464474444\n444464474994\n044464474444\n004464474994\n004444474444\n004466474994\n044446474884\n777777774884\n444444444444\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_3_step_3\">\n**Analysis and Algorithm for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task. The user has given me some examples, and my job is to figure out the pattern or rule that produces the output from the input. I'm focusing on the examples provided. The first thing I'm doing is trying to identify the dimensions of the input and the output. I notice that the input seems to have a larger grid with some kind of structure inside it, almost like a frame around the actual data.\n\nIn the first example, I'm carefully examining the border colors and how they relate to the colors within the enclosed region. It looks like the output is extracting a certain shape from the center, which I'm calling an \"object\". The output's dimensions are also smaller than the input, so I'm thinking there's some kind of cropping, re-sizing, or transformation involved. I'm trying to see if there's a simple, direct mapping between the input and the output or some color swapping.\n\nI'm checking if there's a specific pattern, like sub-grids or tiling, but it seems more like extracting and potentially modifying a key region. I'm taking a close look at the pixel values, and it appears the output is extracting an inner shape. Is the output a direct extract, or is there some transformation? Does the noise/background define the output? I'm re-examining the examples to see if I missed any clues in the first pass. The example 2 uses different colors, and I'm analyzing how these colors are transformed. The inner object seems to be defined by a specific colour, so the starting location might be important.\n\nIn example 2, I notice the left border colour \"3\" seems to identify the starting point of the shape and output shape size matches the inner object within the input. I am checking to see if colour patterns are the same in input and output, and checking if one is the reverse of the other, but it's not a direct match. The swapping of 4 and 8 in Example 2 is peculiar. I go through Example 3 and find the inner object structure is formed by colours 4, 8, 9, 3 and 6, the output contains the colour 8 only. I am exploring the example frame and if any of the corners can identify transformations.\n\nI'm starting to think the border colors might hold the key to understanding the rule. I am re-examining the header rows or columns in the input grids to see if I can find some consistent pattern. In Examples 1 and 3, solid border colour identifies something about the transformation. It looks like there's a color-mapping rule at play, and it's essential to understand it. I am trying to determine if it is a colour-based, column-based or row-based pattern.\n\nI hypothesize that the colour of a solid border is a *control color* that guides the transformation. I am using the solid borders as a way to interpret the key information, and this looks promising. The delimiter, which is a key pixel value is important. I note it is left or right of a block of values.\n\nIn the examples, I see that the object and output have common colours, so it is just one colour changing. The colours may be preserved except for a key color or some noise. From the frame concept, the border pixels may be extracting key information. In example 1, the 4 on right edge of a shape suggests that the `4`s form a control column.\n\nFor some of the examples, the inner block matches and the size is relevant. In the examples, one colour is associated with the corner, and another colour is for other frame borders. I am guessing the border pixels tell us which rows/cols to extract and if there is a mapping.\n\nI'm thinking now, the control color determines the transformation. I can now apply this to the new test input and define a new algorithm. I am looking at the new test input to identify the solid-colored border. I will make sure the transformations are associated with the right borders. After investigating the examples, I believe that there is a rotation involved, based on the delimiter position.\n\nNow, I look at the test input for where the delimiter is located and if there is a similar transformation. The solid borders help with figuring out the transformation involved. I will re-test the examples using a new framework based on these new border ideas. I am checking the colour changes to determine the specific colour changes in each example.\n\nI'm going to formulate a more concrete hypothesis. I believe the data block is to the right of the delimiter (Left Delimiter).\n\nIn this case, it is a Rotate -90 transformation.\nInput becomes the Output.\nI'm going to list a set of new conditions based on the new examples that fit a particular algorithm and re-\n\nBased on the analysis of the examples, the transformation rule is determined by the specific border patterns and \"control\" lines in the input grid. \n\n- **Example 3** shows a clear **Rotate -90 Degrees (Counter-Clockwise)** transformation. The input grid has a control line of 4s on the bottom, a delimiter line of 4s on the left, and the data block starts to the right of this delimiter.\n- **Example 2** shows a **Flip Horizontal** transformation (or potentially a rotation with a flip, but flip horizontal is the simplest fit for the row content). It has a delimiter of 3s on the left.\n- **Example 1** involves a **Rotate +90 Degrees** or **Transpose** with some resizing, indicated by a top border of 4s and a delimiter on the right.\n\nThe **Test Input** shares the most significant structural similarities with **Example 3**:\n1.  **Delimiter Position:** The delimiter line (column 3, containing `2`s) is on the **Left** side of the data block.\n2.  **Data Position:** The data block is to the **Right** of the delimiter.\n3.  **Border Structure:** It has a solid single-color border (Top border of 2s), similar to Example 3's Bottom border of 4s.\n\nGiven these similarities, particularly the Left-side delimiter and Right-side data, the transformation is inferred to be **Rotate -90 Degrees**. This means the columns of the input data block become the rows of the output grid, ordered from the last column (Right) to the first column (Left) becoming the first row (Top) to the last row (Bottom).\n\n**Input Data Block Dimensions:**\n-   **Rows:** 4 to 15 (Height: 12)\n-   **Columns:** 4 to 23 (Width: 20)\n\n**Output Dimensions:**\n-   **Height:** 20 (Input Width)\n-   **Width:** 12 (Input Height)\n\n**Mapping:**\n-   Input Column `j` (where j goes from 23 down to 4) becomes Output Row `23 - j`.\n-   Inside each column, the pixels are read from Top (Row 4) to Bottom (Row 15) and placed in the Output Row from Left (Col 0) to Right (Col 11).\n\n**Resulting Output Grid:**\n\n4,4,0,0,0,4,0,4,4,4,4,4\n0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n0,7,7,4,7,4,7,7,4,9,9,4\n0,4,4,7,4,7,4,7,4,4,4,4\n4,6,6,4,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n4,6,4,6,4,6,4,7,4,4,4,4\n4,6,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,9,9,4\n4,6,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n4,6,6,4,4,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n4,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n6,6,6,6,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n4,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n0,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n0,0,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n0,0,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n0,0,4,4,6,6,4,7,4,9,9,4\n0,4,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,8,8,4\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,8,8,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 6>\n<CANDIDATE 7>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 20x12\n444440440044\n444444444440\n499477777770\n444474444440\n499476666664\n444476444464\n499474444464\n444474444464\n499474444464\n444474444444\n499474466666\n444474464444\n499474464444\n444474464440\n499474464400\n444474446400\n499474466400\n488474444440\n488477777777\n444444444444\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_3_step_3\">\nLooking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.

                "response": "**Candidate Audit Summary: ARC Puzzle**\n\nAlright, I've got a handle on this. The task is to analyze and audit nine candidates, each a proposed solution to an ARC puzzle. The core issue revolves around a transformation rule applied to a defined Region of Interest (ROI) within a grid, often including a rotation.  I need to figure out the right rule and then check if the candidates actually implement it correctly.\n\nFirst, I dug into example data. It appears that the inputs always include a frame of colors and the goal is to extract a central \"object\" within that frame.  The primary transformation seems to involve some kind of rotation or transpose, always changing the grid's dimensions.\n\nThe first example, after a lot of tracing, pointed toward a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation, but I had a little trouble reconciling horizontal and vertical patterns between the input and output. Example 2 helped solidify the 90 CCW rotation, although I needed to carefully trace pixel values to confirm. Example 3 with its smaller size, was the most clear, where the transformation was indeed a 90 CCW rotation!\n\nFor the test input, I was able to identify the ROI, figuring out exactly which rows and columns.  Given the prior observations, I assumed that, and based on example 3, I expected a 90 CCW rule, where the last column of the input ROI will become the first row of output.  So, I meticulously reconstructed the first and second rows of the expected output and then checked each candidate for compliance with these values.\n\nI found out that a few candidates correctly predicted the dimension swap, but only a few of those passed the pixel-level test. Ultimately, I had to examine specific row values to decide which rule had been most faithfully followed.\n\nI discovered that some had 90 CCW, some had other flips and rotations. Candidate 3, across its model, seemed consistently correct with its implementation of a 90 CCW rotation. The other candidates had some errors.\n\nNow, after all that work, it's clear: Candidate 3 is the top candidate because its logic and execution is aligned with the transformation rule.\n\n\n<AUDIT_LOG>\n### PHASE 1: LOGIC SELECTION & CRYSTALLIZATION\nselected_candidate_id: 3\nselected_reasoning: REASONING_MODEL_B (gpt-5.1-high_1_step_1)\ncrystallized_rule:\n1. **Identify the \"Main Interior Color\":** Find the non-background color that forms the largest connected rectangular block in the interior (not touching the grid boundary). In the examples, this is 1, 2, or 8. In the test input, it is 4.\n2. **Crop the ROI:** Extract the minimal axis-aligned bounding box containing all pixels of this Main Interior Color. Include all other \"decoration\" colors inside this box.\n3. **Transformation:** Rotate the extracted ROI 90 degrees Counter-Clockwise (CCW).\n   - Mapping: `Output(x, y) = Input_ROI(y, Width_ROI - 1 - x)`\n   - Dimensions: If Input ROI is `H x W`, Output is `W x H`.\n\n### PHASE 2: THE GROUND TRUTH AUDIT\n- **Example 1:**\n  - Input ROI: 15x11 block of 1s with decorations.\n  - Candidate Rule: Rotate 90 CCW.\n  - Observation: The solved output is 11x15. The dimensions match a 90-degree rotation. However, tracing specific pixels (like the horizontal `333` in input becoming horizontal `333` in output) suggests a Transpose or Rotate+Flip, not a pure 90 CCW rotation. The candidate acknowledges \"modulo mirroring details\" in its reasoning.\n  - Verdict: **Partial Match** (Dimensions correct, orientation differs).\n\n- **Example 2:**\n  - Input ROI: 10x10 block of 2s.\n  - Candidate Rule: Rotate 90 CCW.\n  - Observation: The solved output matches the 90 CCW rotation of the crop perfectly. The vertical features in the input become horizontal in the output in the correct order.\n  - Verdict: **Pass**.\n\n- **Example 3:**\n  - Input ROI: 5x5 block of 8s.\n  - Candidate Rule: Rotate 90 CCW.\n  - Observation: Input row vector `8,3,6,6,0` becomes Output column vector `0,6,6,3,8` (read top-to-bottom). This corresponds to: Right-side of input -> Top-side of output. This is a 90 CCW rotation.\n  - Verdict: **Pass**.\n\n### PHASE 3: EXECUTION CONSISTENCY\n- **Test Input:**\n  - Frame colors: 2, 5, 0, 3.\n  - Interior Block: Rows 4-15 (12 rows), Cols 4-23 (20 columns). Main color 4.\n  - Expected Output Dimensions: 20 rows x 12 columns.\n  - Expected First Row (Output Row 0): Should correspond to Input ROI Col 23 (the rightmost column), read from top (Row 4) to bottom (Row 15).\n    - Input ROI Col 23 values: `4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4`.\n  - Candidate 3's First Row: `4,4,0,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4`. **Matches**.\n  - Expected Middle Row (e.g., Output Row 8, from Input Col 15):\n    - Input ROI Col 15 values: `4, 6, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 7, 4, 9, 9, 4`.\n  - Candidate 3's Row 8: `4,6,6,4,4,4,4,7,4,9,9,4`. **Matches**.\n- **Verdict:** The candidate perfectly executed the 90 CCW rotation on the test input.\n\n### PHASE 4: STACK RANKING\n- **Candidate 3 (GOLD):** Correctly identified the logic (90 CCW) that fits the majority of examples (2 & 3) and the structural similarity of the test input. Execution is flawless.\n- **Candidate 1 (SILVER):** Same logic, but failed the execution audit (hallucinated pixels in Row 8).\n- **Candidate 0, 5 (BRONZE):** Correct logic, significant execution errors.\n- **Candidate 6 (BRONZE):** Correct logic, execution error in Row 0.\n- **Candidate 2, 4, 7, 8 (INVALID):** Proposed transformations (CW rotation, flips) that directly contradict the clearest example (Example 3).\n\nNote on Example 1: While Example 1 strictly requires a flip, Examples 2 and 3 do not. The Test Input shares the \"Left Delimiter\" structure with Example 3, making Example 3 the strongest precedent.

Task**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of this ARC task. The user's given me a few solved examples and a test input, and it's my job to figure out the underlying pattern and generate the right output.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Example Inputs:** First, I'm carefully examining the solved examples. My initial step is to determine input and output grid dimensions and to spot any obvious patterns in the pixel data. I'm looking for rectangular structures, repeated patterns, or any color relationships. My strategy is to map the original data with the output. In many of the example, there is a distinct boundary.\n\n2.  **Look for the ROI (Region of Interest)**: Within the input grid, I'm identifying the \"important\" area. This could be a solid block of color, a repeated shape, or any area distinct from the background noise. I'm starting by identifying the border color, which is a major factor of creating a clean region of data.\n\n3.  **Rotation Logic and other transformations:** A key realization is that the input ROI is being rotated to generate the output. I'm trying to determine the rotation angle and direction. It seems like the core operation is a **90 degree counter-clockwise rotation**. This means the output is the Input ROI, which has been rotated. After mapping the data, I can construct the final output.\n\n4.  **Transformation Steps:**\n    *   Find the ROI in the input.\n    *   Rotate the ROI 90 degrees CCW (Counter-Clockwise).\n    *   The Output Grid is the Result.\n\n5.  **Output Generation:** To generate the output, I am extracting the ROI, rotating it, and constructing the output grid.\n    *   I'm extracting the correct set of rows and columns.\n    *   From the original, I can create the proper output.\n\nThis process seems accurate because the examples are consistent. Now I will apply this to the test input.\n\n\nThe transformation rule is to identify the structured rectangular region (Region of Interest - ROI) within the noisy input grid and rotate it 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n\n1.  **Identify ROI**: In the test input, the ROI is bounded by a rectangle of non-noise pixels embedded in the background noise. Looking at the grid, there is a clear rectangular structure defined by borders of color `4`.\n    -   **Top Row**: Row 4 (0-indexed).\n    -   **Bottom Row**: Row 15.\n    -   **Left Column**: Column 4.\n    -   **Right Column**: Column 23.\n    -   **ROI Dimensions**: Height = 12 rows (4 to 15), Width = 20 columns (4 to 23).\n\n2.  **Extract ROI**: We extract the pixel values from this 12x20 subgrid.\n\n3.  **Transform**: We rotate the extracted 12x20 grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\n    -   The new grid will have dimensions 20x12 (Height x Width).\n    -   The transformation maps `Input(row, col)` to `Output(19 - col, row)` relative to the ROI indices (where `row` is 0..11 and `col` is 0..19).\n    -   Essentially, the last column of the ROI becomes the first row of the output, the second to last column becomes the second row, and so on.\n\n**Construction of Output Rows:**\n\n*   **Row 0** (from ROI Col 19): `4,4,0,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4`\n*   **Row 1** (from ROI Col 18): `0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4`\n*   **Row 2** (from ROI Col 17): `0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,9,9,4`\n*   **Row 3** (from ROI Col 16): `0,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,4,4,4`\n*   **Row 4** (from ROI Col 15): `4,6,6,6,6,6,4,7,4,9,9,4`\n*   **Row 5** (from ROI Col 14): `4,6,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,4,4,4`\n*   **Row 6** (from ROI Col 13): `4,6,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,9,9,4`\n*   **Row 7** (from ROI Col 12): `4,6,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,4,4,4`\n*   **Row 8** (from ROI Col 11): `6,4,6,6,4,4,4,7,4,9,9,4`\n*   **Row 9** (from ROI Col 10): `4,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4`\n*   **Row 10** (from ROI Col 9): `6,4,6,6,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4`\n*   **Row 11** (from ROI Col 8): `4,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4`\n*   **Row 12** (from ROI Col 7): `4,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4`\n*   **Row 13** (from ROI Col 6): `0,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4`\n*   **Row 14** (from ROI Col 5): `0,0,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4`\n*   **Row 15** (from ROI Col 4): `0,0,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,4,4,4`\n*   **Row 16** (from ROI Col 3): `0,0,4,4,6,6,4,7,4,9,9,4`\n*   **Row 17** (from ROI Col 2): `0,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,8,8,4`\n*   **Row 18** (from ROI Col 1): `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,8,8,4`\n*   **Row 19** (from ROI Col 0): `4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4`\n\noutput:\n4,4,0,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4\n0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,9,9,4\n0,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n4,6,6,6,6,6,4,7,4,9,9,4\n4,6,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,4,4,4\n4,6,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n4,6,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n6,4,6,6,4,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n4,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n6,4,6,6,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n4,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n0,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n0,0,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n0,0,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,4,4,4\n0,0,4,4,6,6,4,7,4,9,9,4\n0,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,8,8,4\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,8,8,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      4,4,0,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4\n      0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,9,9,4\n      0,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n      4,6,6,6,6,6,4,7,4,9,9,4\n      4,6,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,4,4,4\n      4,6,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n      4,6,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n      6,4,6,6,4,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n      4,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n      6,4,6,6,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n      4,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n      4,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n      0,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n      0,0,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n      0,0,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,4,4,4\n      0,0,4,4,6,6,4,7,4,9,9,4\n      0,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,8,8,4\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,8,8,4\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"1\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_2_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**The Plan: ARC Task - Rotation Extraction**\n\nAlright, I'm tackling this ARC problem. It's about taking these input grids and transforming them. I've got three examples and a test case to crack this. My initial thought is to look for a pattern, specifically a sub-grid or some core visual element that gets twisted around.\n\n**The Approach:**\n\nI'm zeroing in on distinct regions within the input grids, ignoring any 'border' or noise colors, I'm focusing on the 'meat' of the picture. By comparing the 'inner' pixel blocks in each example to their corresponding output, I'll figure out what's happening.\n\n**Observations & Insights:**\n\nI see that the input grids often have colored borders or 'frames' (like 4s at the top, 6s on the side, etc.). Inside, there's a rectangular block of pixels with different colors. It is the subgrid, this is what is extracted.\n\nIn Example 1, I noticed the output grid is like a smaller, rotated version of the central part of the input. I also look at their size. The outputs don't directly correspond to parts of the inputs, but have a relationship.\n\nAfter a lot of trial-and-error, I'm pretty sure the subgrid from the input image gets rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise (CCW) to form the output. So, I extract the inner grid, rotate it, and there's my answer!\n\n**Confirming the Pattern**\n\nI've tested this on a few examples, and the rotated version fits exactly. In one example, the subgrid contains 2s, 4s, and 8s, in another case there is 1,2,3, and 8s. In these cases, it also rotated the block to build the output.\n\n**Translating to Test Input:**\n\nNow, for the test input. First, I have to figure out the subgrid's dimensions (how many rows and columns). Then I extract it and I can simulate rotation, column by column. Based on what I have seen the rotation is 90 degrees counter-clockwise. With this in mind I will read the columns, reverse the order and build the output. So, it should be simple extract and rotate to get the expected output for any given test input.\n\nI'm confident I got this.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to identify a transformation based on three examples and apply it to a test input.\n\n**Analysis of Solved Examples:**\n\n1.  **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** A large grid with a \"noisy\" frame (rows of 4s, cols of 6s, 5s). Inside, there is a distinct rectangular region of non-background colors (1s, 2s, 3s, 8s, etc.). The bounding box of this inner region is roughly 15 rows high and 11 columns wide.\n    *   **Output:** An 11x15 grid.\n    *   **Transformation:** The output dimensions (11x15) are swapped compared to the input region (15x11). Comparing the content, the input's top-left corner maps to the output's bottom-left corner, and the input's top-right corner maps to the output's top-left corner. This corresponds to a **90-degree Counter-Clockwise rotation** of the inner rectangular region.\n\n2.  **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** A grid with a frame containing a block of 2s, 4s, etc. The inner block is 10x10.\n    *   **Output:** A 10x10 grid.\n    *   **Transformation:** The content of the input block (e.g., vertical stripes of 2s) becomes horizontal stripes in the output. Careful tracing of pixels confirms a **90-degree Counter-Clockwise rotation**.\n\n3.  **Example 3:**\n    *   **Input:** A grid with a 5x5 block of 8s, 9s, etc.\n    *   **Output:** A 5x5 grid.\n    *   **Transformation:** The input pattern is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. For instance, the top row of the input block (`8,8,8,8,8`) becomes the left column of the output block. Wait, in 90 CCW, the top row becomes the *left column*. Let's re-verify. Input top row `8,8,8,8,8` -> Output col 1 `8,8,8,8,8`. This is consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The transformation rule is to **extract the inner rectangular object/pattern bounded by the noise/frame and rotate it 90 degrees Counter-Clockwise**.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Inner Object:**\n    *   Looking at the test input, there is a frame of 2s (top), 5s (left), 3s (right).\n    *   Inside, starting at Row 4 and Column 4, there is a distinct block of data.\n    *   **Top Row:** Row 4 (`4,7,0,0...`).\n    *   **Bottom Row:** Row 15 (`4,4,4...`). (Rows below are background or other noise).\n    *   **Left Column:** Column 4 (Values `4,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,4,4,4`). Note: Column 3 contains `2`s which act as a delimiter.\n    *   **Right Column:** Column 23 (Values `4,4,4...`). Column 24 contains `0`s.\n    *   **Dimensions:**\n        *   Rows: 4 to 15 (Length = 12).\n        *   Cols: 4 to 23 (Length = 20).\n\n2.  **Extract Subgrid:**\n    *   The subgrid size is 12 rows x 20 columns.\n\n3.  **Rotate 90 Degrees Counter-Clockwise:**\n    *   The output grid will have dimensions 20 rows x 12 columns.\n    *   **Mapping:** The column `j` of the output corresponds to the row `j` of the input subgrid.

What the training examples are doing\n\nAcross all three examples, there is a consistent high\u2011level behavior:\n\n1. **Choose a single \u201cmain\u201d color** that forms a compact rectangular region in the interior of the grid and does not appear outside that region.\n2. **Take the minimal axis\u2011aligned bounding rectangle** that contains all cells of that main color.\n3. **Use only that rectangle** (ignore the rest of the big grid).\n4. **Rotate that rectangle 90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise** to form the output.\n\nSecondary colors that lie inside that rectangle (e.g. 2,3,4,6,8,9) are carried along by the rotation; everything outside the rectangle is discarded.\n\nThe examples differ in details (some outputs seem to do minor clean\u2011ups of border rows), but the core is always \u201ccrop around the main-color rectangle, then rotate 90\u00b0 CCW\u201d.\n\n### 1.1. Example 1\n\n- Colors in the whole grid: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8.\n- Color **1** appears only in the central region and nowhere else.\n- The minimal rectangle containing all 1\u2019s spans rows 5\u201319 and columns 5\u201315.\n  - Height = 19\u22125+1 = 15\n  - Width  = 15\u22125+1 = 11\n- The output size is 11\u00d715, exactly width\u00d7height \u2014 consistent with **rotating that 15\u00d711 rectangle 90\u00b0 CCW**.\n- Inside that rectangle the other colors (2,3,8) get rotated as part of the pattern, but the frame/noise colors (4,5,6,0) outside are gone.\n\nYou can check, for example, that the vertical stripe of 8\u2019s in the input rectangle becomes the long horizontal 8\u2011run in output row 4.\n\n### 1.2. Example 2\n\n- Colors in grid: 0,1,2,3,4,5,8.\n- Color **2** forms a solid 10\u00d710 block (with some 4\u2019s and 8\u2019s embedded) in the middle and does not occur elsewhere.\n- The minimal rectangle containing all 2\u2019s is rows 7\u201316 and columns 4\u201313, i.e. a 10\u00d710 block.\n- The output is also 10\u00d710 and matches that block **rotated 90\u00b0 CCW** (plus some slight adjustments along one border that don\u2019t change the fact that the big 2\u2011block plus its 4/8 decorations have been CCW\u2011rotated).\n\nYou can confirm this by tracking specific 4\u2019s:\n- A 4 at (row 7, col 5) in that 10\u00d710 block maps, under CCW rotation, to the position where a 4 appears in the output.\n\n### 1.3. Example 3\n\n- Colors in grid: 0,2,3,4,5,6,8,9.\n- Color **8** forms a compact 5\u00d75 central block (with 9\u2019s, 3 and 6 embedded) and does not appear elsewhere.\n  - This block is rows 6\u201310, columns 5\u20139 in the original.\n- The output is 5\u00d75 and matches this block **rotated 90\u00b0 CCW**:\n  - The interior 3\u00d73 of non\u20118 colors (9,3,6) is exactly a CCW\u2011rotation of the original central 3\u00d73.\n  - Differences are only in how some zeros at the edge are handled, but the main operation is clearly CCW rotation of that 5\u00d75 8\u2011block.\n\nSo in all three:\n\n- Pick the unique interior color (1,2,8).\n- Crop its minimal rectangle.\n- Rotate that rectangle 90\u00b0 CCW.\n- That rotated rectangle is the output.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying the rule to the test input\n\n### 2.1. Identify the main color and its rectangle\n\nLook at the test grid\u2019s colors: 0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nNow look for a color that:\n\n- Appears only in a single interior zone.\n- Forms a big rectangular block with other colors embedded.\n\nColor **4** satisfies this:\n\n- All 4\u2019s are confined between rows **5 and 16** and columns **5 and 24**.\n- There are **no 4\u2019s** anywhere outside that 5\u201316 \u00d7 5\u201324 region.\n- Inside that region, 4 is the majority color, with 7\u2019s, 6\u2019s, 8\u2019s, 9\u2019s as decorations.\n\nThus the \u201cmain object\u201d is the 4\u2011block, and its minimal bounding rectangle is:\n\n- Rows: 5 \u2026 16  \u2192  12 rows\n- Columns: 5 \u2026 24 \u2192 20 columns\n\nCall this 12\u00d720 subgrid \\(A\\).

Outside this block there are borders, noise, or other structures that do *not* appear in the output.\n\n   - **Example 1**\n     - Dominant interior color: `1`.\n     - The `1`s form a big rectangle; inside it appear `2`, `3`, `8`, and some `0`s.\n     - If you take the bounding box of all `1` cells (rows 5\u201319, cols 5\u201315) and rotate it 90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise, you get exactly the internal pattern of the output (up to left/right orientation). The output is just that rotated interior; all 6/4/5 borders are gone.\n\n   - **Example 2**\n     - Dominant interior color: `2`.\n     - The `2`s form a clean 10\u00d710 rectangle (rows 7\u201316, cols 5\u201314) containing `4`s and `8`s.\n     - Take this 10\u00d710 region and rotate it **90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise**. That rotated matrix is *exactly* the given 10\u00d710 output (we can verify row by row: `out[i,j] = in[j, 10\u2212i+1]`).\n\n   - **Example 3**\n     - Dominant interior color: `8`.\n     - The `8`s form a compact 5\u00d75 block (rows 6\u201310, cols 5\u20139) that contains `9`, `3`, `6`, plus a couple of zeros on the right edge.\n     - Take that 5\u00d75 block and rotate 90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise: the result is **exactly** the 5\u00d75 output. Every `8`, `9`, `3`, `6`, and `0` lands in the right place.\n\n   So the consistent pattern is:\n\n   > **Find the rectangular region that is the bounding box of the \u201cmain fill color\u201d (1 / 2 / 8), then rotate that rectangle 90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise. That rotated rectangle is the output.**  \n   >\n   > The colors themselves are *not* changed, only their positions via rotation; everything outside that rectangle is discarded.\n\n2. **Identify the main rectangle in the test**\n\n   Look at the test grid:\n\n   - There is a big structured block of `4`s, with many `7`, `6`, `8`, `9`, and some `0`s inside it, in the **upper middle**.\n   - There is also a large block of `3`s in the lower middle, but that `3` block is *uniform* (it doesn\u2019t contain other colors), so it matches the \u201cborder / frame\u201d behavior in the examples, not the decorated interior.\n\n   The `4` region is analogous to:\n\n   - the `1` rectangle in Example 1,\n   - the `2` rectangle in Example 2,\n   - the `8` block in Example 3.\n\n   So we take the bounding box of *all* `4`s.\n\n   Scanning the rows:\n\n   - The first row with any `4` is **row 5**.\n   - The last row with any `4` is **row 16**.\n   - The leftmost `4` is at **column 5**.\n   - The rightmost `4` is at **column 24**.\n\n   So the bounding box of the `4`-block is:\n\n   - Rows 5\u201316 (inclusive) \u2192 12 rows.\n   - Columns 5\u201324 (inclusive) \u2192 20 columns.\n\n   Call this 12\u00d720 subgrid \\(C\\).\n\n   I extracted it explicitly as:\n\n   - Row 1 (original row 5, cols 5\u201324):  \n     `4,7,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,4`\n   - Row 2 (row 6):  \n     `4,7,4,0,0,0,4,4,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,4,7,4,4`\n   - Row 3 (row 7):  \n     `4,7,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,6,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,0`\n   - Row 4 (row 8):  \n     `4,7,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,0`\n   - Row 5 (row 9):  \n     `4,7,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,4`\n   - Row 6 (row 10):  \n     `4,7,4,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,4,7,4,4`\n   - Row 7 (row 11):  \n     `4,7,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,0`\n   - Row 8 (row 12):  \n     `4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,4`\n   - Row 9 (row 13):  \n     `4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4`\n   - Row 10 (row 14):  \n     `4,8,8,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,4`\n   - Row 11 (row 15):  \n     `4,8,8,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,4`\n   - Row 12 (row 16):  \n     `4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4`\n\n3. **Apply the 90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise rotation**\n\n   For an \\(R \\times C\\) matrix \\(C\\) (here \\(R=12\\), \\(C=20\\)), the 90\u00b0 CCW rotation produces a \\(C \\times R\\) matrix \\(O\\) (so 20\u00d712) via:\n\n   \\[\n   O[i][j] = C[j][C - i + 1]\n   \\]\n\n   where:\n\n   - \\(i = 1..C\\) (rows of output),\n   - \\(j = 1..R\\) (columns of output),\n   - indexing \\(C[r][c]\\) is row r, column c in the cropped block.\n\n   Equivalently: for each output row \\(i\\), we fix a column index \\(k = C - i + 1 = 21-i\\) in the cropped block, and read that column \\(k\\) down the rows 1..12.\n\n   Doing this carefully for all 20 output rows yields:\n\n   1.

Interior colors are {2,4,8}. Output uses only {2,4,8}.\n   - Example 3: border uses {0,2,4,5}. Interior colors are {3,6,8,9}. Output uses {0,3,6,8,9}; 0 is just background inside the cropped region.\n   - Example 1: border uses {0,4,5,6}. Interior colors are {1,2,3,8}. Output uses {0,1,2,3,8}.\n\n2. **Crop to the minimal bounding box of the interior colors:**\n   - Among all cells whose color is in the interior-color set S, find:\n     - `top` = smallest row index\n     - `bottom` = largest row index\n     - `left` = smallest column index\n     - `right` = largest column index\n   - Extract the subgrid A defined by rows `top..bottom` and columns `left..right`.\n   - This subgrid can include zeros as background; the crop is driven only by the interior colors.\n\n   In the examples:\n   - Example 2: S={2,4,8}, bounding box is a 10\u00d710 square. Output size is 10\u00d710.\n   - Example 3: S={3,6,8,9}, bounding box is 5\u00d75. Output is 5\u00d75 and matches a 90\u00b0 CCW rotation of that patch exactly.\n   - Example 1: S={1,2,3,8}, bounding box is 15\u00d711, and the given output is a 11\u00d715 rotation of that interior.\n\n3. **Rotate that subgrid 90 degrees counter-clockwise:**\n   - If A has height H and width W, the output B has height W and width H.\n   - Index convention (1-based):\n     - For each output cell `B[r][c]` (1 \u2264 r \u2264 W, 1 \u2264 c \u2264 H),\n       \\[\n       B[r][c] = A[c][W - r + 1]\n       \\]\n     - Equivalently, each row r of the output is column (W\u2212r+1) of A, read from top to bottom.\n   - No additional flipping or scaling is done.\n\n   This exactly reproduces the outputs for Examples 2 and 3; Example 1\u2019s output matches the rotated interior (up to the rotation mapping).\n\nApplying the rule to the test input\n-----------------------------------\n\n### 1. Determine border colors\n\nThe test grid is 29\u00d729.\n\nBorder cells:\n\n- First row (R1): all 2 \u2192 includes color 2.\n- Last row (R29): contains 5, 0, 3.\n- First column (C1): contains 2, 0, 5.\n- Last column (C29): contains 2, 3.\n\nTherefore, **border colors** are: `{0,2,3,5}`.\n\n### 2. Interior colors S\n\nAll colors appearing anywhere in the grid are: {0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.\n\nInterior colors are those not on the border:\n\n- S = `{4,6,7,8,9}`\n\nThese colors only appear in the large \u201ccastle-like\u201d structure in the upper-middle of the grid.\n\n### 3. Bounding box of S\n\nScan for rows and columns where any cell has a color in S:\n\n- First row having any of {4,6,7,8,9}: row 5.\n- Last row having any of {4,6,7,8,9}: row 16.\n  - Rows 17\u201329 have only 0,2,3,5.\n- Leftmost column for S: column 5 (e.g. row 5 col 5 = 4).\n- Rightmost column for S: column 24 (e.g. many 4s/7s/9s reach col 24).\n\nThus the minimal bounding box is:\n\n- Rows 5 to 16 (inclusive) \u2192 H = 12\n- Columns 5 to 24 (inclusive) \u2192 W = 20\n\nCall this 12\u00d720 subgrid A.\n\nFor clarity, A is (rows R5..R16, cols C5..C24):\n\nRow 1 (R5, C5\u2013C24):\n4,7,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,0,0,0,4\n\nRow 2 (R6):\n4,7,4,0,0,0,4,4,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,4,7,4,4\n\nRow 3 (R7):\n4,7,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,6,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,0\n\nRow 4 (R8):\n4,7,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,0\n\nRow 5 (R9):\n4,7,4,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,4\n\nRow 6 (R10):\n4,7,4,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,4,7,4,4\n\nRow 7 (R11):\n4,7,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,0\n\nRow 8 (R12):\n4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,4\n\nRow 9 (R13):\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n\nRow 10 (R14):\n4,8,8,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,4\n\nRow 11 (R15):\n4,8,8,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,9,4,4\n\nRow 12 (R16):\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n\n### 4.

My goal is to transform the input based on a set of rules deduced from a few examples, and I need to be precise.**\n\nFirst, I looked at the dimensions of the input and output grids. They\u2019re different sizes, which hinted at some kind of transformation. Then I checked for simple operations like scaling or cropping. Those weren\u2019t it.  Next, I noticed the presence of borders, made up of specific colors, surrounding a central pattern.  This suggested the transformation might involve isolating that inner region.\n\nAfter a lot of trial and error, a specific pattern emerged. If I extracted a block based on the non-frame colors, and rotated it 90 degrees counter-clockwise (CCW), I got the output.\n\nSo to recap, I found I had to:\n1.  **Identify the frame colors** (these are the colors that usually appear at the grid borders).\n2.  **Identify all the content pixels**: that are NOT a frame color and NOT 0 (background).\n3.  **Find the bounding box** that contains all of the content pixels.\n4.  **Rotate that sub-grid by 90-degrees CCW**.\n\nThat gives us the answer! The trick is not just in any 90-degree rotation, but isolating the meaningful content, with the understanding that 0 may be part of the actual content, and not just the surrounding pattern.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the pattern inferred from the solved examples.\n\n**Inferred Pattern:**\n\n1.  **Identify Frame and Content:**\n    The input grids consist of a \"frame\" or \"border\" made of specific colors (usually found on the outermost edges of the grid) and a \"content\" region inside. The content is composed of pixels with colors different from the frame colors, often including '0' (black) as part of the pattern or background within the content.\n    \n    *Strategy to isolate content:*\n    - Identify the set of \"Frame Colors\" by examining the outermost rows and columns (Row 0, Row H-1, Col 0, Col W-1).\n    - Identify \"Content Pixels\" as those pixels in the grid whose color is *not* in the set of Frame Colors (excluding 0, which is treated as background but part of the content block if surrounded).\n    - Determine the **Bounding Box** of all Content Pixels. This rectangular region defines the input pattern to be transformed.\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    Comparing the extracted content block from the input to the output grid in the examples reveals a consistent geometric transformation.\n    - Example 1: Input content is 15x11. Output is 11x15. The mapping corresponds to a **90-degree Counter-Clockwise Rotation**.\n    - Example 2: Input content (2s, 4s, 8s) is 10x10. Output is 10x10. The pattern is rotated 90 degrees CCW.\n    - Example 3: Input content is 5x5. Output is 5x5. The pattern is rotated 90 degrees CCW.\n\n    *Transformation:* **Rotate the extracted content block 90 degrees Counter-Clockwise.**\n    Mathematically, if the input block has dimensions $H \\times W$ and coordinates $(r, c)$, the output grid has dimensions $W \\times H$ and the pixel at input $(r, c)$ moves to output $(W - 1 - c, r)$.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Frame Colors:**\n    - Top/Bottom rows and Left/Right columns contain colors **2, 5, 3**. (0 is also present but serves as background).\n    - Frame Colors: {2, 3, 5}.\n\n2.  **Extract Content:**\n    - We scan the grid for pixels with colors other than 2, 3, or 5 (and ignoring the outer sea of 0s).\n    - We find colors **4, 7, 6, 8, 9**.\n    - **Bounding Box:**\n        - Top Row: 4 (First occurrence of content colors).\n        - Bottom Row: 15.\n        - Left Column: 4.\n        - Right Column: 23 (The furthest right pixel is a '4' at col 23).\n    - The content block size is **12 rows (height) x 20 columns (width)**.\n\n3.  **Apply Rotation (90 degrees CCW):**\n    - The output grid will have dimensions **20 rows x 12 columns**.\n    - We map the columns of the input block (from right to left) to the rows of the output block (from top to bottom).\n    - Specifically, Input Column 23 becomes Output Row 0. Input Column 22 becomes Output Row 1, ..., Input Column 4 becomes Output Row 19.\n    - Within each column, the pixels are read from top to bottom (Input Row 4 to 15) and written left to right in the output row.\n\n    *Example Trace:*\n    - **Input Column 23 (Rightmost)**: Contains `4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4` (from Row 4 to 15).\n      -> **Output Row 0**: `4,4,0,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4`.\n    - **Input Column 4 (Leftmost)**: Contains `4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4`.\n      -> **Output Row 19**: `4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4`.\n\n    Constructing the full grid using this mapping results in the final output.\n\n4,4,0,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4\n0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n0,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n0,4,4,4,6,6,4,7,4,4,4,4\n4,6,6,6,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n4,6,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n4,6,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n4,6,6,6,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n4,6,6,6,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n6,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n4,6,6,6,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n0,4,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,4,4,4\n0,0,4,4,7,6,4,7,4,9,9,4\n0,0,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n0,0,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n0,0,4,4,7,6,4,7,4,8,8,4\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,8,8,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      4,4,0,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,4\n      0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      0,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n      0,4,4,4,6,6,4,7,4,4,4,4\n      4,6,6,6,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n      4,6,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n      4,6,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n      4,6,6,6,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n      4,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n      4,6,6,6,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n      6,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n      4,6,6,6,6,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n      4,4,4,4,6,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n      0,4,4,4,4,6,4,7,4,4,4,4\n      0,0,4,4,7,6,4,7,4,9,9,4\n      0,0,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,4,4,4\n      0,0,4,4,4,4,4,7,4,9,9,4\n      0,0,4,4,7,6,4,7,4,8,8,4\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,8,8,4\n      4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"6\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_3_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Analysis and Algorithm for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task. The user has given me some examples, and my job is to figure out the pattern or rule that produces the output from the input. I'm focusing on the examples provided. The first thing I'm doing is trying to identify the dimensions of the input and the output. I notice that the input seems to have a larger grid with some kind of structure inside it, almost like a frame around the actual data.\n\nIn the first example, I'm carefully examining the border colors and how they relate to the colors within the enclosed region. It looks like the output is extracting a certain shape from the center, which I'm calling an \"object\". The output's dimensions are also smaller than the input, so I'm thinking there's some kind of cropping, re-sizing, or transformation involved. I'm trying to see if there's a simple, direct mapping between the input and the output or some color swapping.\n\nI'm checking if there's a specific pattern, like sub-grids or tiling, but it seems more like extracting and potentially modifying a key region. I'm taking a close look at the pixel values, and it appears the output is extracting an inner shape. Is the output a direct extract, or is there some transformation? Does the noise/background define the output? I'm re-examining the examples to see if I missed any clues in the first pass. The example 2 uses different colors, and I'm analyzing how these colors are transformed. The inner object seems to be defined by a specific colour, so the starting location might be important.\n\nIn example 2, I notice the left border colour \"3\" seems to identify the starting point of the shape and output shape size matches the inner object within the input. I am checking to see if colour patterns are the same in input and output, and checking if one is the reverse of the other, but it's not a direct match. The swapping of 4 and 8 in Example 2 is peculiar. I go through Example 3 and find the inner object structure is formed by colours 4, 8, 9, 3 and 6, the output contains the colour 8 only. I am exploring the example frame and if any of the corners can identify transformations.\n\nI'm starting to think the border colors might hold the key to understanding the rule. I am re-examining the header rows or columns in the input grids to see if I can find some consistent pattern. In Examples 1 and 3, solid border colour identifies something about the transformation. It looks like there's a color-mapping rule at play, and it's essential to understand it. I am trying to determine if it is a colour-based, column-based or row-based pattern.\n\nI hypothesize that the colour of a solid border is a *control color* that guides the transformation. I am using the solid borders as a way to interpret the key information, and this looks promising. The delimiter, which is a key pixel value is important. I note it is left or right of a block of values.\n\nIn the examples, I see that the object and output have common colours, so it is just one colour changing. The colours may be preserved except for a key color or some noise. From the frame concept, the border pixels may be extracting key information. In example 1, the 4 on right edge of a shape suggests that the `4`s form a control column.\n\nFor some of the examples, the inner block matches and the size is relevant. In the examples, one colour is associated with the corner, and another colour is for other frame borders. I am guessing the border pixels tell us which rows/cols to extract and if there is a mapping.\n\nI'm thinking now, the control color determines the transformation. I can now apply this to the new test input and define a new algorithm. I am looking at the new test input to identify the solid-colored border. I will make sure the transformations are associated with the right borders. After investigating the examples, I believe that there is a rotation involved, based on the delimiter position.\n\nNow, I look at the test input for where the delimiter is located and if there is a similar transformation. The solid borders help with figuring out the transformation involved. I will re-test the examples using a new framework based on these new border ideas. I am checking the colour changes to determine the specific colour changes in each example.\n\nI'm going to formulate a more concrete hypothesis. I believe the data block is to the right of the delimiter (Left Delimiter).\n\nIn this case, it is a Rotate -90 transformation.\nInput becomes the Output.\nI'm going to list a set of new conditions based on the new examples that fit a particular algorithm and re-\n\nBased on the analysis of the examples, the transformation rule is determined by the specific border patterns and \"control\" lines in the input grid. \n\n- **Example 3** shows a clear **Rotate -90 Degrees (Counter-Clockwise)** transformation. The input grid has a control line of 4s on the bottom, a delimiter line of 4s on the left, and the data block starts to the right of this delimiter.\n- **Example 2** shows a **Flip Horizontal** transformation (or potentially a rotation with a flip, but flip horizontal is the simplest fit for the row content). It has a delimiter of 3s on the left.\n- **Example 1** involves a **Rotate +90 Degrees** or **Transpose** with some resizing, indicated by a top border of 4s and a delimiter on the right.\n\nThe **Test Input** shares the most significant structural similarities with **Example 3**:\n1.  **Delimiter Position:** The delimiter line (column 3, containing `2`s) is on the **Left** side of the data block.\n2.  **Data Position:** The data block is to the **Right** of the delimiter.\n3.  **Border Structure:** It has a solid single-color border (Top border of 2s), similar to Example 3's Bottom border of 4s.\n\nGiven these similarities, particularly the Left-side delimiter and Right-side data, the transformation is inferred to be **Rotate -90 Degrees**.

                "response": "**Initial Assessment & Problem Decomposition**\n\nAlright, the task is clear. I've got three training examples and one test case for an ARC problem. My job is to figure out the transformation rule applied to the input grid to get the output grid. I need to understand the pattern using the training data and then apply it to analyze candidate solutions. It's a rotation, but the exact direction and potentially other operations like flips or transposes are unclear. I'll need to break this down.\n\n**Diving into the Training Data**\n\nI\u2019ll begin by carefully examining the first training example. I need to look for any special features: the shape, pixel values, borders, and how their position changes. The initial thought is that the size change implies rotation or Transpose, but which type? 90 degrees CCW (counter-clockwise), CW (clockwise), or even something else? After tracing specific pixel patterns across rows and columns, It looks like 90 CCW is the correct angle. I am going to write down my thoughts as I see them.\n\n**Hypothesis Testing & Validation**\n\nOk, after examining a few more pixels, especially the 8s, I can see that this example is likely a 90 CCW rotation. The output has a transposed dimension to the input. Input (r,c) -> Output (W-1-c, r) seems to be the right mapping, not something flipped.\n\nNow, I'll move on to the second and third examples to see if my hypothesis holds true. It's important to keep verifying. By observing pixel patterns, I confirm my rotation hypothesis through the second and third examples. I'm going to look for any consistent features to support this. I have a lot of numbers in my head.\n\nI had considered transpose, but the rotation seems consistent across all three training sets. I am now confident that the transformation is a 90 CCW rotation of the inner content block, regardless of the outer pixels.\n\n**Test Case Analysis**\n\nI'll now turn my attention to the test input. It looks like it has a similar structure, and I'll need to use my transformation rule to figure out the output grid. Let's see how this works. I will keep in mind my thoughts and the candidate\u2019s grids during my check.\n \nGiven the test input, I will focus on understanding how its pixel values interact. I'll identify the boundary of the inner content and apply the rule I found in the examples (90 CCW). From the data, the inner block is 12x20. Thus, I expect a 20x12 output.\n\n**Candidate Solution Evaluation**\n\nWith the test input understood, I can start examining the candidate solutions. Each candidate's rule and output are evaluated according to 90 CCW transformation. I\u2019m now going to compare each answer against what my understanding.\n\nI'll go through each candidate, checking their rule, grid size, and pixel values. I am going to try to identify the one that best matches the 90 CCW rotation I identified. I'll flag any that have different rules or incorrect pixel values.\n\n**Refinement & Ranking**\n\nI\u2019ve examined all candidates and now need to refine my ranking. Some candidates are a little off. Some may also have grid errors. Some did not correctly understand the rotation. I will rank based on the accuracy of their rule and the similarity of their output grid compared with what I expect.\n\nBased on the rules and grid, I'm going to determine a final ranking. It seems Candidate 0, 3, and 5 have the exact grid content. The explanations are all quite similar, but slight errors are present. Candidate 1 is also good but has some mistakes in the explanation. The majority of candidates implement 90 CCW. Candidates 2, 4, 7 and 8 have invalid transformations. \n\nMy final judgment goes to Candidate 0, 5, and 3. I will make sure the JSON includes the best answer.\n\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 9.5,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Correctly identifies the core transformation as extracting the inner object and rotating it 90 degrees counter-clockwise.
