        "Full raw LLM response": "**The ARC Task: A Flood-Fill with a Twist**\n\nOkay, so the challenge here is to solve an ARC puzzle where we're given some examples and a test input. The task seems to involve transforming a grid where maroon (9) pixels are scattered around, but the core mechanic revolves around a central \"Green Box,\" a 3x3 square composed primarily of green (3) pixels, with a red (2) pixel in the center. Let's break this down.\n\n**Initial Analysis and the \"Magenta Frame\"**\n\nWe've got an orange background (7), and the green box. My first instinct is that there's some kind of rule about collecting the maroon pixels and putting them in the box. Now, the key seems to be the magenta (6) pixels. These form \"rooms\" or enclosures and it looks like a sort of capture mechanism.\n\n**Discovering the Algorithm**\n\nI realized the basic idea is a flood-fill from the green box, moving through any pixels that aren't magenta. Once all reachable maroons are found (within the 3x3 box limit), we count them. That count tells us how many pixels in the Green Box we'll overwrite. If we have 5 maroon pixels, we take the 5.  This explains why the center (the red 2) doesn't always become a maroon.\n\n**Applying the Rules to the Test Input**\n\n1. Locate the Green Box in the test input. It's Rows 4-6, Columns 4-6.\n\n2.  Next, look for any magenta pixels creating walls.\n\n3.  The algorithm then collects any maroon pixels that can be reached from the Green Box without going through a wall.\n\n4.  Calculate the distances to all the valid maroons (BFS).\n\n5.  Here's where it gets interesting: you're capped by the number of box pixels. If there are 12 maroon pixels, but you only have a 3x3 box, you only take the first 9 pixels!\n\n6. Remove from the Grid these pixels, set to the background (7).\n\n7. Then, fill the green box with these maroons in order.\n\n**Applying this to the Input**\n\nWe've located the Box and we have the reachability. Now, let's look at the example input.\n\nWe need to calculate the distance of each 9 and start collecting based on path length and box constraints. We calculate each distance from the Green Box. And at last, we start moving. We will collect only a certain number of pixels, per the above.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the grid by moving \"noise\" pixels (maroon, 9) into a specific \"container\" object (a green box with a red center). Based on the examples, the transformation follows these rules:\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Container:** Locate the 3x3 box composed of green (3) pixels with a central red (2) pixel.\n2.  **Determine Reachability:** Identify all maroon (9) pixels in the grid that are \"reachable\" from this green box. Movement is allowed horizontally and vertically (4-way connectivity) through \"permeable\" pixels.\n    *   **Permeable pixels:** Background (7), Green (3), Red (2), and Maroon (9).\n    *   **Blocking pixels:** Magenta (6) acts as a wall.\n    *   The examples show that 9s inside closed magenta enclosures are not collected if the box cannot reach them. Conversely, if the box is in a magenta tube open at one end, 9s accessible from that opening are collected.\n3.  **Collect and Limit:** Calculate the number of reachable 9s. Let this number be $N$. The capacity of the 3x3 container is 9 pixels. We collect the reachable 9s, prioritizing those closest to the box (Breadth-First Search distance), up to a maximum of 9.\n4.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The collected 9s are removed from their original positions (replaced by the background color 7).\n    *   The 3x3 Green Box is filled with the collected 9s in reading order (row by row, left to right).\n    *   If $N < 9$, the remaining pixels in the box (3s and 2) stay as they are.\n    *   If $N \\ge 9$, the entire box becomes 9s (including the center). Any reachable 9s beyond the count of 9 remain in their original positions.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Green Box:** Located at Rows 4-6, Columns 4-6.\n2.  **Reachability Analysis:**\n    *   **Walls:** There is a magenta (6) structure.\n    *   **Exits:** The box has two openings: one at the top (Row 3, Col 5) and one at the bottom (Row 7, Col 6).\n    *   **Reachable 9s (BFS order approx):**\n        *   **Close (via R7C6):** (10,4), (10,6).\n        *   **Close (via R3C5):** (1,2), (3,2), (1,10), (3,10).\n        *   **Medium (via left/right paths):** (7,2), (7,10).\n        *   **Far (via extended left path):** (10,0).\n        *   **Further (remaining left cluster):** (10,1), (10,2).\n    *   **Unreachable 9s:**\n        *   (0,4), (0,6): Inside a closed top enclosure (Row 1 C3-7 is a solid wall).\n        *   (10,8), (10,9), (10,10): Inside a closed bottom-right pocket (isolated by walls at R7-9, C7-9).\n3.  **Collection (Max 9):**\n    *   We collect the closest 9 reachable 9s.\n    *   The set includes: (10,4), (10,6), (1,2), (3,2), (1,10), (3,10), (7,2), (7,10), (10,0).\n    *   Total Collected = 9.\n    *   Remaining reachable 9s (excess): (10,1), (10,2).\n4.  **Output Generation:**\n    *   **Fill Box:** The box (R4-6, C4-6) is completely filled with 9s.\n    *   **Clear Collected:** Change the collected 9s listed above to 7s.\n    *   **Preserve Others:** Keep unreachable 9s and excess reachable 9s as 9.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n*   Row 0: `7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7` (Unreachable 9s stay).\n*   Row 1: `7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7` (9s at C2, C10 removed).\n*   Row 2: `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7`\n*   Row 3: `6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7` (9s at C2, C10 removed).\n*   Row 4: `7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7` (Box filled).\n*   Row 5: `7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6` (Box filled).\n*   Row 6: `7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7` (Box filled).\n*   Row 7: `6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7` (9s at C2, C10 removed).\n*   Row 8: `7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7`\n*   Row 9: `7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6`\n*   Row 10: `7,9,9,6,7,7,7,6,9,9,9` (C0, C4, C6 removed.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Rule Development for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where the goal is to transform grids containing integers 0-9.  I need to infer the transformation rules from a few examples and apply it to a test grid. The output should be a grid where I detail my process.\n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n\n*   **Input Grids:** The input grids seem to contain mainly orange (7) pixels and scattered \"maroon\" (9) pixels. There's a central structure, usually a block of green (3) pixels with a red (2) center, often enclosed by magenta (6) borders.\n*   **Initial Hypothesis:** The initial guess is some sort of movement or collection rule for the \"maroon\" (9) pixels, maybe based on their proximity to the central structure.\n\n**Examining the Examples**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   I start by looking at changes to the central structure's area.  Input has a green 3x3 with a central 2. Output sees two of those greens swapped for 9s from somewhere.\n    *   I look at the areas immediately surrounding and notice the Maroons.  It seems the Maroons within the magenta-bound area move into the green box.\n    *   I confirm this by counting the maroon pixels and comparing them to the changes. My hypothesis is strengthened by comparing coordinates of specific maroon pixels in the input and output grids.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   This has a bigger magenta structure enclosing a reservoir of maroon pixels. My assumption is that the maroon pixels inside the structure are pulled into the green 3x3 block on the upper part.\n    *   I try to trace the magenta borders and the distribution of maroon (9) pixels inside and outside. I find the 9s *outside* of what I consider to be \"the structure\" don't move.\n    *   I see a pattern: the *number* of maroon pixels inside the magenta structure is the amount of the green box is replaced by 9. However, it seems the entire green box is replaced by 9s, so it must use a different rule.\n    *   I attempt to verify what maroon pixels are adjacent to 6s, and come up with the hypothesis that this might be the rule.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   There are *no* magenta walls here.  The green box still exists in the center, and there are maroon pixels throughout the grid. My hypothesis that the absence of a defined structure, *all* maroons move into the central green area.\n    *   So, a more generalized rule is emerging.\n\n**Refining the Rule**\n\n*   **Structure:**\n    *   It seems the magenta lines act as walls defining the structure.\n    *   With no walls, the \"structure\" is simply the green box itself.\n*   **Target Maroons:**\n    *   Maroon pixels \"inside\" the structure are the ones to be moved.\n    *   With no structure, *all* Maroons are Targets.\n*   **Movement:**  These Target Maroons are moved and overwrite the pixels inside the green 3x3 box, starting from the top-left and moving across rows. The 2 in the center seems to get overwritten if there are enough 9s.\n*   **Distance/Connectivity:** I start exploring if distance to the Green box matters.\n\n**Testing the Rule**\n\n*   **Verifying Examples:**  I meticulously re-examine the examples. It looks as if the shape of the Magenta lines determines if any maroon pixel is moved, based on 4-way connections. Any maroon pixel connected to the green box gets replaced with 9. I check the boundary on both sides and determine a maroon outside the boundary should remain the same.\n*   **Flood Fill Approach:** Based on this, I come up with a clearer rule: \"Do a flood fill from the green box, only moving through orange and maroons, and stop at magenta walls. Any maroons reachable in that fill are moved to the green box.\" This \"Connectivity\" becomes the key.\n\n**Application to Test Input**\n\n1.  **Analyze Test Grid:** The test grid's structure is a combination of central green pixels inside a Magenta structure with multiple openings and walls.\n2.  **Flood Fill:** I perform a flood-fill from the green box area. The central green block is linked to both the top and the bottom parts of the grid.\n3.  **Identify Target Maroons:** Based on my flood fill, I can now identify the maroon pixels that are reachable from the Green Box.\n4.  **Count:** Calculate geodesic distance.\n5.  **Move & Output:** The reachable maroon pixels are moved into the green box area. Remaining\n\nTo solve this task, I will apply the \"Reachable 9s Flood Fill\" logic derived from the examples.\n\n**Logic Explanation:**\n1.  **Identify the Sink:** The central 3x3 box containing Green (3) and Red (2) pixels. In the test input, this is at Rows 4-6, Cols 4-6.\n2.  **Identify Connectivity:** The Magenta (6) pixels act as walls. The Orange (7) and Maroon (9) pixels are permeable space. We perform a flood fill starting from the Sink to find all \"Reachable\" Maroon (9) pixels.\n    *   **Connectivity Analysis for Test Input:**\n        *   The Sink connects **Up** via (3,5) into Row 2, which grants access to the top region (Rows 0-3).\n        *   The Sink connects **Down** via (7,6) into Row 8.\n        *   **Top Region:** From Row 2, we can reach 9s at (0,4), (0,6), (1,2), (1,10), (3,2), (3,10).\n        *   **Bottom Region:** The path down leads to the bottom center. We can reach 9s at (10,4) and (10,6).\n        *   **Left Region:** There is a path from the Top Region down the left side (Col 0) to reach the 9 at (7,2) and the cluster at (10,0-2). However, this path is long.\n        *   **Right Region:** The bottom-right corner (Rows 7-10, Cols 8-10) is isolated by walls in Rows 5, 7, and 9. The 9s there are unreachable.\n3.  **Prioritize by Distance:** The Sink has a capacity of 9 slots (3x3). We found more than 9 reachable 9s (12 total). We fill the slots with the 9s that are *geodesically closest* to the Sink.\n    *   **Closest (High Priority):**\n        *   Top Cluster: (0,4), (0,6), (1,2), (3,2), (1,10), (3,10). (6 pixels)\n        *   Bottom Center Cluster: (10,4), (10,6). (2 pixels)\n    *   **Next Closest:**\n        *   (7,2) is reachable via the left path. It is the closest of the far group. (1 pixel)\n    *   **Farthest (Low Priority - Will Stay):**\n        *   (10,0), (10,1), (10,2). These are further down the path past (7,2).\n4.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The 9 slots in the Sink are filled with 9s (replacing the 3s and 2).\n    *   The 9 selected \"source\" pixels ((0,4), (0,6), (1,2), (3,2), (1,10), (3,10), (10,4), (10,6), (7,2)) are changed from 9 to 7.\n    *   All other pixels remain unchanged.\n\n**Final Grid Construction:**\n*   **Moved to Sink (Become 7):** (0,4), (0,6), (1,2), (1,10), (3,2), (3,10), (7,2), (10,4), (10,6).\n*   **Stay as 9:** (10,0), (10,1), (10,2) [Far], (4,10) [Actually a 7 in input], (7,10) [Unreachable], (10,8), (10,9), (10,10) [Unreachable].\n*   **Sink (4,4) to (6,6):** All become 9.\n\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n9,9,9,6,7,7,7,6,9,9,9",

        "Full raw LLM response": "I'll describe a simple transformation rule that is consistent with the *pattern seen in the changed region* (the 3\u00d73 \u201cobject\u201d), and then apply it to the test grid.\n\n### 1. Interpreted rule (local to the 3\u00d73 object)\n\nAcross the three examples, the part that always changes in a regular way is the 3\u00d73 block of `3`s around a central `2`:\n\n- That 3\u00d73 block is always located somewhere near the middle of the grid; in all provided cases it is at rows 5\u20137 and columns 5\u20137.\n- Some of the `3`s (and sometimes the center `2`) inside that 3\u00d73 block are turned into `9`s.\n- Within the 3\u00d73 block, the `9`s are always placed in a fixed **row-major order from the top-left**:\n  1. (top row) (r5,c5), (r5,c6), (r5,c7)\n  2. (middle row) (r6,c5), (r6,c6), (r6,c7)\n  3. (bottom row) (r7,c5), (r7,c6), (r7,c7)\n- The number of `9`s placed there equals the number of `9`s that are \u201ctaken\u201d from somewhere else; in examples, those `9`s are then removed (set to background `7`). The total count of `9`s is conserved.\n\nA simple, reproducible version of this idea that we can apply to the test is:\n\n1. Identify the central 3\u00d73 block (rows 5\u20137, cols 5\u20137).\n2. Decide how many `9`s to place inside it (call this number `K`).\n3. Fill the first `K` positions of that 3\u00d73 in row\u2011major order with `9`.\n4. Replace `K` `9`s elsewhere (taken from some chosen region; for the test we\u2019ll use the bottom row) with `7` so that the overall number of `9`s stays the same.\n5. Leave all other cells unchanged.\n\nFor the test grid, I\u2019ll take `K` equal to the number of `9`s in the bottom row (8), and use those 8 as the source `9`s to be \u201cpulled into\u201d the 3\u00d73.\n\n### 2. Apply the rule to the test input\n\n**Test input (for reference):**\n\nRow1:  7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7  \nRow2:  7,7,9,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,9  \nRow3:  7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \nRow4:  6,6,9,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,9  \nRow5:  7,7,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,7,7  \nRow6:  7,6,6,6,3,2,3,6,7,6,6  \nRow7:  7,7,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,7,7  \nRow8:  6,6,9,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,9  \nRow9:  7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7  \nRow10: 7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6  \nRow11: 9,9,9,6,9,7,9,6,9,9,9  \n\n#### 2.1. Count and remove source `9`s (bottom row)\n\nBottom row (row 11) has 8 `9`s at columns:\n\n- (11,1), (11,2), (11,3), (11,5), (11,7), (11,9), (11,10), (11,11)\n\nSet those 8 cells to `7`:\n\nRow11 becomes:  \n`7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7`\n\nWe now have `K = 8` `9`s to place in the central 3\u00d73.\n\n#### 2.2. Fill the central 3\u00d73 block in row-major order\n\nCentral 3\u00d73 before change (rows 5\u20137, cols 5\u20137):\n\nRow5:  (5,5\u20137): 3,3,3  \nRow6:  (6,5\u20137): 3,2,3  \nRow7:  (7,5\u20137): 3,3,3  \n\nRow\u2011major order of its 9 positions:\n\n1. (5,5)  \n2. (5,6)  \n3. (5,7)  \n4. (6,5)  \n5. (6,6)  \n6. (6,7)  \n7. (7,5)  \n8. (7,6)  \n9. (7,7)\n\nWe have `K = 8` tokens, so we set the first 8 of these to `9`, leaving the last one as it was:\n\n- (5,5) \u2190 9\n- (5,6) \u2190 9\n- (5,7) \u2190 9\n- (6,5) \u2190 9\n- (6,6) \u2190 9  (overwriting the original 2)\n- (6,7) \u2190 9\n- (7,5) \u2190 9\n- (7,6) \u2190 9\n- (7,7) remains 3\n\nSo rows 5\u20137 become:\n\nRow5:  7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7  \nRow6:  7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6  \nRow7:  7,7,7,6,9,9,3,6,7,7,7  \n\nAll other rows stay as in input, except the modified row11.\n\n### 3.

        "Full raw LLM response": "First I\u2019ll lay out the reasoning I *can* extract, then I\u2019ll give the concrete output grid.\n\n---\n\n## Reasoning\n\nWe have a recurring structure in all training examples:\n\n- Background: mostly color `7`.\n- A central \u201cplus\u201d motif of color `3` with a center `2`:\n\n  ```\n  3 3 3\n  3 2 3\n  3 3 3\n  ```\n\n- Several `9` cells scattered around.\n\nFrom the examples we can see two stable facts:\n\n1. The central 3\u00d73 \u201cplus\u201d region is always the *only* place where 3\u2019s and the single 2 appear.\n2. In the outputs, some of these 3/2 cells turn into 9\u2019s in a very specific order: always starting at the top-left corner of the 3\u00d73 block, then going left-to-right, top-to-bottom (\u201creading order\u201d).\n\nConcretely, label the 3\u00d73 plus bounding box relative to the grid as:\n\n- Top row:    (r\u2080, c\u2080), (r\u2080, c\u2080+1), (r\u2080, c\u2080+2)\n- Middle row: (r\u2080+1, c\u2080), (r\u2080+1, c\u2080+1), (r\u2080+1, c\u2080+2)\n- Bottom row: (r\u2080+2, c\u2080), (r\u2080+2, c\u2080+1), (r\u2080+2, c\u2080+2)\n\nThe examples show:\n\n- Example 1: 2 cells in this block become 9\u2019s: the first two in reading order \u2192 positions (r\u2080,c\u2080) and (r\u2080,c\u2080+1).\n- Example 2: all 9 cells in this block become 9\u2019s \u2192 full 3\u00d73 of 9\u2019s.\n- Example 3: 4 cells become 9\u2019s: the first four in reading order \u2192 (r\u2080,c\u2080), (r\u2080,c\u2080+1), (r\u2080,c\u2080+2), (r\u2080+1,c\u2080).\n\nSo:\n- The number of newly placed 9\u2019s inside the plus, call it `K`, varies between examples.\n- Once `K` is determined, **which** cells in the plus get 9\u2019s is always the same prefix order (reading order) of length `K`.\n\nDetermining `K` exactly from the three examples is nontrivial; multiple features of the 9-distribution change, and the training set is too small to pin down a unique robust rule. However, a simple, consistent way to construct a transformation is:\n\n- Erase all original 9\u2019s in the grid (turn them to 7).\n- Let `K = min(total_number_of_original_9s, 9)`.\n- In the 3\u00d73 plus bounding box, change the first `K` cells in reading order to color 9 (overwriting 3 or 2).\n- Leave all other non-9 colors (6,3,2,7) unchanged.\n\nThis rule:\n- Always preserves the recognizable 3\u00d73 central motif, now partially or fully filled with 9\u2019s.\n- Ensures that the number of placed 9\u2019s in/around the plus reflects the overall amount of original 9\u2019s (capped at 9).\n- Produces a deterministic output for the test case.\n\nApplying this to the **test**:\n\n1. Count 9\u2019s in the input:\n\n   Positions of 9\u2019s:\n   - Row 1: (1,5), (1,7)\n   - Row 2: (2,3), (2,11)\n   - Row 4: (4,3), (4,11)\n   - Row 8: (8,3), (8,11)\n   - Row 11: (11,1),(11,2),(11,3),(11,5),(11,7),(11,9),(11,10),(11,11)\n\n   Total = 16.\n\n   So `K = min(16, 9) = 9`.\n\n2. Identify the 3\u00d73 plus bounding box:\n\n   In the test, the plus has center `2` at row 6, col 6, with 3\u2019s around it:\n\n   - Rows 5\u20137, Cols 5\u20137:\n\n     ```\n     r5: c5,c6,c7 = 3,3,3\n     r6: c5,c6,c7 = 3,2,3\n     r7: c5,c6,c7 = 3,3,3\n     ```\n\n   So the 3\u00d73 bounding box is rows 5\u20137, columns 5\u20137.\n\n3. Place 9\u2019s into plus bounding, first 9 cells in reading order:\n\n   Reading order for these 9 positions:\n\n   - (5,5), (5,6), (5,7),\n   - (6,5), (6,6), (6,7),\n   - (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)\n\n   Since `K = 9`, all 9 of these get set to 9.\n\n4. Turn *all* original 9\u2019s outside the plus to 7.\n\nCarry this out cell-by-cell below.\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\nApplying the above rule to the test input yields:\n\n- Row 1: original `7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7`  \n  \u2192 9\u2019s at c5,c7 \u2192 7 \u2192 `7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7`\n\n- Row 2: `7,7,9,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,9`  \n  \u2192 c3,c11 \u2192 7 \u2192 `7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7`\n\n- Row 3: unchanged `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7`\n\n- Row 4: `6,6,9,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,9`  \n  \u2192 c3,c11 \u2192 7 \u2192 `6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7`\n\n- Row 5: `7,7,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,7,7`  \n  \u2192 plus area c5\u20137 \u2192 `9,9,9` \u2192 `7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7`\n\n- Row 6: `7,6,6,6,3,2,3,6,7,6,6`  \n  \u2192 plus area c5\u20137 \u2192 `9,9,9` \u2192 `7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6`\n\n- Row 7: `7,7,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,7,7`  \n  \u2192 plus area c5\u20137 \u2192 `9,9,9` \u2192 `7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7`\n\n- Row 8: `6,6,9,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,9`  \n  \u2192 c3,c11 \u2192 7 \u2192 `6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7`\n\n- Row 9: unchanged `7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7`\n\n- Row 10: unchanged `7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6`\n\n- Row 11: `9,9,9,6,9,7,9,6,9,9,9`  \n  \u2192 all 9\u2019s to 7 \u2192 `7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7`\n\nSo the completed **output grid** is:\n\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7  \n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7  \n7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6  \n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7  \n6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7  \n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7  \n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6  \n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7",

        "Full raw LLM response": "The three examples show that only two kinds of changes ever occur: some existing 9s are turned into 7s, and an equal number of cells in the central 3\u00d73 block of 3s/2 are turned into 9s starting from the top\u2011left of the block in row\u2011major order. The total number of 9s is preserved.\n\nThe pattern that explains which 9s are \u201cmoved\u201d is to treat the cells with colour 6 as walls and compute reachability and distance from the 3\u00d73 block. Starting from all nine cells of the block as sources, perform a 4\u2011connected flood\u2011fill through non\u20116 cells. This gives the set of reachable 9s and their shortest path distances. Remove (set to 7) the reachable 9s in order of increasing distance until either you run out of reachable 9s or you have moved nine of them (the size of the block). Place the same number of 9s into the block cells in row\u2011major order.\n\nOn the test grid there are 16 nines; the two at (1,5) and (1,7) are isolated by surrounding 6s and are unreachable from the block. Fourteen are reachable; the nine closest (at (2,3), (4,3), (11,5), (2,11), (4,11), (11,7), (8,3), (8,11), (11,1)) are removed and the 3\u00d73 block is completely filled with 9s. The remaining seven 9s stay in place.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,9,9,6,7,7,7,6,9,9,9",

If there is at least one `9` that does have a `9` neighbour (i.e. any multi\u2011cell `9` cluster exists), add one more. Cap the resulting number at 9, because the block has nine cells. This gives the number `K` of `9`\u2019s to move.\n\n3. Choose which `9`\u2019s to move: list all `9` positions sorted by row from bottom to top and, within each row, by column from left to right. Prefer positions not in the last column; only take from the last column if there aren\u2019t enough elsewhere to reach `K`. Take the first `K` positions from this ordered list. Set those grid cells to the background colour `7`.\n\n4. Fill the 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 block in row\u2011major order from its top\u2011left with `K` `9`\u2019s, overwriting the original `3`/`2` values; if `K` is 9 the whole block becomes `9`.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n- There are 10 isolated `9`\u2019s and other clustered `9`\u2019s, so `K = min(9,10+1) = 9`.\n- The first nine `9`\u2019s in the bottom\u2011up order excluding the last column are at `(11,1),(11,2),(11,3),(11,5),(11,7),(11,9),(11,10),(8,3),(4,3)`; these are set to `7`.\n- The 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 block at rows\u202f5\u20137, cols\u202f5\u20137 is filled entirely with `9`.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,9,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,9\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,9",
