        "Full raw LLM response": "**Solving the ARC Task: My Thought Process**\n\nAlright, I'm diving into this ARC task. The user wants me to crack a pattern based on examples and a test input. Let's see...\n\nI start with Example 1, a 30x30 grid with a weird structure at the bottom right.  It's got some colors: blue, red, yellow, and gray.  I try to break down the non-black pixels, focusing on their arrangement.  Looks like vertical towers, some \"behind\" others. The output, a 3x6 grid, seems *way* smaller, a real head-scratcher.\n\nThe gray pixels grab my attention. In ARC, they're often a \"selector\" or a \"mask.\"  I pinpoint the coordinates of these gray pixels. It looks like they outline a rectangle! Hey! The output's dimensions perfectly match the dimensions defined by those gray pixels, a 3x6 rectangle.\n\nThen the red pixels in the input catches my eye. If I look to the left, I find that a red \"E-shape\" or a \"U shape on its side\", spanning a bounding box that's wider than it is high. The output is all red, but it doesn't look like any of the shapes in the input.\n\nIt's all about that gray region. Now, let's look for a deeper pattern! I think. The gray pixels are pointing me at the right horizontal and vertical spans:\nRow 26, Cols 19-24, looks like 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0.\nRow 27, 5,0,0,0,5.\nRow 28, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5,5.\n\nBut the output is all red! Maybe the gray pixels are an instruction, telling me *where* to look. Or maybe they are instructing me to *transform* the pattern I see around the pixels to the left. I start noticing some width-based objects to the left:\nBlue width is 5\nYellow is 4\nRed is 3\nGray area is width 6.\nSo it is some sort of width-based sequence, leading to the gray region. And the color matches the sequence: 2,4,1,2. Ah, ha! I think I've got it.\n\nOkay, let's test it on Example 2. It has gray markers at the top and bottom of a long region. This is likely an indication I need to horizontally continue a pattern to the region specified by the gray marker. And, that's what seems to happen!\n\nNow, Example 3, has a diagonal pattern with 7s, 2s, and 3s. There are gray markers that tell me what the pattern at the end of the input will be. It's essentially extending the pattern by one iteration, which is the sequence 7, 2, 3...\nSo the pattern seems to be: extend the sequence to the target region.\n\nTest input time!  The new input has a bunch of \"5\" pixels in it, defining the target, and I need to figure out what it's supposed to look like based on the previous objects.\n\nI map the sequence from above into this new test input, and I construct a final result! \n\n\nThe problem asks us to solve an ARC task where we must infer a transformation rule from examples and apply it to a test input.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Example 1:** The input contains several colored \"objects\" (Red, Yellow, Blue) arranged horizontally. A box defined by gray (5) pixels appears to the right of the sequence. The output grid matches the dimensions of this gray box. The content of the output is a Red (2) shape.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The objects form a sequence.\n        *   Red object (width 3).\n        *   Yellow object (width 4).\n        *   Blue object (width 5).\n        *   The gray box has width 6.\n        *   The sequence of widths is 3, 4, 5, -> 6.\n        *   The sequence of colors is 2, 4, 1. If this cycles (2, 4, 1, 2...), the next color is 2.\n        *   The output is a generated object of color 2 and width 6, following the morphological pattern of the previous objects (top/bottom full, middle row ends-only).\n\n2.  **Example 2:** The input contains a repeating background pattern of vertical columns. Two gray markers define a rectangular region. The output matches the size of this region and contains the continuation of the background pattern (colors 9, 8, 4) that would logically exist in that space.\n\n3.  **Example 3:** The input contains a diagonal/wave pattern of objects (7, 2, 3...). A gray box defines a target region. The output is filled with the pattern of the object (7) that logically belongs in that column based on the horizontal sequence (7, 2, 3, 7, 2, -> 3, -> 7).\n\n**General Rule:**\nThe gray pixels define a **target region**. The task is to identify the underlying pattern or sequence of objects in the grid (extrapolating position, size, color, and shape) and generate the content that should logically fill that target region.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Identify Target Region:**\n    *   Gray pixels (5) are found in Row 11 (cols 7, 8, 27) and Row 12 (cols 7, 27, 28).\n    *   These mark the corners of a rectangular region from **Row 11 to Row 12** and **Column 7 to Column 28**.\n    *   Output dimensions: Height 2, Width 22.\n\n2.  **Analyze Grid Patterns:**\n    *   The grid consists of horizontal layers of objects.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom, Rows 26-28):** Pink (6) objects. Centers are at x = ..., 14.5, 19.5, ... (Interleaved positions).\n    *   **Layer 2 (Rows 22-24):** Yellow (4) objects. Centers are at x = 7, 12, 17, 22, 27 (Aligned positions).\n    *   **Layer 3 (Rows 18-20):** Pink (6) objects. Interleaved.\n    *   **Layer 4 (Rows 14-16):** Yellow (4) objects. Aligned.\n    *   **Layer 5 (Target, Rows 10-12):** This continues the vertical sequence.\n    *   **Sequence:** Pink, Yellow, Pink, Yellow, -> **Pink**.\n    *   Therefore, the target region should contain **Pink (6)** objects.\n\n3.  **Determine Object Properties:**\n    *   **Position:** Pink objects in this grid are \"interleaved\", meaning they are centered halfway between the Yellow objects. Yellow centers are 7, 12, 17, 22, 27 (gap 5). Pink centers are 4.5, 9.5, 14.5, 19.5, 24.5, 29.5.\n    *   **Vertical Alignment:** The layers are separated by 1 row of zeros. Layer 4 is 14-16. Layer 5 (Target) is 10-12.\n    *   **Shape:** Based on Pink objects in layers 1 and 3:\n        *   **Top Row:** Width 2 centered.\n        *   **Middle Row:** Width 4 centered (Indices: center-1.5 to center+1.5).\n        *   **Bottom Row:** \"Legs\" at the edges. Indices: [center-2.5, center-1.5] and [center+1.5, center+2.5]. Note that legs of adjacent objects merge (e.g., right leg of 9.5 and left leg of 14.5 overlap/touch).\n\n4.  **Generate Output:**\n    *   The target region (Rows 11-12) corresponds to the **Middle** and **Bottom** rows of the Pink objects (since the full object is height 3, occupying rows 10-12).\n    *   We need to fill the output (2 x 22) with the Middle and Bottom rows of Pink objects centered at 9.5, 14.5, 19.5, 24.5, and the edges of objects at 4.5 and 29.5 if they overlap.\n    *   **Row 0 (Middle Row):**\n        *   Objects are 4 pixels wide (e.g., center 9.5 spans 8-11).\n        *   Cols 8-11, 13-16, 18-21, 23-26, 28-31.\n        *   Mapped to output cols (grid col - 7):\n            *   Grid 8-11 -> Out 1-4.\n            *   Grid 13-16 -> Out 6-9.\n            *   Grid 18-21 -> Out 11-14.\n            *   Grid 23-26 -> Out 16-19.\n            *   Grid 28 -> Out 21.\n    *   **Row 1 (Bottom Row):**\n        *   Legs span 2 pixels at outer edges (e.g., center 9.5 has legs 7-8 and 11-12).\n        *   Adjacent legs merge/touch (e.g., 11-12 and 12-13 create a block 11-13).\n        *   Resulting pattern segments (Grid indices):\n            *   (4.5 Right Leg 6-7 + 9.5 Left Leg 7-8) -> **7, 8** are filled.\n            *   (9.5 Right Leg 11-12 + 14.5 Left Leg 12-13) -> **11, 12, 13** are filled.\n            *   (14.5 Right + 19.5 Left) -> **16, 17, 18** filled.\n            *   (19.5 Right + 24.5 Left) -> **21, 22, 23** filled.\n            *   (24.5 Right + 29.5 Left) -> **26, 27, 28** filled.\n        *   Mapped to output cols:\n            *   Grid 7-8 -> Out 0-1.\n            *   Grid 11-13 -> Out 4-6.\n            *   Grid 16-18 -> Out 9-11.\n            *   Grid 21-23 -> Out 14-16.\n            *   Grid 26-28 -> Out 19-21.\n\noutput:\n0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Summary of my reasoning for solving the ARC task:**\n\nThe task involves deciphering a pattern generation rule from examples, particularly focusing on how to generate an output grid based on a given input and \"key\" markers.  My process involved a deep dive into the examples, starting with a meticulous examination of the input and output structures. I began by analyzing the given examples, noting key features such as grid size, color distributions, and repeating shapes.\n\nMy initial hypothesis centered around identifying recurring patterns and how they might relate to the \"key\" elements, specifically the elements marked by 5s. I observed that the 5s, appearing as pairs or small clusters, seemed to define a bounding box or region within the input grid. I also noticed that the output grid\u2019s size often correlated with the dimensions defined by these 5s.\n\nThrough careful comparison of multiple examples, I formulated a core idea: the task is to predict the \"next\" element in a horizontal sequence of patterns. The process involves identifying a repeating vertical structure in the input, a specific pattern and position, and using the \"key\" (5-clusters) to select the correct pattern and generate the output. It seemed as though the \"key\" acted as a pointer, indicating a region or a source for the output pattern.\n\nThe analysis revealed that the output was constructed through either scaling or tiling a portion of an identified input pattern to fit the dimensions indicated by the 5s. I carefully analyzed how the key marker corresponded to the width of the repeating elements. I also had to trace the repeating sequences with great accuracy, including gaps and offsets. I verified the vertical patterns across multiple examples to determine if the pattern would be stretched or tiled.\n\nIn the test case, I identified the sequence (pattern sequence 4s and 6s), the marker, and determined that the output grid needed to tile the horizontal period to generate the output shape, based on the principle to replicate the \"next element\" in the pattern using the parameters of the key. I had to reconstruct each row carefully and map it into the output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to fill a specific region (indicated by grey '5' markers) with a pattern derived from the existing sequences in the grid.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Example 1:** A sequence of colored shapes with increasing widths (2, 3, 4, 5) is followed by a region defined by '5's with width 6. The sequence of colors is Blue, Red, Yellow, Blue. The cycle is 1, 2, 4. The next term should be Red (2). The solution stretches the Red pattern (width 3) to fit the target width (6).\n2.  **Example 2:** A vertical sequence of tower tops matches the output. The region defined by '5's is below the existing towers. The output corresponds to continuing the sequence of rows found above, in reverse order (mirroring) or simply extending the pattern downwards.\n3.  **Example 3:** A horizontal sequence of towers (7, 2, 3, 7, 2) with constant spacing. The '5's mark a region at the position where the next tower (3) would be, but the marker position skips one cycle, aligning with the recurrence of '7'. The output is the '7' tower pattern.\n\n**Analysis of Test Input:**\n1.  **Target Region:** The '5' markers in rows 12 and 13 define a bounding box from column 7 to column 28 (Width 22, Height 2).\n2.  **Vertical Sequence:** There is a repeating vertical sequence of \"triangular\" shapes.\n    *   Rows 15-17: 4s (Magenta)\n    *   Rows 19-21: 6s (Pink)\n    *   Rows 23-25: 4s (Magenta)\n    *   Rows 27-29: 6s (Pink)\n    The sequence is alternating 4s and 6s.\n    We are predicting the pattern for rows 11-13 (just above the 4s at 15).\n    Following the pattern backwards (4, 6, 4, 6 ...), the shape at row 11 should be **6s**.\n3.  **Shape Geometry:** The 6-shape (Pink) is a triangle spanning 3 rows.\n    *   Top (Row 1): `6 6` (Width 2).\n    *   Middle (Row 2): `6 6 6 6` (Width 4).\n    *   Bottom (Row 3): `6 6 0 0 6 6` (Width 6, with a central gap). Note: At the intersections of repeating units, the edges merge.\n    Our target region is rows 12-13. If the shape starts at row 11, row 12 is the Middle and row 13 is the Bottom.\n4.  **Horizontal Tiling:** The shapes repeat horizontally with a period of 5 columns.\n    *   Starts for 4s (R15): Cols 5, 9, 14, 19, 24.\n    *   Starts for 6s (R19): Cols 9, 14, 19...\n    We align our predicted 6s with these columns (9, 14, 19, 24).\n    *   **Row 1 of Output (Middle of Triangle):** Blocks of `6 6 6 6` centered at these locations.\n    *   **Row 2 of Output (Bottom of Triangle):** Blocks of `6 6 0 0 6 6` centered at these locations. Overlapping edges merge (e.g., right `6 6` of one unit overlaps with left `6 6` of the next).\n\n**Construction:**\n*   **Row 1 (Middle):**\n    *   Unit at 9: `6 6 6 6` at cols 8-11.\n    *   Unit at 14: `6 6 6 6` at cols 13-16.\n    *   Unit at 19: `6 6 6 6` at cols 18-21.\n    *   Unit at 24: `6 6 6 6` at cols 23-26.\n    *   Result: `0, 6,6,6,6, 0, 6,6,6,6, 0, 6,6,6,6, 0, 6,6,6,6, 0, 0`\n*   **Row 2 (Bottom):**\n    *   Unit at 9: `6 6 0 0 6 6` at cols 7-12.\n    *   Unit at 14: `6 6 0 0 6 6` at cols 12-17. (Overlap at 12).\n    *   Unit at 19: `6 6 0 0 6 6` at cols 17-22. (Overlap at 17).\n    *   Unit at 24: `6 6 0 0 6 6` at cols 22-27. (Overlap at 22).\n    *   Result: `6,6, 0,0, 6,6,6, 0,0, 6,6,6, 0,0, 6,6,6, 0,0, 6,6, 0`\n\noutput:\n0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,0\n6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,0",

Near the bottom of the image there are four \u201cglyphs\u201d:\n\n- A 2\u2011shaped object (rows ~25\u201329, cols ~5\u20137), with pattern:\n\n  ```\n  2 0 0\n  2 0 0\n  2 2 2\n  2 0 0\n  2 2 2\n  ```\n\n- A 4\u2011shaped object (rows ~24\u201329, cols ~9\u201312), similar structure but larger:\n\n  ```\n  4 0 0 0\n  4 0 0 0\n  4 0 0 0\n  4 4 4 4\n  4 0 0 0\n  4 4 4 4\n  ```\n\n- A 1\u2011shaped object, again same sort of \u201cvertical bar with some full rows\u201d pattern.\n- A more irregular 5\u2011object to the right.\n\nThe output is:\n\n```\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n```\n\nThis is a 3\u00d76 \u201c\u0393 / U\u201d-like frame entirely in color 2, unrelated in size to the 5\u00d73 bounding box of the 2\u2011object, but similar in \u201cone full vertical bar and two full horizontal bars\u201d idea.\n\nSo: they\u2019ve picked one colored glyph (color 2) and produced a small canonical pattern using that color.\n\n### Example 2\n\nNon\u2011zero colors (mainly): 4,8,9 plus a small 5 block. The inner part of the image has a fairly intricate, symmetric tiling/stripe pattern involving 4,8,9; 5 appears as a small block on the right and at the bottom.\n\nThe output is a 14\u00d72 matrix of color pairs:\n\n```\n9,9\n8,9\n8,8\n8,4\n4,4\n9,4\n9,9\n9,8\n8,8\n4,8\n4,4\n4,9\n9,9\n0,9\n```\n\nThis looks like a sequence of adjacent color pairs (including self\u2011pairs and a single pair with background 0), probably extracted as some kind of \u201cadjacency walk\u201d or border summary of the 4\u20138\u20139 structure. Crucially, 5 never appears in the output.\n\nSo again, the small 5 block seems irrelevant; the transformation is driven by the 4/8/9 pattern.\n\n### Example 3\n\nNon\u2011zero colors (main): 7,2,3, plus a 5 block near bottom\u2011right. The upper half of the grid is a large repeating tiling made of little 7/2/3 blocks. Focusing on 7:\n\n- At columns 2\u20134, rows 2\u20136:\n\n  ```\n  7 7 7\n  7 0 7\n  7 7 7\n  7 0 7\n  7 7 7\n  ```\n\n- At columns 14\u201316, rows 2\u201312:\n\n  ```\n  7 7 7\n  7 0 7\n  7 7 7\n  7 0 7\n  ...\n  (alternating 777 / 707 down to row 12)\n  ```\n\nSo the 7\u2011pattern tile is essentially a \u201csquare ring\u201d:\n\n```\n7 7 7\n7 0 7\n7 7 7\n```\n\nThe output is 17\u00d73:\n\n```\n7,7,7\n7,0,7\n7,7,7\n7,0,7\n...\n(repeating 777 / 707, ending with 777)\n```\n\nSo they have extracted that 3\u00d73 7\u2011tile and repeated it vertically into a 17\u00d73 column. The other colors (2,3,5) don\u2019t appear in the output.\n\nSo again: pick one color (here 7), extract its characteristic tile, and re\u2011use it in some canonical way.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Trying to find a unified rule\n\nWhat\u2019s common:\n\n- The small 5\u2011blocks appear in all three inputs, but never in outputs. So 5 seems to be \u201cnoise\u201d or at least not a driver of the output.\n- Each output focuses on a subset of the non\u20115 colors:\n  - Example 1: only 2.\n  - Example 2: 4,8,9.\n  - Example 3: only 7.\n- For at least examples 1 and 3, a specific color\u2019s *local pattern* is clearly being abstracted into a canonical glyph:\n  - For 2: an L/U\u2011frame (but resized).\n  - For 7: the 3\u00d73 ring, repeated vertically.\n\nFor Example 2, however, the output is not a simple glyph, but a list of color pairs. It looks like a more global summary of the 4/8/9 pattern, e.g. which colors are adjacent or in what nesting order.\n\nI tried a lot of hypotheses:\n\n- \u201cTake bounding box of a chosen color and scale/rotate it\u201d \u2013 doesn\u2019t work cleanly across examples.\n- \u201cPick smallest or largest color, or smallest glyph\u201d \u2013 conflicts between examples 1 and 3.\n- \u201cUse 5 to mark which color to choose\u201d \u2013 5 never touches others 4\u2011connectedly; there is no simple local rule.\n- \u201cSummarize adjacency graph of non\u20115 colors\u201d \u2013 Example 2 fits that idea, but Examples 1 and 3 don\u2019t look like simple adjacency graphs.\n\nAfter many passes I could not find a single transformation that:\n\n- Explains Example 1\u2019s 3\u00d76 2\u2011pattern,\n- Explains Example 3\u2019s 17\u00d73 repetition of the 7\u2011ring,\n- And also explains Example 2\u2019s 14\u00d72 adjacency list,\n- In a way that deterministically picks a unique output for the test input.\n\nGiven that, any solution I give for the test is necessarily heuristic and not proven correct with respect to the three trainings.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Heuristic used for the test\n\nFor the **test** grid, non\u2011zero colors are mainly:\n\n- Color 4: two substantial 3\u2011row clusters (rows 15\u201317 and 23\u201325), with repeated internal structure.\n- Color 6: two similar 3\u2011row clusters (rows 19\u201321 and 27\u201329).\n- Color 5: a couple of small 2\u00d72 blocks at rows 12\u201313 (one near columns 8\u20139, one near 27\u201328).\n\nIn all three training examples, color 5 behaved like a small, disconnected marker that did not influence the output content. So I treat 5 as irrelevant noise again and focus on the main structured colors \u2013 here, 4 and 6.\n\nAmong these, 4 is:\n\n- The smaller even color (some ARC tasks systematically favor the lower\u2011valued color among the main pattern colors).\n- The one whose cluster shapes (in rows 15\u201317 and 23\u201325) most resemble the \u201cL/U\u2011frame\u201d style of Example 1\u2019s 2\u2011shape: a vertical bar plus multiple horizontal bars.\n\nBased on that, and by analogy with Example 1, I chose a **canonical \u201cU\u2011frame\u201d glyph** but rendered in color 4 instead of color 2:\n\n- Use the same 3\u00d76 frame structure as Example 1:\n  - Top row all the chosen color.\n  - Bottom row all the chosen color.\n  - Leftmost column the chosen color.\n  - Interior cells zero.\n\nThus, my heuristic rule is:\n\n> For the test, ignore color 5. Choose 4 as the \u201crepresentative\u201d structural color, and output the same 3\u00d76 U\u2011shaped frame used in Example 1, but with color 4 instead of 2.\n\nThis is a **best\u2011effort guess**, not a rigorously justified rule compatible with all three training examples, but it\u2019s at least grounded in visible structural similarity between the 4\u2011clusters in the test and the 2\u2011pattern in Example 1.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Final output grid\n\nUsing the heuristic above, the output grid is:\n\n```\n4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,0,0,0,0,0\n4,4,4,4,4,4\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **5-markers define output dimensions**: In each example, there are two clusters of 5s that define the size of the output:\n   - Example 1: 3 rows \u00d7 6 columns\n   - Example 2: 14 rows \u00d7 2 columns  \n   - Example 3: 17 rows \u00d7 3 columns\n\n2. **The main pattern is tiled/extended** to fill those dimensions.\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n\n**Finding the 5-markers:**\n- Row 11: 5,5 at cols 7-8, and 5 at col 27\n- Row 12: 5 at col 7, and 5,5 at cols 26-27\n\nThe markers span:\n- Rows: 11-12 = **2 rows**\n- Columns: 7-27 = **21 columns**\n\n**Identifying the main pattern:**\nThe primary pattern uses color 4, found in rows 14-16:\n- Row 14: `4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4` (from col 5-24)\n- Row 15: `4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4` (from col 5-24)\n\nThe basic repeating unit (5 columns) is:\n```\n4,0,0,0,4 (with adjacent 4s merging)\n4,4,0,4,4\n```\n\n**Extending to 21 columns:**\nThe pattern needs to be extended from 20 to 21 columns by following the repeating structure:\n\nRow 1: The pattern is `4` followed by repeating `0,0,0,4,4`:\n`4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4`\n\nRow 2: The pattern is `4,4,0` followed by repeating `4,4,4,4,0` and ending with `4,4,4`:\n`4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4`\n\n```\n4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4\n4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**High-level reasoning**\n\nFrom the three solved examples I extracted one rule that appears to be consistent across them and also applies naturally to the test:\n\n1. **Use color 5 to define the output size.**  \n   - Take the bounding box of all cells whose value is 5 (minimum and maximum row and column where a 5 appears).\n   - The **output height** is the number of rows in this bounding box.\n   - The **output width** is the number of columns in this bounding box.\n   - This matches all three examples:\n     - Example 1: 5\u2019s span rows 27\u201329 (3 rows) and columns 20\u201325 (6 cols) \u2192 output is 3\u00d76.\n     - Example 2: 5\u2019s span rows 15\u201328 (14 rows) and columns 20\u201321 (2 cols) \u2192 output is 14\u00d72.\n     - Example 3: 5\u2019s span rows 2\u20133 and 17\u201318, so overall rows 2\u201318 (17 rows) and columns 26\u201328 (3 cols) \u2192 output is 17\u00d73.\n\n2. **Fill the resulting rectangle with a repeated \u201cmotif\u201d derived from the main non\u20115 color structure.**  \n   - In the examples, the motif is a simple \u201cframe-like\u201d pattern using one prominent color:\n     - Example 1: motif is a **3\u00d72** block of 2\u2019s with a hole:  \n       ```\n       2 2\n       2 0\n       2 2\n       ```  \n       tiled horizontally 3 times to make 3\u00d76.\n     - Example 3: motif is a **2\u00d73** block of 7\u2019s with a hole:  \n       ```\n       7 7 7\n       7 0 7\n       ```  \n       repeated vertically to fill 17\u00d73.\n   - Example 2 is more complex (it mixes 9/8/4), but it still follows the same \u201cuse 5\u2019s for the size, fill with a pattern based on the strong color structure\u201d idea.\n\n3. **For the test**, the 5\u2019s bounding box is:\n   - Rows with 5\u2019s: 12 and 13 \u2192 height = 2.\n   - Columns with 5\u2019s: from column 8 to column 28 \u2192 width = 28 \u2212 8 + 1 = 21.\n   \u2192 Output must be **2\u00d721**.\n\n   The prominent structured color (by area and clear repeated patterns) is 4 (large and small 4-blocks), with 6 similarly structured below. To stay consistent with the examples that use a single strong color with a central \u201chole\u201d pattern, I derive a **2\u00d73** motif using color 4:\n   - First (top) row fully 4.\n   - Second (bottom) row 4 at the sides, 0 in the center:\n     ```\n     4 4 4\n     4 0 4\n     ```\n\n   Since the output is 2\u00d721 and 21 is divisible by 3, I horizontally tile this 2\u00d73 motif 7 times:\n   - Row 1: `[4,4,4]` repeated 7 times \u2192 21 entries, all 4.\n   - Row 2: `[4,0,4]` repeated 7 times \u2192 a 4\u20130\u20134 pattern repeated across the width.\n\nThis yields a 2\u00d721 \u201cfrieze\u201d consistent in spirit with the training motifs: a rectangle sized by the 5\u2019s, filled with a simple repeated frame-like pattern in the main structural color.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n\nHere is the completed output grid for the test input (2 rows, 21 columns):\n\nRow 1: 4 repeated 21 times  \nRow 2: (4,0,4) repeated 7 times\n\nSo in CSV form:\n\n```\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,0,4,4,0,4,4,0,4,4,0,4,4,0,4,4,0,4,4,0,4\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "The color `5` marks out a missing strip in the pattern. In the solved examples the output grid always has the same height and width as the bounding box of the `5` cells, and it is filled with the pattern that would have appeared there if the tiling were continued, using the next color in the alternating sequence.\n\nIn the test grid the `5` cells occupy rows 12\u201313 and columns 8\u201328 (1\u2011based), so the output is 2 rows by 21 columns. The tiling of 3\u00d73 \u201cL\u201d shapes of `4` and `6` repeats every 4 rows; the group below the `5` strip is of color `4`, so the missing group above should be of color `6`. Taking the mask of non\u2011zeros from rows 16\u201317, columns 8\u201328 of the input and recoloring them to `6` gives the output below.\n\nOutput grid:\n0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,0,0,0\n6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0",
