        "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Transformation Rule for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I've been given this ARC task, and it seems pretty straightforward: take a grid, do something to it, and get a new grid as output. My job is to figure out *what* the \"something\" is. There are a few examples to look at, and a test input to apply the rule to.\n\n**Initial Assessment:** The key is to find the pattern and apply it.\n\n**Diving into the Examples:**\n\n**Example 1:**\nI immediately see a central structure with a 3x3 box in the middle. The color inside the box transforms.  It also seems like the other things in the grid \u2013 the scattered '9's - might be important.  There's a bunch of '9's scattered around the background color (Orange, 7), some inside the structure some outside. The output has changed the 3x3 box, and some of the 9's near the box (or inside the boundaries).\n\nI'm starting to think about the '9's.  Are they moving? Are they being attracted to the box?  I trace the scattered '9's to see if I can find a pattern: are they 'inside' the bigger shape?  Aha! The '6's (Magenta) seem to define a boundary.  It's looking like *only* the '9's *inside* this boundary are changing. Let's trace it and see if the '9's near the box are the ones that actually move and change something in the 3x3 box.\n\nI start counting the number of '9's in the input and output. I'm focusing on the center box; that's where the most obvious change happens.  I examine specific rows to confirm the change. The scattered '9's disappear from the original grid (the source) but I am not clear if they stay in the final form. Where the \u20189\u2019s in the structure disappear, and the '3's in the center box become \u20189\u2019. The original number of '9's seem to be re-positioned. Now, it looks like a 'gravity' of sorts.\n\nIt seems the box is the \"sink\", and the number of moving '9's affect it. It appears some '9's 'move' into the center box, replacing the '3's. So let me look deeper at the '6's: there are two kinds of areas, and the key change is between them.\n\n**Example 2:**\nHere, there are similar structures, but now the number of '9's seem important! There are a lot of the '9's here. I start looking for '9's. Ok, again there's a 3x3 center box. The 6 boundaries are at different positions. And the 9 are scattered differently. And the central 3x3 box color (3 and 2) changes to 9. And the \u20186\u2019s make some kind of \u201cwalls\u201d in the grid. If a 9 is \u201cconnected\u201d it will move, and others won\u2019t. Let me find all of the connected 9's to confirm this theory!\n\n**Connectivity Theory Emerges:**\n\nI start to formulate a connectivity hypothesis: The grid is divided into \u201ccompartments\u201d by walls of \u20186\u2019. There\u2019s a \u201ctarget\u201d compartment, where the 3x3 box lives. Any '9's in compartments *connected* to the target compartment (via gaps in the \u20186\u2019 walls) will \"move\". I double-check this: the number of 9s affect if the color is replaced or not. I'm checking, like, is the number of '9's enough to fill the 3x3? Maybe I'm starting to see a pattern!\n\n**Testing the Hypothesis:**\n\nI go back to Example 2 and start tracing those 6s. The number of 9s has to be at least the same as the available space in the middle. I look at Example 2. There seem to be more 9\u2019s that should have moved, but I can't confirm a pattern. Now, I'm thinking, is that \"number\" important? Or is it something more spatial?\n\nAha! There's something important about connectivity. I check the '6' boundary to see where there are gaps. Are all 9\u2019s connected? I look for 6 boundaries that are either vertical or horizontal. I confirm that only 9's within certain \"compartments\" are the ones moving. The '9's must be accessible. The accessibility is defined by the spaces between the 6s! I'm making progress here!\n\nI'm thinking, is there a simple rule that defines which 9\n\nTo solve this ARC task, we need to infer the transformation rule by analyzing the provided examples and then applying that rule to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:**\n    *   The grid contains a background of Orange (7).\n    *   There are structures formed by Magenta (6) \"walls\".\n    *   There is a specific \"target chamber\" or \"box\" defined by a 3x3 region containing Green (3) pixels and a central Red (2) pixel.\n    *   There are Maroon (9) pixels scattered throughout the grid.\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule (Inferred):**\n    *   The core mechanic is a \"flow\" or \"attraction\" of the Maroon (9) pixels into the target 3x3 box.\n    *   **Connectivity:** Only Maroon (9) pixels that are *topologically connected* to the 3x3 box via \"open\" space (pixels of color 7 or other 9s, passing through gaps in the Magenta 6 walls) are moved. Pixels enclosed in isolated chambers formed by Magenta (6) walls do not move.\n    *   **Movement:** The connected Maroon (9) pixels are removed from their original positions (turning into the background color 7) and \"moved\" into the 3x3 box.\n    *   **Filling Order:** The arriving Maroon (9) pixels replace the existing Green (3) and Red (2) pixels in the box. The filling order appears to be row-major (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).\n    *   **Capacity:** The 3x3 box has 9 slots. If the number of connected 9s is less than 9, they fill the slots partially (preserving the remaining 3s or 2s). If the number of connected 9s is greater than or equal to 9, the entire box becomes 9s.\n\n3.  **Application to Test Input:**\n\n    *   **Identify the Target Box:** The 3x3 box containing 3s and a 2 is located at **Rows 4-6, Columns 4-6**.\n    *   **Analyze Connectivity:** We perform a flood-fill or pathfinding analysis starting from the box to see which 9s are reachable.\n        *   **Box Connections:** The box connects to the top section via a gap in the wall at (3,5) and to the bottom section via a gap at (7,6).\n        *   **Top Region (Rows 0-3):**\n            *   The gap at (3,5) connects to Row 2, which is entirely open (7s).\n            *   From Row 2, we can reach the 9s at **(1,2)**, **(1,10)**, **(3,2)**, and **(3,10)**.\n            *   The 9s at **(0,4)** and **(0,6)** are enclosed by walls at (0,3), (0,7) and a solid floor of walls at Row 1 (cols 3-7). They are isolated from the box and will **not** move.\n        *   **Bottom Region (Rows 7-10):**\n            *   The gap at (7,6) connects to the open area in Row 8.\n            *   Row 8 connects to Row 9 via a gap at (9,4).\n            *   Row 9 connects to Row 10 (which is mostly 9s).\n            *   From this central bottom area, paths extend to the 9s at the sides and bottom corners. Specifically, the 9s at **(7,2)**, **(7,10)**, and the clusters at **Row 10 (cols 0-2, 4-6, 8-10)** are all reachable.\n    *   **Count Moving 9s:**\n        *   Top/Middle: (1,2), (1,10), (3,2), (3,10) -> **4 pixels**.\n        *   Bottom Sides: (7,2), (7,10) -> **2 pixels**.\n        *   Bottom Row: (10,0), (10,1), (10,2), (10,4), (10,6), (10,8), (10,9), (10,10) -> **8 pixels**.\n        *   **Total Moving:** 14 pixels.\n    *   **Execute Transformation:**\n        1.  **Remove Source 9s:** All the reachable 9s listed above are changed to background (7). The isolated 9s at (0,4) and (0,6) remain 9.\n        2.  **Fill Target Box:** Since 14 > 9, the entire 3x3 box (Rows 4-6, Cols 4-6) is filled with 9s.\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\n- **Row 0:** Unchanged (Isolated 9s remain).\n- **Row 1:** 9s become 7s.\n- **Row 2:** Unchanged (All 7s).\n- **Row 3:** 9s become 7s.\n- **Rows 4-6:** The central 3x3 area (Cols 4-6) becomes all 9s.\n- **Row 7:** 9s become 7s.\n- **Rows 8-9:** Unchanged (7s and walls).\n- **Row 10:** All 9s become 7s.\n\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**My Strategy for Solving the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's what I've figured out. I need to take three example ARC grids, analyze the changes, and figure out the general rule to apply to a new one.  I'm seeing a pattern where certain \"maroon\" pixels, represented by the value 9, move to a specific \"target\" area in the grid, replacing existing colors.\n\n**Initial Observations**\n\nIn the examples, there's always a background color (7), a \"frame\" color (6), and this 3x3 square in the middle, initially green (3) with a red (2) dot.  I noticed that maroon (9) pixels are scattered around the grid, and the output shows the central 3x3 block changing, sometimes completely, sometimes only partially, and the 9s from outside filling it up.\n\n**Key Rule: Connecting and Counting**\n\nThe critical breakthrough is that *only* those maroon (9) pixels that are \"connected\" to the central 3x3 target area (the box of 3s with a 2 in the middle) are the ones that move.  Here's how this \"connected\" idea works:  A pixel is considered reachable if it's connected to the target without going through any magenta-colored (6) pixels. We must \"walk\" only on pixels with values: 9, 3, 2, or 7. I found that I needed to use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to identify all walkable 9s. Then, those reachable pixels are pulled, or \"sucked\", into the central area. The rule is that the *closest* 9s get to come.\n\n**Details: Filling and the Filling Order**\n\nAfter doing some careful counting, I realized the fill count matters.  We count how many reachable 9s we have. Then, the number of 9s we use is limited by a capacity which equals the number of pixels in the 3x3 target region. The 9s \"fill\" the target, and we can only use pixels if a path can be constructed to them. Then, we fill up our grid. If there are extra, unused 9s, then the grid is filled to full. The filling is from left-to-right, then top-to-bottom (row-major order).\n\n**Implementation**\n\nTo solve this, I'll:\n\n1.  **Identify the Target:** Find the 3x3 block and list it's pixels.\n2.  **Define Walkable Paths:** Identify all pixels that can be walked on (7, 3, 2, 9).\n3.  **Perform BFS:** Use BFS to determine which maroon pixels are \"connected\" to the target.\n4.  **Calculate Distance:** Find the distances (in terms of path-length from target to source) from the reachable 9s to the Target.\n5.  **Prioritize:** Prioritize those pixels closest to the target.\n6.  **Fill and Replace:** Convert the closest 9s to 7, and replace pixels in the Target with 9s following row-major scanline order.\n\nThis should allow me to accurately determine the correct output grid for the test case.\n\n\nThe goal of this task is to fill the central 3x3 structure (originally green/3 and red/2) with maroon (9) pixels collected from the surrounding grid. The central structure acts as a \"target\" that pulls in the nearest accessible maroon pixels.\n\n**Rules inferred from examples:**\n1.  **Identify the Target:** The target is the 3x3 square structure in the center of the grid, consisting of green (3) pixels with a red (2) pixel in the center.\n2.  **Determine Accessibility:** Maroon (9) pixels can only be moved to the target if they are connected to it by a path of non-wall pixels. The walls are magenta (6). If a maroon pixel is inside a sealed area formed by magenta walls and the grid edges, it cannot be moved.\n3.  **Find Nearest Sources:** Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the target pixels to find all reachable maroon (9) pixels. Calculate the path distance from the target to each reachable maroon pixel.\n4.  **Select Sources:** The target has a capacity of 9 pixels. Select the up to 9 closest reachable maroon pixels. If there is a tie in distance, select based on reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).\n5.  **Apply Transformation:**\n    *   Change the selected reachable maroon (9) pixels in the grid to background (7).\n    *   Change all 9 pixels in the target 3x3 area to maroon (9).\n    *   Any maroon pixels that were not selected (either because they are unreachable/sealed or because they were too far and the target was full) remain as 9.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Target:** The 3x3 area is at rows 4-6, columns 4-6.\n2.  **Connectivity Analysis:**\n    *   The target is enclosed by magenta (6) walls but has two openings: one at the top via `(3,5)` leading to Row 2, and one at the bottom via `(7,6)` leading to the bottom area.\n    *   **Sealed:** The 9s at `(0,4)` and `(0,6)` are enclosed by walls and grid edges with no opening. They cannot be moved.\n    *   **Reachable:**\n        *   **Top Area (via `(3,5)`):** `(1,2)`, `(3,2)`, `(1,10)`, `(3,10)`. (Distances are short, ~6-8 steps).\n        *   **Bottom Middle (via `(7,6)`):** `(10,4)`, `(10,6)`. (Distances are short, ~6-8 steps).\n        *   **Left Strip (via Top -> Left):** `(7,2)` (Dist 10), `(10,0)` (Dist 15), `(10,1)` (Dist 16), `(10,2)` (Dist 17).\n        *   **Right Strip (via Top -> Right):** `(7,10)` (Dist 16), `(10,8-10)` (Dist > 16).\n3.  **Selection (Need 9 pixels):**\n    *   Rank 1-3 (Dist 6): `(1,2)`, `(3,2)`, `(10,4)`.\n    *   Rank 4-6 (Dist 8): `(1,10)`, `(3,10)`, `(10,6)`.\n    *   Rank 7 (Dist 10): `(7,2)`.\n    *   Rank 8 (Dist 15): `(10,0)`.\n    *   Rank 9 (Dist 16): Tie between `(7,10)` and `(10,1)`. `(7,10)` is higher in reading order (Row 7 vs Row 10).\n    *   **Selected:** `(1,2)`, `(3,2)`, `(10,4)`, `(1,10)`, `(3,10)`, `(10,6)`, `(7,2)`, `(10,0)`, `(7,10)`.\n4.  **Result:**\n    *   Set selected source pixels to 7.\n    *   Set target 3x3 (R4-R6, C4-C6) to 9.\n    *   `(0,4)`, `(0,6)`, `(10,1)`, `(10,2)`, `(10,8)`, `(10,9)`, `(10,10)` remain 9.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,9,9,6,7,7,7,6,9,9,9",

Some 9s get moved into the 3\u00d73 block (replacing 3s), while those 9s' original positions become 7s\n4. The total count of 9s is preserved\n\nThe key insight is that 9s which are **connected to the interior region** (reachable through 7s, not blocked by 6s) get moved into the 3\u00d73 block.\n\nFor the test input:\n- The 3\u00d73 block is at rows 4-6, cols 4-6\n- 6s form barriers at cols 3 and 7 (vertical walls) and at rows 1 and 7 (partial horizontal barriers)\n- Total 9s in input: 16\n\nTracing connectivity from the 3\u00d73 interior through 7s:\n- 9s at (0,4) and (0,6) are NOT reachable (blocked by 6s at row 1)\n- 14 other 9s ARE reachable through paths around the barriers\n\nSince the 3\u00d73 block has 9 cells, exactly 9 of the reachable 9s will be absorbed. The 9s that stay are:\n- (0,4), (0,6): non-reachable, stay\n- (1,2), (1,10), (3,2), (3,10), (10,8): reachable but furthest from block, stay\n\nThe transformation:\n- 3\u00d73 block becomes all 9s\n- Remove 9s from: (7,2), (7,10), (10,0), (10,1), (10,2), (10,4), (10,6), (10,9), (10,10)\n\nOutput count check: 9 (block) + 2 (row 0) + 2 (row 1) + 2 (row 3) + 1 (row 10) = 16 \u2713\n\n```\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,9,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,9\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,9,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,9,7,7\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "First, I\u2019ll describe the transformation pattern from the examples, then apply it step\u2011by\u2011step to the test grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the task is doing\n\nAcross all examples:\n\n- There is exactly one special 3\u00d73 block:\n  - It looks like a \u201cplus\u201d of 3\u2019s with a 2 in the center:  \n\n    ```\n    3 3 3\n    3 2 3\n    3 3 3\n    ```\n\n- Only the colors {3, 2, 7, 9} ever change:\n  - Some 3\u2019s (and possibly the central 2) inside that 3\u00d73 become 9.\n  - The same number of 9\u2019s elsewhere in the grid become 7.\n  - Color 6 (the \u201cwall\u201d) never changes.\n  - Total count of cells colored 9 is conserved in every example.\n\nInterpretation:  \nThe puzzle \u201cmoves\u201d some 9s from elsewhere onto the 3\u00d73 [+] object, turning selected 3/2 cells into 9. Which outside 9s are used, and which stay, is determined by the layout of 6-walls and by whether a 9 is isolated or in a cluster.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The inferred general rule\n\n### 2.1. Find the special 3\u00d73 object\n\nLocate the unique 3\u00d73 block of 3\u2019s with a 2 in the center.  \nIn the test grid it\u2019s at rows 5\u20137, columns 5\u20137.\n\n### 2.2. Define \u201crooms\u201d using color 6 as walls\n\n- Treat color 6 as **walls**.\n- Treat all non\u20116 colors (including 9) as open floor.\n- Using 4\u2011connected BFS/flood\u2011fill from the 3\u00d73 block, find all cells reachable without crossing a 6.\n- Any 9 reachable in this sense is a **candidate donor**.\n- Any 9 not reachable (i.e., in a different 6\u2011component/room) is **anchored** and must stay 9.\n\nCheck against examples:\n\n- Example 1: only the pair of 9s at (row9,col8\u20139) is in the same 6-room as the plus; those are exactly the ones changed to 7 and \u201cmoved\u201d onto the block.\n- Example 2: the plus sits in an open room that actually connects around the bottom to all 9s; so all 9s are in the same 6\u2011component.\n- Example 3: there are no 6\u2019s at all, so every 9 is in the same room as the plus. All 9s become donors.\n\nWe\u2019ll apply the same principle to the test.\n\n### 2.3. Limit how many donors we actually use\n\nLet:\n\n- \\( S \\) = set of donor 9s = 9s in the same 6-room as the plus.\n- \\( C = 9 \\) = number of cells in the 3\u00d73 block.\n\nWe can only turn at most C cells inside the block into 9, so we use:\n\n\\[\nK = \\min(|S|,\\; C)\n\\]\n\n- We will recolor **exactly K cells** inside the 3\u00d73 plus block to color 9.\n- And we will recolor **exactly K cells** from S (donor 9s) from 9 \u2192 7, to keep the total number of 9s unchanged.\n\nWhen \\(|S| \\le C\\): all S cells are donors, block only partially filled (Examples 1 & 3).  \nWhen \\(|S| > C\\): we need to choose *which* 9s in S become donors (Example 2).\n\n### 2.4. Which 9s in S become donors (when |S| > C)\n\nFrom the examples, the selection obeys:\n\n1. **Group 9s in S into 4\u2011connected components** (clusters of touching 9s).\n2. **Singletons first:**  \n   Use all 9s that are isolated (no 9 neighbor up/down/left/right) as donors before touching any multi\u2011cell cluster.\n   - In Example 2, there are 8 singleton 9s and we needed 9 donors, so all 8 singletons are donors.\n3. **If we still need more donors**, take them from multi\u2011cell clusters:\n   - For each 9 in any cluster, compute its Manhattan distance to the center of the 3\u00d73 block (the 2-cell).\n   - Repeatedly choose the not\u2011yet\u2011chosen cluster cell with **minimum distance**.\n   - If there\u2019s a tie, break by **smallest row index**, then **smallest column index**.\n   - This matches Example 2: after using all singletons, the extra donor is the cluster cell (2,7), which is the closest cluster cell to the plus center.\n\nAll selected donor 9s become 7 in the output; all other 9s in S remain 9.\n\n### 2.5. How to recolor the 3\u00d73 block\n\n- Traverse the 3\u00d73 block **row-major** (top to bottom, left to right).\n- For the **first K cells** of this traversal:\n  - Set that cell\u2019s color to 9 (even if it was 3 or 2).\n- Leave the remaining cells in the 3\u00d73 block as they were.\n\nThis exactly matches:\n\n- Example 1: S has 2 donors \u2192 change top row\u2019s first two 3s: becomes\n\n  ```\n  9 9 3\n  3 2 3\n  3 3 3\n  ```\n\n- Example 2: S has 15 donors, but \\(K = 9\\) \u2192 entire 3\u00d73 becomes 9.\n- Example 3: S has 4 donors \u2192 first 4 cells in row-major order become 9:\n\n  ```\n  9 9 9\n  9 2 3\n  3 3 3\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Applying the rule to the test input\n\n### 3.1. Identify the 3\u00d73 block\n\nIn the test grid:\n\nRows 5\u20137, columns 5\u20137:\n\n```\nrow5: c5-7 = 3 3 3\nrow6: c5-7 = 3 2 3\nrow7: c5-7 = 3 3 3\n```\n\nSo the plus block is at (r5\u20137, c5\u20137), center at (6,6).\n\n### 3.2. Build 6-based connectivity and find S\n\nList all 9s in the grid:\n\n- Row1: (1,5), (1,7)\n- Row2: (2,3), (2,11)\n- Row4: (4,3), (4,11)\n- Row8: (8,3), (8,11)\n- Row11: (11,1), (11,2), (11,3), (11,5), (11,7), (11,9), (11,10), (11,11)\n\nNow treat color 6 as walls and everything else as walkable.  \nRun a conceptual flood\u2011fill from the plus center (6,6):\n\n- You can reach all 9s **except** the two on the small top island at row 1, columns 5 and 7.\n  - That island { (1,5), (1,6), (1,7) } is surrounded by 6s in row2 and at columns 4 and 8, so it\u2019s a separate 6\u2011component.\n\nThus:\n\n- **Anchored 9s (different 6-component):** (1,5), (1,7) \u2013 they stay 9.\n- **Candidate donors S (same 6-component as the plus):**\n\n  ```\n  (2,3), (2,11),\n  (4,3), (4,11),\n  (8,3), (8,11),\n  (11,1), (11,2), (11,3),\n  (11,5), (11,7),\n  (11,9), (11,10), (11,11)\n  ```\n\nSo |S| = 14.\n\n### 3.3. Determine K\n\nC = 9 (3\u00d73 block size).\n\nSo\n\\[\nK = \\min(|S|,\\; 9) = \\min(14,9) = 9.\n\\]\n\nWe will:\n\n- Turn 9 donor 9s into 7.\n- Turn 9 cells inside the 3\u00d73 block into 9 (i.e., the whole block).\n\n### 3.4. Select donors: singletons first, then nearest cluster cell\n\nFirst, find 4\u2011connected 9\u2011clusters among S.\n\n9s in S:\n\n- Row2: (2,3), (2,11) \u2013 separate, both single.\n- Row4: (4,3), (4,11) \u2013 separate, both single.\n- Row8: (8,3), (8,11) \u2013 separate, both single.\n- Row11 left: (11,1), (11,2), (11,3) \u2013 a 3\u2011cell cluster.\n- Row11 center: (11,5) \u2013 single.\n- Row11 mid-right: (11,7) \u2013 single.\n- Row11 right cluster: (11,9), (11,10), (11,11) \u2013 a 3\u2011cell cluster.\n\nSo:\n\n- **Singleton 9s in S:**\n\n  \\[\n  \\{(2,3),(2,11),(4,3),(4,11),(8,3),(8,11),(11,5),(11,7)\\}\n  \\]\n  8 cells.\n\n- **Multi\u2011cell clusters in S:**\n  - Cluster D: {(11,1), (11,2), (11,3)}\n  - Cluster G: {(11,9), (11,10), (11,11)}\n\nWe need K = 9 donors.\n\n1. Take all 8 singleton 9s as donors.\n2. We still need 1 more donor, so pick it from the clusters by minimum Manhattan distance to the plus center (6,6).\n\nCompute distances for cluster cells:\n\n- Cluster D:\n  - (11,1): |11\u20136| + |1\u20136| = 5 + 5 = 10\n  - (11,2): 5 + 4 = 9\n  - (11,3): 5 + 3 = 8\n- Cluster G:\n  - (11,9): |11\u20136| + |9\u20136| = 5 + 3 = 8\n  - (11,10): 5 + 4 = 9\n  - (11,11): 5 + 5 = 10\n\nMinimal distance among cluster cells: 8, at (11,3) and (11,9).\n\nTie\u2011break by smallest row, then smallest column \u2192 choose **(11,3)**.\n\nSo the **9 donor cells** are:\n\n- All 8 singleton donors:\n  - (2,3), (2,11), (4,3), (4,11), (8,3), (8,11), (11,5), (11,7)\n- Plus the chosen cluster cell:\n  - (11,3)\n\nThese 9 cells will change 9 \u2192 7.\n\nAll other 9s remain unchanged.\n\n### 3.5. Recolor the 3\u00d73 block\n\nThe block rows 5\u20137, cols 5\u20137 currently:\n\n```\nrow5: 3 3 3    (cells (5,5),(5,6),(5,7))\nrow6: 3 2 3    (cells (6,5),(6,6),(6,7))\nrow7: 3 3 3    (cells (7,5),(7,6),(7,7))\n```\n\nTraverse row-major:\n\n1. (5,5)\n2. (5,6)\n3. (5,7)\n4. (6,5)\n5. (6,6)\n6. (6,7)\n7. (7,5)\n8. (7,6)\n9. (7,7)\n\nK = 9, so **all 9 cells** in this 3\u00d73 are recolored to 9:\n\n- All 3s and the 2 at (6,6) become 9.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Constructing the final grid\n\nStart from the input and apply:\n\n1.

Every other colour (7,\u202f3,\u202f2,\u202f9) is passable.\n- Starting from the centre cell (the 2), compute which 9s are reachable by a 4\u2011connected path that never crosses a 6. Compute the shortest\u2011path distance to each reachable 9.\n- Sort the reachable 9s by increasing distance (ties don\u2019t matter here) and take as many as there are cells in the 3\u00d73 block (9 cells). For each taken 9, place a 9 into the next block cell in row\u2011major order; set the original 9 cell to 7. Any remaining block cells stay as they were; any 9s not taken (either unreachable or farther than the first nine) stay in place.\n\nFor the test grid, the reachable 9s sorted by distance are at (1,2),\u202f(3,2),\u202f(10,4),\u202f(1,10),\u202f(3,10),\u202f(10,6),\u202f(7,2),\u202f(7,10),\u202f(10,0). There are nine of them, so the entire 3\u00d73 block becomes 9s. Those nine original positions are set to 7; all other cells stay the same.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,9,9,6,7,7,7,6,9,9,9",
