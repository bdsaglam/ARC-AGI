        "Full raw LLM response": "**Solving an ARC Task: A Deep Dive into Pattern Recognition**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The user's thrown me a curveball: an ARC problem. I've got four solved examples and a test input to work with. Time to put my pattern-recognition skills to the test!\n\nFirst things first, I need to understand the structure. I'm seeing grids. Example 1 has a 30x30 input, spitting out a 9x4 output. That output size seems important. I'm scanning for patterns, symmetry, anything that jumps out. I see it! Horizontal and vertical symmetry in the input, but with a bit of \"noise\" that's hiding something.\n\nI see a subgrid within the input - the output seems to be related to a subgrid. Now, I have an 8-block, and I can start relating it to the output.\n\nWait a sec, I should look more carefully. So I see a block of '8's. Bingo! The 8-block's size matches the output size perfectly. Okay, the 8s are on the right side and the output seems to be derived from the \"left side\" of the grid (relative to the 8-block). Is the mapping reversed? Or is the 8-block masking something?\n\nThe key: I have to figure out how the values under the 8s relate to some other part of the grid. Let's dig deeper: Is the grid a set of 4 quadrants? Is it a palindrome? No, but It's close.\n\nThe answer became clear in one of the examples. I see vertical symmetry in Example 4. This implies copying, but this is a bit too simple in some ways. Then I notice the \"sum of the indices = constant rule\". Boom! That's it! I test it with the test input, and it works.\n\nThere is another catch when the mapping creates a circular reference. With the test input, I need to remember the mirror. In Ex 1 I had the problem. It seems the rule changes slightly when this situation happens. In this case, horizontal is the key.\n\nNow, with everything clear, the solution becomes quite simple. Identify the key rows and columns. Then use those keys to get the output from the inputs! Let's get to it!\n\nI finally deduced the core strategy: vertical reflection, with a shift (Index Sum=31). The tricky parts happen when the reflection hits the 8-block itself (circular reference). For the blocks, I saw horizontal symmetry (palindromes in Ex 1 and mirror in test input) to solve those. It all came together!\n\nSo, the values are based on the neighbor rows and horizontal symmetry! Now I've analyzed and solved the test input, I can construct the final answer (a 9x3 subgrid with the numbers).\n\n\nThe problem asks us to reconstruct the obscured part of the grid (represented by `8`s). Based on the solved examples, the grid exhibits symmetries that allow us to determine the missing values.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n1.  **Vertical Symmetry:** The primary transformation observed in Examples 3 and 4 (and partially in 1) is a vertical reflection where row `r` maps to row `31 - r`. The sum of the indices of the source and target rows is 31 (for a 30-row grid, this is slightly offset from the standard 29, implying a specific axis).\n    -   `Target[r][c] = Grid[31-r][c]`\n2.  **Horizontal Symmetry (Fallback):** In Example 1 and the Test Input, the vertical mapping for the middle rows maps a row with `8`s to another row with `8`s (e.g., Row 14 maps to Row 17). In these cases, the rows exhibit a horizontal symmetry property. Specifically, the relationship `Col[c]` corresponds to `Col[31-c]`.\n    -   For the Test Input, the `8`s are at columns 0, 1, 2.\n    -   Using the sum 31 rule:\n        -   `c=2` maps to `31-2 = 29`. The value at column 29 is available.\n        -   `c=1` maps to `30` (out of bounds).\n        -   `c=0` maps to `31` (out of bounds).\n    -   For columns 0 and 1, we infer the values from the vertical neighbors. The rows immediately above (R13) and below (R18) the undefined block (R14-R17) have the pattern `4, 4` in columns 0 and 1. Due to the continuity and vertical reflection symmetry of the values in columns 0 and 1 (R13 mirrors R18, R12 mirrors R19, etc.), we deduce that R14-R17 also follow the `4, 4` pattern.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\nThe `8`s are located at **Rows 14-22** and **Columns 0-2**.\n\n*   **Row 22:** Maps to `31 - 22 = 9`.\n    *   Row 9: `1,6,1,5,4...` -> Columns 0-2 are **1, 6, 1**.\n*   **Row 21:** Maps to `31 - 21 = 10`.\n    *   Row 10: `6,6,6,6,7...` -> Columns 0-2 are **6, 6, 6**.\n*   **Row 20:** Maps to `31 - 20 = 11`.\n    *   Row 11: `6,6,1,6,7...` -> Columns 0-2 are **6, 6, 1**.\n*   **Row 19:** Maps to `31 - 19 = 12`.\n    *   Row 12: `4,4,7,7,9...` -> Columns 0-2 are **4, 4, 7**.\n*   **Row 18:** Maps to `31 - 18 = 13`.\n    *   Row 13: `4,4,7,2,7...` -> Columns 0-2 are **4, 4, 7**.\n\n*   **Rows 14, 15, 16, 17:** These map to each other (14<->17, 15<->16). We use the fallback logic.\n    *   **Columns 0, 1:** Inferred from neighbors R13 (`4,4`) and R18 (`4,4`). We assume these are **4, 4**.\n    *   **Column 2:** Maps to Column `31 - 2 = 29`.\n        *   Row 14 Col 29 is `9`. -> **9**.\n        *   Row 15 Col 29 is `9`. -> **9**.\n        *   Row 16 Col 29 is `9`. -> **9**.\n        *   Row 17 Col 29 is `9`. -> **9**.\n    *   So, Rows 14-17 correspond to **4, 4, 9**.\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\nR14: 4, 4, 9\nR15: 4, 4, 9\nR16: 4, 4, 9\nR17: 4, 4, 9\nR18: 4, 4, 7\nR19: 4, 4, 7\nR20: 6, 6, 1\nR21: 6, 6, 6\nR22: 1, 6, 1\n\n4,4,9\n4,4,9\n4,4,9\n4,4,9\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n6,6,1\n6,6,6\n1,6,1",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Solution Strategy for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got to do: solve this ARC problem. There are four solved examples and one test input to look at. From these, I need to figure out what's going on.\n\n**Initial Impressions:**\n\n*   **Example 1:** Right off the bat, I see a big grid with a 30x30 input and a 9x4 output. The numbers are mostly symmetric, both horizontally and vertically. But, there's a problem: rows 0 and 29 aren't exactly the same, which gets me thinking, is the pattern shifted? Or is symmetry playing tricks?\n*   **The \"8\" Block:** Okay, now I see a block of \"8\"s inside the input, right around the middle. It's almost the exact dimensions of the output (9x4). Is the solution related to this block? Is the output extracted from the \"8\"s block?\n*   **Horizontal Reflection:** Could it be that the output is generated by reflecting sections of the input horizontally, and then overlaying the \"8\"s? I start going through the grid, searching for evidence of reflection or rotation. But it's not straightforward. Maybe there's an axis of symmetry, but it's not perfect. It's almost, but there's a shift or corruption.\n\n**Deeper Dive:**\n\n*   **Vertical Symmetry:** Looking at columns, maybe the output is formed by \"completing\" a structure, a mirrored copy of the left portion of the 8s to the right. This is confirmed by checking R14 and R17. It helps that all examples seem to use this property. Then looking at other rows R18 and R13, for example, the symmetry checks out again.\n*   **Collision Detection:** The next important point is when the symmetry gets \"corrupted.\" I found that the pattern between rows 14-17 (where the \"8\" blocks are) is not symmetric.\n*   **Palindrome Discovery**: Examining the column, I start creating a list of columns. Suddenly, I see a repeating and perfectly symmetric sequence for each column! This means the algorithm to extract must be able to recognize it!\n\n**Test Input Deduction**\n\n*   **Test Input Pattern:** All right, let's look at the Test Input, which also has a block of 8s, in columns 0-2.\n*   **The Shift Rule:** There seems to be a rule here: I think that the values from clean rows are vertically symmetric around those with 8s. \n*   **Collision Problem:** A bit like Example 1, rows 14-17 and the symmetry is not clear.\n\n**Proposed Solution**\n\nHere's my proposal: for the rows with \"8\"s and a partner with the same block dimensions, simply copy and extend the clean portions adjacent to the 8's block. The key is completing the palindrome!\n\n\nThe task is to restore the region covered by '8's (which acts as noise or a mask) in the input grid. By analyzing the solved examples, we can identify a vertical symmetry in the grid rows. specifically, Row $i$ is identical to Row $31-i$ (using 0-based indexing relative to a hypothetical 32-row grid, or simply observing the pairing of rows from the edges inwards).\n\nIn the test input:\n- The grid is $30 \\times 30$.\n- The noise ('8's) is located in rows 14-22 and columns 0-2.\n- We need to produce an output grid corresponding to this noise region (9 rows, 3 columns).\n\nWe apply the vertical symmetry principle to recover the rows:\n1.  **Rows 18-22**: These rows have symmetric partners in the top half of the grid that are clean (no '8's).\n    -   Row 22 corresponds to Row 9. Row 9 cols 0-2 are `1, 6, 1`.\n    -   Row 21 corresponds to Row 10. Row 10 cols 0-2 are `6, 6, 6`.\n    -   Row 20 corresponds to Row 11. Row 11 cols 0-2 are `6, 6, 1`.\n    -   Row 19 corresponds to Row 12. Row 12 cols 0-2 are `4, 4, 7`.\n    -   Row 18 corresponds to Row 13. Row 13 cols 0-2 are `4, 4, 7`.\n\n2.  **Rows 14-17**: These rows are in the middle and map to each other (14 to 17, 15 to 16). Since both partners contain '8's in the target columns (0-2), we cannot copy from a symmetric clean row. This is a \"collision\".\n    -   In Example 1, a similar collision occurred, and the values formed a logical completion of the pattern.\n    -   In the Test Input, observing the clean parts of Rows 14-17, we see that Row 14 is identical to Row 17, and Row 15 is identical to Row 16.\n    -   The '8's are in columns 0-2. The immediate adjacent clean columns are 3-5.\n    -   For Row 14 (and 17), columns 3-5 contain `1, 3, 2`.\n    -   For Row 15 (and 16), columns 3-5 contain `9, 2, 3`.\n    -   Using the pattern extension logic (shifting the adjacent pattern into the void for the collision rows), we fill Row 14/17 with `1, 3, 2` and Row 15/16 with `9, 2, 3`.\n\nConstructing the output:\nRow 14: 1, 3, 2\nRow 15: 9, 2, 3\nRow 16: 9, 2, 3\nRow 17: 1, 3, 2\nRow 18: 4, 4, 7\nRow 19: 4, 4, 7\nRow 20: 6, 6, 1\nRow 21: 6, 6, 6\nRow 22: 1, 6, 1\n\noutput:\n1,3,2\n9,2,3\n9,2,3\n1,3,2\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n6,6,1\n6,6,6\n1,6,1",

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Identify the \u201cspecial\u201d colour and its block**\n\n   In all four training examples, the only place colour `8` appears is in one or more **solid rectangular blocks** (or nearly so) of `8`s.  \n   The output size in every example exactly matches the height and width of the largest such 8\u2011block.\n\n   For the **test input**:\n\n   - Colour `8` appears only in rows 15\u201323, columns 1\u20133.\n   - Those positions form a solid 9\u00d73 rectangle of 8s.\n\n   So the 8\u2011block \\(B\\) is:\n\n   - Rows \\(r_B = 15..23\\)\n   - Columns \\(c_B = 1..3\\)\n   - Height \\(h = 9\\), width \\(w = 3\\)\n\n   Thus the output must be a 9\u00d73 grid.\n\n2. **Find the vertical symmetry axis**\n\n   In the training examples (ignoring the 8\u2011blocks), the grid is vertically symmetric: for each row index \\(r\\) we have\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{row}(r) = \\text{row}(33 - r)\n   \\]\n\n   (since there are 30 rows, the symmetry axis is between rows 16 and 17, i.e. at 16.5).\n\n   The same is true in the test grid (away from the 8\u2011region): e.g.\n\n   - Row 3 = Row 30\n   - Row 4 = Row 29\n   - Row 5 = Row 28\n   - etc.\n\n   So the vertical reflection mapping is always:\n\n   \\[\n   r_{\\text{mirror}} = 33 - r\n   \\]\n\n3. **Where to read the pattern from**\n\n   In examples 2, 3, and 4 (the cleanest cases):\n\n   - Let \\(B\\) be the bounding box of 8s.\n   - Reflect the rows of \\(B\\) across the symmetry axis: for each row index \\(r\\in r_B\\), compute \\(r' = 33 - r\\).\n   - Use those reflected rows, on the same columns as \\(B\\), as the **source patch**.\n   - But to restore the original orientation, you vertically flip that source patch before outputting.\n\n   Concretely: if \\(r_B = [r_1, r_2, ..., r_h]\\) in ascending order, and \\(r'_i = 33 - r_i\\), then:\n\n   - Take the rows in ascending order of \\(r'_i\\) to form a rectangle \\(P\\) of size \\(h \\times w\\).\n   - Output is the vertical flip of \\(P\\): row 1 of output = last row of \\(P\\), row 2 = second\u2011last of \\(P\\), etc.\n\n   This reproduces exactly the outputs of examples 2, 3, and 4.\n\n4. **Apply this mapping to the test grid**\n\n   For the test grid:\n\n   - \\(B\\): rows 15..23, cols 1..3 (9\u00d73).\n   - Reflected rows:  \n     \\(15 \\mapsto 18,\\ 16 \\mapsto 17,\\ 17 \\mapsto 16,\\ 18 \\mapsto 15,\\ 19 \\mapsto 14,\\ 20 \\mapsto 13,\\ 21 \\mapsto 12,\\ 22 \\mapsto 11,\\ 23 \\mapsto 10.\\)\n\n   So the set of reflected rows is \\(\\{10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18\\}\\).  \n   In ascending order: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.\n\n   We read patch \\(P\\) from those rows and columns 1..3:\n\n   - Row 10, cols 1\u20133: `1,6,1`\n   - Row 11, cols 1\u20133: `6,6,6`\n   - Row 12, cols 1\u20133: `6,6,1`\n   - Row 13, cols 1\u20133: `4,4,7`\n   - Row 14, cols 1\u20133: `4,4,7`\n   - Row 15, cols 1\u20133: `8,8,8`\n   - Row 16, cols 1\u20133: `8,8,8`\n   - Row 17, cols 1\u20133: `8,8,8`\n   - Row 18, cols 1\u20133: `8,8,8`\n\n   So\n\n   \\[\n   P =\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   1 & 6 & 1 \\\\\n   6 & 6 & 6 \\\\\n   6 & 6 & 1 \\\\\n   4 & 4 & 7 \\\\\n   4 & 4 & 7 \\\\\n   8 & 8 & 8 \\\\\n   8 & 8 & 8 \\\\\n   8 & 8 & 8 \\\\\n   8 & 8 & 8\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n   Now vertically flip \\(P\\) to get the output:\n\n   - Output row 1 = last row of \\(P\\) = `8,8,8`\n   - Output row 2 = row 8 of \\(P\\) = `8,8,8`\n   - Output row 3 = row 7 of \\(P\\) = `8,8,8`\n   - Output row 4 = row 6 of \\(P\\) = `8,8,8`\n   - Output row 5 = row 5 of \\(P\\) = `4,4,7`\n   - Output row 6 = row 4 of \\(P\\) = `4,4,7`\n   - Output row 7 = row 3 of \\(P\\) = `6,6,1`\n   - Output row 8 = row 2 of \\(P\\) = `6,6,6`\n   - Output row 9 = row 1 of \\(P\\) = `1,6,1`\n\n---\n\n## Completed output grid\n\n8,8,8\n8,8,8\n8,8,8\n8,8,8\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n6,6,1\n6,6,6\n1,6,1",

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning**\n\n1. In each training example there is a rectangular block filled entirely with the color `8`.  \n   - Example 1: a 9\u00d74 block of 8\u2019s.  \n   - Example 2: a 4\u00d75 block of 8\u2019s.  \n   - Example 3: a 3\u00d77 block of 8\u2019s.  \n   - Example 4: a 4\u00d74 block of 8\u2019s.\n\n   The output size always exactly matches the size of this 8\u2011rectangle.\n\n2. Away from the 8\u2011block, the big 30\u00d730 grids show a **vertical symmetry**: rows come in pairs that are mirror images across a horizontal line halfway down the grid. Formally, for many rows `i`, row `i` is (almost) identical to row `33\u2212i` (since there are 30 rows, the symmetry axis is between rows 16 and 17).  \n   - Example 2: rows 3 and 30 match except where one has 8\u2019s.  \n   - Example 3: rows 20 and 13 match except for the 8\u2011block.  \n   - Example 4: rows 8 and 25 match except for the 8\u2011block.\n\n   The 8\u2011block lives on one side of this symmetry and \u201ccovers\u201d values that can be seen on the other side in the mirrored row. The output is then just the mirrored values for the 8\u2011rectangle\u2019s coordinates.\n\n3. So the transformation can be summarized as:\n   - Find the minimal axis\u2011aligned rectangle that contains all cells of color `8`.  \n   - For each cell `(r, c)` in that rectangle, take the color from the vertically mirrored row: `(33\u2212r, c)` in the same column.  \n   - Collect these colors (in the same order as the 8\u2011rectangle) to form the output grid.\n\n4. Apply this to the **test input**:\n\n   - The 8\u2019s form a 9\u00d73 rectangle:\n     - Rows 15\u201323.\n     - Columns 1\u20133.\n   - For each such cell `(r, c)`, we map to `(33\u2212r, c)`:\n\n     - Row 15 \u2192 mirror row 18  \u2192 entries (1\u20133) = `8,8,8`\n     - Row 16 \u2192 mirror row 17  \u2192 `8,8,8`\n     - Row 17 \u2192 mirror row 16  \u2192 `8,8,8`\n     - Row 18 \u2192 mirror row 15  \u2192 `8,8,8`\n     - Row 19 \u2192 mirror row 14  \u2192 `4,4,7`\n     - Row 20 \u2192 mirror row 13  \u2192 `4,4,7`\n     - Row 21 \u2192 mirror row 12  \u2192 `6,6,1`\n     - Row 22 \u2192 mirror row 11  \u2192 `6,6,6`\n     - Row 23 \u2192 mirror row 10  \u2192 `1,6,1`\n\n   Collecting these rows in order gives the 9\u00d73 output.\n\n---\n\n**Output grid**\n\n8,8,8  \n8,8,8  \n8,8,8  \n8,8,8  \n4,4,7  \n4,4,7  \n6,6,1  \n6,6,6  \n1,6,1",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Explanation:\nAll examples indicate that a solid block of color\u202f8 marks a missing rectangular region. The given grids are vertically and horizontally symmetrical with respect to a centre corresponding to a \u201cconstant\u201d of 33, i.e. a cell at \\((r,c)\\) mirrors to row \\(33\\!-\\!r\\) and column \\(33\\!-\\!c\\). In every training case the values to fill the 8\u2011block are obtained from the corresponding mirrored cells. For the test grid the 8\u2011block occupies rows\u202f15\u201323 and columns\u202f1\u20133. Rows\u202f19\u201323 can be filled directly from their mirrored rows\u202f14\u201310. Column\u202f3 is determined by horizontal symmetry with column\u202f30. Rows\u202f15\u201318 mirror each other, so their first two values are taken to continue the surrounding symmetric pattern, with column\u202f3 fixed by the row symmetry.\n\nApplying this gives the 9\u00d73 output corresponding to the missing block, in the same top\u2013down order as the block rows.\n\nCompleted output grid:\n```\n4,4,9\n4,4,9\n4,4,9\n4,4,9\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n6,6,1\n6,6,6\n1,6,1\n```",
