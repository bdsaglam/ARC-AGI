            "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's my thought process:**\n\nI need to analyze two example images and a test input to find a transformation rule, as an ARC expert. I'll need to identify patterns in the input, how they relate to the output, and how to apply this to the test input.\n\nFirst, I examined Example 1: a 30x30 input and a 5x5 output. I looked for distinct features like rectangular regions and their internal patterns and started by checking for framed areas within the input. I quickly narrowed it down to four rectangular sections or \"windows\" of interest. I then carefully examined the Example 1 output and started by matching colors in each section. I extracted the 5x5 grids within the \"windows\" and noticed each had a distinctive color and pattern.\n\nI then noted the color '4', the presence of a \"frame\" around each 5x5 grid in the 30x30 input, and started extracting 5x5 grids that corresponded to the 5x5 output. Then, I observed there seemed to be a \"path\" rule, I.e. connecting the \"6\" (pivot) and \"2\" (Target). I extracted these different 5x5 grids for further processing, but noticed there was a connection between the shape of the grids and the final output. In Example 1, the \"6\" (the pivot), was at the corner and was filled out with the \"2\" (the target). I considered if it should be an addition between the 4 grids, but ultimately decided it was a pathing problem.\n\nNext, I looked at Example 2. A 30x30 input and a 4x4 output, looking for similar structure. I identified three frames with color '8', then I noted there might be a 4th or it may not be present. I then did the same thing with the other 3 regions. I then extracted the regions within the '8' and, again, looked at patterns. I noticed a distinct pattern in the output and attempted to apply the same pivot-to-endpoint idea used in Ex. 1, which didn't seem to work, I eventually decided the outputs might be a filling operation to create a rectangular output from the region (a kind of flood fill). Again, I extracted the grids for each region, and compared against the Ex 2 output. This eventually led me to the idea of the region itself being transformed.\n\nI then revisited Ex. 1 with the \"Connect Pivot to Targets\" idea and applied it again to Ex 2. I extracted the grids, this time confirming the extraction accuracy, and looked at what would be the best \"Pivot\" color. Again, the problem was defined as an L-shape filling.\n\nIn analyzing the test input, I again looked for '6' frames in a 30x30 input and noted that both, the test input and Ex 1 had the \"frame\" color '6' inside the main region. I then extracted those regions and applied the same logic of identifying a \"Pivot\", targets and path to these pixels. The output should be 6x6. With Ex 1 and Ex 2 in hand, I can construct the test output as predicted.\n\nThe problem requires us to identify a transformation rule based on the provided examples and apply it to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of Example 1:**\nThe input grid (30x30) contains several rectangular \"frames\" of color `4` (yellow). Inside these frames, there are 5x5 regions of pixels.\n- Top-Left (TL) content has `1`s and `6`.\n- Top-Right (TR) content has `1`s and `6`.\n- Bottom-Left (BL) content has a `6` at (1,0) and `2`s at (1,4) and (4,0). The rest is `0`.\n- Bottom-Right (BR) is empty.\n\nThe output grid (5x5) is:\n```\n0,0,0,0,0\n6,2,2,2,2\n2,0,0,0,0\n2,0,0,0,0\n2,0,0,0,0\n```\nComparing the BL box to the output, we see a match in structure. The `6` acts as a \"Pivot\" or corner. The `2`s act as \"Targets\". The output connects the Pivot to the Targets with lines of color `2` (the target color).\n- Path 1: From `6` (1,0) to `2` (1,4) -> Horizontal line.\n- Path 2: From `6` (1,0) to `2` (4,0) -> Vertical line.\nThe other boxes (TL, TR) contained `1`s which did not appear in the output, implying they are noise or inactive. The presence of distinct colors `6` and `2` in BL likely marks it as the active region.\n\n**Analysis of Example 2:**\nThe input contains frames of color `8` (teal). The boxes are 4x4.\n- The Bottom-Right (RB) box contains `2`s.\n- The output (4x4) contains `2`s forming a pattern that relates to the `2`s in the RB box.\nAlthough the pattern in Example 2 is more complex (possibly involving boundary projection), the core principle remains: identify the \"active\" box (the one with the output colors) and process it.\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n- The grid contains frames of color `6` (magenta) and `3` (green).\n- We look for a box containing a \"Pivot\" and \"Targets\" pattern similar to Example 1.\n- Scanning the grid, we find a 6x6 region in the Bottom-Right (BR), bordered by `6`s.\n- Coordinates of BR content: Rows 18-23 (0-based indices inside the box 0-5), Columns 17-22 (0-based indices inside the box 0-5).\n- Content of BR box:\n  - Row 0 (Grid Row 18): `0,0,0,0,8,0` -> `8` at position (0,4).\n  - Row 1 (Grid Row 19): `0,0,0,0,6,8` -> `6` at position (1,4), `8` at position (1,5).\n  - All other rows are empty (`0`).\n- Here, `6` is distinct and likely the Pivot (consistent with Example 1 where `6` was the pivot).\n- The `8`s are the Targets.\n- The pattern forms an 'L' shape: `8` at (0,4) is above `6` at (1,4). `8` at (1,5) is to the right of `6` at (1,4).\n- Since the targets are adjacent to the pivot, the \"lines\" connecting them are of length 1 (the pixels themselves).\n- No other fill is required.\n\n**Transformation Rule:**\n1. Locate the 6x6 box containing the Pivot (`6`) and Target (`8`) colors. This is the Bottom-Right box.\n2. Generate an output grid of the same size (6x6).\n3. Reproduce the Pivot and Target pixels, filling the connecting linear paths with the Target color.\n4. In this case, the paths are just the points themselves.\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\n- Position (0,4): `8`\n- Position (1,4): `6` (Pivot)\n- Position (1,5): `8`\n- All other cells: `0`\n\nOutput Grid:\n0,0,0,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,6,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n\n0,0,0,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,6,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0",

With only two example pairs, there are many qualitatively different hypotheses that all fit those examples but produce different outputs for the test input. I tried to constrain the possibilities by:\n\n- Checking for simple downsampling/block-aggregation schemes (e.g., 6\u00d76 or 7\u00d77 blocks) based on majority color or presence of \u201cspecial\u201d colors (0, 6, 8).\n- Looking for bounding-box or segmentation rules based on the large structured regions of 0s and 8s in each training input.\n- Considering interpretations where the small output encodes the coarse shape or adjacency pattern of those regions.\n\nHowever, every concrete rule I can define that matches both training pairs either contradicts some parts of the training data on closer inspection, or becomes too underdetermined to generalize uniquely to the test grid. In other words, I can\u2019t find a single transformation that:\n\n1. Explains all details of both provided input\u2013output pairs, and  \n2. Leads to a well-defined, non-arbitrary procedure for the new test input.\n\nUnder those conditions, any specific output grid I might give you for the test case would just be a guess, not the result of a genuinely inferred rule.\n\nSo, to stay honest and not fabricate a transformation or an answer, I have to stop here and say: I can\u2019t solve this ARC task reliably from the information given, and I\u2019m not going to output a pretend \u201csolution grid\u201d that isn\u2019t actually supported by a consistent rule.",

Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to identify the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\nIn both examples, I observe:\n1. Large regions bounded by one value (1s in Ex1, 4s/2s in Ex2)\n2. Within these, smaller sub-regions bounded by another value (4s in Ex1, 8s in Ex2)\n3. These sub-regions contain patterns with 0s, a marker value (6 in Ex1, 8 in Ex2), and fill values\n\nThe transformation appears to:\n1. Extract 4 sub-region interiors (arranged in 2x2: upper-left/right, lower-left/right)\n2. XOR diagonal pairs (upper-left with lower-right, upper-right with lower-left)\n3. XOR those results together\n4. Replace non-marker values with the lower region's boundary color\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\nThe test input has:\n- Upper region bounded by 1s (rows 2-13)\n- Sub-regions bounded by 3s containing patterns with 8 (marker) and 3 (fill)\n- Lower region bounded by 4s (rows 16-26)  \n- Sub-regions bounded by 6s\n\nExtracting the 6\u00d76 interiors:\n- Interior A (upper-left): Has 8s and 3s in a symmetric pattern\n- Interior B (upper-right): Has 8s and one 3, mostly 0s\n- Interior C (lower-left): All 0s\n- Interior D (lower-right): Has 8 and 6 in specific positions\n\nComputing XOR operations:\n- (A XOR D) captures differences where only one has non-zero\n- (B XOR C) = B since C is all 0s\n- Final XOR of these two results\n\nThe 3s get replaced with 6 (lower region boundary color), while 8s (marker) are preserved where consistent.\n\n```\n0,0,6,6,0,0\n0,0,6,6,0,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,6,6,6,6,8\n0,8,6,6,8,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task Summary - My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task. My job is to figure out the rule that transforms the input grids into their corresponding outputs, based on a couple of examples and a test input.  My process? I'm going to carefully analyze the examples for patterns, focusing on things like the size changes, repeated elements, and how colors shift around.  Then I\u2019ll try to apply that rule to the new, unseen test case.\n\nThe examples are 30x30 input grids transformed to 5x5 outputs. My mind goes immediately to looking for shapes, particularly rectangular or square regions.  I see patterns of repeating numbers (1,2,3,4) that I think represent some kind of noise or background. I'm hoping to identify the *real* \"objects\" that are being transformed. \n\nIn Example 1, I find these yellow (color 4) frames. These boxes are like containers. The 5x5 Output feels like it is the interior of that frame but it's not simply an extraction. The internal numbers are not just a slice. Then I consider connecting lines, it also did not solve it. In contrast, Example 2 has teal (color 8) frames, and it seems like the output is an inverted version of what\u2019s inside, but still not very convincing.\n\nSo I am back to square one, trying to figure out what ties the examples together.  \n\nMy next thought is about how the outputs seem to use the same colors as the inputs but rearrange them. Perhaps the output is a combination of operations or a function on the input. I have to admit I'm getting a little stuck here.\n\nSo the breakthrough comes from focusing on the presence of the color red (color 2).  I notice both examples' rules hinge on finding a red box (or something containing the color 2). Example 1 has an L-shaped structure, whereas Example 2 performs an Inversion.\n\nAfter this light-bulb moment, I start my attention on the test input, trying to look for these \"special\" boxes. It looks like the most prominent feature is a Magenta (color 6) framed area with teal (color 8) content.  Then I started applying the inversion logic.\n\nSince the inversion seemed to happen in both previous cases, I assume this holds, and I proceed with that.  I'm trying to figure out which pixel is important (e.g., is there noise, or just a simple shift?). Because `6` is present inside that frame, and is the frame color, I end up hypothesizing that this is the area I want, and I proceed with the inverted mapping. After some consideration if the frame color should be included in the content or not.\n\nI double-check to make sure it matches the inversion principle. My final prediction is an inversion of the magenta (6) frame content in test input to form a 5x6 size structure. So the inverted result is:\n\n8 8 8 8 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n\n\nThe problem involves identifying a specific region (subgrid) within the large input grid and applying a transformation to it.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Example 1:**\n    *   **Frame Identification:** There are multiple rectangular frames defined by colors. We find a Yellow (4) frame at the bottom-left.\n    *   **Content:** Inside this frame, there is a sparse arrangement of pixels: a Magenta (6) pixel and two Red (2) pixels.\n    *   **Transformation:** The output is a 5x5 grid (matching the frame's interior size). The transformation connects the Magenta pixel to the Red pixels using paths of Red (2), filling the empty space between them. The background (0) remains 0 elsewhere? No, in Example 2 it's an inversion. Let's look at Example 2.\n\n2.  **Example 2:**\n    *   **Frame Identification:** There are multiple Teal (8) frames.\n    *   **Content:** The frame at the bottom-right contains Red (2) pixels scattered in a pattern, with Black (0) background.\n    *   **Transformation:** The output is a 4x4 grid (matching the frame's interior size). The pattern is an **inversion** of the input content.\n        *   Input Empty (0) $\\rightarrow$ Output Red (2).\n        *   Input Red (2) $\\rightarrow$ Output Black (0).\n    *   The output color (2) matches the unique non-background content color inside the frame.\n\n**Synthesis of Rule:**\n*   Locate the \"active\" frame. In both examples, this is the frame containing a unique color that contrasts with the frame border and the global noise. In Example 2, the Red (2) content stands out against the Teal (8) frame and background.\n*   Extract the interior of the active frame.\n*   Perform an **Inversion/Fill** operation. The Empty (0) space is filled with the object color. The Object pixels become Empty (0).\n*   If the input implies a connection (Example 1), the logic is similar: the empty space between key points is filled. However, Example 2 is the more direct \"Invert\" mapping (0 $\\leftrightarrow$ Color).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Frame Search:** The input contains large frames of Blue (1) and Yellow (4). Inside the bottom Yellow frame (rows 16-26), there are two distinct Magenta (6) frames.\n    *   **Left Magenta Frame:** Interior is all Black (0).\n    *   **Right Magenta Frame:** Bounded by cols 16 and 23, rows 18 and 24.\n        *   Interior Indices: Rows 19-23 (5 rows), Cols 17-22 (6 columns).\n        *   Interior Content (Row 19): `0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 8`.\n        *   Other rows are empty (0).\n*   **Active Box:** The Right Magenta Frame contains Teal (8), which is a unique object color inside the frame (distinct from the Empty 0). The Magenta (6) pixel inside is the same color as the frame, likely acting as a \"wall\" or solid structure rather than empty space.\n*   **Transformation:** Apply the Inversion Rule.\n    *   **Target Color:** Teal (8).\n    *   **Mapping:**\n        *   Empty (0) $\\rightarrow$ Teal (8).\n        *   Object/Solid (8 and 6) $\\rightarrow$ Empty (0). (Treating the frame-colored pixel 6 and the object pixel 8 both as \"solid\" to be inverted to 0).\n*   **Execution on 5x6 Grid:**\n    *   Row 0 (Input `0,0,0,0,6,8`): Becomes `8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0`.\n    *   Rows 1-4 (Input `0,0,0,0,0,0`): Become `8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8`.\n\nThe final output is a 5x6 grid of Teal (8) with two holes (0) in the top-right corner corresponding to the solid pixels in the input.\n\n8,8,8,8,0,0\n8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8",

For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, here's what I'm thinking:**\n\nThe task at hand involves taking a large, noisy grid as input and transforming it into a smaller output grid, essentially summarizing the visual information in a specific way. The examples provided (Ex 1 and Ex 2) give me some clues, and the test input is where I have to apply the logic.\n\n**Initial Observations:**\n\nThe input grids are filled with repeating patterns or noise, but within them, distinct rectangular structures are present. These structures are framed with colors and also have \"windows\" inside that contain specific colored pixels or sometimes nothing at all. The output grids are much smaller and contain only a few colors.\n\n**Analyzing Example 1:**\n\nIn the first example, I see a 30x30 grid with a repeating background pattern (`1,2,3,4`). Inside this noise, there are two main regions: a blue (or sometimes yellow!) top cluster and a red (or sometimes yellow!) bottom cluster, each with its own internal layout.  The structures are not single-colored boxes but are frames with smaller 'windows' inside that have black interiors. And here is where it gets interesting: one of those black windows in each region contains a magenta pixel. I try to understand the logic behind this by analyzing the raw pixel data and how these colors are arranged in the 30x30 input.\n\nI initially thought the output was a downscaled version of the input, but the output size (5x5) and arrangement of the colors don't seem like a direct reduction.  I realize that the background noise (`1,2,3,4`) is irrelevant, and the structures are what's important. I hypothesize that the output reflects the presence and connectivity of these structures within the noisy grid.\n\nI see that the 5x5 output has magenta (6) and red (2) and I try to relate these colors to the input. The magenta pixel (6) is what defines the 'key' or 'start'. The magenta dots are placed inside the frames, and my initial hypothesis is that each frame represents a cell. The two input structures are connected visually; I need to figure out how this is represented in the output. I also realized that magenta is the 'key' item, and Red represents some form of 'connected path' in the input grid.\n\nThe output 5x5 is not a direct scale-down of the input, and I shift towards a mapping rule. Maybe the 5x5 grid is a visualization of the layout of the regions in the input. Each pixel of the grid represents a larger block of the 30x30 input.\n\n**Analyzing Example 2:**\n\nExample 2 reinforces my idea of the key role played by the rectangular boxes and their specific colors.  In this case, the output is 4x4, and I see a \"path-like\" output (U-Shape) that reflects the layout of the input boxes. The key color changes in this example (from magenta to red), but the general principle is the same: the output highlights the 'active' structures, possibly by showing their connections.\n\n**Test Input Analysis and Hypotheses Refinement**\n\nFor the test input, I need to understand what defines a valid path. I need to understand how the 'color' information in the input is mapped to the 'path' representation in the output.  My initial hypothesis is that if an element (e.g. key) is present, we represent its presence in the Output. A grid (the output) that represents 'Active Structures' by coloring.\n\nThe first thing I did was to locate those important rectangular boxes in the input. In the Test Input, there are multiple key areas (TL, TR, BL, and BR) in different positions.  One has unique content. If I can figure out how to associate the colors in the output grid with the 'boxes', I can solve the task.\n\nI then realized that instead of directly mapping input pixels to output pixels, I can subdivide the input into blocks corresponding to the output grid dimensions. The core idea becomes: Identify the presence and connections of structural elements and reflect them using specific colors in the output grid. The presence of key colored items in the input structure affects how the output grid is colored.  I look at the arrangement of key structures, what color is used, and how it maps to output grid. I am trying to see the connections between boxes and translate those connections to colors.\n\nThe core rule becomes: only map the \"rooms\" or rectangular structures that have \"Content\".  I'll start with a 4x4 Output. My output will then depend on two steps. First is identifying the boxes that represent valid structures. I need to verify that all blocks in the final solution match this expectation.\n\nI will use the frame color and content color to establish if that structure needs to be represented in the Output or not.\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a large 30x30 input grid into a smaller output grid (5x5 or 4x4) based on the patterns found in the solved examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** 30x30 grid with a repeating background pattern `1,2,3,4`. Two large clusters of \"rooms\" are visible: a top pair framed in blue (`1`) containing yellow (`4`) boxes, and a bottom pair framed in red (`2`) containing yellow (`4`) boxes.\n    *   **Content:** Inside the yellow boxes are black (`0`) regions.\n        *   Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), and Bottom-Left (BL) boxes contain a magenta (`6`) pixel.\n        *   Bottom-Right (BR) box contains only black (`0`).\n    *   **Output:** 5x5 grid.\n        *   Row 1: `6, 2, 2, 2, 2`\n        *   Column 0 (from row 1 downwards): `6, 2, 2, 2, 2` (vertical)\n        *   Other cells are `0`.\n    *   **Interpretation:** The output is a map of the connected, \"active\" rooms. A room is active if it contains a special item (non-black pixel). Here, `6` is the item. The room containing the first instance (TL) is marked `6`. The path to other active rooms (TR, BL) is marked with `2` (Red). The inactive room (BR) is not mapped (marked `0`).\n\n2.  **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** 30x30 grid with background pattern `4,1,2,3,0`. Two large vertical structures: Left (Yellow frame) and Right (Red frame).\n    *   **Content:** Both structures contain windows with teal (`8`) pixels inside. All 4 \"rooms\" (Top/Bottom of Left/Right structures) appear to contain `8`.\n    *   **Output:** 4x4 grid.\n        *   The grid contains `2`s (Red) forming a connected shape that roughly corresponds to the layout of the structures (Left column, Right column, and a connecting bridge).\n    *   **Interpretation:** Since all rooms are active (contain `8`), the entire structure is mapped. The color `2` is used for the structure map. No unique \"start\" color is used, possibly because `8` maps to `2` or there isn't a single \"root\". The grid size 4x4 roughly corresponds to the 30x30 input with a pattern period of 5 (keeping central area).\n\n**Analysis of Test Input:**\n\n*   **Input:** 30x30 grid. Background pattern `2,3,4,5,6` (Period 5).\n*   **Grid Size:** Period 5 suggests a **4x4** output grid (similar to Example 2).\n*   **Structures:** There are 4 \"rooms\" located at the corners of the central area.\n    *   **Top-Left (TL):** Frame `8` (Teal), Content `3` (Green).\n    *   **Top-Right (TR):** Frame `3` (Green), Content `0` (Black).\n    *   **Bottom-Left (BL):** Frame `6` (Magenta), Content `0` (Black).\n    *   **Bottom-Right (BR):** Frame `6` (Magenta), Content `0` (Black).\n*   **Connectivity & Activity:**\n    *   The **TL** room is the only one with non-black content (`3`). This makes it the \"Start\" or \"Root\" node. It should be represented by its content color, **3** (Green).\n    *   The **TR** room is empty (`0`), but its **Frame** is `3` (Green). This matches the content of the TL room, implying a strong connection or that TR is \"activated\" by TL.\n    *   The **BL** and **BR** rooms are empty (`0`) and their frames are `6` (Magenta). There is no source of `6` content to activate them. Thus, they are considered inactive/disconnected.\n*   **Mapping:**\n    *   We map the active component: TL connected to TR.\n    *   Location: Top row of the 4x4 grid.\n    *   Start Node (TL): Color `3`.\n    *   Path/Connected Node (TR): Color `2` (Red), following the convention from Example 1 where connected nodes form a red path.\n    *   The Bottom row (BL, BR) is inactive, so it remains `0`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe output should be a 4x4 grid. The top row maps the connection from the Top-Left room to the Top-Right room. The cell corresponding to TL is `3` (Green). The path to TR is filled with `2` (Red). The rest of the grid is empty `0` (Black).\n\nOutput Grid:\n```\n3 2 2 2\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n```\n\n3,2,2,2\n0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this ARC task:**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to create a 5x5 output grid based on a 30x30 input grid, using two provided examples as guides. I need to figure out what the \"logic\" is. The input looks a bit like a map or a maze. I'm seeing patterns of numbers (like 1, 2, 3, 4) in the background. The key seems to be these distinct \"rooms\" or structures outlined in different colors. The input has rectangular structures with either yellow or red outlines and some internal features.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the output is a 5x5 grid, and the first thought is that the output describes the \"shape\" of the main structures.  I think the 30x30 grid is being divided into a 5x5 grid of 6x6 \"blocks\". Then I check the contents of each block, and it seems the output relates to the arrangement of the \"rooms\" and their contents. The color in the output is determined somehow by the colors within the corresponding input blocks. I see the colors 2 (Red) and 6 (Pink) play a role. The output looks like a path or a connecting layout between important locations.\n\nThe output color 6 (Pink) probably means a \"start\". The Output shape makes an L, and the L is made of the color 2 (Red). The main idea: 30x30 input is mapped to a 5x5 output. The 5x5 output shows the main layout of the \"rooms\" or \"blocks\" that are in the input.\n\nExample 2 is similar but is a 4x4 output. It does not have a \"start\". It is two separate components. I see a structure with a Yellow outline on the left and a structure with a Red outline on the right.  The output shows some kind of paths of Red. No specific start here.\n\nThe Test Input is also 30x30. It probably has a 5x5 or a 4x4 output as well.  The output shape should match the underlying shape. The input should contain the key \"rooms\", their relationships, and the layout. The goal is to draw the skeleton of the scene based on markers. I'm hunting for the main structure, the main \"rooms\", and how to connect them. I will draw a basic shape that makes a line among key rooms. The logic of Ex 2 must be combined with the new one: I have 4 important rooms. 20 markers. The goal is now draw a path that includes them: draw the lines that represent main roads and features. The output should be 2s and 0s and have no 6.\n\nMy plan is to find the meaningful regions in the input. In the test input, the key markers are 8 (Teal). I'll figure out where the main regions are, like in previous examples. Then I need to determine the main structure: Is it a line? An L? Or a more complex path? I'll probably apply the logic of the simple line with a branch to the test input.\n\nThere's no Pink marker here to indicate the \"start\", but there are similar rooms with the Teal markers. I will mark the centers of those rooms and connect them by drawing a path. A \"skeleton\" map of the main structures seems likely. Because the basic shape of test data has an underlying \"3 main blocks\" structure, it's very probable that my output will have at least 3 blocks as well. It's likely that it will be a 5x5 matrix. The plan is to draw a simple shape that connects the regions of interest (the Teal rooms). There are walls (1s). The goal is to show the connected layout of the Teal-marked areas. Now the logic: if the path has to pass through, then a 5x5 shape may make a line. No cycle.\n\nI'm thinking about the shape of this grid, and looking at example 1. In example 1, I saw an L shape. I have multiple points to include. One simple path will include all the key markers. There are 4 locations to cover, and my line will follow the layout of these markers. So I'll go for the most likely layout, which is 5x5 and the 2x2 horizontal and vertical branches. Then connect it with some vertical line. The solution uses the column 1.\n\n\nThe goal of the task is to interpret the input grid as a map of \"rooms\" containing specific markers, and then output a simplified 5x5 grid representing the connectivity path between these rooms.\n\n**Analysis of the Rules:**\n1.  **Grid Mapping:** The input is a 30x30 grid. The output is a 5x5 grid. This implies a scaling factor where each 6x6 block of the input corresponds to one cell in the output.\n2.  **Markers:**\n    *   In Example 1, the markers were Pink (6) pixels inside \"rooms\" (black areas surrounded by colored frames).\n    *   In Example 2, the markers were Teal (8) pixels inside rooms.\n    *   In the Test Input, the markers are Teal (8) pixels inside rooms.\n3.  **Path Construction:**\n    *   The output consists of a Red (2) path on a Black (0) background.\n    *   The path connects all the regions containing markers.\n    *   The geometry of the path appears to be a rectilinear tree (using rows and columns) that connects the marker locations.\n    *   In Example 1, markers were at (1,0), (1,4), and (4,0). The path formed an 'L' shape using Row 1 and Column 0 (pivoting at (1,0)).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Locate Markers (Teal 8s) in the 30x30 grid:**\n    *   **TL Room (Top-Left):** Located roughly in rows 6-10, columns 6-12. Center is approx (8, 9). Mapping to 5x5 grid (dividing by 6): Row 1, Col 1 -> **(1,1)**.\n    *   **TR Room (Top-Right):** Located roughly in rows 6-10, columns 20-28. Center is approx (8, 24). Mapping to 5x5 grid: Row 1, Col 4 -> **(1,4)**.\n    *   **BL Room (Bottom-Left):** Located roughly in rows 22-30, columns 4-10. Center is approx (26, 7). Mapping to 5x5 grid: Row 4, Col 1 -> **(4,1)**.\n    *   **BR Room (Bottom-Right):** Located roughly in rows 19-25, columns 17-23. Center is approx (22, 20). Mapping to 5x5 grid: Row 3, Col 3 -> **(3,3)**.\n\n2.  **Construct the Path:**\n    *   We have markers at **(1,1)**, **(1,4)**, **(4,1)**, and **(3,3)**.\n    *   We need a path of Red (2) cells to connect them.\n    *   **Pivot Point:** (1,1) aligns horizontally with (1,4) and vertically with (4,1). This makes (1,1) a natural hub.\n    *   **Vertical Trunk:** Connect (1,1) to (4,1) via **Column 1**. Cells: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1).\n    *   **Horizontal Branch 1:** Connect (1,1) to (1,4) via **Row 1**. Cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4).\n    *   **Horizontal Branch 2:** We need to connect (3,3). The closest point on our existing structure is (3,1) on the vertical trunk. Connect (3,1) to (3,3) via **Row 3**. Cells: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3).\n\n3.  **Final Output Grid Generation:**\n    *   Initialize a 5x5 grid with 0s.\n    *   Set the calculated path cells to 2.\n    *   Row 0: All 0.\n    *   Row 1: Cells 1, 2, 3, 4 are 2. -> `0, 2, 2, 2, 2`\n    *   Row 2: Cell 1 is 2 (part of trunk). -> `0, 2, 0, 0, 0`\n    *   Row 3: Cells 1, 2, 3 are 2 (trunk + branch to BR). -> `0, 2, 2, 2, 0`\n    *   Row 4: Cell 1 is 2 (end of trunk at BL). -> `0, 2, 0, 0, 0`\n\n0,0,0,0,0\n0,2,2,2,2\n0,2,0,0,0\n0,2,2,2,0\n0,2,0,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**High\u2011level interpretation of the task**\n\nIn all three grids (two examples + the test) the \u201cinteresting\u201d structure is formed by large rectangular regions of color `0` (black) which are framed by other colors.  \nThe colorful background of repeating patterns (1\u20136 etc.) is irrelevant noise.\n\nThe transformation is:\n\n1. **Detect the large 0\u2011rectangles.**  \n   Ignore small isolated zeros; keep only maximal rectangles of zeros (height and width at least ~4\u20135 cells).  \n   - Example 1 has four such rectangles arranged roughly in a 2\u00d72 pattern.  \n   - Example 2 has a larger composite pattern of such rectangles along left and right.  \n   - The test grid has three main 0\u2011rectangles:  \n     \u2022 top\u2011right,  \n     \u2022 bottom\u2011left,  \n     \u2022 bottom\u2011right.\n\n2. **Map the arrangement of these rectangles into a small square grid.**  \n   - The small grid is just a coarse diagram of where the big 0\u2011rectangles sit relative to one another.  \n   - Connections between rectangles (sharing row or column in the big grid) are drawn as straight horizontal/vertical bars.  \n   - These bars are drawn with color `2`.  \n   - Where a horizontal and vertical bar meet (i.e. where connections intersect), that intersection cell is marked with color `6`.  \n   - All other cells in the small grid are `0`.\n\n3. **Size of the output grid.**  \n   The number and layout of rectangles in each puzzle dictate a minimal diagram that still preserves the connectivity pattern:\n   - Example 1: three effective \u201cnodes\u201d (one corner is redundant) \u2192 a 5\u00d75 L\u2011shaped diagram.\n   - Example 2: rectangles arranged more compactly \u2192 a 4\u00d74 diagram with an E\u2011like skeleton.\n   - Test: three nodes again (top\u2011right, bottom\u2011right, bottom\u2011left), but orientation mirrored relative to Example 1, so we again use a 5\u00d75 grid whose L\u2011shape connects:\n     - top\u2011right node down to bottom\u2011right,\n     - bottom\u2011right node left to bottom\u2011left.  \n     Intersection (bottom\u2011right corner of the L) is `6`.\n\nFollowing this rule for the test grid:\n\n- We place a vertical bar of `2`s along the **right side** (representing the top\u2011right to bottom\u2011right relation).\n- We place a horizontal bar of `2`s along the **second\u2011from\u2011bottom row** (representing the bottom\u2011right to bottom\u2011left relation).\n- Their intersection cell is colored `6`.\n- All other cells are `0`.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n5\u00d75 grid:\n\n0,0,0,0,2  \n0,0,0,0,2  \n0,0,0,0,2  \n2,2,2,2,6  \n0,0,0,0,0",

In the test grid the only such regions are the two large rectangular zero blocks in the lower part of the grid, so the configuration of selected regions matches that of the second training example: a single row with two items.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Inference and Mapping for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I'm given some solved examples and I need to figure out the rule and apply it to a new input. It's all about visual transformations \u2013 large grids of numbers get shrunk down and turned into smaller grids. My initial thoughts are to look for patterns, and I've got some clues: outputs are \"thumbnails,\" backgrounds relate to container borders, and inner frames become solid blocks. The color of these solid blocks depends on the \"innermost\" pixel of the original frame.\n\nLooking at Example 1, I analyze it in detail. I spot a red container with a complex inside.  I map the hints, trying to understand what the 0, 2, and 6 values mean in the output. I zero in on specific colored borders and nested structures. I analyze the \"6\" in the output, searching for its source in the input.\n\nExample 2 throws some new colors into the mix, and I try to find those structures in both input and output. I'm trying to match an output color with its corresponding input container border. I scrutinize the pixel arrangements.\n\nThen, I'm thinking, maybe the container is a complete shape, or even just some part of the shapes, or maybe just some section in the shapes. I realize the structure of frames might be important. I start looking for a pattern inside the example inputs.\n\nI start to zero in on how these are constructed. I have to look carefully for the input to see what's happening. And, how can I map that to the output? I get the idea that a thumbnail means there's a smaller grid representing a structure in a container.\n\nI try to visualize and then I switch gears to the test input. It's about finding the container, now. This involves finding shapes that are a collection of pixels and then a pixel inside, like a small container.\n\nI identify the container based on its yellow border and the frames inside. I look at each color, tracing the values and their layouts.\n\nI have a hypothesis: I should extract a simplified visual mapping of frames, but I need to figure out how.\n\nI think about scaling, or a pixel art style conversion.\n\nI start looking at specific color pixels inside the inputs.\n\nI try all these ideas: mapping the pixel values, and transforming them.\n\nI then start to look at all of the numbers and all of the color values for Ex 1 again, comparing them to what I see in the input. I have to map them to the 5x5. I focus on where the 0s are, and where the 6 is. I'm focusing on \"Thumbnail\" hint. I'm thinking of a 5x5 arrangement of 4-boxes.\n\nI move onto Ex 2 now, with 0s and 2s to interpret.\n\nI try to go to the container to show how I'm thinking. I have to find a correlation between the inside and the outside, and then how I might convert it into a simple format.\n\nThen, I come up with a new, simplified rule and start applying it to the test input.\n\nI'm thinking, \"inner hollow frame\" = \"solid block\". So I'm now taking all of the values inside.\n\nI then focus on the test input. It contains two frames. Now, the main question is: What should the output grid look like. Should I use one of the existing examples as reference or find the rule in the input? What's the output format, given the two frame setup? Maybe it should be 4x4 or 5x5 like the examples, given the number of shapes.\n\nI then go on the output shape. I want the most relevant values. I want the borders to be there. I am thinking, \"should it be symmetrical?\".\nI keep comparing against the examples. I now know I need to create a thumbnail and have a border.\n\nI'm now back to applying it to the test input. How big is my output going to be? I know to use an existing thumbnail shape size to apply.\n\nI use a final check and apply my solution.\n\nThe problem asks us to extract a \"thumbnail\" or \"map\" of a specific container from the input grid. Based on the examples and hints, the process is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Container:** Find the prominent rectangular container in the input grid.\n    *   In Example 1, the container had a Red (2) border.\n    *   In Example 2, the relevant container structure involved Red (2) and Teal (8) elements, with the output background being Red (2).\n    *   In the **Test Input**, there is a clear container defined by a **Yellow (4)** border roughly between rows 16 and 26.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Content:** Inside the identified container, look for \"inner hollow frames\" or sub-structures.\n    *   In the Test Input, inside the Yellow (4) container (rows ~17-25), there are two distinct frames defined by **Magenta (6)** borders.\n    *   These frames are arranged side-by-side: one on the **left** and one on the **right**.\n\n3.  **Determine Block Colors:** The \"hollow frames\" are transformed into \"solid blocks\" in the output. The color of the solid block is determined by the \"innermost\" pixel or content of the frame.\n    *   **Left Frame:** Examining the interior of the left Magenta (6) frame (e.g., rows 19-24, cols ~3-9), the space is empty, filled with **Black (0)** pixels (voids). Thus, the Left Frame becomes a **Solid Block of 0**.\n    *   **Right Frame:** Examining the interior of the right Magenta (6) frame (e.g., rows 18-24, cols ~16-22), we find **Teal (8)** pixels (e.g., at row 18). Thus, the Right Frame becomes a **Solid Block of 8**.\n\n4.  **Construct the Output Map:** Create a simplified grid (thumbnail) representing these blocks on the container's background color.\n    *   **Background Color:** The container border is Yellow (4), so the output background is **4**.\n    *   **Layout:** The frames are arranged Left (0) and Right (8).\n    *   **Resolution:** Based on the examples (5x5 and 4x4), a 4x4 grid is appropriate to represent this side-by-side structure with a margin.\n    *   The map should show the background (4) surrounding the two blocks (0 and 8).\n\n    **Predicted Output Grid (4x4):**\n    *   Row 0: All background (4).\n    *   Row 1: Left block (0), Right block (8), surrounded/separated by background (4).\n    *   Row 2: Left block (0), Right block (8), surrounded/separated by background (4).\n    *   Row 3: All background (4).\n\n    Structure:\n    4, 4, 4, 4\n    4, 0, 8, 4\n    4, 0, 8, 4\n    4, 4, 4, 4\n\n    (Note: The separation between blocks aligns with the gap in the input.)\n\noutput:\n4,4,4,4\n4,0,8,4\n4,0,8,4\n4,4,4,4",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown**\n\nOkay, the user wants me to tackle an ARC task. I'm presented with two example inputs and one test input that all seem related to visual pattern recognition within grids. My initial thought is to figure out the underlying logic by looking at the examples and identifying the features that define the output.\n\n**Understanding the Input and Output**\n\nThe input grids are large and noisy, filled with repeating patterns or what I will refer to as \"background noise\". Inside, however, are distinct rectangular structures. These structures have a border of a particular color and contain content. The output grids are significantly smaller. They appear to be a simplified representation of some part of the input. I need to figure out the rules for selecting and transforming the input into the output.\n\n**Focusing on the Key Hints**\n\nThe provided hints are crucial. Here\u2019s how I interpret them:\n\n*   **\"Output acts as a simplified 'thumbnail' or 'map' of one specific container from the input.\"** This narrows the scope. We\u2019re not working with the entire grid, but with a *specific region* that I need to identify in each input.\n*   **\"Background color of the output corresponds to the border color of the selected container.\"** This is the key link between the input and the output. I should look for a correspondence between the border color of a region in the input and the background color of the output.\n*   **\"Inner hollow frames are transformed into solid blocks.\"** This seems to indicate that the internal structure within this region matters. I need to understand how the hollow frames in the input relate to the solid blocks in the output.\n*   **\"Color of these solid blocks is determined by the 'innermost' pixel ... e.g., a pink dot turns the whole block pink.\"** This tells me that the *color* of the internal frames affects the color of the output block.\n\n**Analyzing Example 1 and Pattern Identification**\n\n*   I start by finding the \"Red\" (border `2`) region in Example 1. After carefully looking I see it. It has other internal borders or frames as well (`4`). I will try to map the Red region to the output.\n*   I start with the assumption that the output\u2019s background color (`2` in example 1) matches a container's border color.\n*   I look inside the example 1 Red box and recognize the yellow (`4`) hollow frames and contents.\n*   The hint about inner pixels tells me that blocks may exist within a larger frame.\n*   There's also a Blue (`1`) container. Its contents and relationship to output are unclear at first.\n*   Let's check the size and content of the output. It is `5x5`. There are `0`, `2`, and `6` colors in this output, and their spatial layout. The hint of mapping the blocks in space is key here.\n\n**Refining the Theory and Checking Example 2**\n\n*   By re-reading the hints, I'm almost certain that picking a correct container with internal blocks is important for solving the task.\n*   The Example 2 Output has background `2`. This matches the output grid's dominant color.\n*   By tracing a Red (border `2`) container, I see that the output relates to frames inside, which can have an `8`.\n*   The large container may contain several boxes.\n*   Example 2 Output shows an interesting shape or layout of features that may correspond to blocks in the input.\n\n**Looking into the Test Input**\n\n*   I identify two clear containers in the test input. One is Blue, the other is Yellow.\n*   With example 1 in mind, I assume one of those is the right container. I will pick the Yellow, with border `4`, to map. The key is in the solid frames and their content.\n*   By going through the yellow container and their frames, I see two large rectangular blocks within this yellow container.\n*   These are border `6` with either `0` or `8` inside. They map to `0` and `8`.\n\n**Establishing Mapping Rules**\n\n*   After a detailed review, the hint: \"the color of the solid blocks is determined by the innermost pixel found within the frame\" is key here. This creates an abstract map. The frames in the selected region should be solid.\n*   If a frame has internal `0`s, it becomes a `0`. An `8` turns to a solid `8`.\n*   The background matches border `4` to border `4`.\n*   The shape of the blocks is preserved, so solid-shaped blocks of pixels from frames are mapped.\n*   The horizontal layout of frames indicates columns in output. The vertical structure influences the rows.\n*   I\n\nThe task involves creating a simplified \"thumbnail\" map of a specific container found within the input grid.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Container:**\n    *   In Example 1, a container with a red border (color `2`) was selected.\n    *   In Example 2, a container with a red border (color `2`) seems to be the background context for the output (output background is `2`).\n    *   In the Test Input, we look for prominent containers. There is a blue (`1`) bordered container (Rows 4-13) and a yellow (`4`) bordered container (Rows 16-26).\n    *   Following the pattern (possibly selecting the bottom-most or the one with specific \"hollow frame\" content), we select the **Yellow Container** (Border `4`). The output background will therefore be `4`.\n\n2.  **Analyze Container Content:**\n    *   The Yellow Container spans Rows 16-26. The internal area is Rows 17-25.\n    *   Scanning the internal area for \"inner hollow frames\":\n        *   **Left Frame:** Located at the bottom-left of the container (Rows ~19-25, Cols ~4-11). It has a Magenta (`6`) border. Inside this frame, the pixels are Black (`0`). According to the hint, this frame becomes a solid block of its innermost color, which is **`0`**.\n        *   **Right Frame:** Located at the bottom-right of the container (Rows ~19-25, Cols ~17-22). It also has a Magenta (`6`) border. Inside this frame, there is a Teal (`8`) pixel (e.g., at Row 19). The innermost non-zero color determines the block color, so this becomes a solid block of **`8`**.\n        *   **Top Area:** The rows above these frames (Rows 16-18) contain noise/background pattern but no distinct hollow frames. This area maps to the background color **`4`**.\n        *   **Gap:** There is a gap between the left and right frames (Cols ~12-15). This maps to the background color **`4`**.\n\n3.  **Determine Output Grid Dimensions and Layout:**\n    *   The frames have a width of roughly 8 pixels, and the gap is roughly 4 pixels. The total width is roughly 20-22 pixels.\n    *   The ratio of Frame:Gap:Frame is approximately 2:1:2. This suggests a horizontal division into 5 units (2 units for left frame, 1 unit for gap, 2 units for right frame).\n    *   Vertically, the frames occupy the bottom ~70% of the container, with the top ~30% being empty. This fits a 5-unit vertical division (top 1 unit empty, bottom 4 units filled).\n    *   This implies a **5x5** output grid is appropriate (matching Example 1).\n\n4.  **Construct the Output Map:**\n    *   **Row 0:** Represents the top empty area -> All `4`s.\n    *   **Rows 1-4:** Represent the area with frames.\n        *   **Cols 0-1:** Left Frame -> `0`.\n        *   **Col 2:** Gap -> `4`.\n        *   **Cols 3-4:** Right Frame -> `8`.\n\n**Final Output Grid:**\n4,4,4,4,4\n0,0,4,8,8\n0,0,4,8,8\n0,0,4,8,8\n0,0,4,8,8\n\n4,4,4,4,4\n0,0,4,8,8\n0,0,4,8,8\n0,0,4,8,8\n0,0,4,8,8",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The output acts as a simplified \"thumbnail\" or \"map\" of one specific container from the input.\n*   The background color of the output corresponds to the border color of the selected container (ignoring the noisy texture inside).\n*   Inner hollow frames are transformed into solid blocks.\n*   The color of these solid blocks is determined by the \"innermost\" pixel found within the frame (e.g., a pink dot turns the whole block pink; a black void remains black).\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to identify the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\nIn Example 1:\n- There's a container bordered by 2s (rows 16-25, columns 5-23)\n- Inside are 4-bordered frames with inner content\n- One frame has markers (6 and 2), the other is all 0s\n- The output shows the markers with edges filled, background is 0\n\nIn Example 2:\n- Container bordered by 2s contains 8-bordered frames\n- The frame with markers (2s) has its content inverted (0s and 2s swapped)\n- Output uses the container border color (2) as background\n\n**Key insights from hints:**\n- Output is a thumbnail of a specific container\n- Background color = border color of selected container\n- 0s get replaced with the container's border color, preserving special markers\n\n**Analyzing Test Input:**\n\n1. There's a 4-bordered container at rows 16-26, columns 1-25\n2. Inside are 6-bordered frames:\n   - First frame (rows 18-25, cols 3-10): all 0s inside\n   - Second frame (rows 17-24, cols 16-23): has markers\n\nExtracting the second 6-bordered frame's inner content (rows 18-23, cols 17-22):\n```\n0,0,0,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,6,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n```\n\nMarkers: 8 at (0,4), 6 at (1,4), 8 at (1,5)\n\n**Applying the transformation:**\n- Container border color is 4\n- Replace 0s with 4 (background)\n- Preserve the markers (8 and 6)\n\nThis gives:\n```\n4,4,4,4,8,4\n4,4,4,4,6,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4\n```\n\n```\n4,4,4,4,8,4\n4,4,4,4,6,8\n4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4\n```",

to the border color of the selected container (ignoring the noisy texture inside).\n*   Inner hollow frames are transformed into solid blocks.\n*   The color of these solid blocks is determined by the \"innermost\" pixel found within the frame (e.g., a pink dot turns the whole block pink; a black void remains black).\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that

Markers in the interior determine the final pattern\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\nLooking at the test input, I can identify:\n- Outer container bounded by 4s (rows 16-26, columns 1-25)\n- Two inner containers bounded by 6s inside the 4-bounded region\n\nThe first 6-bounded container (rows 18-25, columns 3-10) has an interior that's essentially all zeros.\n\nThe second 6-bounded container (rows 17-24, columns 16-23) has interior (6x6):\n```\n0,0,0,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,6,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n```\n\nThis has markers: 8 at positions (0,4) and (1,5), and 6 at position (1,4).\n\n**Applying the Transformation:**\n\nFollowing the pattern from Example 2 where:\n- Empty cells (0) become the outer container's border color (4)\n- The special markers (8) get inverted to 0\n- The distinctive marker (6) indicates the innermost content and remains\n\nTransforming:\n- 0 \u2192 4 (background becomes outer border color)\n- 8 \u2192 0 (markers invert)\n- 6 \u2192 6 (innermost marker stays)\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n4,4,4,4,0,4\n4,4,4,4,6,0\n4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4,4\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The output acts as a simplified \"thumbnail\" or \"map\" of one specific container from the input.\n*   The background color of the output corresponds to the border color of the selected container (ignoring the noisy texture inside).\n*   Inner hollow frames are transformed into solid blocks.\n*   The color of these solid blocks is determined by the \"innermost\" pixel found within the frame (e.g., a pink dot turns the whole block pink; a black void remains black).\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that

In particular:\n\n- In each training example, there are many overlapping rectangular \u201ccontainers\u201d (frames) built from different colors (often with 0 or 8 and other colors like 2, 4, 6).\n- The given hints say that:\n  - The output is a \u201cthumbnail\u201d of one specific container.\n  - The background color of the **output** matches the **border color** of that chosen container.\n  - Nested hollow frames inside that container get turned into solid blocks.\n  - Each such block is colored by the innermost pixel inside that frame.\n- However, when I inspect the two training grids in detail, I cannot reliably identify:\n  - Which *single* container is selected in each case, and\n  - How the nested frames inside that container map to the exact small output patterns (for example, the 5\u00d75 pattern with 0, 2 and 6 in Example 1, and the 4\u00d74 pattern of 0 and 2 in Example 2).\n\nFor the test input, I can clearly see at least one very clean container:\n\n- Rows 19\u201326, columns 4\u201311:\n  - The outer border is all 6\u2019s.\n  - The entire interior (rows 20\u201325, columns 5\u201310) is 0\u2019s.\n  - There are no further colored pixels inside that 0-area; it\u2019s a uniform 6-border rectangle with a uniform 0 interior.\n\nThis is an unambiguous \u201ccontainer with one inner hollow frame of 0,\u201d but there are no additional, smaller frames or interior dots that would produce a rich thumbnail like in the examples (with multiple colors or a nontrivial pattern). Other zero-filled regions I can find in the test grid are either similar \u201cempty\u201d holes or have borders that are not cleanly of one color, and I can\u2019t match them in a way that reproduces the example behavior.\n\nBecause I cannot reliably generalize the exact selection rule for \u201cwhich container\u201d nor the mapping from nested frame structure to the small output pattern, any concrete output I produce would be essentially a guess rather than a well-founded solution.\n\nNonetheless, to give *some* concrete answer, I will treat that clean 6\u20130 container (rows 19\u201326, cols 4\u201311) as the chosen one, and I\u2019ll make the simplest possible \u201cthumbnail\u201d:\n\n- Border color 6 \u21d2 output background 6.\n- One inner hollow frame filled with 0 \u21d2 one 0 block in the thumbnail.\n- Minimal thumbnail size for one inner frame \u21d2 2\u00d72.\n\nSo I compress this container to a 2\u00d72 grid, with the lower-right cell representing the inner 0-region:\n\nFinal (guessed) output grid:\n6,6\n6,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Below I\u2019ll explain the reasoning I followed to interpret the transformation and then apply it to the test case. However, because of the extreme structural and color complexity in the training examples, and the lack of a cleanly isolatable \u201ccontainer\u201d that unambiguously matches the hints, what follows is necessarily a *hypothesis* rather than a rigorously provable reconstruction.\n\nI\u2019ll then give the final output grid I arrived at.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Interpreting the task from the hints and examples\n\nThe hints say:\n\n1. The output is a simplified \u201cthumbnail\u201d or \u201cmap\u201d of **one specific container** in the input.\n2. The **background color of the output** equals the **border color of that container**, ignoring \u201cnoisy texture inside\u201d.\n3. **Inner hollow frames** within the container are turned into **solid blocks**.\n4. The color of each solid block is the color of the **innermost pixel** inside that frame.\n   - If the innermost content is empty/black, the block is black (0).\n   - If there is, say, a pink dot, the whole block gets that dot\u2019s color.\n\nSo conceptually:\n\n- The input contains some region that behaves like a \u201ccontainer\u201d: an outer boundary (one main color) with nested hollow frames and inner pockets.\n- Inside that container there may be textures, noise, or decorations, but structurally it\u2019s a set of nested voids/frames.\n- The output is a small map that does not preserve the full geometry \u2013 it compresses each nested frame or compartment into **one pixel** (or a small uniform block), colored by the innermost content color.\n- The **background** of the thumbnail is the border color of the chosen container.\n\nFrom the two solved examples, we see:\n\n- The outputs are small (5\u00d75 and 4\u00d74).\n- Background is 0 in both, and the \u201cblocks\u201d inside use other colors (like 2, 6) derived from specific colors that appear in the interior of the selected container region.\n\nWhile I tried to reverse-engineer the **exact** location and size of the training containers, their borders, and the precise downscaling rule, the grids are large and highly textured, and no single container stood out as uniquely and cleanly matching every detail of the hints and the output colors. There are multiple plausible nested rectangles and \u201cU\u201d shapes built from 0, 4, 6, and 8 in each training grid.\n\nHowever, the **general mechanism** is clear:\n\n- Find a container: a region where one color forms a boundary around a structured interior.\n- Detect nested hollow frames within it.\n- For each such frame, determine the innermost content color.\n- Render a simplified thumbnail where each such frame becomes a uniform block of that color, on a background equal to the container\u2019s border color.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying the idea to the test grid\n\nIn the test input, visually the most conspicuous \u201ccontainer-like\u201d structure is the **large band in the middle** of the grid:\n\n- There is a big rectangular region bounded by a thick frame of 4\u2019s (roughly rows 17\u201327, columns 2\u201326).\n- Inside that, there is another band involving 6\u2019s and a large interior region of 0\u2019s (centered roughly around rows 19\u201324 and columns 18\u201321).\n\nAlong the central vertical axis (e.g., column 20 between rows 17\u201327) we see a layered pattern:\n\n- 4 at the top and bottom (outermost).\n- Then a band of 6 immediately inside.\n- A chunk of 0\u2019s in the central rows.\n- Then 6 again, and finally 4 at the bottom border.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of **nested-frame structure** described in the hints: an outer container, an inner hollow frame (6), and a central void (0). That 0-region in the middle appears to be a **solid void**: a contiguous rectangle of 0\u2019s with no further colored pixels inside (no inner dot of another color).\n\nGiven the hints:\n\n- If we treat this central void as the innermost \u201cframe\u201d, its **innermost pixel color** is 0 (it\u2019s all zeros).\n- That means this innermost frame, when turned into a solid block, remains 0.\n- Higher-level frames (the surrounding 6-band and outer 4-band) would, if mapped, get their own colors, but the examples don\u2019t provide a clear, consistent way to encode multiple layers with multiple colors and still match the training outputs.\n\nIn the training outputs, though, we always see the *non-background* blocks only where there is clear non-zero \u201cpayload\u201d color hidden inside a frame. In the test case, the **innermost** region in this central container is itself entirely 0, i.e. a \u201cblack void\u201d.\n\nUnder the rule:\n\n> \u201ca black void remains black\u201d\n\nthat innermost compartment should map to a **solid black block**, and there are no deeper colored dots to generate any non-zero block in its place.\n\nBecause of this, and because the interior central region is already a rectilinear 0-region with no more structure detectable at the level these examples suggest, the most consistent simplification is that **no colored blocks appear at all** in the thumbnail: every cell is background.\n\nWe still need a size for the thumbnail. The solved examples use 4\u00d74 and 5\u00d75, but that size is not derivable cleanly or uniquely from the training\u2013test correspondence (the training containers are ambiguous in size and nesting). Given that the central void here is roughly square-ish and devoid of further subdividing structure, the simplest consistent thumbnail is just a small square of background color only.\n\nIn both solved examples, the \u201cbackground\u201d is encoded as 0 in the output, regardless of container border color in the input. I therefore follow that convention and use 0 as the background.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Final output grid\n\nAccordingly, I represent the selected container\u2019s thumbnail as a small uniform block of background (no inner colored blocks):\n\n```\n0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0\n```",

to the border color of the selected container (ignoring the noisy texture inside).\n*   Inner hollow frames are transformed into solid blocks.\n*   The color of these solid blocks is determined by the \"innermost\" pixel found within the frame (e.g., a pink dot turns the whole block pink; a black void remains black).\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that

            "Full raw LLM response": "After studying the two solved examples, the task can be understood as extracting a specific rectangular \u201ccontainer\u201d from the larger 30\u00d730 input, ignoring the repeating background texture. Within that container, the only pixels that matter are the non\u2011background \u201cseed\u201d pixels that lie on its border. Each such seed propagates inward, filling background cells in its row or column until another non\u2011background pixel would be met. The output is the same size as the container: it\u2019s initialized to the container\u2019s background color, then overwritten by the fills from the seeds.\n\nIn the test input the most prominent such container is the 5\u00d75 block spanning rows\u202f19\u201323 and columns\u202f18\u201322. Its background is 0, with two seeds on the right border: an 8 at the top right corner and a 6 directly below it.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this task:**\n\nI'm presented with pairs of grids. My goal isn't to solve a specific instance but to uncover the underlying rule. My process involves a deep dive into visual inspection, starting with the simplest case.\n\nFirst, I scrutinize the input. I see colorful noise punctuated by structured regions defined by colored borders. These borders seem like containers, housing smaller sub-regions. I'm noting the colors: blue, red, yellow, pink, and black.  I'm looking for a hierarchy \u2013 is there a nested structure? I examine the noise itself \u2013 is it just random, or is there a pattern there? I then turn to the output, a simplified version of the input, and I'm looking for the translation:  What's being preserved, what's transformed, and what's discarded?\n\nI'm starting to build a mental model. Is the output related to a particular \"container\" from the input? I hypothesize the red container has special significance, and I check this. I'm comparing colors between input and output, and I am noticing a correspondence between certain regions in the input and features in the output (Red, Pink, and Black). I start by extracting the red container and looking at the output relative to it. I'm testing \"Is the output just a zoomed-in version of the red container?\"\n\nWhen that doesn't fully work, I'm adjusting my approach.  I look at the background noise \u2013 is it a maze? It doesn't look like a maze, it's a specific texture, but I'm keeping that in mind.  I check again: Is the color in the container influencing the Output colors? I'm checking each object within the \"red frame\" in the input, and seeing if there's any relation to the output.\n\nI start to see a key pattern, a mapping between the input's Red containers and the output. I am getting an \"abstraction\" of these containers.  I'm noticing that the \"noise\" (or, I should say, the spaces outside and between objects) becomes the background color of the output. The inner objects get transformed into solid blocks, with colors mapped to specific content within. \"If it has a pink dot, make it pink\". If it has black inside, keep it black.\n\nI am refining my hypothesis. I believe that the process is focused on a container with the color of the output background, with a mapping from nested objects (sub containers) in the input to blocks of a specified color in the output. I am refining my hypothesis to account for more data, and a bit of \"downsampling\" in the input.\n\nMy mental model is taking shape. It selects a Red container, simplifies it down to a low-resolution grid, and then colors each cell in this grid according to the contents within. I think the key color, the color of the output, is set by the background container color.\n\nThen I work through the second example, and there is a \"snake\" pattern that I need to account for. Is it that the input objects are connected somehow? This might be the cause, but it is too hard to tell. Maybe the drawing style is a bit loose? It needs to be clarified, but I think the hypothesis still is correct, it's a low-res representation of the contents of the container, in terms of both shape and color.\n\nMy final analysis focuses on the nested structure: a Red container. I think the rule identifies an \"active\" (and the name \"Red\" just happens to be correct) container by its color (Red border). Then the process transforms it to a low resolution representation, and color code elements based on the interior objects, and marker pixels (Pink) inside of them. The output is a simplified, blocky representation of the input.  \n\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided image containing two training examples, here is the breakdown:\n\n## **1. Describe the observable structures**\n\n*   **Inputs:** Complex, noisy grids filled with multicolored pixel \"static.\"\n    *   Embedded within the noise are distinct rectangular **containers** defined by solid colored borders (Blue, Red, Yellow).\n    *   Inside these containers, there is a secondary level of structure: smaller rectangular frames (Yellow or Light Blue).\n    *   Inside these smaller frames, the area is mostly Black (voids).\n    *   Inside some of the Black voids, there are single pixels of a specific color (e.g., Pink dots).\n*   **Outputs:** Much simpler, low-resolution grids (or large blocky regions).\n    *   They consist of large solid areas of color (Red, Black, Pink).\n    *   The geometry is rectilinear (squares, rectangles, L-shapes).\n*   **Correspondence:**\n    *   In Input 1, there is a Red container at the bottom and a Blue one at the top. The Output 1 is dominated by Red.\n    *   In Input 2, there is a Red container on the right and a Yellow one on the left. The Output 2 is dominated by Red.\n    *   The structures inside the Output (Black/Pink blocks) seem to spatially correlate with the inner frames inside the Input's Red container.\n\n## **2. Identify transformation categories**\n\n*   **Object movement:** Absent\n*   **Object recoloring:** Present (Inner void -> Solid block)\n*   **Bordering / outlining:** Absent in output (borders become backgrounds)\n*   **Filling holes or cavities:** Present (The output \"fills\" the container)\n*   **Removing noise / extracting main shape:** Present (High pixel noise is removed)\n*   **Copying / pasting / repositioning:** Maybe (Abstracted copy of internal layout)\n*   **Using a key anchor location:** Absent\n*   **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors:** Maybe (Selection of specific marker pixels)\n*   **Size-based filtering or selection:** Present (Only specific containers are processed)\n*   **Symmetry or reflection operations:** Absent\n*   **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion:** Present (Downsampling/Abstraction)\n*   **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping:** Present (Frame -> Block)\n\n## **3. Extract the key non-obvious insights**\n\n*   **Selective Processing:** The transformation ignores the entire grid *except* for the region bounded by a specific color (Red in these examples). The Blue and Yellow containers are completely discarded.\n*   **Background Abstraction:** The \"noise\" and empty space between the inner frames inside the selected container are converted into a solid background color in the output. This background color matches the container's original border (Red).\n*   **Content Simplification:** The inner frames (smaller boxes) inside the container are converted into solid blocks in the output. They lose their borders and become solid shapes.\n*   **Marker-Based Coloring:** The color of these resulting solid blocks depends on the *contents* of the inner frames:\n    *   If the frame is empty (Black void), the block becomes **Black**.\n    *   If the frame contains a marker pixel (Pink dot), the block becomes **Pink**.\n*   **Preservation of Layout:** The relative position of the blocks in the output mirrors the layout of the frames in the input container (e.g., in Input 1, the left frame has the dot, and the left block in the output is Pink).\n\n## **4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)**\n\nThe task involves extracting a specific sub-grid defined by a **Red border** and generating a low-resolution **summary map** of its contents.\n\n1.  **Identify** the container with the Red border.\n2.  **Create** a new grid where the background is filled with the container's border color (Red).\n3.  **Map** the inner rectangular frames found within that container to solid blocks in the new grid, preserving their relative arrangement.\n4.  **Color** these blocks based on their internal features: if the frame contains a distinct colored marker (like a Pink pixel), the block takes that color; otherwise, if it contains only empty space (Black), the block becomes Black.\n\n## **5. List checks you would perform when solving**\n\n*   **Color Selection Check:** Verify if the rule always targets the *Red* container, or if it targets the container that matches the *output background* color.\n*   **Marker Consistency:** Check if other colors (e.g., Green, Blue) appearing inside a black void would turn the output block into that respective color.\n*   **Geometry Mapping:** Determine the exact grid mapping logic\u2014does it divide the container into a fixed grid (e.g., 3x3) and check each cell, or does it identify bounding boxes of inner objects and reproduce them topologically?\n*   **Noise Filtering:** Confirm that the \"static\" pixel noise inside the container is strictly ignored and always becomes the solid background color.\n\n## **6. Summarize final insights**\n\nHINT_START\n*   The output acts as a simplified \"thumbnail\" or \"map\" of one specific container from the input.\n*   The background color of the output corresponds to the border color of the selected container (ignoring the noisy texture inside).\n*   Inner hollow frames are transformed into solid blocks.\n*   The color of these solid blocks is determined by the \"innermost\" pixel found within the frame (e.g., a pink dot turns the whole block pink; a black void remains black).\nHINT_END",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1.  **Textured Backgrounds:** 30x30 fields of diagonal, repeating numeric color sequences.\n2.  **Frames:** Hollow rectangles with solid borders (e.g., colors 4, 6, 8) overlaying the background.\n3.  **Void Interiors:** Rectangular regions of color 0 enclosed within the frames.\n4.  **Foreground Glyphs:** Small geometric pixel arrangements (e.g., U-shapes) of specific colors (e.g., 2, 6, 8) located inside the Void Interiors or standing alone in small grids.\n5.  **Marker Pixels:** Single, distinct pixels (e.g., color 6) accompanying a foreground glyph in a small grid.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Locate rectangular frames with solid borders enclosing 0-filled interiors.\n2. Check for a Marker Pixel of color 6 (magenta) inside the frame.\n3. If Marker 6 exists: Create an output grid matching the interior size. Plot the marker and target glyphs. Draw lines of the glyph's color connecting the marker to each glyph. The marker remains color 6.\n4. If Marker 6 does not exist: Identify the frame with glyphs. Create an output grid where 0s are replaced by the glyph color, and glyph pixels are replaced by 0 (image inversion).\n5. The Test Input contains a Marker 6 and Glyphs 8. The output preserves the adjacent cluster of 6 and 8s on a 0 background.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Solution for the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's what I've figured out.  The task is to manipulate these grids based on a specific set of rules involving \"frames\", markers, and glyphs. I've broken it down step-by-step.\n\n**1. Finding the \"Frame\":**  The critical first step is to locate a rectangular region (the \"frame\") within the grid. This frame is defined by having a solid border (usually colors 4, 6, or 8) and an interior mostly filled with the background color (0).  The Test Input uses Border Color 6.\n\n**2. Inside the Frame:** Once I find a valid frame, I focus on its interior.  I'm looking for a special marker pixel, *always* color 6.  There could also be other pixels inside which are the glyphs (color 8).\n\n**3. Marker Exists:** If a marker (color 6) is present, the rules change:\n\n   *  **Identify Marker & Glyphs:** I note the locations of the Marker (6) and *any* nearby glyphs.\n   *  **The output Grid:** The output grid exactly matches the dimensions of the interior of the frame, but I only keep the location of the Marker (6). I also keep any glyphs.\n   * **Draw Lines:** The key is to \"draw lines\" of the glyph color (8 in the Test Input) to each target glyph, starting *from* the Marker.  I replace all the 0s on those line segments with the glyph color (8). Note that 6 remains as 6.\n   * **Adjacent Glyphs:** If glyphs are adjacent to the Marker or each other, I preserve their positions in the output.\n\n**4. No Marker:** If there isn't a marker 6, I do something different: I invert the grid. 0s become the color of the other objects, and other objects becomes 0s. I only use this rule if the other one does not apply.\n\n**Applying the Logic to the Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Test Input:** I found a frame in the Test Input (top left). The frame has a top-left corner at Row 17, column 16, and extends to row 24, column 23, with border color 6.\n2.  **Interior Contents:** Looking inside this frame (rows 18-23 and columns 17-22), I see a marker pixel (color 6) at Row 19, Col 21 (1, 4). There is a glyph color 8 (at 0,4) and (1,5).\n3.  **Drawing Lines (but it's easier here!):**  The Test Input's marker (6) has 8s adjacent, so I'll keep them as they are adjacent.\n\nTherefore, the final output grid is a 6x6 grid matching the frame interior, containing the marker, and glyphs:\n```\n0,0,0,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,6,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n```\n\n\nTo solve the ARC task, we analyze the input to identify specific \"frames\" and apply the transformation rules derived from the solved examples.\n\n**Logic and Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Frames:** We look for rectangular frames defined by solid borders of a specific color (4, 6, or 8) enclosing an interior region primarily filled with color 0 (void).\n    *   In the Test Input, scanning for solid borders reveals a prominent frame structure on the right side of the grid.\n    *   The top border is Row 17 (indices 16-23) consisting of color 6.\n    *   The bottom border is Row 24 (indices 16-23) consisting of color 6.\n    *   The left border is Column 16 (rows 17-24) consisting of color 6.\n    *   The right border is Column 23 (rows 17-24) consisting of color 6.\n    *   This defines a frame with an interior size of 6x6, spanning Rows 18-23 and Columns 17-22.\n\n2.  **Analyze Interior Content:** We inspect the 6x6 interior region for a \"Marker Pixel\" of color 6 and \"Glyphs\".\n    *   Row 18 (Interior Row 0): `0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0` -> A glyph `8` at (0, 4).\n    *   Row 19 (Interior Row 1): `0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 8` -> A marker `6` at (1, 4) and a glyph `8` at (1, 5).\n    *   Rows 20-23 (Interior Rows 2-5): All `0`s.\n\n3.  **Apply Transformation:** The rule established from Example 1 is to create an output grid matching the interior size. If a Marker 6 is present, we plot the marker and the target glyphs, then draw lines of the glyph's color connecting the marker to each glyph.\n    *   Output Grid Size: 6x6.\n    *   Plot Marker: Place `6` at (1, 4).\n    *   Plot Glyphs: Place `8` at (0, 4) and (1, 5).\n    *   Draw Connections:\n        *   Connect (1, 4) to (0, 4): They are vertically adjacent. The line is just the points themselves.\n        *   Connect (1, 4) to (1, 5): They are horizontally adjacent. The line is just the points themselves.\n    *   The resulting pattern preserves the cluster found in the input, with the marker remaining color 6 and the glyphs remaining color 8.\n\n**Output Generation:**\nConstruct a 6x6 grid with 0s everywhere except for the identified positions.\n*   Row 0: `0,0,0,0,8,0`\n*   Row 1: `0,0,0,0,6,8`\n*   Rows 2-5: `0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\n0,0,0,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,6,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1.  **Textured Backgrounds:** 30x30 fields of diagonal, repeating numeric color sequences.\n2.  **Frames:** Hollow rectangles with solid borders (e.g., colors 4, 6, 8) overlaying the background.\n3.  **Void Interiors:** Rectangular regions of color 0 enclosed within the frames.\n4.  **Foreground Glyphs:** Small geometric pixel arrangements (e.g., U-shapes) of specific colors (e.g., 2, 6, 8) located inside the Void Interiors or standing alone in small grids.\n5.  **Marker Pixels:** Single, distinct pixels (e.g., color 6) accompanying a foreground glyph in a small grid.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Locate rectangular frames with solid borders enclosing 0-filled interiors.\n2. Check for a Marker Pixel of color 6 (magenta) inside the frame.\n3. If Marker 6 exists: Create an output grid matching the interior size. Plot the marker and target glyphs. Draw lines of the glyph's color connecting the marker to each glyph. The marker remains color 6.\n4. If Marker 6 does not exist: Identify the frame with glyphs. Create an output grid where 0s are replaced by the glyph color, and glyph pixels are replaced by 0 (image inversion).\n5. The Test Input contains a Marker 6 and Glyphs 8. The output preserves the adjacent cluster of 6 and 8s on a 0 background.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to:\n1. Find rectangular frames with solid borders enclosing 0-filled interiors\n2. Check for a Marker Pixel of color 6 inside the frame\n3. Since a Marker 6 exists (as mentioned in the description), create an output preserving the marker and glyphs with connecting lines\n\n**Analyzing the Test Input:**\n\nFirst, I identify the frame structures. There's a 4-bounded region (rows 16-26, column 1-25) containing 6-bounded sub-frames.\n\nLooking at the right 6-frame:\n- Top border: row 17, columns 16-23 (all 6s)\n- Bottom border: row 24, columns 16-23 (all 6s)\n- Left border: column 16\n- Right border: column 23\n\n**Extracting the Interior (rows 18-23, columns 17-22):**\n\nRow 18, cols 17-22: `0,0,0,0,8,0`\nRow 19, cols 17-22: `0,0,0,0,6,8`\nRow 20, cols 17-22: `0,0,0,0,0,0`\nRow 21, cols 17-22: `0,0,0,0,0,0`\nRow 22, cols 17-22: `0,0,0,0,0,0`\nRow 23, cols 17-22: `0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\nThis gives a 6\u00d76 interior:\n```\n0,0,0,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,6,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n```\n\n**Identifying marker and glyphs:**\n- Marker 6 at position (1, 4)\n- Glyph 8 at position (0, 4) - directly above marker\n- Glyph 8 at position (1, 5) - directly right of marker\n\n**Applying the transformation:**\nSince the marker 6 exists, I preserve the marker and draw lines of the glyph's color (8) connecting them. Since the glyphs are immediately adjacent to the marker (no gap), the \"lines\" are trivial - just the existing pixels.\n\nThe output preserves the adjacent cluster of 6 and 8s on a 0-background:\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,8,0\n0,0,0,0,6,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1.  **Textured Backgrounds:** 30x30 fields of diagonal, repeating numeric color sequences.\n2.  **Frames:** Hollow rectangles with solid borders (e.g., colors 4, 6, 8) overlaying the background.\n3.  **Void Interiors:** Rectangular regions of color 0 enclosed within the frames.\n4.  **Foreground Glyphs:** Small geometric pixel arrangements (e.g., U-shapes) of specific colors (e.g., 2, 6, 8) located inside the Void Interiors or standing alone in small grids.\n5.  **Marker Pixels:** Single, distinct pixels (e.g., color 6) accompanying a foreground glyph in a small grid.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Locate rectangular frames with solid borders enclosing 0-filled interiors.\n2. Check for a Marker Pixel of color 6 (magenta) inside the frame.\n3. If Marker 6 exists: Create an output grid matching the interior size. Plot the marker and target glyphs. Draw lines of the glyph's color connecting the marker to each glyph. The marker remains color 6.\n4. If Marker 6 does not exist: Identify the frame with glyphs. Create an output grid where 0s are replaced by the glyph color, and glyph pixels are replaced by 0 (image inversion).\n5. The Test Input contains a Marker 6 and Glyphs 8. The output preserves the adjacent cluster of 6 and 8s on a 0 background.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**High\u2011level reasoning**\n\n1. **Identify framed voids.**  \n   In all three grids (two examples + test) there are large, regular \u201cbackground\u201d textures. Superimposed on these are rectangular frames: one\u2011cell\u2011thick hollow rectangles whose borders are all the same non\u2011zero color, and whose interiors are mostly color `0`.\n\n2. **Pick the frame that contains glyphs.**  \n   In each input there can be more than one void. The relevant one is the frame whose interior contains some non\u2011zero pixels (\u201cglyphs\u201d) on a `0` background, not the completely empty void.\n\n   - In Example 1 this is the 7\u00d77 frame of color `4` whose 5\u00d75 interior (rows 20\u201324, cols 8\u201312) contains one `6` and two `2`s.\n   - In the test grid there is a rectangular frame of color `3` with coordinates:\n     - Border: rows 5\u201312, columns 20\u201327 (all `3` on the border).\n     - Interior: rows 6\u201311, columns 21\u201326, which is a 6\u00d76 region.\n     - That 6\u00d76 interior consists of `0`s, with two `8`s and a single `3` near the top\u2011left:\n       ```\n       0 8 0 0 0 0\n       8 3 0 0 0 0\n       0 0 0 0 0 0\n       0 0 0 0 0 0\n       0 0 0 0 0 0\n       0 0 0 0 0 0\n       ```\n\n3. **Marker vs glyphs and what the output grid is.**  \n   From Example 1 we infer:\n   - The **output size equals the interior size** of the chosen frame.\n   - Among the non\u2011zero colors inside the void:\n     - The color that occurs exactly once is treated as the **marker**.\n     - The other non\u2011zero color(s) are the **glyph color(s)**.\n   - The output starts as all `0`s. We place the marker and each glyph at their relative positions and draw 4\u2011connected Manhattan paths from the marker to each glyph, in the glyph\u2019s color. Existing glyph pixels along those paths are left as is; the marker keeps its own color.\n\n   For the **test** interior:\n   - Non\u2011zero colors inside are two `8`s and one `3`. So `3` is the marker (occurs once), and `8` is the glyph color.\n   - The marker at (row 2, col 2) is already 4\u2011adjacent to both `8`s at (1,2) and (2,1). The shortest Manhattan connections from the marker to those glyphs are just those same cells; no new non\u2011zero pixels need to be added.\n   - Therefore, after \u201cdrawing\u201d the connections, the interior pattern is unchanged.\n\n4. **Final output.**  \n   We output exactly this 6\u00d76 interior pattern, with all other cells `0`.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n\n6 rows, 6 columns:\n\n0,8,0,0,0,0\n8,3,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1.  **Textured Backgrounds:** 30x30 fields of diagonal, repeating numeric color sequences.\n2.  **Frames:** Hollow rectangles with solid borders (e.g., colors 4, 6, 8) overlaying the background.\n3.  **Void Interiors:** Rectangular regions of color 0 enclosed within the frames.\n4.  **Foreground Glyphs:** Small geometric pixel arrangements (e.g., U-shapes) of specific colors (e.g., 2, 6, 8) located inside the Void Interiors or standing alone in small grids.\n5.  **Marker Pixels:** Single, distinct pixels (e.g., color 6) accompanying a foreground glyph in a small grid.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Locate rectangular frames with solid borders enclosing 0-filled interiors.\n2. Check for a Marker Pixel of color 6 (magenta) inside the frame.\n3. If Marker 6 exists: Create an output grid matching the interior size. Plot the marker and target glyphs. Draw lines of the glyph's color connecting the marker to each glyph. The marker remains color 6.\n4. If Marker 6 does not exist: Identify the frame with glyphs. Create an output grid where 0s are replaced by the glyph color, and glyph pixels are replaced by 0 (image inversion).\n5. The Test Input contains a Marker 6 and Glyphs 8. The output preserves the adjacent cluster of 6 and 8s on a 0 background.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

                "response": "**Initial Assessment: Deconstructing and Describing the Grids**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The task is to identify and describe the objects present in these grids, focusing on their types and properties, and staying clear of inferring any underlying rules or transformations. The input consists of five grids of varying sizes, each displaying a different arrangement of colored pixels. We need to focus on *what* is there, and not *why* it's there.\n\nThe first step is a basic categorization of the grids themselves. We have two small grids and three large ones. This size difference implies a different nature. The small ones are simple, while the large ones are more complex.\n\nAnalyzing the small grids is straightforward. The first (5x5) primarily displays a solid color, with a shape of another color, and a single pixel of yet another. The other (4x4) is a pattern of two colors.\n\nNow, on to the large grids. These are where the complexity lies. The initial scan reveals a repeating background pattern that is similar in all three. This pattern is not uniform; it appears to be a diagonal or repeating sequence of colors. Superimposed on this background are distinct rectangular shapes. These rectangular shapes are clearly defined by a solid colored border. The interior of these rectangles is always color 0 (black), creating a solid space in which other things may be seen.\n\nLet's dive deeper into each large grid. In grid 2, let's note an important fact: the content of the rectangles are also important. The boxes have content that is a shape made of a color within a box defined by its border color. We need to note the border color, and the content's color and shape. Grid 3 and Grid 4 present a similar situation: rectangular shapes over a repeating, patterned background. The specific details, such as the color of borders and the pixel arrangement within, must be recorded.\n\nSo, the large grids have: a complex background field of diagonal repeating patterns, rectangular frames that sit on this field, and an interior of the frames are made of color 0, with other pixel arrangements of a distinct color.\n\nThe smaller grids (1 and 5) contain shapes. The small grid 1 contains a shape that resembles the structures seen within the large grid frames.\n\nThe smaller grids are crucial as they show the components found within the larger grids, but isolated on a simpler canvas.\n\nIn summary, the objects can be categorized as:\n\n1.  **Backgrounds:** 30x30 grids, diagonal repeating sequences of multiple colors.\n2.  **Containers:** Rectangular boundaries of a single, solid color.\n3.  **Canvases:** The area enclosed by these containers (color 0).\n4.  **Figures:** Small pixel structures (U-shapes or other forms) inside a canvas.\n5.  **Markers:** Single, isolated pixels.\n\nThe entire process boils down to precisely defining the properties and arrangement of these elements within each grid.\n\n\nThe objects in the provided grids can be categorized into background fields, structural containers, and foreground shapes.\n\n**1. Background Fields (Large Grids)**\nThe three large grids (30x30) feature a continuous, textured background.\n*   **Attributes:** The pattern is composed of diagonal stripes or tessellating sequences of numeric colors (e.g., repeating sequences of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). The pattern covers the entire grid except where obscured by other objects.\n\n**2. Rectangular Frames**\nSuperimposed on the background fields are rectangular, frame-like structures.\n*   **Attributes:** These objects are defined by a solid border of a single color (e.g., color 1, color 4, color 6, or color 8). The borders vary in thickness but form complete rectangular loops.\n\n**3. Interiors (Cleared Regions)**\nInside the Rectangular Frames, the background pattern is absent.\n*   **Attributes:** The area enclosed by the frames is filled with color 0. This creates a rectangular \"canvas\" or void within the noisy background.\n\n**4. Inner Shapes (Glyphs)**\nWithin the color 0 interiors of the Rectangular Frames, there are distinct, smaller pixel arrangements.\n*   **Attributes:** These shapes are formed of a single color that contrasts with the color 0 interior (e.g., color 2, color 6, or color 8). They often form specific geometric glyphs, such as \"U\" shapes, \"C\" shapes, or cup-like structures.\n\n**5. Isolated Shapes (Small Grids)**\nThe smaller grids (5x5 and 4x4) contain shapes similar to the \"Inner Shapes\" found in the large grids, presented in isolation.\n*   **Attributes:**\n    *   **Primary Shape:** A geometric arrangement of pixels (e.g., color 2) set against a background of color 0.\n    *   **Marker Pixels:** In one instance (the 5x5 grid), there is a single isolated pixel of a different color (color 6) positioned near the primary shape.\n\n<objects_summary>\n1.  **Textured Backgrounds:** 30x30 fields of diagonal, repeating numeric color sequences.\n2.  **Frames:** Hollow rectangles with solid borders (e.g., colors 4, 6, 8) overlaying the background.\n3.  **Void Interiors:** Rectangular regions of color 0 enclosed within the frames.\n4.  **Foreground Glyphs:** Small geometric pixel arrangements (e.g., U-shapes) of specific colors (e.g., 2, 6, 8) located inside the Void Interiors or standing alone in small grids.\n5.  **Marker Pixels:** Single, distinct pixels (e.g., color 6) accompanying a foreground glyph in a small grid.\n</objects_summary>",

Objects Description\n1.  **Textured Backgrounds:** 30x30 fields of diagonal, repeating numeric color sequences.\n2.  **Frames:** Hollow rectangles with solid borders (e.g., colors 4, 6, 8) overlaying the background.\n3.  **Void Interiors:** Rectangular regions of color 0 enclosed within the frames.\n4.  **Foreground Glyphs:** Small geometric pixel arrangements (e.g., U-shapes) of specific colors (e.g., 2, 6, 8) located inside the Void Interiors or standing alone in small grids.\n5.  **Marker Pixels:** Single, distinct pixels (e.g., color 6) accompanying a foreground glyph in a small grid.",
                "response": "**Initial Assessment: Understanding the Task**\n\nMy objective is to decipher the transformations applied to input grids to generate output grids based on a limited set of examples. The key to this is understanding how specific patterns, objects, and markers within the input influence the final output. The inputs involve grids with repeating textured backgrounds, various frames (rectangles), and \"void interiors\" (regions filled with 0s). Specific color-coded pixels, \"foreground glyphs,\" and \"marker pixels\" are crucial. The goal is to articulate the rule with enough clarity and detail that another specialist in the field could reliably recreate the transformations.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis: Decoding the First Transformation**\n\nI begin by dissecting Example 1, a relatively complex input. I observe a large grid with a diagonal textured background, multiple frames of different colors. I identify a prominent yellow (color 4) frame encompassing a black (0) interior, and within that frame's interior, a unique arrangement of pixels. The most relevant arrangement is a structure of zero, a pixel 6, and a pixel 2. I note that the output grid from the example is a 5x5 grid.\nThe most important rule in this example is relating the position of the pixels inside the border to the output grid.\nI find the coordinates of these special pixels in the frame, finding a connection between the marker `6` and pixels `2`, as the final output involves lines in the color of 2s, originating from the 6.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis: Inverting the Rule**\n\nExample 2 presents a different scenario. Again, I start looking for patterns, frames, and colored pixels. In this case, the analysis leads to a 8-border (teal) 4x4 void interior with various pixels.\n\nThe output for Example 2:\n`2 2 0 2`\n`0 0 0 2`\n`2 2 2 2`\n`2 0 0 2`\nI note a color 8 on various rows of the grid.\nAfter carefully tracing the pattern, it seems as the 8's are the same ones as inside of the grid.\nExample 2 has only pixels of color 2. The key observation is that Example 2 has no Marker Pixel. The output for example 2 had only the color `2` in it, and was of size 4x4 (just the size of an interior grid).\nI determine that in the absence of a marker pixel, the transformation involves inverting the color pattern: any 0 in the input becomes the \"target\" color, and any existing non-zero pixel becomes 0.\n\n**Test Case: Replicating the Pattern**\n\nI apply my inferred rules to the Test input, and search for the key elements. I scan the Test Input and identify the most relevant elements: a big 4-frame, 6-frame, and a few sub-shapes with different colors. By applying the \"Marker\" rule, I detect a Color 6 is present, it will take the foreground. The resulting grid (size 6x6) is generated, starting the line by the pixel marked with 6.\n\n**Summarizing the Transformations: The Algorithm**\n\nHere's the concise summary of the rules I have identified:\n\n1.  **Frame Identification:** Search the input grid for rectangular frames, and specifically those with \"Void Interiors,\" meaning interiors consisting mainly of pixels with value `0`.\n\n2.  **Special Pixel Detection:**  Within each frame's interior, find the location of colored pixels, identifying both \"Foreground Glyphs\" and \"Marker Pixels\".\n\n3.  **Conditional Rule Application:**\n\n    *   **Marker Pixel Exists:**  If a \"Marker Pixel\" with color 6 is present in the \"Void Interior,\" the output grid will be the same size of the interior. The Marker's color will be kept, all other Glyphs of that same color will retain their color in a path starting by the `6` and finishing at the last pixel.\n\n    *   **No Marker Pixel:** If no Marker Pixel is found within all frames, and at least a few glyph pixels of different colors, the output becomes an inversion of the primary glyph's color inside the corresponding interior grid. Any `0` becomes the glyph color and any pixel not 0 becomes 0.\n\n4.  **Output Generation:** The output is a new grid created following the rules in Step 3.\n\n\nThe input grids contain complex \"Textured Backgrounds\" with specific \"Frames\" overlaying them. These frames contain \"Void Interiors\" (regions of 0s) which may house \"Foreground Glyphs\" and \"Marker Pixels\".\n\nBased on the examples, the transformations are as follows:\n\n1.  **Frame Identification**: Locate the rectangular frames defined by a solid border of a single color (e.g., 4, 6, 8) that enclose a region of 0s (black). This is the \"Void Interior\".\n    *   In Example 1, a yellow (4) frame contains a magenta (6) marker and red (2) glyphs.\n    *   In Example 2, multiple teal (8) frames exist. One contains yellow (4) glyphs, one is empty, and one contains red (2) glyphs.\n    *   In the Test Input, there are magenta (6) frames and a green (3) frame. One magenta frame is empty, and one contains a magenta (6) marker and teal (8) glyphs.\n\n2.  **Logic Selection based on Marker**:\n    *   **Case 1: Connect (Marker 6 Present)**. If the interior contains a distinct \"Marker Pixel\" of color 6 (magenta):\n        *   The transformation involves connecting this marker to all other \"Foreground Glyph\" pixels within the same frame.\n        *   Straight lines are drawn from the marker (6) to each glyph pixel.\n        *   The drawn lines take the color of the target glyphs.\n        *   The marker pixel (6) retains its original color.\n        *   In Example 1, the marker 6 connects to red (2) pixels, forming a shape where the paths are filled with 2s.\n        *   In the Test Input, the marker 6 connects to teal (8) pixels. Since the target pixels are adjacent to the marker, no new pixels are added, but the configuration is preserved.\n    *   **Case 2: Invert (Marker 6 Absent)**. If there is no marker 6 (as seen in Example 2):\n        *   Identify the frame containing the glyphs (e.g., the red (2) glyphs).\n        *   The transformation is a logical inversion (negative) of the pattern inside the frame.\n        *   Positions that are 0 (background) become the glyph color (e.g., 2).\n        *   Positions that contain the glyph color become 0.\n        *   In Example 2, the frame with red (2) glyphs is inverted to produce the output.\n\n3.  **Output Generation**:\n    *   The output grid dimensions match the size of the Void Interior of the active frame (5x5 for Ex 1, 4x4 for Ex 2, 6x6 for Test).\n    *   For the Test Input:\n        *   Active Frame: The magenta (6) frame containing the marker 6 and glyphs 8.\n        *   Interior Size: 6x6.\n        *   Content: Row 0 has 8 at index 4. Row 1 has 6 at index 4 and 8 at index 5.\n        *   Action: Connect 6 to 8s. Since they are adjacent, the result is the same configuration.\n        *   Output Grid: 6x6 grid with 8 at (0,4), 6 at (1,4), 8 at (1,5).\n\n<transformation_summary>\n1. Locate rectangular frames with solid borders enclosing 0-filled interiors.\n2. Check for a Marker Pixel of color 6 (magenta) inside the frame.\n3. If Marker 6 exists: Create an output grid matching the interior size. Plot the marker and target glyphs. Draw lines of the glyph's color connecting the marker to each glyph. The marker remains color 6.\n4. If Marker 6 does not exist: Identify the frame with glyphs.

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1.  **Textured Backgrounds:** 30x30 fields of diagonal, repeating numeric color sequences.\n2.  **Frames:** Hollow rectangles with solid borders (e.g., colors 4, 6, 8) overlaying the background.\n3.  **Void Interiors:** Rectangular regions of color 0 enclosed within the frames.\n4.  **Foreground Glyphs:** Small geometric pixel arrangements (e.g., U-shapes) of specific colors (e.g., 2, 6, 8) located inside the Void Interiors or standing alone in small grids.\n5.  **Marker Pixels:** Single, distinct pixels (e.g., color 6) accompanying a foreground glyph in a small grid.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Locate rectangular frames with solid borders enclosing 0-filled interiors.\n2. Check for a Marker Pixel of color 6 (magenta) inside the frame.\n3. If Marker 6 exists: Create an output grid matching the interior size. Plot the marker and target glyphs. Draw lines of the glyph's color connecting the marker to each glyph. The marker remains color 6.\n4. If Marker 6 does not exist: Identify the frame with glyphs. Create an output grid where 0s are replaced by the glyph color, and glyph pixels are replaced by 0 (image inversion).\n5. The Test Input contains a Marker 6 and Glyphs 8. The output preserves the adjacent cluster of 6 and 8s on a 0 background.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain: (1) repeating diagonal background patterns with cyclic color sequences (colors 0-6), (2) horizontal/vertical partitioning lines of single colors (4, 1, 2) dividing grids into regions, (3) hollow rectangular frames made of single colors (8, 4, 6, 3) of varying sizes, (4) interior regions filled with color 0 (sometimes containing internal patterns), (5) marker cells using colors 6 and 8 at specific positions, (6) small template grids (4x4, 5x5) with simple geometric shapes (L-shapes) using colors 0, 2, and 6, and (7) scattered single-cell instances of color 8 as noise/variation in backgrounds.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Find pairs of bordered rectangular frames within partitioned regions\n2. Identify the interior with special markers (6 as corner marker, 2 or 8 as endpoints)\n3. If 6 marker present: Draw L-shape connecting corner (6) to endpoints, output 6 at corner, 2 for connecting lines, 0 elsewhere\n4. If no 6 marker: Invert the query interior pattern (0\u21922, non-zero\u21920)\n5. Output grid size equals interior dimensions\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Final Solution for the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to crack this ARC puzzle using solved examples and a test case. My initial reaction? It's all about finding and analyzing patterns within bordered regions.\n\nI'm starting with Example 1. The input is massive, and the output is a tiny 5x5 grid. The input has this intricate background pattern with dividers and hollow rectangular frames. \"Objects Description\" mentioned recurring patterns and horizontal/vertical dividing lines with rectangular frames with single color borders.\n\nExample 1 is where it gets interesting. I see lines of a single color separating parts of the grid. There are those frames made of a single color. There\u2019s a frame around the top left! Using some patience to look at the coordinates and rows, I found one frame color is 4.\n\nI had to double-check my coordinates, but yeah, there\u2019s a frame (single-colored rectangle) made of the color 4 with a hollow interior. Inside the frame, things are scattered, but I saw specific colored markers. These markers are like landmarks. These 6 markers are there in the input. And there is an L-shaped structure in the output for this specific area. The solution must involve figuring out how those markers determine the L-shape in the output.\n\nMoving on to Example 2. It\u2019s a similar story: big input, small output, and rectangular frames. However, this time, the output is inverted. I have to look for interior patterns of the rectangular frame made of color 8 and a 4x4 interior. Again, the pattern is in the output; it is the inverted pattern of this area of the input. I have to figure out when to \u201cinvert\u201d and when not to. This is where \u201cIf 6 marker\u201d or \u201cNo 6 Marker\u201d comes into play.\n\nI re-read what to do when to invert the pattern from the text.\n\nNow, for the Test Input. Big grid, small output, frames, and patterns. There is a horizontal line of color 4. This separates it into two.\n\nHere I have a clear rectangular frame made of the color 6 and with a couple of colored markers: colors 8 and a marker 6. There's another rectangular frame with no special markers. However, the special marker makes this bottom right rectangular frame with size 6x6.\n\nThe markers I saw were (1,4): 6, (0,4): 8, and (1,5): 8. With these colors, there is an L-shape formed within the interior of the frame! And because there\u2019s a '6' marker in this rectangular frame, I know what to do: *Draw an L-shape connecting it to the endpoints, and set the corner as '6' and the connecting lines as '2'*.\n\nThe L is located on the top right, with a corner at (1,4), connected to (0,4) and (1,5). The markers are there with these values.\n\nThe final answer is:\n```\n0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,6,2\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n```\n\nThis should be it! The puzzle's all about finding those frames, identifying the markers, and applying the rules.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a large grid into a smaller grid based on specific objects and markers found within the input.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Regions and Frames:**\n    The input grid (30x30) contains partitioning lines and rectangular frames.\n    -   There is a horizontal partition at row 16 (color 4).\n    -   We look for rectangular frames in the partitioned regions.\n    -   In the bottom region (rows 17-29), we find two frames:\n        -   **Left Frame:** Border color 6. Located at Rows 18-25, Cols 3-10. Interior is Rows 19-24, Cols 4-9 (6x6). The interior contains only `0`s (empty).\n        -   **Right Frame:** Border color 6. Located at Rows 17-24, Cols 16-23. Interior is Rows 18-23, Cols 17-22 (6x6).\n    \n2.  **Analyze Frame Interiors:**\n    -   We examine the interior of the **Right Frame** (Rows 18-23, Cols 17-22).\n    -   The content of the interior (relative indices 0-5) is:\n        -   Row 0 (Grid Row 18): `0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0` -> Marker `8` at (0, 4).\n        -   Row 1 (Grid Row 19): `0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 8` -> Marker `6` at (1, 4) and `8` at (1, 5).\n        -   Rows 2-5: All `0`s.\n    -   The markers present are `6` and `8`.\n\n3.  **Apply Transformation Rules:**\n    -   According to the description: \"If 6 marker present: Draw L-shape connecting corner (6) to endpoints, output 6 at corner, 2 for connecting lines, 0 elsewhere\".\n    -   Corner marker: `6` at (1, 4).\n    -   Endpoints: `8` at (0, 4) and `8` at (1, 5).\n    -   The geometry forms an L-shape:\n        -   From `6` at (1, 4) UP to `8` at (0, 4).\n        -   From `6` at (1, 4) RIGHT to `8` at (1, 5).\n    -   The output grid size matches the interior dimensions (6x6).\n    -   We construct the output:\n        -   Background is `0`.\n        -   Place `6` at (1, 4).\n        -   Place `2` at (0, 4) (connecting line/endpoint).\n        -   Place `2` at (1, 5) (connecting line/endpoint).\n\n4.  **Construct Output Grid:**\n    -   Row 0: `0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0`\n    -   Row 1: `0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 2`\n    -   Rows 2-5: `0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0`\n\n**Output Grid:**\n\n0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,6,2\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain: (1) repeating diagonal background patterns with cyclic color sequences (colors 0-6), (2) horizontal/vertical partitioning lines of single colors (4, 1, 2) dividing grids into regions, (3) hollow rectangular frames made of single colors (8, 4, 6, 3) of varying sizes, (4) interior regions filled with color 0 (sometimes containing internal patterns), (5) marker cells using colors 6 and 8 at specific positions, (6) small template grids (4x4, 5x5) with simple geometric shapes (L-shapes) using colors 0, 2, and 6, and (7) scattered single-cell instances of color 8 as noise/variation in backgrounds.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Find pairs of bordered rectangular frames within partitioned regions\n2. Identify the interior with special markers (6 as corner marker, 2 or 8 as endpoints)\n3. If 6 marker present: Draw L-shape connecting corner (6) to endpoints, output 6 at corner, 2 for connecting lines, 0 elsewhere\n4. If no 6 marker: Invert the query interior pattern (0\u21922, non-zero\u21920)\n5. Output grid size equals interior dimensions\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "From the training pairs and the given description, the procedure is:\n\n1. **Find a framed rectangular interior**: a hollow rectangle whose border is all one color (here, color 6) and whose interior is mostly 0, possibly with a few markers.\n\n2. **Choose the interior that contains a `6` marker inside** (and `2`/`8` as possible endpoints).  \n   In the test grid there are two large 6\u2011colored rectangular frames near the bottom:\n\n   - Left frame: rows 19\u201326, columns 4\u201311. Its interior (rows 20\u201325, cols 5\u201310) is a 6\u00d76 block of all 0s, with **no internal 6 or 8 markers**.\n   - Right frame: rows 18\u201325, columns 17\u201324. Its interior (rows 19\u201324, cols 18\u201323) is also 6\u00d76 but contains markers:\n\n     Interior (rows 19\u201324, cols 18\u201323), written as a 6\u00d76:\n\n     ```\n     0 0 0 0 8 0\n     0 0 0 0 6 8\n     0 0 0 0 0 0\n     0 0 0 0 0 0\n     0 0 0 0 0 0\n     0 0 0 0 0 0\n     ```\n\n     Here the unique internal `6` is at local coordinates (row 2, col 5); there are `8`s at (1,5) and (2,6).\n\n   Because this interior contains the special `6` marker (and `8`s along its row/column), this is the **query interior** we must transform.\n\n3. **Interpret the markers and draw the L\u2011shape**:\n\n   - Treat the internal `6` as the **corner** of the L.\n   - Treat `8`s lying in the same row or column as the **endpoints** of the two arms:\n     - Endpoint above: (1,5) \u2014 same column as the `6`.\n     - Endpoint to the right: (2,6) \u2014 same row as the `6`.\n   - Draw straight Manhattan paths from the corner `6` to each endpoint:\n     - Vertical arm: from (2,5) up to (1,5).\n     - Horizontal arm: from (2,5) right to (2,6).\n   - In the output:\n     - Put `6` at the corner cell.\n     - Put `2` along the connecting segments (including the former endpoint locations).\n     - All other interior cells become `0`.\n\n   The interior is 6\u00d76, so the output must also be **6\u00d76**.\n\n4. **Construct the output grid** (local coordinates 1..6 for rows and columns):\n\n   - Non\u2011zero cells:\n     - (1,5) = 2\n     - (2,5) = 6\n     - (2,6) = 2\n   - Everything else = 0.\n\nSo the final 6\u00d76 output grid is:\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 2 0  \nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 6 2  \nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0  \nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0  \nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0  \nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0  \n\n## Completed output grid\n\n0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,6,2\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain: (1) repeating diagonal background patterns with cyclic color sequences (colors 0-6), (2) horizontal/vertical partitioning lines of single colors (4, 1, 2) dividing grids into regions, (3) hollow rectangular frames made of single colors (8, 4, 6, 3) of varying sizes, (4) interior regions filled with color 0 (sometimes containing internal patterns), (5) marker cells using colors 6 and 8 at specific positions, (6) small template grids (4x4, 5x5) with simple geometric shapes (L-shapes) using colors 0, 2, and 6, and (7) scattered single-cell instances of color 8 as noise/variation in backgrounds.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Find pairs of bordered rectangular frames within partitioned regions\n2. Identify the interior with special markers (6 as corner marker, 2 or 8 as endpoints)\n3. If 6 marker present: Draw L-shape connecting corner (6) to endpoints, output 6 at corner, 2 for connecting lines, 0 elsewhere\n4. If no 6 marker: Invert the query interior pattern (0\u21922, non-zero\u21920)\n5. Output grid size equals interior dimensions\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this puzzle, I need to identify rectangular frames within partitioned regions and apply the transformation rules.\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n\n1. **Partitioning lines**: I can see horizontal lines of 1s (rows 2, 13) and 4s (rows 16, 26) that divide the grid into regions.\n\n2. **Upper region frames (bordered by 3s)**:\n   - Frame 1 (rows 4-11, cols 5-12): Interior has a symmetric pattern with 8s at corners/edges and 3s in the middle\n   - Frame 2 (rows 4-11, cols 19-26): Interior is mostly 0s with some 8s and 3s in the top-left\n\n3. **Lower region frames (bordered by 6s)**:\n   - Frame 3 (rows 18-25, cols 3-10): Interior is entirely 0s (6\u00d76)\n   - Frame 4 (rows 17-24, cols 16-23): Interior (6\u00d76) contains:\n     ```\n     0,0,0,0,8,0\n     0,0,0,0,6,8\n     0,0,0,0,0,0\n     0,0,0,0,0,0\n     0,0,0,0,0,0\n     0,0,0,0,0,0\n     ```\n\n**Applying the transformation:**\n\nFrame 4 contains a **6 marker at position (1,4)**. According to the transformation rules:\n- When a 6 marker is present, draw an L-shape with the 6 at the corner\n- The L-shape extends from the corner to the edges\n\nWith the corner at (1,4):\n- **Horizontal arm**: extends LEFT from (1,4) to (1,0) - filled with 2s\n- **Vertical arm**: extends DOWN from (1,4) to (5,4) - filled with 2s\n- The 6 remains at the corner position\n- Everything else becomes 0\n\n**Output construction (6\u00d76 grid):**\n- Row 0: All 0s (above the L corner)\n- Row 1: 2s from col 0-3, 6 at col 4, 0 at col 5\n- Rows 2-5: 0s except col 4 which has 2s\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0\n2,2,2,2,6,0\n0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,2,0\n```",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain: (1) repeating diagonal background patterns with cyclic color sequences (colors 0-6), (2) horizontal/vertical partitioning lines of single colors (4, 1, 2) dividing grids into regions, (3) hollow rectangular frames made of single colors (8, 4, 6, 3) of varying sizes, (4) interior regions filled with color 0 (sometimes containing internal patterns), (5) marker cells using colors 6 and 8 at specific positions, (6) small template grids (4x4, 5x5) with simple geometric shapes (L-shapes) using colors 0, 2, and 6, and (7) scattered single-cell instances of color 8 as noise/variation in backgrounds.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Find pairs of bordered rectangular frames within partitioned regions\n2. Identify the interior with special markers (6 as corner marker, 2 or 8 as endpoints)\n3. If 6 marker present: Draw L-shape connecting corner (6) to endpoints, output 6 at corner, 2 for connecting lines, 0 elsewhere\n4. If no 6 marker: Invert the query interior pattern (0\u21922, non-zero\u21920)\n5. Output grid size equals interior dimensions\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "The large inputs each contain a small \u201croom\u2019\u2019 bounded by a single colour. For each case the required output comes from the interior of that room, processed in a consistent way:\n\n* Locate the rectangular frame of constant colour; take only its interior cells for processing.\n* If there is any\u202f`6` inside the interior, take the first such `6` in reading order as the anchor; otherwise take as anchor the rightmost non\u2011zero in the row with the most non\u2011zeros.\n* Create an output grid the same size as the interior, initialised to `0`.\n* Fill the entire anchor row with `2`, leaving the anchor cell as `6` if it was `6`.\n* Fill the anchor column, and any other columns in the anchor row which are `0` in the original interior, with `2` wherever the original interior has `0` (skip original non\u2011zeros).\n* As a final top\u2013row adjustment, if there is a non\u2011zero before the anchor column in the top interior row, fill from column\u202f0 up to that position with `2`.\n\nFor the test case the frame of `6`s from rows\u202f17\u201324 and cols\u202f16\u201323 encloses a 6\u00d76 interior:\n```\n0 0 0 0 8 0\n0 0 0 0 6 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\nThe first `6` is at (1,\u202f4), so the anchor row is 1 and anchor column 4. Applying the steps above yields the following output grid:\n\n2,2,2,2,0,0\n2,2,2,2,6,2\n2,2,2,2,2,0\n2,2,2,2,2,0\n2,2,2,2,2,0\n2,2,2,2,2,0",

Background/Tiled Patterns\nLarge grids feature **repeating diagonal stripe patterns** using cyclic color sequences. These sequences typically involve colors like 0-1-2-3 or 2-3-4-5-6, creating a consistent tiled background that spans the grid.\n\n### 2. Partitioning Lines\n**Horizontal and vertical lines** of a single color (commonly color 4, color 1, or color 2) that extend across significant portions of the grid. These lines divide the grid into distinct rectangular regions or sections.\n\n### 3. Rectangular Frames/Outlines\n**Hollow rectangular borders** made of a single color (typically color 8, color 4, color 3, or color 6). These frames vary in size and enclose specific interior regions. The frame borders are typically one cell thick.\n\n### 4. Interior Fill Regions\n**Filled areas inside rectangular frames**, often filled predominantly with color 0. These regions may be uniformly filled or contain simple internal patterns with colors like color 2 or color 4.\n\n### 5. Marker/Accent Cells\n**Single cells or small clusters** of distinctive colors (commonly color 6 or color 8) that appear at specific positions within frames or patterns, potentially marking corners or special locations.\n\n### 6. Small Pattern Templates\n**Small grids (4x4 or 5x5)** containing simple geometric shapes such as L-shapes or cross-like configurations. These use colors 0, 2, and 6, with one color forming the shape against a background of another.\n\n### 7. Scattered/Noise Points\n**Isolated instances of color 8** appearing sporadically throughout grids, breaking the regularity of background patterns.\n\n<objects_summary>\nThe grids contain: (1) repeating diagonal background patterns with cyclic color sequences (colors 0-6), (2) horizontal/vertical partitioning lines of single colors (4, 1, 2) dividing grids into regions, (3) hollow rectangular frames made of single colors (8, 4, 6, 3) of varying sizes, (4) interior regions filled with color 0 (sometimes containing internal patterns), (5) marker cells using colors 6 and 8 at specific positions, (6) small template grids (4x4, 5x5) with simple geometric shapes (L-shapes) using colors 0, 2, and 6, and (7) scattered single-cell instances of color 8 as noise/variation in backgrounds.\n</objects_summary>",

Objects Description\nThe grids contain: (1) repeating diagonal background patterns with cyclic color sequences (colors 0-6), (2) horizontal/vertical partitioning lines of single colors (4, 1, 2) dividing grids into regions, (3) hollow rectangular frames made of single colors (8, 4, 6, 3) of varying sizes, (4) interior regions filled with color 0 (sometimes containing internal patterns), (5) marker cells using colors 6 and 8 at specific positions, (6) small template grids (4x4, 5x5) with simple geometric shapes (L-shapes) using colors 0, 2, and 6, and (7) scattered single-cell instances of color 8 as noise/variation in backgrounds.",

The 6 (corner) is preserved, and 2s fill the connecting lines.\n\n**Example 2:**\n- Grid has lines of 4s and 2s creating partitions  \n- Contains 8-bordered rectangles in different regions\n- Bottom-right interior has a pattern with 2s (no 6 markers)\n- **Output**: Direct inversion of the pattern - where the interior has 0\u2192output 2, where non-zero\u2192output 0\n\n## Key Transformation Rules:\n\n1. **Identify bounded rectangular regions** within partitioned areas (borders of 4, 8, 6, or 3)\n\n2. **Extract interior contents** of matching rectangle pairs\n\n3. **If interior contains 6 markers** (corner markers):\n   - 6 marks the corner/anchor point\n   - Other markers (2 or 8) indicate endpoints\n   - Draw lines connecting corner to endpoints\n   - Output: 6 at corner, 2 along lines, 0 elsewhere\n\n4. **If no 6 markers present**:\n   - Take the \"query\" interior (typically bottom-right)\n   - Invert: 0\u21922, non-zero\u21920\n\n5. **Output size matches interior dimensions**\n\n## Test Input Analysis:\n- 6-bordered rectangles in lower region (rows 17-25)\n- Left interior (cols 4-9): all 0s\n- Right interior (cols 17-22): Has markers:\n  - 8 at position (0,4)\n  - 6 at position (1,4) - corner\n  - 8 at position (1,5)\n- Since 6 marker exists, connect corner to endpoints forming small L-shape\n\n<transformation_summary>\n1.

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain: (1) repeating diagonal background patterns with cyclic color sequences (colors 0-6), (2) horizontal/vertical partitioning lines of single colors (4, 1, 2) dividing grids into regions, (3) hollow rectangular frames made of single colors (8, 4, 6, 3) of varying sizes, (4) interior regions filled with color 0 (sometimes containing internal patterns), (5) marker cells using colors 6 and 8 at specific positions, (6) small template grids (4x4, 5x5) with simple geometric shapes (L-shapes) using colors 0, 2, and 6, and (7) scattered single-cell instances of color 8 as noise/variation in backgrounds.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Find pairs of bordered rectangular frames within partitioned regions\n2. Identify the interior with special markers (6 as corner marker, 2 or 8 as endpoints)\n3. If 6 marker present: Draw L-shape connecting corner (6) to endpoints, output 6 at corner, 2 for connecting lines, 0 elsewhere\n4. If no 6 marker: Invert the query interior pattern (0\u21922, non-zero\u21920)\n5. Output grid size equals interior dimensions\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
