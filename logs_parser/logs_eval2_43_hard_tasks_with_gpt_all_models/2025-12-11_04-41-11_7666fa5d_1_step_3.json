        "Full raw LLM response": "**Solution for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so the task at hand involves processing 16x16 grids of integers, where a teal background (8) and a maroon foreground (9) are given, and I have to transform them to include red (2) regions bounded by the foreground pixels. The examples give me the pattern: the red color fills regions bounded by the foreground colors.\n\nIt seems I need to connect the foreground pixels to form closed shapes, either implicitly or explicitly. I initially explored connecting adjacent pixels with lines and applying a flood-fill, but the gaps in the boundaries made this tricky. I then realized that I can create boundaries in 2D shapes, and the challenge lies in understanding how these boundaries work.\n\nI analyzed example 1 carefully to figure out the rule, realizing I can define \"lines\" from each other. I noted that I can fill \"inside\" shapes of the grid. From there, I saw that the pattern involves filling the area bounded by \"connecting\" lines, forming ribbons or winding tubes or folded polygons. Then I focused on identifying segments or sections of a continuous boundary. In example 2 I identified segments and fill regions, and I noted that maybe these line segments are being organized, and then the regions between them are being filled.\n\nIn the case of Test Input, I noted the foreground pixels formed diagonal lines. I looked at the relative distances and positions of the input foreground colors. The answer is based around the shape that is made from diagonal lines, the algorithm needs to build \"ribbons\" or \"quadrilaterals\" from these diagonal lines. It is possible to see these regions as a collection of shapes (quadrilaterals) and fill them, as opposed to a scan-line type flood-fill.\n\nSo, the plan is to connect these segments of code, sort the segments, form polygons with fillable regions between them, and use these results for the Test Input. This suggests a pattern-based approach:\n1.  **Identify Diagonal Segments**: Find the lines of same color that are diagonal.\n2.  **Order Segments**: Establish a chain or linear order. The order seems to be based on the starts and ends of each segment. The starts form diagonals and the ends form diagonals, and the diagonal can overlap.\n3.  **Create Polygons**:  Create a \"Polygon\" between adjacent segments.\n4.  **Fill**: Fill in the internal regions of the polygon with color 2.\n\nThe task involves filling the regions between diagonal segments formed by the foreground pixels. The foreground pixels form segments with a slope of +1 row, -1 column. These segments can be ordered into a chain, and the areas between adjacent segments in the chain are filled with color 2 (red).\n\n**Analysis of Test Input:**\n1.  **Identify Segments:**\n    -   Segment 1 (S1): (4,4) to (5,3).\n    -   Segment 2 (S2): (4,9) to (9,4).\n    -   Segment 3 (S3): (5,13) to (13,5).\n    -   Segment 4 (S4): (7,15) to (14,8).\n\n2.  **Define Quadrilaterals (Regions to Fill):**\n    -   **Region 1 (S1 to S2):** Bounded by S1, S2, line connecting Starts(4,4)-(4,9), line connecting Ends(5,3)-(9,4).\n    -   **Region 2 (S2 to S3):** Bounded by S2, S3, line connecting Starts(4,9)-(5,13), line connecting Ends(9,4)-(13,5).\n    -   **Region 3 (S3 to S4):** Bounded by S3, S4, line connecting Starts(5,13)-(7,15), line connecting Ends(13,5)-(14,8).\n\n3.  **Compute Fill for Each Row:**\n    -   **Row 4:** S1 at 4, S2 at 9. Fill region 1 between them: **5, 6, 7, 8**.\n    -   **Row 5:** S1 at 3, S2 at 8. Fill region 1: **4, 5, 6, 7**. S2 at 8, S3 at 13 (start line ends). Fill region 2: **9, 10, 11, 12**.\n    -   **Row 6:** Region 1 lower bound (line 5,3->9,4 at row 6 is ~3.25->4). S2 at 7. Fill region 1: **4, 5, 6**. S2 at 7, S3 at 12. Fill region 2: **8, 9, 10, 11**. Region 3 (start line 5,13->7,15 at row 6 is 14). Fill region 3: **13**.\n    -   **Row 7:** Region 1 bound ~3.5->4. S2 at 6. Fill region 1: **4, 5**. S2 at 6, S3 at 11. Fill region 2: **7, 8, 9, 10**. S3 at 11, Start line 15. Fill region 3: **12, 13, 14**.\n    -   **Row 8:** Region 1 bound ~3.75->4. S2 at 5. Fill region 1: **4**. S2 at 5, S3 at 10. Fill region 2: **6, 7, 8, 9**. S3 at 10, S4 at 14. Fill region 3: **11, 12, 13**.\n    -   **Row 9:** Region 1 ends. S2 at 4. S2 at 4, S3 at 9. Fill region 2: **5, 6, 7, 8**.

Fill region 3: **9, 10, 11**.\n    -   **Row 11:** Region 2 bound ~4.5->5. S3 at 7. Fill region 2: **5, 6**. S3 at 7, S4 at 11. Fill region 3: **8, 9, 10**.\n    -   **Row 12:** Region 2 bound ~4.75->5. S3 at 6. Fill region 2: **5**. S3 at 6, S4 at 10. Fill region 3: **7, 8, 9**.\n    -   **Row 13:** Region 2 ends. S3 at 5. S3 at 5, S4 at 9. Fill region 3: **6, 7, 8**.\n    -   **Row 14:** Region 3 ends. S4 at 8.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task: Polygon Interior Fill**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to crack an ARC task that's basically about filling the interior of shapes defined by some colored pixels. From the examples, it looks like a teal background (8), and the pattern pixels (4 in Example 1, 3 in Example 2, and 9 in the test input) form these boundaries. The output is basically the same, except some regions get filled with another color, 2 (red). It's a 16x16 grid, and the trick is figuring out *what* defines \"inside.\"\n\nAt first, I thought it was about some kind of flood fill or maybe tracing connected components. But looking closely, I realized it's not simply \"fill every enclosed space.\" The examples have this neat diagonal structure with the pattern pixels, forming these parallel lines. It seems like the 2s are filling the space between these parallel diagonals, but there's a definite pattern.\n\nI started tracing lines and noticed that a specific area between a pair of lines has a specific filling pattern. Then I realized I was overcomplicating things! Essentially, the 2s are appearing in regions where the \"shadows\" of the pattern lines overlap.\n\nI think it's a \"polygon interior\" problem, where the colored pixels define the boundaries. The rule seems to be to:\n\n1.  **Identify linear segments of pattern pixels.**\n2.  **Group them by orientation (slope +1 or -1).**\n3.  **Find pairs of parallel segments that \"face\" each other.**\n4.  **Define a region bounded by:**\n    *   The two segments.\n    *   Lines perpendicular to the segments connecting their projected endpoints, or simply the overlap.\n5.  **Fill this region with color 2.**\n\nFor the test input, I need to find the lines (9s), determine the parallel pairs, compute the overlap regions using those \"r-c\" values and populate the grid. Now it's a matter of plugging and chugging through the math!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the grid by filling the regions enclosed by the pattern pixels (color 9 in the test case). Based on the examples, the transformation follows a specific geometric rule:\n1.  **Identify Boundary Lines:** The pattern pixels form parallel diagonal lines. In the test input, these are lines with a slope of -1 (where row index + column index = constant $k$).\n2.  **Identify Channels:** We look for the regions (\"channels\") between consecutive diagonal lines.\n3.  **Determine Fill Area:** Within each channel, we identify the \"shadow\" or perpendicular overlap of the two bounding lines. Specifically, if the two lines cover a range of diagonals in the perpendicular direction ($d = r - c$), the fill region is the intersection of these ranges.\n    *   Line 1: $r+c = 8$. Range of $r-c$: $[0, 2]$.\n    *   Line 2: $r+c = 13$. Range of $r-c$: $[-5, 5]$.\n    *   Line 3: $r+c = 18$. Range of $r-c$: $[-8, 8]$.\n    *   Line 4: $r+c = 22$. Range of $r-c$: $[-8, 8]$.\n\n    This defines three regions to fill with color 2 (red):\n    *   **Region 1 (between Line 1 and 2):** Pixels where $8 < r+c < 13$ and $0 \\le r-c \\le 2$.\n    *   **Region 2 (between Line 2 and 3):** Pixels where $13 < r+c < 18$ and $-5 \\le r-c \\le 5$.\n    *   **Region 3 (between Line 3 and 4):** Pixels where $18 < r+c < 22$ and $-8 \\le r-c \\le 8$.\n\n    Any pixel falling into these valid $(r, c)$ coordinates is changed to 2. All other pixels (background 8 and pattern 9) remain unchanged.\n\nHere is the completed output grid:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,2,2,8,8,9,2,2,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,2,9,2,2,8\n8,8,8,8,8,2,9,2,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,9\n8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,9,8\n8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,2,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

The transformation fills regions with color 2.\n\nThe diagonal lines go in the \"down-left\" direction (where row+column = constant). Looking at the fill pattern:\n- The 2s appear in regions bounded by these diagonal lines\n- Specifically, cells between consecutive diagonal lines get filled with 2\n- The fill appears between pairs of the colored diagonal markers on each row\n\n**For the test input:**\n\nI identified the 9s forming diagonal lines where row+col equals:\n- r+c=8: rows 4-5\n- r+c=13: rows 4-9  \n- r+c=18: rows 5-13\n- r+c=22: rows 7-15\n\nThe transformation fills the regions between these diagonal lines with 2s. For each row, cells between consecutive 9s (that fall between the diagonal boundaries) are filled.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,2,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,2,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,2,9,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,9\n8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,9,8\n8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\nIn both examples, I see:\n1. The background is 8\n2. There are diagonal lines (slope -1) of a colored value (4 in Ex1, 3 in Ex2)\n3. The transformation fills regions between pairs of diagonal lines with 2s\n\nThe diagonals have a consistent slope (-1), meaning points on the same diagonal satisfy row + col = constant (the \"intercept\").\n\nThe filled regions appear to be triangular/diamond shapes bounded by pairs of diagonal lines. The fill:\n- Appears between adjacent diagonal intercepts\n- Forms triangular shapes with apexes at diagonal endpoints\n- Extends slightly beyond where diagonals end\n\n**Analyzing Test Input:**\n\nThe 9s form diagonal lines with intercepts:\n- Intercept 8: rows 4-5 (ending at row 5, col 3)\n- Intercept 13: rows 4-9 (ending at row 9, col 4)  \n- Intercept 18: rows 5-13 (ending at row 13, col 5)\n- Intercept 22: rows 7-15 (ending at row 15, col 7)\n\n**Applying the transformation:**\n\nFor each pair of adjacent diagonals, I fill the region between them:\n- Between intercepts 8 and 13: rows 4-7 (with extension past row 5)\n- Between intercepts 13 and 18: rows 5-12 (with extension past row 9)\n- Between intercepts 18 and 22: rows 7-14 (with extension past row 13)\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,2,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,2,9,8,8\n8,8,8,2,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,2,9,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,2,9,2,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,9\n8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,9,8\n8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,2,2,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,2,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Identify the key colors and structure**\n\n   In all three grids:\n\n   - Background is color `8`.\n   - There is a single \u201cspecial\u201d color:\n     - Example 1: `4`\n     - Example 2: `3`\n     - Test: `9`\n   - The special color forms long 45\u00b0 diagonals (anti-diagonals, i.e. decreasing column as row increases).\n\n2. **Empirical pattern from the examples**\n\n   Looking at Examples 1 and 2, one consistent, *local* pattern that always holds is:\n\n   > Whenever you have two special-color cells diagonally adjacent in the **down-left** direction  \n   > i.e. at `(r, c)` and `(r+1, c-1)`,  \n   > then in the output there is a cell of color `2` at `(r+1, c)`  \n   > (directly to the right of the lower special cell).\n\n   Concretely in Example 2:\n   - Special color `3` at `(2,4)` and `(3,3)` \u21d2 output has `2` at `(3,4)`.\n   - `3` at `(3,3)` and `(4,2)` \u21d2 `2` at `(4,3)`.\n   - `3` at `(3,8)` and `(4,7)` \u21d2 `2` at `(4,8)`.\n   - `3` at `(2,9)` and `(3,8)` \u21d2 `2` at `(3,9)`.\n   - And so on.\n\n   The same pattern appears along the corresponding diagonals in Example 1 with color `4`.\n\n   Other `2`s in the examples can be viewed as the result of applying that diagonal \u201cbridging\u201d repeatedly along extended diagonal chains, but the primitive operation is that single-step bridge.\n\n3. **Apply the primitive rule to the test grid**\n\n   For the test, the special color is `9`. We scan for all pairs of `9`s that satisfy:\n\n   - One at `(r, c)`\n   - Another at `(r+1, c-1)` (down-left neighbor)\n   - Then we paint `(r+1, c)` as `2` (if it is background `8`).\n\n   Enumerating all such pairs in the test input:\n\n   - `(4,4)` and `(5,3)` \u21d2 `(5,4)` becomes `2`\n   - `(4,9)` and `(5,8)` \u21d2 `(5,9)` becomes `2`\n   - `(5,8)` and `(6,7)` \u21d2 `(6,8)` becomes `2`\n   - `(5,13)` and `(6,12)` \u21d2 `(6,13)` becomes `2`\n   - `(6,7)` and `(7,6)` \u21d2 `(7,7)` becomes `2`\n   - `(6,12)` and `(7,11)` \u21d2 `(7,12)` becomes `2`\n   - `(7,6)` and `(8,5)` \u21d2 `(8,6)` becomes `2`\n   - `(7,11)` and `(8,10)` \u21d2 `(8,11)` becomes `2`\n   - `(7,15)` and `(8,14)` \u21d2 `(8,15)` becomes `2`\n   - `(8,5)` and `(9,4)` \u21d2 `(9,5)` becomes `2`\n   - `(8,10)` and `(9,9)` \u21d2 `(9,10)` becomes `2`\n   - `(8,14)` and `(9,13)` \u21d2 `(9,14)` becomes `2`\n   - `(9,9)` and `(10,8)` \u21d2 `(10,9)` becomes `2`\n   - `(9,13)` and `(10,12)` \u21d2 `(10,13)` becomes `2`\n   - `(10,8)` and `(11,7)` \u21d2 `(11,8)` becomes `2`\n   - `(10,12)` and `(11,11)` \u21d2 `(11,12)` becomes `2`\n   - `(11,7)` and `(12,6)` \u21d2 `(12,7)` becomes `2`\n   - `(11,11)` and `(12,10)` \u21d2 `(12,11)` becomes `2`\n   - `(12,6)` and `(13,5)` \u21d2 `(13,6)` becomes `2`\n   - `(12,10)` and `(13,9)` \u21d2 `(13,10)` becomes `2`\n   - `(13,9)` and `(14,8)` \u21d2 `(14,9)` becomes `2`\n   - `(14,8)` and `(15,7)` \u21d2 `(15,8)` becomes `2`\n\n   All these target cells are originally `8`, so we can safely recolor them as `2`. All original `9`s stay as `9`. All other `8`s remain `8`.\n\n4. **Construct the final output grid**\n\n   Starting from the input and applying the updates above, we obtain:\n\n   - Rows 0\u20134 unchanged (no bridging targets there).\n   - Rows 5\u201315 modified where listed.\n\n**Final output grid**\n\nRow by row:\n\n1. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n2. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n3. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n4. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n5. `8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n6. `8,8,8,9,2,8,8,8,9,2,8,8,8,9,8,8`\n7. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,8,8,8,9,2,8,8`\n8. `8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,8,8,8,9,2,8,8,9`\n9. `8,8,8,8,8,9,2,8,8,8,9,2,8,8,9,2`\n10. `8,8,8,8,9,2,8,8,8,9,2,8,8,9,2,8`\n11. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,8,8,9,2,8,8`\n12. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,8,8,9,2,8,8,8`\n13. `8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,8,8,9,2,8,8,8,8`\n14. `8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,9,2,8,8,8,8,8`\n15. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n16. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Below is how I interpreted the rule and why for this specific test grid it leads to \u201cno change\u201d.\n\n---\n\n### Interpreting the examples\n\nAcross the examples:\n\n- The background is color `8`.\n- There is a *single* other color (`4` in Example\u00a01, `3` in Example\u00a02).\n- In the **output**, that special color stays where it was.\n- A new color `2` is added, forming a solid region that sits **inside** a structure traced out by the special color.\n\nIn both solved examples:\n\n- The special-color cells reach all four borders of the grid.\n- If you look at the entire pattern of that color, it forms a kind of \u201cframe\u201d or boundary that encloses one or more interior regions.\n- The `2`s are placed **only in those enclosed interior regions**; they do not appear \u201coutside\u201d the frame.\n- Where there is no fully enclosed interior (i.e. if a region of `8`s is open to the outside of the frame), that region is not filled with `2`.\n\nSo an operative rule that fits both examples is:\n\n> 1. Identify the background color (here `8`).\n> 2. Identify the other color (`4` or `3`) as the *boundary color*.\n> 3. Determine whether those boundary-color cells form a closed contour that encloses some interior background cells.\n> 4. If so, fill those enclosed interiors with color `2` (keeping the boundary cells themselves unchanged).\n\nThis matches what you see:\n- In Example\u00a01, the `4`s form two enclosing structures; the areas inside them are filled with `2`.\n- In Example\u00a02, the `3`s form a more complex enclosing \u201cX\u201d-shaped boundary; the interior is filled with `2`, but open areas connected to the outside remain `8`.\n\n---\n\n### Applying that reasoning to the test\n\nIn the test grid:\n\n- Background is again `8`.\n- The only other color is `9`.\n\nWe check whether the `9` cells form any **closed** loop that actually encloses some `8`s:\n\n- The `9`s appear in a cross/diagonal structure centered in the lower-middle of the grid.\n- They **do not** touch the top border (rows 0\u20133 are entirely `8`).\n- The leftmost `9` is at column 3; there is no contact with the left edge (`col 0`).\n- There are clear paths of `8`s from any region \u201cinside\u201d the apparent cross out to the top and left edges, so no region of `8`s is truly enclosed by `9`s.\n\nUnder the rule consistent with the solved examples, since the `9` pattern does **not** form a closed frame that encloses any background area, **no cells get filled with `2`**; the grid stays as it is.\n\nSo the transformation on this test input is effectively: **output = input**.\n\n---\n\n### Final output grid\n\nHere is the completed output grid (identical to the test input):\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,9  \n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,9,8  \n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,9,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,9,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Working out the rule**\n\nIn both solved examples the non\u2011background digits lie on NW\u2013SE diagonals (constant\u00a0`r+c`) and come in pairs of parallel segments. The output 2s fill the space between adjacent diagonal segments, but they taper at the start if one segment starts later, and taper at the end if one segment ends later. A clean way to express it per pair of left/right diagonals of sums `S_L<S_R` is:\n\n- For each contiguous segment of `S_L` (rows `rL0\u2026rL1`) and each contiguous segment of `S_R` (`rR0\u2026rR1`) that overlap (`r\u2208[max(rL0,rR0),min(rL1,rR1)]`), compute the base interior in that row as\n  `left=S_L\u2212r+1` (one to the right of the left boundary) and `right=S_R\u2212r\u22121` (one to the left of the right boundary).\n\n- If the left segment doesn\u2019t start more than one row before the right (`rR0\u2212rL0\u22641`), clip the right edge using the left segment\u2019s top `v` value: `vmin=2*rL0\u2212S_L`, set `right=min(right, r\u2212vmin)`. This produces the ramp\u2011up seen in the examples.\n\n- If the right segment ends at least one row after the left (`rR1\u2212rL1\u22651`), clip the left edge using the right segment\u2019s bottom `v`: `vmax=2*rR1\u2212S_R`, set `left=max(left, r\u2212vmax)`. This gives the ramp\u2011down.\n\n- Fill cells `c` between `left` and `right` inclusive with 2, leaving the original coloured digits intact.\n\nApplying this to the test diagonals (sums 8,13,18,22,23 with a gap in the sum\u201122 diagonal at row\u00a014) yields two bands of 2s between sums\u00a013\u201318 and 18\u201322, plus a small band at row\u00a05 between sums\u00a08\u201313, matching the pattern of the examples.\n\n**Resulting grid**\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,2,2,8,8,9,2,2,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,2,9,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,9\n8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,9,8\n8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "To reproduce the transformation seen in the examples I looked at where the new colour \u201c2\u201d appears. All of the coloured input cells lie on north\u2011west/south\u2011east anti\u2011diagonals (constant\u202fr+c). For each such diagonal segment you take the next higher\u2011sum diagonal segment whose row range overlaps or touches it, form the quadrilateral by joining their corresponding endpoints, and fill the interior of that trapezoid with colour\u202f2, leaving the original coloured cells intact. Doing this for each consecutive overlapping pair of diagonal segments produces the bands of 2\u2019s seen in the examples.\n\nIn the test grid the 9\u2019s lie on diagonal segments with sums 10,\u202f15,\u202f20,\u202f24 and 25. The overlapping consecutive pairs 10\u201315, 15\u201320 and 20\u201324 generate three trapezoids, which when filled give the following output (no cells are overwritten where a 9 already exists):\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,2,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,2,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,2,9,2,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,2,9,2,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,9\n8,8,8,8,2,9,2,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,9,8\n8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,2,2,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,2,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",
