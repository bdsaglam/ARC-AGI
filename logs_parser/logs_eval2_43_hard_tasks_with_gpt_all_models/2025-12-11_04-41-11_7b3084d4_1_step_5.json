            "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**\n\nAlright, the user wants me to tackle an ARC task.  It's clear I need to adhere to the explicit instructions, especially regarding the output format, despite the initial confusing wording about the hidden \"scratchpad\" and the \"reveal only the final answer grid\" instructions.  I will provide both the explanation and the final grid as the instructions say.  The prompt's structure hints at a possible prompt injection attempt or a desire for a very specific thought process, but I will ignore that. My approach will be a standard one that balances the \"hidden scratchpad\" approach and the visible \"explanation\".\n\n**Task Analysis and Pattern Identification**\n\nThe core of this is about identifying patterns. I need to dissect the provided examples. The input seems to involve a decomposition of a larger grid, where shapes are defined by the distribution of values, such as the colors or shape identifiers.  The task involves recognizing how these shapes are organized within the input and how they're rearranged in the output. I'll need to pay close attention to the colors and their positions.  It looks like there's some kind of tiling or overlapping of elements, but the precise transformation is unclear.\n\n**Hypothesis Formulation and Iterative Refinement**\n\nMy first hypothesis is that the output grid is generated by combining the input shapes, but the shape regions might be reorganized or rotated.  I'm going to look at the dimensions, try to discern a base unit, and compare the shapes in the input and output.\n\nI initially looked at the bounding boxes, and thought there might be some kind of scaling or overlap, but then, I found that there is some pattern involving quadrants. After a careful analysis of the output layouts in relation to the quadrants from the input images, I found the shapes are moving in a consistent pattern. \n\n**Establishing a Rule: Shape Permutation**\n\nI found that there is some type of \"Special shape\" that defines the transformation to perform to move the shapes into a pattern. I need to identify this Special shape based on some marker. By comparing the layout in each example, the permutation became clearer: There is a mapping of the quadrants in a cyclic pattern to the Output. The \"Special Shape\" in the input gets placed in the Top-Left of the output. I can express this permutation as some form of rotation based on an identified value within the grid's quadrant structure.\n\n**Handling of Holes and Background**\n\nI found that there are several holes in shapes that are located at specific coordinates (defined as the shape is located on the grid). These have to be filled.  Initially, I thought some \"background\" value was present, but then I found I should fill the holes by looking at the adjacent neighbors and using the color in the \"Opposite\" position.  This seems to work and maintain symmetry across the Output Grid.\n\n**Applying the Rules to the Test Input and Generating Output**\n\nFinally, I will analyze the test input and identify its quadrants. Based on these shapes, I will apply the rules, identify the \"Special\" shape in the test input, and use the permutation found earlier to determine its output location. I will crop the input into \"tiles\", fill the holes with the rules I established earlier, and stitch the tile blocks together. By extracting the tiles and using the permutation, I will generate the final output grid, applying the fill rule to all shapes in the composition.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI believe this approach will work, especially because it takes a structured decomposition and analysis strategy. The rules found can be applied systematically and the resulting output grid should be correct.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a 20x20 input grid into an output grid based on the logic inferred from three examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Decomposition:** Each input grid contains four distinct colored shapes, roughly one in each quadrant (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right).\n2.  **Selection & Transformation:** The output grid is a composition of cropped versions of these four shapes. The layout of the shapes in the output is a permutation of their original positions.\n3.  **Permutation Logic:**\n    *   One shape always contains a unique \"marker\" pixel (color 5 mixed with color 7 in the examples, or just a distinct pixel). Let's call this the \"Special\" shape.\n    *   In the output, the Special shape is always moved to the **Top-Left** quadrant.\n    *   The rearrangement of the other quadrants depends on the original position of the Special shape:\n        *   **Rule:** The transformation ensures the Special shape ends up at Top-Left.\n        *   If the Special shape is in the **Top Row** of the input (TL or TR), the output's Top Row consists of the input's Top Row shapes, possibly swapped so Special is at TL. The Bottom Row remains the same as the input's Bottom Row.\n        *   If the Special shape is in the **Bottom Row** of the input (BL or BR), the output's Top Row consists of the input's Bottom Row shapes (swapped if necessary to put Special at TL). The output's Bottom Row consists of the input's **Top Row** shapes, but **reversed** (swapped horizontally).\n4.  **Content & Filling:**\n    *   The shapes are cropped to a standard size. In the test input, the patterns suggest 7x7 blocks.\n    *   \"Holes\" (0s) within the shapes are filled with the color of the shape that occupies the adjacent quadrant in the output. specifically:\n        *   **Vertical Filling:** Top-row blocks fill their holes with the color of the block directly below them.\n        *   **Horizontal Filling:** Bottom-row blocks fill their holes with the color of the block horizontally adjacent to them (or vertically from above, but the examples suggest a specific neighbor relationship: TL filled by BL, TR filled by BR, BR filled by BL, BL filled by BR). Actually, looking at Example 1, the logic is consistent with: Top blocks filled by Bottom blocks, and Bottom blocks filled by their horizontal neighbors (or each other). Let's apply: TL holes $\\leftarrow$ Color of BL; TR holes $\\leftarrow$ Color of BR; BL holes $\\leftarrow$ Color of BR; BR holes $\\leftarrow$ Color of BL.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Identify Shapes:**\n    *   **TL:** Shape 2 (Blue).\n    *   **TR:** Shape 3 (Green).\n    *   **BL:** Shape 7 (Orange) with a marker 5 (Gray). This is the **Special** shape.\n    *   **BR:** Shape 8 (Teal).\n2.  **Permutation:**\n    *   Special is at **BL** (Bottom Row).\n    *   **Output Top Row:** Input Bottom Row (BL, BR) $\\rightarrow$ [Shape 7, Shape 8]. (Special is already at left, so order is 7, 8).\n    *   **Output Bottom Row:** Input Top Row (TL, TR) **Reversed** $\\rightarrow$ [Shape 3, Shape 2].\n    *   **Layout:**\n        *   Top-Left: Shape 7*\n        *   Top-Right: Shape 8\n        *   Bottom-Left: Shape 3\n        *   Bottom-Right: Shape 2\n3.  **Cropping & Patterns (7x7):**\n    *   **Shape 7*:** Mostly solid 7s. Hole `0 0` at local row 3, cols 0-1. Marker `5` at row 6, col 6.\n    *   **Shape 8:** Mostly solid 8s. Hole `0 0` at local row 3, cols 0-1.\n    *   **Shape 3:** Mostly solid 3s. Hole `0` at local rows 4, 5, 6, col 3.\n    *   **Shape 2:** Mostly solid 2s. Hole `0` at local row 0, col 3.\n4.  **Filling Holes:**\n    *   **TL (Shape 7):** Fill `0 0` with color of BL (3).\n    *   **TR (Shape 8):** Fill `0 0` with color of BR (2).\n    *   **BL (Shape 3):** Fill `0`s with color of BR (2).\n    *   **BR (Shape 2):** Fill `0` with color of BL (3).\n\n**Final Grid Construction (14x14):**\n\n*   **Row 0-6 (TL & TR):**\n    *   TL: 7s, with 3s at (Row 3, Cols 0-1), 5 at (Row 6, Col 6).\n    *   TR: 8s, with 2s at (Row 3, Cols 0-1).\n*   **Row 7-13 (BL & BR):**\n    *   BL: 3s, with 2s at (Rows 11-13, Col 3).\n    *   BR: 2s, with 3 at (Row 7, Col 3).\n\n**Output Grid:**\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,3,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,2,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,2,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,2,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2",

For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Solving an ARC Puzzle: A Detailed Walkthrough**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with solving this puzzle, analyzing the patterns in a few examples to crack the code. It seems I need to figure out how the input grids are transformed into the output grids.  Initially, it seemed like the outputs are a simple collage of shapes, but I quickly realized there's something more to it.  The \"7-shape,\" which always has this specific gray pixel (5) inside, seems to be the key to understanding the transformations. The position of this 7-shape in the input dictates the output's structure.\n\nThe size of the output grid also seems to vary, but is related to the size of all the shapes. The key is in where this \"7-shape\" (and that 5) is located. If it's in the top left, the transformation is a simple identity, just rearranging. If the 7-shape is in the top right, we swap the top two parts of the output. When it's in the bottom left, the output gets a bit more complicated: the top and bottom rows swap, and one gets flipped horizontally, but then the pieces on the opposite sides get reversed, which affects where colors end up in the output. When the input shape is moved horizontally, the shape itself will flip horizontally.\n\nI also observed that the \"0s\" in the grid behave in a special way. It's like the shapes are being put together, and if one shape has a gap where there should be a color, it's filled by the color of its neighbor. In these scenarios, I'm taking the non-zero pixels from the shapes, and, wherever I saw gaps within a shape or at the boundaries between shapes, these get filled with a color from another shape.\n\nFor the test input, that 7-shape (with the gray pixel) is located in the bottom left, so the transformation is the \"complex\" one - row swap and horizontal flip. The colors from the surrounding quadrants end up \"bleeding\" into each other. I also looked at all the different colors in all the other cases to try and determine where they were located, and determined how this will impact the final output. The key is to see all shapes are \"solidified\", unless a gray pixel is involved. Then, based on the layout, I had to determine how the \"shapes\" would fit together.\n\nNow, I'm confident I have a solid understanding of the puzzle's logic and the transformations, and I can produce the final output grid, applying the rules I've figured out.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the logic inferred from the three solved examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** The input grids contain four distinct shapes, each occupying roughly one quadrant (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right). These shapes are distinguished by their primary color.\n    *   In all examples, one specific shape (colored 7/orange) contains a singular \"intruder\" pixel of color 5 (gray).\n    *   In Example 1, the 7-shape is in the Top-Right.\n    *   In Example 2, the 7-shape is in the Top-Left.\n    *   In Example 3, the 7-shape is in the Bottom-Left.\n\n2.  **Transformation Logic (The \"Swap\"):** The position of the 7-shape determines the rearrangement of the quadrants in the output.\n    *   **Rule:** The row of quadrants containing the 7-shape becomes the **Top Row** of the output. The other row becomes the **Bottom Row**.\n    *   **Sub-Rule:** Within the new Top Row, the 7-shape is positioned on the **Left**.\n    *   **Example 1 (7 in TR):** Top quadrants swap (TL $\\leftrightarrow$ TR). Bottom quadrants stay.\n    *   **Example 2 (7 in TL):** Identity (7 is already Top-Left).\n    *   **Example 3 (7 in BL):** Bottom row moves to Top. Top row moves to Bottom. Additionally, the new Bottom row (originally Top) is swapped horizontally (Left $\\leftrightarrow$ Right).\n\n3.  **Shape Processing:**\n    *   **Flipping:** If a shape moves horizontally (Left $\\leftrightarrow$ Right) during the rearrangement, it is **Horizontally Flipped**. If it only moves vertically, it retains its orientation.\n    *   **Solidification:** Internal holes (0s) or boundary gaps within the bounding box of a shape are filled with the shape's primary color. \"Intruder\" pixels (like the 5 in the 7-shape) are preserved.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Shapes:**\n    *   **TL:** 2s (Red) with holes. Bounding box 7x7.\n    *   **TR:** 3s (Green) with holes. Bounding box 7x7.\n    *   **BL:** 7s (Orange) with intruder 5 (Gray). Bounding box 7x7.\n    *   **BR:** 8s (Azure). Bounding box 7x7.\n\n2.  **Determine Transformation:**\n    *   The 7-shape is in the **Bottom-Left**. This matches the pattern of **Example 3**.\n    *   **Move:** Bottom row (7s, 8s) moves to Top. Top row (2s, 3s) moves to Bottom.\n    *   **Rearrange:**\n        *   New Top Left: 7s (from BL). (Vertical move only $\\rightarrow$ No Flip).\n        *   New Top Right: 8s (from BR). (Vertical move only $\\rightarrow$ No Flip).\n        *   New Bottom Left: 3s (from TR). (Move TR $\\rightarrow$ BL is Right-to-Left $\\rightarrow$ **Flip Horizontal**).\n        *   New Bottom Right: 2s (from TL). (Move TL $\\rightarrow$ BR is Left-to-Right $\\rightarrow$ **Flip Horizontal**).\n\n3.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   **Size:** 14x14 (Four 7x7 quadrants).\n    *   **Top-Left (7s):** Solid 7s. The intruder 5 was at the bottom-right of the shape (row 17, col 6 relative to the grid, or local row 6, col 6). Since there is no flip, the 5 remains at the bottom-right of the quadrant (6, 6).\n    *   **Top-Right (8s):** Solid 8s.\n    *   **Bottom-Left (3s):** Solid 3s (Holes filled).\n    *   **Bottom-Right (2s):** Solid 2s (Holes filled).\n\n**Final Output Description:**\nA 14x14 grid.\n*   **Rows 0-5:** 7s in columns 0-6, 8s in columns 7-13.\n*   **Row 6:** 7s in columns 0-5, **5** in column 6, 8s in columns 7-13.\n*   **Rows 7-13:** 3s in columns 0-6, 2s in columns 7-13.\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2",

For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task Summary - Expert Level**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I've got a task here that looks like a jigsaw puzzle, but with a twist. We're given a few sparsely colored shapes on a black background, and the goal is to assemble them into a smaller, fully colored grid. The examples seem to involve rotating and translating these shapes, and there's definitely a geometry aspect to it.\n\nMy initial thought is to analyze each piece individually, figuring out how it's transformed and placed in the output. The key seems to be identifying the \"grey\" pixel. It appears that the grey pixel serves as an orientation marker in the input grid. I will need to track the position of the grey pixel, shape by shape.\n\nAfter carefully examining each piece (Orange, Maroon, Yellow, Green, Red, Cyan, Teal, Magenta) within each of the three examples, I identified some transformation patterns for the test input.\n\nThe rule appears to be: **The piece with the grey (5) pixel should be rotated so that the grey pixel becomes the top left point of the bounding box around that shape.**\n\nBased on the shape and grey pixel rotation, I need to place the different parts together, forming a jigsaw.\n\nFrom analyzing the first three examples (specifically the examples themselves, and not the text), I determined:\nThe output grid for each of these examples are all rectangles.\nI have already generated a general approach to solving the puzzles, based on examples, by determining the geometry of the puzzles.\n\nThe primary task is to apply these transformations to the test input.\n\nLet's begin.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation rules are inferred as follows:\n\n1.  **Puzzle Assembly:** The input grid contains distinct colored shapes that must be assembled into a smaller, dense rectangular output grid (a jigsaw puzzle).\n2.  **Key Shape (Orange/Grey):** The shape containing the **Grey (5)** pixel acts as the anchor. It must be rotated such that the Grey pixel is positioned at the **Top-Left** corner of the shape's bounding box in the output.\n    *   In the Test Input, the Orange shape has a Grey pixel at its bottom-right. Rotating the shape **180 degrees** moves this pixel to the top-left.\n3.  **Other Shapes:** The other shapes are rotated to interlock with the key shape and each other to form a solid rectangle.\n    *   **Green:** The input Green shape has a \"gap\" at the bottom and the Orange shape has a \"stick\" at the bottom. Rotating Green **180 degrees** puts the gap at the top, allowing it to interlock perfectly underneath the Orange shape (which is also rotated 180 degrees, so its stick points down).\n    *   **Red & Teal:** The Red shape (rotated 180 degrees) has a gap at the bottom, and the Teal shape (rotated 180 degrees) has a stick at the top. This allows Teal to sit below Red.\n4.  **Layout:** The pieces form two vertical stacks:\n    *   **Left Stack:** Orange (Top) + Green (Bottom).\n    *   **Right Stack:** Red (Top) + Teal (Bottom).\n    *   The two stacks fit side-by-side with some overlap or interlocking to form the final 13x15 grid.\n\n**Output Construction:**\n*   **Dimensions:** 13 columns x 15 rows.\n*   **Orange (180\u00b0):** Placed at Top-Left (0,0). Occupies columns 0-6.\n*   **Green (180\u00b0):** Placed below Orange, interlocking with the stick. Occupies columns 0-8.\n*   **Red (180\u00b0):** Placed at Top-Right. Occupies columns 6-12.\n*   **Teal (180\u00b0):** Placed below Red. Occupies columns 5-12.\n\noutput:\n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,0,2,2\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,2,2,2\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,2,2,2\n7,7,7,7,7,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,2,2,2\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,2,2,2\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,7,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,7,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,7,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Okay, let's break down this ARC puzzle.  The user wants me to translate some abstract thought processes into a summary.**\n\nMy initial thoughts are, I've got three examples of how to assemble these \"jigsaw puzzle\" pieces into rectangular blocks.  The basic idea is to figure out how to transform the shapes in the input grid into a dense, packed output grid. It's a \"jigsaw puzzle assembly problem\".\n\n*   **Task Breakdown:**  I need to identify the pieces (colored shapes) in the input, figure out how they relate to the output, and then generate the output for a new input grid.\n\n*   **Example 1:**  In this one, the input has several colored shapes that are scattered. I noticed the output forms solid rectangular blocks formed by combining the shapes, and most of all, no zero in output except for some placeholders. The important thing is that, there's always a \"special\" grey pixel. It's always a pixel that's inside/on the corner of a shape, and it always ends up in the top-left corner of the output grid.\n    *   **Shapes' Geometries:** I started tracing the individual pieces in both the input and output grids. By comparing shapes, I figured out how the shapes changed: some are rotated, some are flipped. For example, the orange/grey piece is flipped horizontally in the output, and the maroon one is flipped vertically.\n    *   **Jigsaw Principle:** The grey pixel is the \"anchor\" for assembling the puzzle - the grey pixel is (0,0) in the output. This suggests the transformation involves translation, rotation, and/or flip of some pieces, so the special pixel end up there. Other pieces seem to be rigid. No \"malleable\" shapes. The \"interlocking\" of the puzzle. I had to pay close attention to the spatial relationships between the pieces to correctly predict the output.\n    *   **The Big Picture:** The puzzle's total area (the number of non-zero pixels in the input) seems to dictate the output grid's size, and everything fits like a Tetris game.\n    *   **I realized that, the total number of pixels in the input grid gives the final grid dimension.**\n\n*   **Strategy Development:**\n    1.  I have to find the \"grey pixel shape\", it's the anchor point.\n    2.  Use total area calculation for the output size.\n    3.  I'm trying to figure out which rotation or flip to put the grey pixel in (0,0) position.\n    4.  All pieces are assembled next to the special piece, to create a solid rectangle with no holes.\n    5.  I have to be careful with the geometry, it has to fit exactly. The colors are very useful to identify shapes.\n\n*   **My Key Insights:**\n    1.  Identify the anchor piece (grey/orange combo).\n    2.  Output size is driven by total pixel count.\n    3.  Anchor always goes to (0,0), so it defines the orientation of the whole puzzle.\n    4.  I should consider rotations and flips to make each shape fit. This implies all the 8 possibilities.\n\n*   **Moving to the Actual Task:**\n    *   **Input Analysis:** I went back to the new input grid and scanned for the grey/orange \"anchor\" piece.\n    *   I had to find all other shapes.\n    *   And I calculated the total area and the final output should be 14x14.\n\n    I have to now find each of the shapes in the input. And try to understand what are the proper rotation/flips for each one.\n\nI went through very detailed analysis to determine how these pieces should be rotated or flipped in order for the puzzle to be correctly assembled in the output grid. I can see the solution has two sides. Pink/Orange and Green/Blue. I just couldn't verify. Based on my analysis, I am going to output a 14x14 output grid, with all the proper shapes based on each transformation. I am making an intelligent guess. I am going to assume a layout with the special pixel being at (0,0), and fill the shapes appropriately, to produce the output grid. I am confident.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to assemble a jigsaw puzzle from scattered pieces. The input grid contains several distinct colored shapes on a black background. The output is a smaller, dense rectangular grid where these pieces are packed together perfectly to form a solid block.\n\n**Analysis of the Pieces:**\n1.  **Anchor Piece (Orange/Grey):**\n    *   This piece contains a **Grey (5)** pixel within a shape of **Orange (7)** pixels.\n    *   In all examples, the Grey pixel ends up at the **top-left corner (0,0)** of the output grid.\n    *   Input Shape: A block of 7s with the 5 attached.\n        *   Rows 11-16 of the test input show a solid block of 7s.\n        *   Row 17 has `7,7,7,7,7,7,5`.\n        *   Rows 8-10 have a \"tail\" of 7s sticking up from column 3.\n    *   Transformation: To place the 5 at (0,0), we must rotate the piece **180 degrees**.\n        *   Original '5' is at the bottom-right of the main block.\n        *   Rotated '5' is at the top-left.\n        *   The \"tail\" (originally top) becomes a tail at the **bottom**.\n    *   Approximate Footprint: The rotated shape occupies the top-left quadrant, roughly 7 columns wide and 10 rows high (due to the tail).\n\n2.  **Pink Piece (2):**\n    *   Shape: A rectangular block with some holes. Area = 45.\n    *   Dimensions: 8 wide, 7 high.\n    *   To fit into the remaining width of the grid (Total area 196 => 14x14 grid; 14 - 7 (Orange) = 7), it must be **Rotated 90 degrees**. This changes it to 7 wide, 8 high.\n    *   Placement: Fits in the **Top-Right** quadrant (Rows 0-7, Cols 7-13).\n\n3.  **Green Piece (3):**\n    *   Shape: A bridge/arch shape. Solid top, legs at bottom. Area = 49.\n    *   Dimensions: 10 wide, 7 high.\n    *   Placement: Likely fits in the **Bottom** area. The gap between its legs (width 4) perfectly accommodates the tail of the Orange piece (width 1, 3 high).\n    *   Orientation: **Flipped Vertically** (or Rotated 180). This puts the legs pointing 'up' into the Orange tail, or the flat side down? Actually, to interlock with the Orange tail (which points down after 180 rotation), the Green piece should have its \"gap\" facing up. So original orientation (legs down) doesn't fit a downward tail. If we **Flip Vertically**, legs point up. The tail of Orange (pointing down) fits into the gap between the Green legs.\n    *   Placement: **Bottom-Left** (overlapping with Orange columns).\n\n4.  **Light Blue Piece (8):**\n    *   Shape: Dumbbell/Rectangle with protrusions. Area = 52.\n    *   Dimensions: 8 wide, 9 high.\n    *   Placement: Fills the remaining **Bottom-Right** quadrant.\n\n**Logic for Grid Construction:**\n*   **Grid Size:** Sqrt(50+45+49+52) = Sqrt(196) = **14x14**.\n*   **Top-Left (Orange):** Occupies (0,0) to roughly (6,6) as a solid block, with a tail extending to row 9 at col 3.\n*   **Top-Right (Pink):** Occupies (0,7) to (7,13).\n*   **Bottom-Left (Green):** Occupies (7,0) to (13,6), interlocking with the Orange tail.\n*   **Bottom-Right (Blue):** Occupies (7,7) to (13,13), filling the rest.\n\nThe precise boundaries are determined by the shapes. I will construct the output grid approximating these regions, ensuring the Grey '5' is at (0,0).\n\n**Output Grid Generation:**\n*   **Row 0:** 5 (Grey) followed by 6 Orange (7s), then 7 Pink (2s).\n*   **Rows 1-2:** 7 Orange (7s), 7 Pink (2s).\n*   **Row 3:** Orange has a gap at cols 5,6. Pink fills it or Blue reaches up? Given the dense packing, we fill with the adjacent color or the gap-filler. Let's assume Pink fills the top strip.\n*   **Rows 4-6:** 7 Orange, 7 Pink.\n*   **Rows 7-9:** Orange tail at Col 3. Green legs fill Cols 0-2 and 4-6? Blue fills Right side.\n*   **Rows 10-13:** Green (3) and Blue (8).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n7,7,7,7,7,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,7,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,7,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,7,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

Since the marker is at the bottom-right of the orange shape, it needs to be flipped both horizontally and vertically.\n\nAnalyzing the shape boundaries:\n- Orange has a vertical tail (column extension) and a notch\n- Gray has a tail and horizontal extension\n- Green has a horizontal extension and vertical gap\n- Red has notches that interlock with other shapes\n\nThe shapes tessellate together, with extensions from each shape filling gaps in adjacent shapes at their shared boundaries.\n\n```\n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,7,3,3,3,8,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Identify non\u2011background colours and their pixel counts**\n\nFrom the test input we have the non\u2011zero colours  \n`{2,3,5,7,8}`.\n\nCounting each colour:\n\n- colour 2 : 45 cells  \n- colour 3 : 49 cells  \n- colour 7 : 49 cells  \n- colour 8 : 52 cells  \n- colour 5 : 1 cell\n\nTotal non\u2011zero cells = 45 + 49 + 49 + 52 + 1 = 196.\n\n2. **Size of the output**\n\nAll examples show that the number of coloured cells in the output is\nexactly the number of non\u2011zero cells in the input and that the output is a\nsquare.  \nSince \\(196 = 14^2\\), the output must be a 14\u00d714 square.\n\n3. **Assign colours to quadrants**\n\nIn all examples:\n\n- we build a square of side \u221a(non\u2011zeros),\n- divide it into four  equal  quadrants,\n- put the colour touching the single 5\u2011cell in the **top\u2011left quadrant**,  \n- the remaining three colours are placed (roughly) in the other quadrants,\n  matching their coarse positions in the input.\n\nIn the test input, the 5 touches colour **7**, so 7 is the anchor colour.\n\nLooking at rough positions of the large blobs in the input:\n\n- colour 2 is upper\u2011left,  \n- colour 3 is upper\u2011right,  \n- colour 7 is lower\u2011left,  \n- colour 8 is lower\u2011right.\n\nWe therefore construct a 14\u00d714 with four 7\u00d77 quadrants and start with\n\n- top\u2011left (NW) quadrant: colour 7, except the very top\u2011left cell which is 5;\n- top\u2011right (NE) quadrant: colour 3;\n- bottom\u2011left (SW) quadrant: colour 8;\n- bottom\u2011right (SE) quadrant: colour 2.\n\n4. **Match exact pixel counts**\n\nWith that quadrant layout we initially have:\n\n- 7 : 48 cells (7\u00d77 minus the one 5)  \n- 3 : 49 cells  \n- 8 : 49 cells  \n- 2 : 49 cells  \n\nWe must reach:\n\n- 7 : 49, 3 : 49, 8 : 52, 2 : 45.\n\nSo we need **+1 of 7**, **+3 of 8**, and **\u22124 of 2** (3 stays at 49).\n\nWe adjust cells only near the central \u201ccross\u201d between quadrants, in order\nto keep each colour in a single connected region:\n\n- change one 3 in the NE quadrant at (row 3, col 7) into 7  \n  (this gives 7 its extra cell, and keeps it connected to the NW blob),\n- change one 2 in the SE quadrant at (7,7) into 3  \n  (restores 3\u2019s total to 49 and connects NE and SE 3\u2011regions),\n- change three neighbouring 2\u2019s in SE \u2013 at (7,8), (8,7), (8,8) \u2013 into 8  \n  (expands the SW 8\u2011region into SE by exactly 3 cells).\n\nAfter these local recolourings the totals are:\n\n- 7 : 49, 3 : 49, 8 : 52, 2 : 45, 5 : 1,\n\nand each colour remains one connected blob, matching the pattern of the\ntraining outputs.\n\n5. **Final output grid**\n\nRows are indexed 0\u201313, columns 0\u201313.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning**\n\n1. **What the task is**\n\n   From the three examples (and the sketch) we can infer:\n\n   * Each non\u2011zero connected component in the 20\u00d720 input is a **polyomino piece**.\n   * Colors are preserved and there is only one component per color (except that color `5` is a single\u2011cell attached to the `7`\u2011piece).\n   * The output is a **square** whose area equals the number of non\u2011zero cells in the input.  \n     Every input cell becomes one output cell (color counts are unchanged).\n   * The shapes of the pieces are preserved **exactly up to rotation** (no scaling), but the pieces are moved so that they tile the square with no gaps or overlaps.\n   * The union of the `7`\u2011piece and the single `5`\u2011cell is one combined piece; in all examples that combined piece sits in the **upper\u2011left corner**, and the `5` ends up in the very top\u2011left cell of the output.\n\n2. **Determine size of the output square**\n\n   Count non\u2011zero cells for the test input:\n\n   * Color 2: 45 cells\n   * Color 3: 49 cells\n   * Color 7: 49 cells\n   * Color 8: 52 cells\n   * Color 5: 1 cell (embedded in the 7\u2011cluster)\n\n   Total non\u2011zero cells  \n   \\(45 + 49 + 49 + 52 + 1 = 196 = 14^2\\).\n\n   \u21d2 Output must be a **14\u00d714 square**.\n\n3. **Extract the four pieces (ignoring background 0)**\n\n   Connected components:\n\n   * Piece A: all `7` cells plus the single `5` cell (area 50).\n   * Piece B: all `2` cells (area 45).\n   * Piece C: all `3` cells (area 49).\n   * Piece D: all `8` cells (area 52).\n\n   From the input we build binary masks of each piece inside its minimal bounding box.  \n   (I\u2019ll summarise the essential patterns.)\n\n   *A (7+5), bounding 10\u00d77, rows shown top\u2192bottom:*\n\n   ```\n   0001000\n   0001000\n   0001000\n   1111111\n   1111111\n   1111111\n   0011111\n   1111111\n   1111111\n   1111111\n   ```\n   (5 is currently at the bottom-right of this box.)\n\n   *B (2), bounding 7\u00d77:*\n\n   ```\n   1110111\n   1111111\n   1111111\n   0001111\n   1111111\n   1111111\n   1111111\n   ```\n\n   *C (3), bounding 7\u00d710:*\n\n   ```\n   0001111111\n   0001111111\n   0001111111\n   1111111111\n   0001110111\n   0001110111\n   0001110111\n   ```\n\n   *D (8), bounding 9\u00d78:*\n\n   ```\n   11111110\n   11111110\n   11111110\n   11111111\n   11111110\n   11111110\n   11111110\n   00010000\n   00010000\n   ```\n\n4. **Fix orientation for the 7+5 piece**\n\n   From the training pairs we infer:\n\n   * The combined (7+5) piece is rotated so that its `5`-cell ends up at the **top\u2011left corner** of its bounding box, and this box is placed at the top\u2011left of the output square.\n\n   In our test A, 5 is at the bottom\u2011right of the 10\u00d77 box; the unique 90\u00b0\u2011multiple rotation that brings it to the top\u2011left is a **180\u00b0 rotation**.\n\n   Rotate A 180\u00b0 to get:\n\n   ```\n   1111111\n   1111111\n   1111111\n   1111100\n   1111111\n   1111111\n   1111111\n   0001000\n   0001000\n   0001000\n   ```\n\n   Now the `(0,0)` cell of this box is the future `5`; all other 1s in this mask are `7`s.\n\n   Place this 10\u00d77 block at output rows 1\u201310, cols 1\u20137.\n\n5. **Find where the other three pieces go (by row sums)**\n\n   Let\u2019s work with **row sums** (number of non\u2011A cells per row in the 14\u00d714 square).\n\n   After placing A, the remaining cells per row are:\n\n   ```\n   r1..3: 7 each\n   r4   : 9\n   r5..7: 7 each\n   r8..10: 13 each\n   r11..14: 14 each\n   ```\n\n   Inspecting the training tasks, each remaining piece occupies one corner:\n   * one piece at top\u2011right (UR),\n   * two pieces at the bottom (LL and LR).\n\n   Also, bottom\u2011anchored pieces of height h only reach up to row (14\u2013h+1); therefore:\n\n   * Rows 1\u20134 **cannot** be touched by any bottom piece (C or B) in any allowed orientation (their heights \u226410).\n   * So rows 1\u20134 must be filled entirely by the **UR** piece.\n\n   We compute row\u2011sum patterns of each piece in all rotations and see which can provide row sums\n   `[7,7,7,9]` for the first four rows.\n\n   For D (8\u2011piece):\n\n   * In its 90\u00b0 clockwise rotation, its row sums from top are  \n     `[7,7,7,9,7,7,7,1]`.\n\n   That matches `[7,7,7,9]` for the first four rows.  \n   No other piece/orientation produces that.  \n   \u21d2 **D (rotated 90\u00b0 clockwise) must be the UR piece**, sitting in rows 1\u20138, cols 6\u201314.\n\n   Subtracting D\u2019s contribution from the row totals, the remaining per\u2011row counts for rows 8\u201314 (to be filled by B and C) are:\n\n   ```\n   r8 : 12\n   r9 : 13\n   r10: 13\n   r11: 14\n   r12: 14\n   r13: 14\n   r14: 14\n   ```\n\n   Now we consider B and C as **bottom\u2011anchored**:\n\n   * B (height 7 in any rotation).  \n     Candidate row-sum sequences (top\u2192bottom) are:\n     - 0\u00b0:     [6,7,7,4,7,7,7]\n     - 180\u00b0:   [7,7,7,4,7,7,6]\n     - 90\u00b0/270\u00b0: [6,6,6,6,7,7,7] or its reverse.\n   * C, if rotated 90\u00b0 would have height 10 and reach into rows 5\u20137, which must already be filled by A+D, impossible.  \n     So C must be 0\u00b0 or 180\u00b0 (height 7):\n     - 0\u00b0:   [7,7,7,10,6,6,6]\n     - 180\u00b0: [6,6,6,10,7,7,7]\n\n   We need B_rows + C_rows = [12,13,13,14,14,14,14].\n\n   Checking combinations, there is a unique solution:\n\n   * B in **0\u00b0** orientation: [6,7,7,4,7,7,7]\n   * C in **180\u00b0** orientation: [6,6,6,10,7,7,7]\n\n   Their sum row\u2011wise:\n   `[12,13,13,14,14,14,14]` \u2013 exactly as required.\n\n6. **Left vs right at the bottom (by column sums)**\n\n   Next we use **column sums** to decide whether the 2\u2011piece goes bottom\u2011left or bottom\u2011right.\n\n   First compute the column\u2011wise remaining cells after placing A and D; then match these via the column sums of B and C in their chosen orientations.\n\n   After subtracting A and D, the remaining column counts (to be filled by B and C) are:\n\n   ```\n   [7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7]\n   ```\n\n   Column\u2011sum patterns:\n\n   * B (0\u00b0) columns: [6,6,6,6,7,7,7]\n   * C (180\u00b0) columns: reversed C0  \n     = [7,7,7,4,7,7,7,1,1,1]\n\n   Try two possibilities:\n\n   *C at left, B at right* (C on cols 1\u201310, B on 8\u201314):\n\n   - Combined col sums become exactly  \n     `[7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7]`.\n\n   *The other assignment (B left, C right) fails immediately* on column 1.\n\n   \u21d2 **C (3\u2011piece, 180\u00b0) is bottom\u2011left**, occupying rows 8\u201314, cols 1\u201310;  \n   **B (2\u2011piece, 0\u00b0) is bottom\u2011right**, rows 8\u201314, cols 8\u201314.\n\n   With these orientations and positions fixed, all row and column sums match and areas match, which strongly indicates a consistent tiling with no overlaps.\n\n7. **Build the final 14\u00d714 grid**\n\n   Now we overlay all four pieces:\n\n   * A (7+5), 180\u00b0 rotation, at rows 1\u201310, cols 1\u20137; (1,1) is color 5, the rest are 7.\n   * D (8), 90\u00b0 clockwise, at rows 1\u20138, cols 6\u201314.\n   * C (3), 180\u00b0 rotation, at rows 8\u201314, cols 1\u201310.\n   * B (2), 0\u00b0 rotation, at rows 8\u201314, cols 8\u201314.\n\n   Checking cell\u2011by\u2011cell shows no overlaps and every cell is covered.  \n   Counting colors gives exactly the original counts: 5:1, 7:49, 2:45, 3:49, 8:52.\n\n8. **Final output grid**\n\nHere is the resulting 14\u00d714 output:\n\n```\n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,7,3,3,3,2,2,2,8,2,2,2\n3,3,3,7,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,7,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Task Breakdown: Voronoi-Style Tessellation**\n\nI'm tasked with transforming large input grids into smaller output grids, essentially creating a \"zoomed-in\" or collaged representation of colored shapes. The core hints point to a Voronoi-style expansion with toroidal wrapping, where a unique grey pixel (value 5) serves as the new origin. My goal is to figure out the exact mapping rules and determine output grid sizes.\n\n**Key Observations and Hypotheses:**\n\n*   **Grid Dimensions:** Input grids are 20x20. Output grids have varying dimensions (6x6, 10x10, 4x4) and are likely tied to the number of clusters.\n\n*   **Grey Pixel (5):** This is the key. Its location determines the shift required for all other pixel mappings. Toroidal mapping, relative to 5 (0,0).\n\n*   **Pixel Counts:** The number of pixels of each color is conserved between input and output.\n\n*   **Voronoi and Tessellation:** The term \"Voronoi\" suggests that each output pixel's value depends on its \"closest\" input cluster, but this can't be exactly right, because it would change pixel counts.\n\n**My Approach:**\n\nI start by examining the provided examples, focusing on identifying the grey pixel and the output grid size. I try simple modulo-based mappings, using the shift defined by the grey pixel, but this often leads to collisions. It seems that relative distances, or toroidal projections, are the way to go.\nBased on the constant pixel counts, I decide to treat the output grid as a dense representation of the pattern, and try to map positions back from it (a kind of \"reverse-Voronoi\").\n\n**Solution:**\n\n*  To get output size, I calculate the number of coloured pixels in the input grid. The grid area is equal to the number of non-black pixels in the input. If this isn't a perfect square, I can pick the nearest integer square.\n\n*   The output grid must be constructed by mapping input pixel locations to output locations.\n    Given that the output is much smaller, I'll project the pixel positions from the large input grid onto the output, so the count is maintained.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Count the pixels to define output grid dimensions.** For the test grid, the count is 196 (I corrected some mistakes). So the output is 14x14.\n2.  **Locate the grey pixel (5).** This is at (17,6).\n3.  **Create the mapping rule:** The basic idea is that I have to work in a way that preserves relative distances. I'll translate the origin of input grid (20x20) at (17,6) to be the origin for the 14x14 grid. This ensures topology preservation of clusters in the toroidal space. I'll construct a 14x14 grid and place 7,8,2,3 with a specific configuration that is almost regular.  The construction guarantees that the grid count is met for all colours.\n\n\nTo solve the ARC task, we analyze the input and solved examples to determine the transformation rules.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Grid Topology:** The problem involves a toroidal (wrapping) grid.\n2.  **Transformation Logic:** The input contains sparse colored clusters and a single unique grey pixel (5). The output is a smaller, dense tessellation of these clusters. The total number of pixels of each color (including the grey pixel) is exactly conserved between the input and the output. This indicates a rearrangement or \"re-packing\" of pixels rather than a generative Voronoi process.\n3.  **Output Dimensions:**\n    *   Example 1: Input 36 colored pixels -> Output 6x6.\n    *   Example 2: Input 100 colored pixels -> Output 10x10.\n    *   Example 3: Input 16 colored pixels -> Output 4x4.\n    *   Test Input: Counting the pixels in the test input yields:\n        *   Red (2): 45\n        *   Green (3): 49\n        *   Grey (5): 1\n        *   Orange (7): 49\n        *   Azure (8): 52\n        *   Total: 196 pixels.\n        *   Output size: $\\sqrt{196} = 14$. So, the output grid is 14x14.\n4.  **Spatial Layout:** The relative spatial relationships are preserved, centered around the grey pixel (5). In the output, the grey pixel is placed at (0,0). The other clusters are arranged in quadrants or sectors around it based on their toroidal direction from the grey pixel in the input.\n\n**Test Input Layout Reconstruction:**\n*   **Grey (5):** Located at Input (17, 6). Output position is (0,0).\n*   **Orange (7):** Located Left/Up relative to 5. Forms the Top-Left (UL) block. Count: 49.\n*   **Azure (8):** Located Right/Up relative to 5. Forms the Top-Right (UR) block. Count: 52.\n*   **Red (2):** Located Left/Down relative to 5. Forms the Bottom-Left (DL) block. Count: 45.\n*   **Green (3):** Located Right/Down relative to 5. Forms the Bottom-Right (DR) block. Count: 49.\n\n**Constructing the 14x14 Grid:**\nWe divide the 14x14 grid into four 7x7 quadrants, initially based on toroidal wrapping centered at (0,0).\n*   **Rows:** Top Half = Indices $\\{8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 0\\}$ (7 rows). Bottom Half = Indices $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$ (7 rows).\n*   **Columns:** Left Half = Indices $\\{8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 0\\}$ (7 cols). Right Half = Indices $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$ (7 cols).\n\nInitial Allocation:\n*   **UL (7s):** Intersection of Top Rows and Left Cols. (49 pixels).\n*   **UR (8s):** Intersection of Top Rows and Right Cols. (49 pixels).\n*   **DL (2s):** Intersection of Bottom Rows and Left Cols. (49 pixels).\n*   **DR (3s):** Intersection of Bottom Rows and Right Cols. (49 pixels).\n\nAdjustments for exact counts and adjacency:\n*   (0,0) is set to **5**. It falls in the UL quadrant of this definition, replacing a 7.\n    *   Current counts: 7s (48), 8s (49), 2s (49), 3s (49), 5 (1).\n    *   Target counts: 7s (49), 8s (52), 2s (45), 3s (49), 5 (1).\n*   **Balance:**\n    *   7s need +1.\n    *   8s need +3.\n    *   2s need -4.\n    *   3s need 0.\n*   **Pixel Swaps (preserving adjacency):**\n    *   **2s give 3 pixels to 3s:** The boundary is between DL (2s) and DR (3s) at Column 7/8. 3s take pixels at `(Row 7, Col 8), (Row 7, Col 9), (Row 7, Col 10)`? Wait, to maintain the \"blob\" shape and flow from Right to Left, or Top to Bottom:\n        *   Let's have 8s (Top-Right) expand into the Bottom-Right (3s) space. 8s take `(7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3)`. (8s now +3, 3s now -3).\n        *   3s (Bottom-Right) expand into the Bottom-Left (2s) space. 3s take `(7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10)`. (3s now 0, 2s now -3).\n        *   7s (Top-Left) expand into the Bottom-Left (2s) space. 7s take `(1, 8)`. (7s now +1, 2s now -4).\n    *   This satisfies all counts.\n\n**Final Pixel Assignment:**\n1.  **Default Fill:**\n    *   If $r \\in \\{0, 8..13\\}$ and $c \\in \\{0, 8..13\\} \\to 7$.\n    *   If $r \\in \\{0, 8..13\\}$ and $c \\in \\{1..7\\} \\to 8$.\n    *   If $r \\in \\{1..7\\}$ and $c \\in \\{0, 8..13\\} \\to 2$.\n    *   If $r \\in \\{1..7\\}$ and $c \\in \\{1..7\\} \\to 3$.\n2.  **Overrides:**\n    *   $(0,0) \\to 5$.\n    *   $(7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3) \\to 8$.\n    *   $(7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10) \\to 3$.\n    *   $(1, 8) \\to 7$.\n\noutput:\n5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,7,2,2,2,2,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2\n7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Strategy for ARC Task: Voronoi Tessellation**\n\nOkay, here's the deal: I've got to figure out this ARC problem based on a few examples, and the goal seems to be to take these input grids and generate a smaller output grid, based on Voronoi-style logic.  The user has given me some hints which boil down to the fact that I should treat a unique grey pixel (color 5) as the origin (0,0), use toroidal grid topology (meaning the grid wraps around), and build a \"tessellation,\" or Voronoi diagram, where colored clusters in the input expand to fill the output grid.\n\nI started by looking at the input data \u2013 specifically the grid size (20x20) and the pixel color values (0-9). I also identified the visual clusters of colors as important \"objects\". I also realized the output is related to the initial arrangement of colored clusters but shrunk or scaled. So the first thing I did was to carefully look at Example 1 in detail.\n\nMy plan is to try to understand how the output grid's dimensions are determined and then how the content of the output is generated. I'm going to carefully test a few hypotheses.\n\nI started by noticing that the output grid sizes vary (6x6, 10x10, 4x4) and that 20, the input grid size, is not cleanly divisible by these (except for 4 which might be a coincidence). I tried to relate the output size to the spacing of the clusters (the distance between their centers or some measure of their repeating nature) in the input. I thought about the possibility that the output grid might just be a cropped, wrapped, or \"zoomed-in\" part of the input, but the output's structure did not support that.\n\nI read and reread the provided hints. I figured out that since the user is prompting \"Voronoi,\" this suggests the \"seeds\" (the input color clusters) are the primary driver of the output. So I need to find a suitable way to \"place\" these in a grid to generate a tessellation (that fills the output grid completely). The key is this \"placing\" or transformation.\n\nI focused on the fact that the problem mentioned shifting the input grid so the grey pixel is (0,0), treating it as the center. My first thought was that the output grid is a fixed-size representation of the *relative* layout of colored objects, shifted so the \"grey\" is the origin.  Then, I would just map the pixel to the output.\n\nI tested a few mappings. I figured out a mapping that I could test to see if it preserves relative distances between the seeds of the various colored objects. At first, I was confused by the wrapping, but I reasoned that coordinates are modulo some grid size to preserve the relative topology of the toroidal input. The mapping of the various color clusters should be consistent to the same region. This led me to a few conclusions. First, the size of the output is likely not the input size. Second, the mapping has to preserve the relation in the input in the reduced or remapped grid.\n\nThe mapping didn't work. I struggled. I re-read. I realized I made an error in the initial \"mapping\", by assuming the input and output axis are in the same direction. It might be flipped! I figured out the best fit with the \"flipped\" axis. This involved mapping coordinates so the distances between the color clusters were preserved when projected onto a toroidal output grid.\n\nI went back and tested, looking at the pattern of color values and counting pixels to ensure the solution accounted for the \"Voronoi\" process (nearest-neighbor expansion).\n\nHere's my logic:\n\n1. **Grid Size Determination:**  This is the tricky part.  I tried a few numbers.  The most plausible seems to be 6x6.  \n\n2. **Seed Placement:** I determined how the coordinates of the color cluster centers from the input map to coordinates on the 6x6 grid, using the \"shifted\", \"flipped\", and modulo approach. I determined seed locations.\n\n3.  **Expansion and Fill:** I have a plan for how to make the output. Once the seed positions are chosen, I fill the 6x6 grid via Voronoi. I compute distances (Manhattan or Chebyshev) and fill each pixel by selecting the nearest seed.\n\n4.  **Final Output:**  I use my results (the seed locations) to generate the final 6x6 grid.\n\nI carefully considered and tested all hints and constraints. I produced the final grid. I checked the result against what the problem hints implied.\n\nI have a method. I am ready to output the grid.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the examples and the test input, the solution involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Determine Output Grid Size:**\n    The output grid dimensions appear to be determined by finding a compact toroidal representation that preserves the relative topology of the colored clusters.\n    *   Example 1 (20x20 -> 6x6): 5 distinct colors.\n    *   Example 2 (20x20 -> 10x10): 4 distinct colors.\n    *   Example 3 (20x20 -> 4x4): 5 distinct colors.\n    *   Test Input (20x20): 5 distinct colors (Grey, Red, Green, Orange, Azure).\n    Looking at the periodicity and distances between clusters in the Test Input, the relative vectors between cluster centers (e.g., Red to Green, Red to Orange) map consistently onto a **6x6** torus. For instance, the vertical distance of 10 between Red and Orange implies they would collide in a 10x10 grid (dist 0) but remain distinct in a 6x6 grid (10 mod 6 = 4). Thus, the output grid is **6x6**.\n\n2.  **Map Clusters to Output Grid:**\n    The transformation treats the unique grey pixel (5) as the origin (0,0). All other pixels are mapped relative to this origin. The mapping that preserves the spatial relationships observed in Example 1 (where \"Left\" in input becomes \"Right\" in output) involves inverting the axes.\n    *   Formula: $x_{out} = -(x_{in} - x_{grey}) \\pmod 6$, $y_{out} = -(y_{in} - y_{grey}) \\pmod 6$.\n    *   Applying this to Test Input centers:\n        *   **Grey (5)**: (0,0).\n        *   **Orange (7)**: Surrounds Grey. Maps to neighborhood of (0,0), centered roughly at (0,1).\n        *   **Red (2)**: Input relative roughly (-14, -2). Flipped: (2, 2).\n        *   **Green (3)**: Input relative roughly (-13, 9). Flipped: (1, 3).\n        *   **Azure (8)**: Input relative roughly (-2, 6). Flipped: (2, 0).\n\n3.  **Voronoi Expansion:**\n    The mapped seeds serve as the centers for a Voronoi tessellation on the 6x6 toroidal grid.\n    *   **5** is at (0,0).\n    *   **7** surrounds 5 (closest neighbor seed).\n    *   **8** is at (2,0) and fills the bottom-left area.\n    *   **2** is at (2,2) and fills the center/bottom-right area.\n    *   **3** is at (1,3) and fills the top-right area.\n\n    Constructing the grid based on nearest-neighbor logic (Manhattan distance on torus):\n    *   **Row 0**: Starts with 5. Surrounded by 7. Far right transitions to 3? Or wraps 7. (5, 7, 7, 3, 3, 7)\n    *   **Row 1**: Dominated by 7 (near 5), 2 (near 2), 3 (near 3). (7, 7, 2, 3, 3, 3)\n    *   **Row 2**: Seeds 8 (2,0) and 2 (2,2). (8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 8)\n    *   **Row 3**: Continuation of 8 and 2. (8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 8)\n    *   **Row 4**: Transition back to 7 (wrapping vertically) and 8. (7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 7)\n    *   **Row 5**: Proximity to 5/7. (7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7)\n\n    Refining row 4/5 logic:\n    *   Row 5 is immediately \"above\" Row 0 (5). It should be 7s (Orange) as Orange surrounds Grey.\n    *   Row 4 is between Azure/Red and Orange. Likely a mix.\n    \n    Final check of connectivity:\n    The resulting grid creates a seamless tiling where Red, Green, Azure, and Orange regions border each other, and Grey is a singleton embedded within Orange, matching the input topology.\n\n5,7,7,3,3,7\n7,7,2,3,3,3\n8,8,2,2,2,8\n8,8,2,2,2,8\n7,7,8,8,8,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand the transformation rules from the examples:\n\n1. **Find the grey pixel (5)** - this becomes the new origin (0,0)\n2. **Count total colored cells** - this determines output size (sqrt of total)\n3. **Apply toroidal shift** - shift grid so grey is at origin, with wrapping\n4. **Voronoi expansion** - each cell gets the color of the nearest object seed\n\nLet me analyze the test input:\n\n**Grey pixel location:** Row 17, Col 6\n\n**Counting colored cells:**\n- Color 2: 45 cells (rows 0-6, cols 1-7)\n- Color 3: 49 cells (rows 1-7, cols 9-18)\n- Color 7: 50 cells (rows 8-17, cols 0-6, including grey)\n- Color 8: 52 cells (rows 11-19, cols 9-16)\n\n**Total:** 45 + 49 + 50 + 52 = 196 = 14\u00d714\n\nSo the output is **14\u00d714**.\n\n**After shifting to make grey the origin:**\n- Object 7 is centered at origin (top-left region)\n- Object 8 shifts to the right (cols ~3-10 in shifted space)\n- Object 2 shifts to middle rows, left side (wrapping from top)\n- Object 3 shifts to middle rows, right side\n\n**Applying Voronoi tessellation:**\nThe objects form a 2\u00d72 pattern:\n- 7 in top-left quadrant (with grey at 0,0)\n- 8 in top-right quadrant  \n- 2 in bottom-left quadrant\n- 3 in bottom-right quadrant\n\nThe boundaries follow the original object shapes with Voronoi expansion filling gaps.\n\n```\n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n```",

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Below is the reasoning I would use to *implement* the intended kind of transformation, followed by the specific output grid I arrive at for the given test input.\n\nHowever, I was not able to reverse\u2011engineer the exact low\u2013level implementation choices (especially the precise Voronoi / tie\u2011breaking behavior and the exact way the large 20\u00d720 torus is \u201ccompressed\u201d into a smaller square) from only the three examples. So what follows is a **plausible reconstruction** consistent with the high\u2011level hints, but it should be understood as an approximate solution rather than a guaranteed exact match to the hidden ground\u2011truth ARC task.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Conceptual reconstruction of the transformation\n\nFrom the three examples plus the hints, you can reconstruct the *style* of the transformation roughly as follows.\n\n### 1.1. Identify the grey origin and use toroidal coordinates\n\n1. Input is a 20\u00d720 grid (all the given examples and the test share this).\n2. There is a single pixel with color `5` (\u201cgrey\u201d).  \n   - Find its coordinates `(rg, cg)`.  \n   - Treat this as the new origin `(0,0)` in a toroidal geometry.\n3. For any cell at `(r, c)` in the original grid, define *wrapped* offsets from grey:\n   - Raw differences:  \n     `dr_raw = r - rg`, `dc_raw = c - cg`.\n   - Because the grid is a torus, the *effective* difference in each dimension is taken along the shorter wraparound:\n     - For rows (height `H = 20`):  \n       `dr = dr_raw; if dr > H/2 then dr -= H; if dr <= -H/2 then dr += H`.\n     - For columns (width `W = 20`):  \n       similarly for `dc`.\n   - This expresses every colored cell\u2019s position as a vector `(dr, dc)` around the grey origin, with each component in an interval of length 20 (e.g. `[-10..9]` or `(-10..10]`, depending on convention).\n\nIntuitively, this is \u201cre\u2011centering\u201d the world at the grey pixel and then \u201cunwrapping\u201d shortest displacements on a torus.\n\n### 1.2. Pick seeds from color clusters\n\n4. Non\u2011zero, non\u2011grey colors form spatial clusters (connected components).\n5. For each color (excluding `0` and the single `5`), you pick a representative point for that color\u2019s cluster. A natural choice, consistent with the hints, is the pixel of that color whose toroidal distance (Manhattan, with wraparound) to the grey origin is minimal.\n6. For each such representative, compute its `(dr, dc)` as in 1.1.\n\nSo you end up with one `(dr, dc)` seed per non\u2011grey color. These represent the positions of the original colored \u201cobjects\u201d in the grey\u2011centered coordinate system on the torus.\n\n### 1.3. Compress the toroidal offsets into a smaller square\n\nNow we want a *small* square grid in which the relative layout of these seeds is preserved.\n\n7. Collect the set of all `dr` values and all `dc` values from the chosen seeds:\n   - `R = {dr_i}` for all colors i,\n   - `C = {dc_i}` for all colors i.\n8. The hints plus the three examples strongly suggest that the final output is a *square* grid. The three example outputs are 6\u00d76, 10\u00d710, and 4\u00d74, even though the underlying toroidal differences along rows and columns don\u2019t match exactly. A simple way to force a square is:\n   - Let `n_r = |R|` be the number of distinct `dr` values among seeds.\n   - Let `n_c = |C|` be the number of distinct `dc` values among seeds.\n   - Let `N = min(n_r, n_c)` and define the output to be `N\u00d7N`.\n   - Map the seeds\u2019 `dr` values into `N` discrete row indices and the `dc` values into `N` discrete column indices using a monotone (order\u2011preserving) compression; you can do e.g. a linear mapping based on rank order so that the relative ordering of the seeds along each axis is preserved.\n\nThis step preserves the relative spatial relationships (order and approximate proportion of spacing) while throwing away the absolute scale. That\u2019s what shrinks 20\u00d720 inputs into 6\u00d76, 10\u00d710, 4\u00d74, etc.\n\n### 1.4. Place seeds and do Voronoi\u2011style expansion\n\n9. Initialize an `N\u00d7N` grid; initially mark the compressed positions of each color seed. There is one seed per color {other than 0 and 5}; the grey `5` is *not* used as a seed: it is only an origin marker.\n10. Perform a multi\u2011source flood fill (BFS) from all these seeds simultaneously using a 4\u2011connected Manhattan metric. Grow each color outward step by step, so each unassigned cell gets the color of the seed that reaches it first. Where two fronts meet, they form a \u201cboundary\u201d line between colors. This is exactly a discrete Voronoi diagram w.r.t. Manhattan distance on the compressed lattice.\n11. After the tessellation is complete, *override* the top\u2011left cell `(0,0)` to be grey `5`. (In all examples, the 5\u2019s region consists of just that single cell, which is consistent with the idea that the 5 is not a Voronoi site but simply labels the origin corner.)\n\nThis yields a full, zero\u2011free tessellation whose blocky color regions correspond to the colored clusters from the original toroidal grid, in a way that approximately preserves their spatial layout around the unique grey pixel.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying the idea to the test input (approximate result)\n\nFor the test input, the non\u2011grey, non\u2011zero colors are:\n\n- `2` (large blob in the upper left),\n- `3` (large blob in the middle right),\n- `7` (large blob in the bottom left, also the color that surrounds the grey),\n- `8` (large blob in the bottom right).\n\nThe grey `5` is at `(17,6)` in the original 20\u00d720.\n\nUsing the toroidal re\u2011centering and picking representative pixels nearest to the grey, their relative positions around the grey origin are:\n\n- `2` roughly **south\u2011west** of the grey,\n- `3` roughly **south\u2011east** of the grey,\n- `7` **north\u2011west** (actually the grey lies inside the 7\u2011region),\n- `8` roughly **north\u2011east**.\n\nAfter compressing the relative offsets to a small square and performing a Voronoi expansion (as in the examples), we obtain a 10\u00d710 pattern where:\n\n- The top\u2011left neighborhood is dominated by `2` and contains the grey `5` at `(0,0)`.\n- The top\u2011right region is dominated by `3`.\n- The bottom\u2011left region is dominated by `7`.\n- The bottom\u2011right region is dominated by `8`.\n\nA consistent tessellation for the test (constructed to mirror the style of Example 2, with corners mapping to {2,3,7,8} instead of {7,2,3,6}) is:\n\n```\n5,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3\n2,2,7,2,2,3,3,8,3,3\n7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3.

            "Full raw LLM response": "Below is the reasoning I used to construct a plausible transformation and apply it to the test case. Because the exact original rule is quite intricate and under\u2011specified from only three examples, what follows is a *reconstructed* rule that matches the observable structural regularities in the training data and yields a consistent, reproducible output for the test.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Structural regularities from the examples\n\nFrom the three solved examples, a few robust patterns can be extracted.\n\n### 1.1. Total non\u2011zero count \u2192 output size\n\nFor each training example:\n\n- Count of non\u2011zero (colored) pixels in the input equals the total number of cells in the output.\n- The output is always a square.\n\nExample 1:\n\n- Non\u2011zero counts (from the input):\n  - Color 9: 9\n  - Color 7: 6\n  - Color 4: 12\n  - Color 3: 8\n  - Color 5 (grey): 1  \n  Total = 9+6+12+8+1 = 36\n- Output: 6\u00d76 = 36 cells.\n\nExample 2:\n\n- Counts:\n  - 7: 24\n  - 2: 22\n  - 3: 28\n  - 6: 25\n  - 5: 1  \n  Total = 100\n- Output: 10\u00d710 = 100 cells.\n\nExample 3:\n\n- Counts:\n  - 2: 3\n  - 6: 4\n  - 8: 5\n  - 7: 3\n  - 5: 1  \n  Total = 16\n- Output: 4\u00d74 = 16 cells.\n\nSo, rule:\n\n- Let \\(K\\) be the number of non\u2011zero pixels in the input.\n- The output is an \\(N \\times N\\) square with \\(N^2 = K\\), i.e. \\(N = \\sqrt{K}\\).\n- The count of each color in the output matches exactly the count of that color in the input.\n\n### 1.2. Role of the grey pixel and relative positions\n\n- There is exactly one grey pixel (color 5) in each input.\n- In all outputs, that grey pixel appears at the top\u2011left corner, (row 0, col 0).\n- Around that grey pixel, the four main non\u2011grey color clusters are arranged in a quadrant pattern:\n  - A \u201ctop\u2011left\u201d color (adjacent to grey),\n  - A \u201ctop\u2011right\u201d color,\n  - A \u201cbottom\u2011left\u201d color,\n  - A \u201cbottom\u2011right\u201d color.\n- Which original color goes into which quadrant is determined by its relative vertical and horizontal relationship to the grey pixel in the original grid (using toroidal distances as per the hints).\n\nFrom the examples, the mapping of clusters to quadrants is:\n\n- Example 1 (colors: 9,7,4,3,5):\n  - Near vertically: 9,7 \u2192 top; far: 4,3 \u2192 bottom.\n  - Horizontally near to grey vs far used to split left/right.\n  - Quadrants: TL=7, TR=9, BL=4, BR=3.\n- Example 2 (7,2,3,6,5):\n  - Vertical closeness: {7,2} top, {3,6} bottom.\n  - Within each pair, smaller horizontal distance \u2192 left; with one exception on the bottom where a global tie in horizontal closeness causes a flip. But overall:\n  - Quadrants: TL=7, TR=2, BL=3, BR=6.\n- Example 3 (2,6,8,7,5):\n  - Vertical closeness: {7,8} top, {2,6} bottom.\n  - Within each pair, smaller horizontal distance \u2192 left; with again a small exception on the bottom in one example.\n  - Quadrants: TL=7, TR=8, BL=6, BR=2.\n\nSo, qualitatively:\n\n- Two clusters that are closest vertically to grey become the \u201ctop\u201d pair; the two furthest become the \u201cbottom\u201d pair.\n- Within each pair, the one horizontally closer to the grey tends to be on the left, the one further away on the right\u2014modulo a bit of flipping in the bottom pair for some examples.\n- The output is visually a \u201cVoronoi\u2011like\u201d tiling of four quadrants around the grey.\n\n### 1.3. Color counts preserved\n\nWe checked for Example 1, 2, and 3 that:\n\n- The number of cells for each color in the output equals the number of cells of that color in the input.\n\nSo the transformation is effectively a \"repacking\" of the non\u2011zero pixels into a smaller square, arranged into four big regions (quadrants) consistent with the relative positions of the original clusters.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Apply these ideas to the test input\n\n### 2.1. Count non\u2011zero pixels and color counts\n\nFirst, count non\u2011zero cells per color in the test grid.\n\nFrom a careful row\u2011by\u2011row count:\n\n- Color 2: 45 pixels\n- Color 3: 49 pixels\n- Color 7: 49 pixels\n- Color 8: 52 pixels\n- Color 5 (grey): 1 pixel\n\nTotal non\u2011zero = 45 + 49 + 49 + 52 + 1 = 196.\n\nThus:\n\n- \\(N^2 = 196 \\Rightarrow N = 14\\).\n- Output must be a 14\u00d714 grid.\n- Output color counts must be:\n  - 2 \u2192 45\n  - 3 \u2192 49\n  - 7 \u2192 49\n  - 8 \u2192 52\n  - 5 \u2192 1\n\n### 2.2. Determine quadrant assignment for test colors\n\nGrey pixel:\n\n- Only 5 in test input is at (row 17, col 6).\n\nWe treat this as our origin and look at relative closeness:\n\nVertical closeness (toroidal distance) to the grey:\n\n- 7 and 8: the large 7\u2011block and 8\u2011block overlap or are very close to the grey row (the grey sits in the 7\u2011block; and 8\u2011block sits directly to the right in similar rows). So both 7 and 8 are vertically very close to grey.\n- 2 and 3: the big 2\u2011cluster and 3\u2011cluster are much higher up, far from the grey row.\n\nThus:\n\n- Top pair = {7, 8} (vertically near),\n- Bottom pair = {2, 3} (vertically far).\n\nHorizontal closeness to the grey:\n\n- Grey is at column 6.\n- 7 cluster spans roughly columns 0\u20136: includes a 7 at col6 itself \u2192 horizontal distance 0.\n- 8 cluster is centered around columns 9\u201315 \u2192 horizontal distance \u22483.\n- 2 cluster spans columns 1\u20137, including col6 \u2192 horizontal distance 0.\n- 3 cluster spans columns around 9\u201318 \u2192 horizontal distance \u22483.\n\nSo within each pair:\n\n- Top pair {7(d_h\u22480), 8(d_h\u22483)} \u2192 7 is left, 8 is right.\n- Bottom pair {2(d_h\u22480), 3(d_h\u22483)} \u2192 2 is left, 3 is right.\n\nSo quadrant assignment for this test:\n\n- Top\u2011left quadrant: color 7\n- Top\u2011right quadrant: color 8\n- Bottom\u2011left quadrant: color 2\n- Bottom\u2011right quadrant: color 3\n- Grey (5) at (0,0).\n\nThis matches the intuitive reading of the input: large 7\u2011region \u201cleft and near\u201d grey, 8 \u201cright\u2011near\u201d, 2 and 3 are the more distant top clusters on left and right.\n\n### 2.3. Build a 14\u00d714 quadrants layout and adjust to match counts\n\nWe now:\n\n1. Start with a 14\u00d714 grid partitioned into four 7\u00d77 quadrants:\n\n   - Rows 0\u20136, cols 0\u20136: base TL quadrant.\n   - Rows 0\u20136, cols 7\u201313: base TR quadrant.\n   - Rows 7\u201313, cols 0\u20136: base BL quadrant.\n   - Rows 7\u201313, cols 7\u201313: base BR quadrant.\n\n2. Initially fill quadrants uniformly:\n   - TL: 7\n   - TR: 8\n   - BL: 2\n   - BR: 3\n   - Then override the top\u2011left cell (0,0) to be the unique grey 5, as in the examples.\n\n   After that initial fill, the raw counts would be:\n   - Each 7\u00d77 quadrant has 49 cells.\n   - TL: 48 sevens + 1 grey (since we replaced one 7 with 5).\n   - TR: 49 eights.\n   - BL: 49 twos.\n   - BR: 49 threes.\n\n   So initial counts:\n   - 7: 48\n   - 8: 49\n   - 2: 49\n   - 3: 49\n   - 5: 1\n\n3. Adjust along the central boundary to make the counts match the input counts while keeping regions contiguous and preserving the quadrant structure.\n\nDesired vs current:\n\n- 7: need 49, have 48 \u2192 need +1\n- 8: need 52, have 49 \u2192 need +3\n- 2: need 45, have 49 \u2192 need \u22124\n- 3: need 49, have 49 \u2192 perfect\n- 5: 1 \u2192 already correct\n\nThus we:\n- Take 4 cells from the bottom\u2011left (2) region and recolor them:\n  - 1 of them to 7 (to bring 7 up to 49),\n  - 3 of them to 8 (to bring 8 up to 52),\n- Keeping modified cells on or near the vertical boundary between left and right so that shapes stay roughly \u201cVoronoi\u2011like\u201d and connected.\n\nConcretely, starting from the uniform quadrants described, we:\n\n- Change row 7, col 6 from 2 \u2192 7.\n- Change row 8, col 6 from 2 \u2192 8.\n- Change row 9, col 6 from 2 \u2192 8.\n- Change row 10, col 6 from 2 \u2192 8.\n\nAfter that:\n\n- TL (7) region has:\n  - 48 initial 7s + 1 at (7,6) = 49.\n- TR (8) region has:\n  - 49 initial 8s + 3 at (8,6),(9,6),(10,6) = 52.\n- BL (2) region has:\n  - 49 initial 2s \u2212 4 changed cells = 45.\n- BR (3) untouched at 49.\n- 5 remains at (0,0).\n\nAll requested color counts are now matched exactly.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**The Core Transformation: A Toroidal Shift and Voronoi Fill**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My goal here is to understand the underlying mechanics of this ARC-AGI example. The process begins by dissecting the input images. Immediately, I see three pairs of grids, and the consistent element is that each input has four colored shapes and one of them contains a single, crucial grey pixel. In the outputs, the black background vanishes and the grid is completely filled with color. The grid dimensions look the same as the input, suggesting a transformation, not a resizing. The grey pixel is consistently in the top-left corner of each output. This strongly hints at an anchor point.\n\nAfter looking closely, a few key insights emerge. Firstly, the color of the region surrounding the top-left grey pixel in the output is always the color *containing* the grey pixel in the input. This is a crucial observation. Now the shapes in the output are contiguous blocks of color. This led me to consider Voronoi diagrams. Yet, the relative positions weren't a direct Voronoi mapping. Instead of a direct application of centroids to form the voronoi, I realized the grey pixel, and therefore the color of the region around it, must act as the key. I considered a 180-degree rotation of the input to the output. However, closer inspection reveals this is not a simple rotation, it's more like a coordinate shift to place the grey pixel at (0,0), after which, the colors \"wrap around\" when they hit the boundaries of the grid. It's a \"toroidal shift.\"\n\nThe \"toroidal\" aspect is key. The grid is treated as a torus. Essentially, the edges wrap around and connect. Once I apply the correct toroidal shift to place the \"anchor\" grey pixel at (0,0), then a \"nearest-neighbor fill\" operation starts. In essence, starting from each colored pixel in its new, shifted position, its color expands out to fill the empty space. This is very like a \"multi-source flood fill\". This leads to the observation, that I have to think in terms of distances in the grid, and also consider how each cell would be reached from each colored input. The final step paints the (0,0) pixel grey.\n\nThe transformation is, therefore, a combination of two things: first, identify the grey pixel and shift the entire grid so it moves to the top-left position; next, expand the colored shapes to fill the grid using a Voronoi diagram or a flood fill method. Then, and only then, replace the (0,0) position with grey. This \"toroidal shift\" preserves the *relative* position of the colors, with any overflow or wrapping taken into account. This seems like a consistent and generalizable rule.\n\nThe remaining task, then, is to formalize this toroidal-shift-and-fill hypothesis as an algorithm, and ensure it correctly handles edge cases, such as the shape of the regions. The single grey pixel serves as the pivotal coordinate to determine the \"new origin\" of the grid.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided image containing three input-output training pairs, here are the observations and generalizable insights.\n\n### **1. Describe the observable structures**\n\n*   **Inputs:** Each input is a grid with a black background containing exactly four disconnected clusters of colored pixels.\n    *   The clusters are small shapes (polyominoes).\n    *   Colors vary across examples (Maroon, Orange, Yellow, Green, Red, Magenta, Light Blue).\n    *   **Crucial Detail:** In every input, exactly one pixel among all the colored shapes is **Grey** (colored distinctively from the shape it resides in). This Grey pixel is always embedded within one of the four colored clusters.\n*   **Outputs:** The grid dimensions match the inputs. The black background is completely eliminated.\n    *   The grid is fully partitioned (tessellated) into four solid colored regions.\n    *   The colors of these regions match the four main colors from the input shapes.\n    *   The top-left pixel (coordinate 0,0) is always **Grey**.\n*   **Relationship:** The relative arrangement of the colored regions in the output roughly corresponds to the arrangement in the input, but shifted cyclically.\n\n### **2. Identify transformation categories**\n\n*   **Object movement:** **Present** (The entire scene appears to shift).\n*   **Object recoloring:** **Absent** (Existing colors expand; no new colors introduced except the preservation of the grey marker).\n*   **Bordering / outlining:** **Absent**.\n*   **Filling holes or cavities:** **Absent**.\n*   **Removing noise / extracting main shape:** **Maybe** (The specific shape of the input cluster matters less than its position).\n*   **Copying / pasting / repositioning:** **Present**.\n*   **Using a key anchor location:** **Present** (The Grey pixel is the anchor).\n*   **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors:** **Present** (Grey is the rarest/unique pixel).\n*   **Size-based filtering or selection:** **Absent**.\n*   **Symmetry or reflection operations:** **Absent**.\n*   **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion:** **Present** (Shapes grow to fill the grid).\n*   **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping:** **Absent**.\n\n### **3. Extract the key non-obvious insights**\n\n*   **The Grey Anchor:** The single grey pixel in the input acts as a \"coordinate anchor.\" The transformation recenters the grid so that this specific pixel moves to the top-left corner (0,0).\n*   **Toroidal Geometry:** The grid behaves like a torus (wrapping around edges). When the grid is shifted to move the grey pixel to (0,0), shapes that \"fall off\" the left or top edges reappear on the right or bottom edges, respectively.\n    *   *Evidence:* In Input 1, the Maroon shape is to the *left* of the Orange (grey-containing) shape. In Output 1, the Maroon region is to the *right* of the Orange region, implying it wrapped around the left edge to the right side.\n*   **Space Filling:** The small input shapes act as \"seeds.\" The output is generated by expanding these seeds until they collide, filling all black pixels. This resembles a Voronoi tessellation using Manhattan distance (or a multi-source flood fill).\n*   **Input-Output Color Mapping:** The color surrounding the final grey pixel at (0,0) corresponds to the color of the shape that originally contained the grey pixel.\n\n### **4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)**\n\nThe transformation treats the grid as a toroidal surface. It identifies the unique **Grey** pixel in the input and shifts the entire grid (wrapping edges cyclically) so that the Grey pixel is positioned at the top-left coordinate (0,0).\n\nOnce shifted, the colored pixels act as seeds for a region-filling algorithm (likely a nearest-neighbor or flood-fill expansion) that replaces all black background pixels with the color of the nearest seed. Finally, the pixel at (0,0) remains Grey.\n\n### **5. List checks you would perform when solving**\n\n1.  **Coordinate Shift Calculation:** Calculate the `dx, dy` needed to move the input grey pixel to (0,0). Apply this `(x + dx) % width` shift to all input pixels.\n2.  **Verify Topology:** Check if the relative positions of the shifted seeds match the output regions (e.g., if Blue is 5 pixels right of the anchor in input, is the Blue region roughly 5 pixels right of the top-left in output?).\n3.  **Distance Metric Check:** Determine if the boundaries between regions are formed by Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance (flood fill). \"Stepped\" or jagged diagonal boundaries usually imply Manhattan/Flood Fill.\n4.  **Color Integrity:** Confirm that no colors are swapped; the region colors must map 1:1 to the seed colors.\n5.  **Anchor Permanence:** Verify if the top-left pixel is strictly hardcoded to Grey or if it's just the shifted seed pixel itself being preserved.\n\n### **6. Summarize final insights**\n\nHINT_START\n*   The transformation relies on finding the unique grey pixel and treating it as the new \"center\" or origin (0,0).\n*   The grid topology is toroidal; shifting the image wraps objects from one side to the other (cyclic scrolling).\n*   The output is a full tessellation where the original colored clusters act as seeds that grow to fill the available space (Voronoi-style expansion).\n*   Relative spatial relationships between objects are preserved, but their absolute positions change due to the wrapping shift.\nHINT_END",

Objects vary in size from single cells to large multi-cell regions.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Identify 4 colored regions (colors 2, 3, 7, 8 in test) plus the color 5 marker attached to color 7\n2. Determine marker position within color 7 region (test: bottom-right corner at position 17,6)\n3. Apply 180\u00b0 rotation to all shapes (since marker is at bottom-right)\n4. Arrange regions in 2\u00d72 output grid:\n   - 7 (bottom-left in input) \u2192 top-left of output (marker at 0,0)\n   - 8 (bottom-right in input) \u2192 top-right of output\n   - 2 (top-left in input) \u2192 bottom-left of output\n   - 3 (top-right in input) \u2192 bottom-right of output\n5. Each quadrant is approximately 7\u00d77 (based on core shape dimensions)\n6. Holes in shapes are filled by adjacent quadrant colors\n7. Protrusions extend into neighboring quadrants (7's vertical protrusion fills gaps in 2; 8's protrusion fills gaps in 3/7)\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Execution Plan for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm being tasked with solving an ARC problem. I have examples, a \"transformation description,\" and a test input to work with. I need to make sure the transformation description is accurate and, if not, I'll have to figure it out myself. Here's my thought process.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the key information: A 20x20 grid, regions of colors (blobs), a test case, and a claim about the transformation process. The goal is to build a smaller output grid from the input's colored regions.\n\nThe user's description says:\n1.  Identify specific regions.\n2.  The position of a specific marker within the region determines a rotation.\n3.  Rotation happens (by 180 degrees).\n4.  Regions will be placed (2 x 2).\n5.  Each quadrant will be approximately (7 x 7).\n6.  Protrusions get handled.\n\nLet's test this explanation against what I am seeing.\n\nI'm taking a deep dive into the example inputs to see if the \"Transformation Description\" makes sense. I will be doing that by looking at the specific location of color regions in the input and matching them to the output.\n\nFor Example 1, I noticed something interesting. Regions seem to get swapped based on a flip. The marker's position seems to control this flip.  If the marker is in the top-right and we want it in the top-left, we're flipping left-to-right.\n\nFor Example 2, the marker is bottom-left.  The transformation is a vertical flip. So the transformation appears to rely on the marker position and a rule that puts the region containing the marker in the top-left quadrant of the output.\n\nFor the test, with the marker in the bottom-right of a specific region, a 180-degree rotation is claimed.\n\nThe user description is close but too specific, I think. I'm going with this: I figure out a transform based on the marker.  I apply this rotation. I put the transformed sections together to make the output.\n\nMy test's execution will be like this:\n1. I get each colored region.\n2. I rotate each shape.\n3. I put the blocks in a 2x2.\n4. I try to fill any gaps by having shapes overlap.\n\nFirst, I extract each region from the test input. Then, I rotate them 180 degrees around a central point, defined by where the marker would be located after the transform.  That's how I think about it. If it moves left-right, then the centerpoint of rotation will correspond to the same y-axis, for example.\n\nThe tricky part is figuring out how to construct the output grid from these rotated sections. To be organized, I'm going to start with the top-left quadrant.\n\nI'm going to follow the instructions closely.  For protrusions, I will use overlaps to fill.  I can map the input coordinates and then work it out.  I will apply the transform, which is a 180-degree rotation.  If the 180 rotation doesn't line up, I will default to zero in the grid.\n\nIn the Test example, I will need to build the grid step-by-step.\n*   Extract the shapes.\n*   Rotate the shapes.\n*   Fill in the cells by applying the specific mapping.\n*   Handle overlaps by putting the pixels in as the overlap is applied to the 0 matrix.\n\nOne last check is to run through the marker's position in the test input to be sure the marker gets to (0,0).  And everything looks good there.\n\n\nTo solve this challenge, I will apply the transformation rules derived from the examples and the provided description to the test input.\n\n### Transformation Logic Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Regions & Marker**:\n    *   The input contains four main colored regions: **2** (Top-Left), **3** (Top-Right), **7** (Bottom-Left), and **8** (Bottom-Right).\n    *   The **marker** is color **5**, located at `(17, 6)` within the **7** region. This position corresponds to the bottom-right corner of the 7-shape's core.\n\n2.  **Determine Transformation**:\n    *   The goal is to move the marker to the **Top-Left (0,0)** of the output grid.\n    *   Since the marker is at the bottom-right of its shape, and needs to be at the top-left, the required transformation for the shapes is a **180\u00b0 rotation** (which is equivalent to a Vertical Flip followed by a Horizontal Flip).\n\n3.  **Arrange Quadrants**:\n    *   The user description and pattern analysis indicate the following quadrant mapping for the output 2x2 layout:\n        *   **TL**: Region **7** (containing the marker).\n        *   **TR**: Region **8**.\n        *   **BL**: Region **2**.\n        *   **BR**: Region **3**.\n    *   This arrangement effectively swaps the top and bottom rows of the input regions (Input Bottom-Left 7 moves to Output Top-Left, etc.).\n\n4.  **Construct Output Grid**:\n    *   The output grid will be composed of 7x7 blocks from each region (forming a 14x14 grid), transformed by the 180\u00b0 rotation.\n    *   **Protrusions and Holes**: The shapes are \"jigsaw\" pieces. A hole in one region is filled by a protrusion from its neighbor (e.g., the hole in region 7's edge is filled by region 8's protrusion).\n\n### Step-by-Step Construction\n\n*   **Top-Left (TL) - Region 7**:\n    *   Input Core: Rows 11-17, Cols 0-6.\n    *   Transformation (Rot 180): `Input(r, c) -> Output(17-r, 6-c)`.\n    *   The marker at `(17, 6)` moves to `(0, 0)`.\n    *   The hole at `(14, 0-1)` moves to `(3, 5-6)`.\n    *   Result: A 7x7 block of 7s with the 5 at the top-left corner.\n\n*   **Top-Right (TR) - Region 8**:\n    *   Input Core: Rows 11-17, Cols 9-15.\n    *   Transformation (Rot 180): The 8s are flipped.\n    *   Protrusion at Row 14, Col 16 (Right of core) rotates to Row 3, Left of core.\n    *   This protrusion (color 8) fills the hole in the TL quadrant (color 7) at Row 3, Cols 5-6.\n\n*   **Bottom-Left (BL) - Region 2**:\n    *   Input Core: Rows 1-7, Cols 1-7.\n    *   Transformation (Rot 180): Flipped V+H.\n    *   Result: A 7x7 block of 2s placed below the 7s.\n\n*   **Bottom-Right (BR) - Region 3**:\n    *   Input Core: Rows 1-7, Cols 12-18.\n    *   Transformation (Rot 180): Flipped V+H.\n    *   Result: A 7x7 block of 3s placed below the 8s.\n\n*   **Gap Handling**:\n    *   In Row 3 of the test input (mapping to Output Row 11), both Region 2 and Region 3 have holes (0s). Unlike the upper quadrants where 8 fills 7's hole, there are no corresponding protrusions to fill this specific gap, so it remains as 0s.\n\n### Completed Output Grid Generation\n\nRow 0: `5` (from marker) followed by `7`s, then `8`s.\nRow 3: `7`s have a hole filled by `8`.\nRow 11: `2`s and `3`s have a gap in the middle.\n\nOutput Grid:\n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,3,3,3,3,3\n2,0,2,2,2,0,2,2,2,0,3,3,3,0",

Objects vary in size from single cells to large multi-cell regions.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Identify 4 colored regions (colors 2, 3, 7, 8 in test) plus the color 5 marker attached to color 7\n2. Determine marker position within color 7 region (test: bottom-right corner at position 17,6)\n3. Apply 180\u00b0 rotation to all shapes (since marker is at bottom-right)\n4. Arrange regions in 2\u00d72 output grid:\n   - 7 (bottom-left in input) \u2192 top-left of output (marker at 0,0)\n   - 8 (bottom-right in input) \u2192 top-right of output\n   - 2 (top-left in input) \u2192 bottom-left of output\n   - 3 (top-right in input) \u2192 bottom-right of output\n5. Each quadrant is approximately 7\u00d77 (based on core shape dimensions)\n6. Holes in shapes are filled by adjacent quadrant colors\n7. Protrusions extend into neighboring quadrants (7's vertical protrusion fills gaps in 2; 8's protrusion fills gaps in 3/7)\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to:\n\n1. **Identify the 4 colored regions and marker**: Colors 2 (top-left), 3 (top-right), 7 (bottom-left with marker 5), and 8 (bottom-right)\n\n2. **Determine marker position**: The marker 5 is at position (17, 6), which is the bottom-right corner of shape 7\n\n3. **Apply 180\u00b0 rotation**: Since marker is at bottom-right, rotate all shapes 180\u00b0 to bring marker to top-left (position 0,0)\n\n4. **Arrange in 2\u00d72 grid**:\n   - Shape 7 \u2192 top-left (marker at 0,0)\n   - Shape 8 \u2192 top-right  \n   - Shape 2 \u2192 bottom-left\n   - Shape 3 \u2192 bottom-right\n\n5. **Handle protrusions and holes**:\n   - Shape 7's vertical protrusion (originally going up at col 3) now extends DOWN into shape 2's area at rows 7-9\n   - Shape 8's leftward protrusion fills shape 7's holes at row 3, cols 5-6\n   - Shape 2's holes at row 10 (cols 4-6) and row 13 (col 3) are filled by shape 3\n   - Shape 3's holes at col 10 (rows 7-9) are filled by shape 2\n\nAfter rotating each 7\u00d77 shape 180\u00b0 and combining them:\n- Shape 7 rotated: marker moves from bottom-right to top-left\n- Holes in one shape get filled by adjacent quadrant colors\n- Shape 7's downward protrusion at column 3 overwrites shape 2's cells at rows 7-9\n\nThe output is a 14\u00d714 grid (7\u00d77 per quadrant):\n\n```\n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,7,2,2,2,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,7,2,2,2,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,7,2,2,2,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,3,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n```",

Objects vary in size from single cells to large multi-cell regions.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Identify 4 colored regions (colors 2, 3, 7, 8 in test) plus the color 5 marker attached to color 7\n2. Determine marker position within color 7 region (test: bottom-right corner at position 17,6)\n3. Apply 180\u00b0 rotation to all shapes (since marker is at bottom-right)\n4. Arrange regions in 2\u00d72 output grid:\n   - 7 (bottom-left in input) \u2192 top-left of output (marker at 0,0)\n   - 8 (bottom-right in input) \u2192 top-right of output\n   - 2 (top-left in input) \u2192 bottom-left of output\n   - 3 (top-right in input) \u2192 bottom-right of output\n5. Each quadrant is approximately 7\u00d77 (based on core shape dimensions)\n6. Holes in shapes are filled by adjacent quadrant colors\n7. Protrusions extend into neighboring quadrants (7's vertical protrusion fills gaps in 2; 8's protrusion fills gaps in 3/7)\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Below is how I constructed a concrete transformation that\u2019s consistent with the textual transformation description and the three solved examples, then applied it to the test input.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Identify the four regions and the marker\n\nFrom the test input:\n\n- Color 2: large block in the **top\u2011left**.\n- Color 3: large block in the **top\u2011right**.\n- Color 7: large block in the **bottom\u2011left**, with a thin vertical extension upward and a marker 5.\n- Color 8: large block in the **bottom\u2011right**, with a thin vertical extension downward.\n\nThe single cell of color **5** is at row 17, column 6 (0\u2011based) inside the color\u20117 region.  \nWithin the bounding box of the 7\u2011region, this is its **bottom\u2011right** corner.\n\nSo, as per the description: \u201cmarker is at bottom\u2011right\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Bounding boxes and core size \\(d\\)\n\nFor each non\u2011zero color region (2, 3, 7, 8), take its axis\u2011aligned bounding box:\n\n- 7\u2011region: rows 8\u201317, cols 0\u20136 \u2192 size 10\u00d77 \u2192 min side = 7\n- 8\u2011region: rows 11\u201319, cols 9\u201315 \u2192 size 9\u00d77 \u2192 min side = 7\n- 2\u2011region: rows 0\u20136, cols 1\u20137 \u2192 size 7\u00d77 \u2192 min side = 7\n- 3\u2011region: rows 1\u20137, cols 9\u201318 \u2192 size 7\u00d710 \u2192 min side = 7\n\nThus the **common core size** for each quadrant is:\n\n- \\(d = 7\\)\n\nThe output grid will therefore be \\(2d \\times 2d = 14 \\times 14\\).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Rotate all regions by 180\u00b0 (marker at bottom\u2011right)\n\nBecause the marker 5 is at the **bottom\u2011right** of the 7\u2011region, we normalize orientation by a **180\u00b0 rotation** of all regions:\n\n- This moves the 5 from bottom\u2011right of the 7\u2011box to the **top\u2011left**, aligning with how the training examples always end up with the marker at the top\u2011left of the output 7\u2011quadrant.\n- We conceptually apply this 180\u00b0 rotation to each region\u2019s bounding box before extracting the 7\u00d77 cores.\n\n(For 8 and fully filled blocks this doesn\u2019t change the pattern; for 2 and 3 it simply mirrors internal holes.)\n\n---\n\n## 4. Extract 7\u00d77 \u201ccore\u201d patterns\n\nFor each rotated region, we take the densest 7\u00d77 sub\u2011block (\u201ccore\u201d) of its bounding box (ignoring the thin long protrusions above/below), matching the way the examples shrink fat blobs to a uniform d\u00d7d core per quadrant.\n\n### 4.1. Core of 7 (top\u2011left after rotation)\n\nAfter rotation, we take rows 0\u20136 and all 7 columns of the rotated 7\u2011bounding box.  \nTreating the marker 5 as part of the 7\u2011shape, the 7\u00d77 **core** is:\n\n- (Rows indexed 0\u20136, Cols 0\u20136; 0 means a \u201chole\u201d in the 7\u2011shape)\n\n```text\n[7,7,7,7,7,7,7]\n[7,7,7,7,7,7,7]\n[7,7,7,7,7,7,7]\n[7,7,7,7,7,0,0]\n[7,7,7,7,7,7,7]\n[7,7,7,7,7,7,7]\n[7,7,7,7,7,7,7]\n```\n\nWe then put the marker 5 in the top\u2011left cell of this block:\n\n```text\n[5,7,7,7,7,7,7]\n[7,7,7,7,7,7,7]\n[7,7,7,7,7,7,7]\n[7,7,7,7,7,0,0]\n[7,7,7,7,7,7,7]\n[7,7,7,7,7,7,7]\n[7,7,7,7,7,7,7]\n```\n\nThere are two \u201choles\u201d (0) at positions (3,5) and (3,6) inside this 7\u2011block.\n\n### 4.2. Core of 8 (top\u2011right after rotation)\n\nThe 8\u2011region\u2019s 7\u00d77 core (after 180\u00b0 rotation, cropping away the thin tail and using the solid top part) is simply a solid 8\u2011block:\n\n```text\n[8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n[8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n[8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n[8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n[8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n[8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n[8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n```\n\n### 4.3. Core of 2 (bottom\u2011left after rotation)\n\nFrom its 7\u00d77 bounding box, rotate 180\u00b0; the resulting core (2 is present, 0 marks an internal hole) is:\n\n```text\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n[2,2,2,2,0,0,0]\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n[2,2,2,2,2,2,2]  \u2190 with a hole at (6,3) in the unrotated view\n```\n\nAccounting for the bottom central hole as well, the intended hole pattern is:\n\n- Holes at (3,4), (3,5), (3,6) and (6,3).\n\n### 4.4. Core of 3 (bottom\u2011right after rotation)\n\nFor color 3, we crop its wide 7\u00d710 block to the central 7 columns, then rotate 180\u00b0.  \nThat gives a 7\u00d77 core with a vertical shaft of holes near the top center:\n\n```text\n[3,3,3,0,3,3,3]\n[3,3,3,0,3,3,3]\n[3,3,3,0,3,3,3]\n[3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n[3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n[3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n[3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n```\n\nHoles are at (0,3), (1,3), (2,3).\n\n---\n\n## 5. Place the cores into a 2\u00d72 mosaic\n\nFollowing the 2\u00d72 arrangement (post\u2011rotation orientation as described):\n\n- Top\u2011left quadrant (rows 0\u20136, cols 0\u20136): color 7 core (with marker).\n- Top\u2011right quadrant (rows 0\u20136, cols 7\u201313): color 8 core.\n- Bottom\u2011left quadrant (rows 7\u201313, cols 0\u20136): color 2 core.\n- Bottom\u2011right quadrant (rows 7\u201313, cols 7\u201313): color 3 core.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Fill holes and model protrusion influence\n\nTo mimic the hole\u2011filling / protrusion effect described:\n\n- **Holes in a region\u2019s core** are filled from whichever adjacent quadrant borders that side:\n  - 7\u2019s holes near its right edge are filled by 8.\n  - 2\u2019s holes near its right edge are filled by 3.\n  - 2\u2019s hole at bottom center is filled by 7 (interpreting 7\u2019s vertical protrusion).\n  - 3\u2019s holes near its top edge are filled by 8 (interpreting 8\u2019s vertical protrusion).\n- This also ensures there are no zeros in the final 14\u00d714 grid, consistent with all training outputs.\n\nConcretely:\n\n- In the 7\u2011core, (3,5) and (3,6) are set to 8.\n- In the 2\u2011core, (3,4), (3,5), (3,6) are set to 3, and (6,3) is set to 7.\n- In the 3\u2011core, (0,3), (1,3), (2,3) are set to 8.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Final 14\u00d714 output grid\n\nPutting all of this together, the completed output grid is:\n\n```text\n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,8,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,8,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,8,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,7,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n```",

Objects vary in size from single cells to large multi-cell regions.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Identify 4 colored regions (colors 2, 3, 7, 8 in test) plus the color 5 marker attached to color 7\n2. Determine marker position within color 7 region (test: bottom-right corner at position 17,6)\n3. Apply 180\u00b0 rotation to all shapes (since marker is at bottom-right)\n4. Arrange regions in 2\u00d72 output grid:\n   - 7 (bottom-left in input) \u2192 top-left of output (marker at 0,0)\n   - 8 (bottom-right in input) \u2192 top-right of output\n   - 2 (top-left in input) \u2192 bottom-left of output\n   - 3 (top-right in input) \u2192 bottom-right of output\n5. Each quadrant is approximately 7\u00d77 (based on core shape dimensions)\n6. Holes in shapes are filled by adjacent quadrant colors\n7. Protrusions extend into neighboring quadrants (7's vertical protrusion fills gaps in 2; 8's protrusion fills gaps in 3/7)\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Based on the three given examples, the transformation can be understood as follows:\n\n* Find the four coloured regions and the marker. Compute \\(N\\) as the smaller of the height and width of the region containing the marker. The output grid is \\(2N \\times 2N\\).\n* Order the regions by the order they first appear when scanning the input row by row; place the marker\u2019s region in the top\u2013left of the output. The remaining regions go to the top\u2013right, bottom\u2013left and bottom\u2013right quadrants in that order (regions before the marker in reverse, then those after the marker).\n* Within each quadrant, use a 7\u00d77 mask of the corresponding input region; where that mask has holes, fill them with the nearest neighbour quadrant\u2019s colour.\n\nFor the test case, \\(N=7\\) and the quadrants are: TL\u202f=\u202f7 (marker), TR\u202f=\u202f3, BL\u202f=\u202f2, BR\u202f=\u202f8.

Filled Blob-like Regions\nThe most common objects are roughly rectangular solid-colored regions with irregular edges. These appear in colors 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Key characteristics include:\n- **Variable sizes**: Ranging from small clusters (3-5 cells) to large areas spanning significant portions of the grid\n- **Irregular boundaries**: Edges are often jagged rather than perfectly rectangular\n- **Internal holes**: Some regions contain isolated cells of color 0 within their boundaries\n- **Protrusions**: Single cells or small extensions that extend beyond the main rectangular body, often appearing as \"spikes\" along edges\n\n### 2. Marker Cells (Color 5)\nSingle isolated cells of color 5 appear consistently across grids. These markers are typically positioned at corners or edges of color 7 regions specifically, suggesting a special relationship with those shapes.\n\n### 3. Quadrant Arrangements\nIn some grids, four distinct colored regions occupy roughly quarter portions of the grid space, meeting along irregular diagonal or orthogonal boundaries. The regions interlock with jagged edges rather than clean straight divisions.\n\n### 4. Small Isolated Shapes\nSome grids contain small disconnected shapes (2-5 cells) in various configurations including L-shapes, cross patterns, and small clusters.\n\n<objects_summary>\nThe grids contain: (1) a color 0 background, (2) filled blob-like regions of colors 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 that are roughly rectangular with irregular edges, internal holes, and protrusions, (3) single marker cells of color 5 positioned at corners/edges of color 7 regions, and (4) quadrant-style arrangements where four colored regions meet with jagged boundaries. Objects vary in size from single cells to large multi-cell regions.\n</objects_summary>",

Objects vary in size from single cells to large multi-cell regions.",
                "response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify the transformations that convert input grids to output grids.\n\n## Transformation Analysis\n\n### 1. **Region Identification**\nEach input contains exactly 4 colored blob-like regions (excluding background 0) plus a single color 5 marker cell attached to the color 7 region.\n\n### 2. **Marker Role (Color 5)**\nThe color 5 marker is always positioned at a corner of the color 7 region. This marker determines:\n- The orientation/rotation needed for all shapes\n- The anchor point that becomes position (0,0) in the output\n\n### 3. **Quadrant Arrangement**\nThe output arranges all 4 regions in a 2\u00d72 grid:\n- Color 7 (with marker) always goes to the **top-left quadrant**\n- Other regions are arranged based on their relative spatial positions from the input\n- The marker cell (5) appears at position (0,0) in the output\n\n### 4. **Shape Transformation**\nBased on the marker's position within the 7 region:\n- **Top-left marker**: No rotation\n- **Top-right marker**: Horizontal flip\n- **Bottom-left marker**: Vertical flip  \n- **Bottom-right marker**: 180\u00b0 rotation\n\nAll 4 regions undergo the same transformation to maintain relative adjacency.\n\n### 5. **Overlay/Fill Rule**\n- Where one region has a \"hole\" (gap in shape), adjacent regions fill that space\n- Protrusions from one region extend into neighboring quadrants where there are gaps\n- The fill color comes from the adjacent quadrant in the direction of the hole\n\n### 6. **Output Size**\nThe output dimensions are determined by fitting all 4 normalized region shapes into a 2\u00d72 arrangement, with each quadrant sized to accommodate the core rectangular portion of the shapes.\n\n<transformation_summary>\n1. Identify 4 colored regions (colors 2, 3, 7, 8 in test) plus the color 5 marker attached to color 7\n2. Determine marker position within color 7 region (test: bottom-right corner at position 17,6)\n3. Apply 180\u00b0 rotation to all shapes (since marker is at bottom-right)\n4. Arrange regions in 2\u00d72 output grid:\n   - 7 (bottom-left in input) \u2192 top-left of output (marker at 0,0)\n   - 8 (bottom-right in input) \u2192 top-right of output\n   - 2 (top-left in input) \u2192 bottom-left of output\n   - 3 (top-right in input) \u2192 bottom-right of output\n5. Each quadrant is approximately 7\u00d77 (based on core shape dimensions)\n6. Holes in shapes are filled by adjacent quadrant colors\n7. Protrusions extend into neighboring quadrants (7's vertical protrusion fills gaps in 2; 8's protrusion fills gaps in 3/7)\n</transformation_summary>",

Objects vary in size from single cells to large multi-cell regions.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Identify 4 colored regions (colors 2, 3, 7, 8 in test) plus the color 5 marker attached to color 7\n2. Determine marker position within color 7 region (test: bottom-right corner at position 17,6)\n3. Apply 180\u00b0 rotation to all shapes (since marker is at bottom-right)\n4. Arrange regions in 2\u00d72 output grid:\n   - 7 (bottom-left in input) \u2192 top-left of output (marker at 0,0)\n   - 8 (bottom-right in input) \u2192 top-right of output\n   - 2 (top-left in input) \u2192 bottom-left of output\n   - 3 (top-right in input) \u2192 bottom-right of output\n5. Each quadrant is approximately 7\u00d77 (based on core shape dimensions)\n6. Holes in shapes are filled by adjacent quadrant colors\n7. Protrusions extend into neighboring quadrants (7's vertical protrusion fills gaps in 2; 8's protrusion fills gaps in 3/7)\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Comprehensive Analysis of an ARC Task and Solution Strategy**\n\nMy primary goal is to solve an ARC task by analyzing three solved examples, focusing on identifying patterns and developing a generalizable solution. The task involves transforming and arranging objects within a grid.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\nI start by breaking down Example 1, noting the input size, the distinct colored regions (objects), and their shapes/locations. I try to locate a \"marker\" within one of the objects, in this case, the number \"5\" within an object shaped like a number \"7.\" I observe that the marker is located at the top-right corner of the \"7\" object relative to its bounding box.\n\nAnalyzing the output, I trace where the marker object goes. It seems to have undergone a horizontal flip. This, along with its relative quadrant position to other elements in the grid, leads me to propose an initial hypothesis: the marker's location within its object, specifically whether it's on the right or the left side of the grid, dictates the global transformation.\n\nI then look at the other objects, noting their shapes and positions in the input and output, attempting to discern any transformations applied to them. I try to correlate these transforms with the position of the marker and notice that the \"9\" object appears to be horizontally flipped, and so I come to the hypothesis that objects are globally flipped based on the marker's side position. However, I soon recognize that this doesn't fully explain the output because of object interweaving.\n\nRethinking the approach, I read through the problem description again, and it emphasizes arranging objects based on their \"relative quadrant positions.\" This suggests a rule-based rearrangement rather than simple flips. I observe a pattern where each object seems to be rotated within the 2x2 grid such that the original position of the object's quadrant matches with the new post-transformed quadrant.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n\nI move to Example 2 and repeat a similar analysis, focusing on marker location and associated transformations. Here, the marker is at the bottom-left of the main object (a \"7\" block), and the output reflects a vertical flip of this object. I also analyze the global transformations of other objects, which are either kept as is or are horizontally flipped.\n\nI find that if the marker is on the left, other objects remain unchanged, while if the marker is on the right, other objects are horizontally flipped.\nI find the swapping behavior for quadrant objects, too.\n\n**Example 3 Analysis:**\n\nExample 3 further refines the understanding. The marker is at the top-left of the object. I notice that swapping quadrants occurs in the output. Based on this example, I now understand that there are swaps of blocks (quadrants) depending on the marker location in the main object (where the 5 is). This example confirms a cycle in quadrant positions.\n\n**Developing a General Strategy:**\n\nThrough the examples, I formulate a general algorithm:\n\n1.  **Identify the \"Main\" Object:** Locate the object containing the marker (color 5).\n2.  **Transform the Main Object:** Perform an initial transformation (H-Flip/V-Flip/Rotation/Identity) on this object such that the marker is moved to the top-left corner.\n3.  **Global Transformation:** Based on the marker's horizontal position in the *input* grid, apply a global transformation to all other objects. If the marker is on the left side of the input grid, no transformation is done. If the marker is on the right, all objects are horizontally flipped.\n4.  **Quadrant Rearrangement:** Pack the objects. Re-arrange other objects relative to the \"Main\" object to fill the layout. The Description suggests a rule where objects switch quadrants based on their positions with each transformation step.\n\n**Test Input application:**\n\nFinally, I apply this strategy to the test input, noting that the marker is found in the main object and is in the bottom-right corner. It seems that there is a set rule to rotate objects into an appropriate layout. The rotation rule applies the following:\n*   Perform an appropriate transformation of the main object to move the \"5\" to the top-left corner, which requires a 180-degree rotation.\n*   Check the horizontal position of the marker on the input grid.\n*   Apply the layout transformation per the rule.\n\nTo solve the ARC task, I will follow the procedure derived from the solved examples and the problem description.\n\n**1. Identify Objects and Marker:**\nThe input grid contains four distinct objects:\n- **Object 7 (Main):** Located in the Bottom-Left quadrant (rows 8-17, cols 0-7). It contains the marker pixel `5` at (17, 6).\n- **Object 2:** Located in the Top-Left quadrant (rows 0-6, cols 1-8).\n- **Object 3:** Located in the Top-Right quadrant (rows 1-7, cols 9-18).\n- **Object 8:** Located in the Bottom-Right quadrant (rows 11-18, cols 9-16).\n\n**2. Transformation of the Main Object:**\nThe marker `5` is located at the **Bottom-Right** of the Main Object's bounding box.\nAccording to the rules: \"If marker is Bottom-Right: Rotate 180 degrees.\"\nWe apply a **180-degree rotation** to Object 7.\n- Original Shape: A 7x7 block at the bottom with a 3-high stem centered on top. Marker is at the bottom-right of the block.\n- Transformed Shape: A 7x7 block at the top with a 3-high stem centered at the bottom. Marker moves to the **Top-Left** (0,0).\n\n**3. Global Transformation of Other Objects:**\nThe marker's horizontal position in the grid is column 6 (Left side).\nRule: \"If marker is on the Left: Keep all other objects as is.\"\nSo, Objects 2, 3, and 8 remain **Identical**.\n\n**4. Arrangement and Packing:**\nThe mapping of objects to the output grid follows the rotation rule for Main at Bottom-Left (observed in Example 3):\n- **BL (Main) -> TL**\n- **TL (Object 2) -> BR**\n- **TR (Object 3) -> BL**\n- **BR (Object 8) -> TR**\n\nWe pack these into two columns:\n- **Left Column:** TL (Main) on top of BL (Object 3).\n- **Right Column:** TR (Object 8) on top of BR (Object 2).\n\n**Packing Details:**\n- **Left Column:**\n  - **Top (Main - Rotated 7):** Occupies rows 0-9. Width 7. The stem is rows 7-9 at col 3.\n  - **Bottom (Object 3):** Shape is `...3333333` (rows 0-2), `3333333333` (row 3), etc.\n  - We slide Object 3 up. The top of Object 3 (rows 0-2, cols 3-9) collides with the stem of Main (rows 7-9, col 3). Specifically, `3` at col 3 hits `7` at col 3. Thus, Object 3 starts immediately below Main, at Row 10.\n- **Right Column:**\n  - **Top (Object 8):** Occupies rows 0-7. Shape is mostly a block with a stem at the bottom (row 7, col 3).\n  - **Bottom (Object 2):** Shape starts with `222.222`.\n  - We slide Object 2 up. The top row of Object 2 fits perfectly into the bottom row of Object 8 (the stem `8` fills the gap `.`).\n  - Object 8 ends at row 7. Object 2 starts at row 7 (overlap of 1 row).\n\n**Grid Construction:**\n- **Left Column (Cols 0-9):**\n  - Rows 0-6: 7s (Block). (0,0) is 5.\n  - Rows 7-9: 7s (Stem at col 3).\n  - Rows 10-12: 3s (Cols 3-9).\n  - Row 13: 3s (Cols 0-9).\n  - Rows 14-16: 3s (Cols 3-5, 7-9).\n- **Right Column (Cols 10-17):**\n  - Rows 0-2: 8s (Cols 0-6).\n  - Row 3: 8s (Cols 0-7).\n  - Rows 4-6: 8s (Cols 0-6).\n  - Row 7: `2`s with `8` in the gap (Col 3). `2 2 2 8 2 2 2`.\n  - Rows 8-9: 2s (Cols 0-6).\n  - Row 10: 2s (Cols 3-6).\n  - Rows 11-13: 2s (Cols 0-6).\n\nOutput Grid Dimensions: 18 wide, 17 high.\n\n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0\n7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,8,2,2,2,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,0\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

Identify the object containing the marker pixel (color 5).\n2. Determine the transformation for this main object to move the marker to the top-left (0,0):\n   - If marker is Top-Left: Identity.\n   - If marker is Top-Right: Horizontal Flip.\n   - If marker is Bottom-Left: Vertical Flip.\n   - If marker is Bottom-Right: Rotate 180 degrees.\n3. Apply a global transformation to all other objects based on the marker's horizontal position:\n   - If marker is on the Right: Apply Horizontal Flip to all other objects.\n   - If marker is on the Left: Keep all other objects as is.\n4. Arrange the transformed objects into a compact grid starting with the main object at (0,0). Pack other objects into columns adjacent to and below the main object, rotating their relative quadrant positions (BL->TL, BR->TR, TR->BL, TL->BR) and sliding them up to eliminate vertical gaps.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to:\n\n1. **Identify the main object with marker (5)**: The 7-region contains the marker at position (17, 6), which is bottom-right of that region.\n\n2. **Transform main object**: Since marker is at bottom-right, I rotate 180\u00b0 to move marker to top-left.\n\n3. **Transform other objects**: Since marker was on the right side, I apply horizontal flip to all other objects (2, 3, 8).\n\n4. **Apply quadrant repositioning**:\n   - 7+5 (bottom-left) \u2192 top-left (main object)\n   - 8 (bottom-right) \u2192 top-right (no additional rotation)\n   - 3 (top-right) \u2192 bottom-left (+ 180\u00b0 rotation for diagonal move)\n   - 2 (top-left) \u2192 bottom-right (+ 180\u00b0 rotation for diagonal move)\n\n5. **Construct output**: Place transformed objects in their new positions and combine.\n\nAfter transformations:\n- **7+5 (rotated 180\u00b0)**: 10\u00d77, placed at (0,0)\n- **8 (h-flipped)**: 9\u00d78, placed at (0,7)  \n- **3 (h-flipped + 180\u00b0)**: 7\u00d710, placed at (10,0)\n- **2 (h-flipped + 180\u00b0)**: 7\u00d77, placed at (10,10)\n\nThe regions combine with non-zero values filling in zeros from overlapping regions.\n\n```\n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0\n7,7,7,7,7,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,2,2,2,2\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,0,2,2,2\n```",

Identify the object containing the marker pixel (color 5).\n2. Determine the transformation for this main object to move the marker to the top-left (0,0):\n   - If marker is Top-Left: Identity.\n   - If marker is Top-Right: Horizontal Flip.\n   - If marker is Bottom-Left: Vertical Flip.\n   - If marker is Bottom-Right: Rotate 180 degrees.\n3. Apply a global transformation to all other objects based on the marker's horizontal position:\n   - If marker is on the Right: Apply Horizontal Flip to all other objects.\n   - If marker is on the Left: Keep all other objects as is.\n4. Arrange the transformed objects into a compact grid starting with the main object at (0,0). Pack other objects into columns adjacent to and below the main object, rotating their relative quadrant positions (BL->TL, BR->TR, TR->BL, TL->BR) and sliding them up to eliminate vertical gaps.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Below is my reasoning process; afterwards I\u2019ll give the final output grid.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Interpreting the given transformation description\n\nFrom the problem statement and the three solved examples, the intended transformation seems to have these high\u2011level stages:\n\n1. **Find the main object** (the region containing the marker pixel, color 5).  \n   In all examples (and the test) this main region is color 7 with a single 5 inside it.\n\n2. **Reorient the main object so that 5 becomes the top\u2011left of its bounding box**:  \n   - If 5 is in the top\u2011left quadrant of the object\u2019s bounding box \u2192 identity.  \n   - Top\u2011right \u2192 horizontal flip.  \n   - Bottom\u2011left \u2192 vertical flip.  \n   - Bottom\u2011right \u2192 rotate 180\u00b0.\n\n   After doing this, in all examples the marker 5 ends up at output position (0,0), and the rest of the 7\u2011shape is consistent with the described transform.\n\n3. **Global horizontal flip for all *other* objects if the marker is horizontally on the right side of its object; otherwise, leave them as is.**  \n   - Example 1: marker in top\u2011right of its 7\u2011object \u2192 other objects are horizontally flipped.  \n   - Examples 2 & 3: marker in left half \u2192 other objects unchanged.  \n   - Test case: marker is in the bottom\u2011right of the 7\u2011object bounding box \u2192 other objects should be horizontally flipped.\n\n4. **Pack all objects into a compact arrangement with the main object at the upper\u2011left**, placing other objects to the right and below, roughly forming a 2\u00d72 \u201cmacro\u2011layout\u201d:  \n   - Top row: main object plus one \u201ctop partner\u201d object.  \n   - Bottom row: the remaining two objects.  \n   - Shapes are slid up as high as possible and left as far as possible without overlapping non\u2011zero cells.\n\nThe exact packing and quadrant rotation rules described in the text are quite complex and not perfectly recoverable from three examples. To get an explicit output for the test, I made a concrete packing choice that:\n\n- Respects the required reorientation (step 2) and horizontal flipping (step 3).  \n- Places the \u201cclosest vertically\u201d object with the main one in the top row (as seen consistently in the examples).  \n- Places the remaining two in a bottom row, left and right, and slides them upward as far as possible without colliding with existing non\u2011zero cells, while keeping all other shapes intact.\n\nThis yields a definite, self\u2011consistent composite grid, which I\u2019ll now outline.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Objects in the test input\n\nColors and regions:\n\n- **Main object (7 + marker 5)**  \n  - All 7s form one large region from rows 8\u201317, columns 0\u20136, with 5 at (17,6).  \n  - Bounding box: rows 8\u201317, cols 0\u20136 \u2192 height 10, width 7.  \n  - Within this box, 5 is at local coordinate (9,6), i.e. **bottom\u2011right**.\n  - Therefore: **Rotate this 7\u2011region 180\u00b0** so that 5 moves to local (0,0).\n\n- **Other objects** (all will be horizontally flipped due to marker being on the right):\n  1. Color 2: one big block in rows 0\u20136, cols 1\u20137.  \n     - Bounding size 7\u00d77.  \n     - After horizontal flip (within its 7\u00d77 box), it remains mostly the same shape except for one \u201cnotch\u201d row being mirrored.\n  2. Color 3: one big region in rows 1\u20137, cols 9\u201318.  \n     - Bounding size 7\u00d710.  \n     - After horizontal flip, the shape is mirrored left\u2013right but not rotated.\n  3. Color 8: one big region in rows 11\u201317, cols 9\u201315 plus a small vertical bit at rows 18\u201319, col 12, all connected.  \n     - Bounding box rows 11\u201319, cols 9\u201316 \u2192 size 9\u00d78.  \n     - After horizontal flip in that box, 8s are mirrored left\u2013right.\n\nSo after step 2 and the global horizontal flip on the non\u2011main objects, we have four oriented shapes:\n\n- Main 7+5: 10\u00d77 pattern with 5 at (0,0), many 7s, some 0s in lower rows.  \n- 2\u2011object: 7\u00d77, mostly solid but with a row containing zeros shifted to the right.  \n- 3\u2011object: 7\u00d710, dense 3s with a central fully\u2011solid row and some holes in lower rows.  \n- 8\u2011object: 9\u00d78, roughly a large rectangle of 8s with one full row and some vertical stalk at the bottom after flipping.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Packing decision for the test\n\nGiven the oriented shapes, I chose the following concrete placements, obeying:\n\n- Main object anchored at the global top\u2011left (row 0, col 0).  \n- Choose the \u201ctop partner\u201d (to share the top rows with the main object) as the object vertically closest to the main:  \n  - Centers (approx) of the original objects relative to the 7\u2011object show that **8** is closest vertically (just below the main 7\u2011mass), while 2 and 3 are much further above.  \n  - This mirrors the pattern in Example 3 where the closest\u2011vertically object (8) shares the top row with the main.\n- Place the 8\u2011object in the top\u2011right area: slide it leftwards until any further left shift would collide with non\u2011zero cells from the main 7\u2011object; and start it at row 0 (to stay as top as possible).\n  - This yields 8 placed with its top\u2011left at position (0,6).\n- Place the 2\u2011object as the bottom\u2011left object:\n  - Slide it upwards from below until any higher row would cause its 2s to overlap existing 5/7/8 cells.  \n  - The first collision\u2011free row for its top is row 9, column 0.\n- Place the 3\u2011object as the bottom\u2011right object:\n  - Similarly, slide it upwards and leftwards as far as possible while avoiding overlap with non\u2011zero cells from 7, 8, and 2.  \n  - The earliest collision\u2011free placement found is with its top\u2011left at row 9, column 7.\n\nCarrying out these overlays in order:\n\n1. Place the rotated main 7+5 block (10\u00d77) with 5 at (0,0).  \n2. Overlay the horizontally\u2011flipped 8 block starting at (0,6).  \n3. Overlay the flipped 2 block starting at (9,0) (rows 9\u201315, cols 0\u20136).  \n4. Overlay the flipped 3 block starting at (9,7) (rows 9\u201315, cols 7\u201316).\n\nOverlays never place two different non\u2011zero colors on the same cell; positions are chosen to avoid such conflicts.\n\nThe resulting composite has:\n\n- Height 16 (rows 0\u201315).  \n- Width 17 (cols 0\u201316).  \n- No all\u2011zero border rows/columns, so no further trimming.\n\nVisually, the final grid has:\n\n- A large 7+5 block in the top\u2011left,\n- A large 8 block in the top\u2011right,\n- A large 2 block in the bottom\u2011left,\n- A large 3 block in the bottom\u2011right,\n\nmirroring the 2\u00d72 \u201cmacro\u201d structure seen in the examples, but scaled to these larger shapes.\n\n---\n\n### 4.

Identify the object containing the marker pixel (color 5).\n2. Determine the transformation for this main object to move the marker to the top-left (0,0):\n   - If marker is Top-Left: Identity.\n   - If marker is Top-Right: Horizontal Flip.\n   - If marker is Bottom-Left: Vertical Flip.\n   - If marker is Bottom-Right: Rotate 180 degrees.\n3. Apply a global transformation to all other objects based on the marker's horizontal position:\n   - If marker is on the Right: Apply Horizontal Flip to all other objects.\n   - If marker is on the Left: Keep all other objects as is.\n4. Arrange the transformed objects into a compact grid starting with the main object at (0,0). Pack other objects into columns adjacent to and below the main object, rotating their relative quadrant positions (BL->TL, BR->TR, TR->BL, TL->BR) and sliding them up to eliminate vertical gaps.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

                "response": "**Analysis of Object Types in Grids**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My goal is to describe the *types* of things I'm seeing in these grids, not infer any kind of underlying logic.  No rules, just what's there. And everything must be described with the colors as numbers.\n\nFirst, I've got a clear background color in the larger grids \u2013 color 0. The smaller ones are just filled with stuff, no clear background.\n\nThe main \"objects\" are these contiguous regions of a single color. Their shapes vary quite a bit - some are rectangular, some are L-shaped, others are just blobs.  The colors I'm seeing are 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  They vary in size, obviously, since the grids are different sizes.\n\nAnd then there's this little guy, a single pixel of color 5.  This is a recurring element, and it's almost always found embedded within a region of color 7.  It's like it *marks* a place within that color 7 region - usually a corner or something.\n\nOkay, that seems to cover it, sticking to the facts, no rules inferred.  Here's a concise summary:\n\n```\n<objects_summary>\n  Object 1: Contiguous Regions/Polyminoes.\n    Attributes: Colors 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9; irregular or rectangular shapes; variable size.\n  Object 2: Marker Pixel.\n    Attributes: Color 5; size 1x1; located inside color 7 regions.\n  Object 3: Background.\n    Attributes: Color 0; present in sparse grids.\n</objects_summary>\n```\n\n\nBased on the visual data provided in the grids, the objects can be categorized into three main distinct types based on their structure and color attributes.\n\n**1. The Background**\n*   In the larger grids (20x20), the vast majority of the grid consists of empty space represented by **color 0**.\n*   In the smaller, denser grids (e.g., 4x4, 6x6, 10x10), there is no background object; the grid is entirely filled by the other object types.\n\n**2. Contiguous Colored Regions**\n*   These are the primary objects in every grid. They appear as connected blocks or clusters of pixels sharing a single color value.\n*   **Colors:** These regions are composed of various colors, specifically **color 2**, **color 3**, **color 4**, **color 6**, **color 7**, **color 8**, and **color 9**.\n*   **Shape and Size:** The shapes vary significantly.\n    *   In the sparse 20x20 grids, they appear as irregular \"blobs,\" clusters, or sometimes specific shapes like crosses (seen with **color 8**) or lines.\n    *   In the smaller, filled grids, these objects appear as rectangular or square quadrants that tessellate to fill the board.\n*   **Positioning:** They are distributed across different areas of the grids (top-left, bottom-right, etc.) and are separated by the background **color 0** in the larger grids, or touch directly in the smaller grids.\n\n**3. The Marker Pixel**\n*   This is a unique object consisting of a single pixel of **color 5**.\n*   **Association:** This object is strictly associated with regions of **color 7**. It is always found embedded within or replacing a single pixel of a **color 7** region.\n*   **Placement:** It typically appears at a specific extremity or corner of the **color 7** object (e.g., the top-left corner or the bottom tip). It is distinct because it is the only single-pixel object of its color, while all other non-background colors appear as larger clusters.\n\n<objects_summary>\n1. Background: Color 0, fills empty space in large grids.\n2. Colored Regions: Contiguous clusters of colors 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, or 9; varying shapes (irregular blobs, rectangles, crosses).\n3. Marker Pixel: Single pixel of color 5; always located within a region of color 7.\n</objects_summary>",

                "response": "**Transformation Strategy for Grid-Based Object Manipulation**\n\nI need to understand how the input grid transforms into the output grid, given examples. My initial focus is to identify the underlying transformation logic that consistently produces the correct output. Here\u2019s my thought process:\n\n*   **Example Analysis:** I begin by thoroughly analyzing the provided example pairs (input and output grids). I start with Example 1 and look at the objects' composition (shapes). I look at the color 5 pixel inside the 7-shape, considering the 20x20 input and 6x6 output grid.\n*   **Initial Hypothesis:** My initial suspicion is that the grid is being divided into quadrants, perhaps based on the position of specific shapes or a central anchor point or that maybe the transformation involves moving shapes and re-arranging.\n*   **Pinpointing the Key Element:** I identified the key to be pixel 5, within its \"shape\". I observed that this pixel seems to be placed at a fixed position in the output, specifically (0,0), or the top-left corner.\n*   **Transformation Logic Derivation:** By looking at Example 1, I find the 7-shape is being horizontally flipped and moved such that pixel 5 is at top-left.\n*   **Generalizing the Transformation:** Considering Example 2, I saw a vertical flip. And Example 3 had no flip. Based on the positioning of the \"marker\" (pixel 5) within the grid I formulated the hypothesis of \"re-orientation\" based on this positioning.\n*   **The \"5\" Pixel Position as the Key:** I observed that the transformation is strongly related to the location of the pixel with color 5 inside of its associated object (the 7-shape).\n    *   If 5 is at the top right, H-Flip\n    *   If 5 is at the bottom left, V-Flip\n    *   If 5 is at the top-left (Identity)\n    *   If 5 is at the bottom-right, Rotate 180 (Flip both V and H).\n*   **Global vs. Local Transformation:** My explorations show that, typically, if a \"global\" transformation (horizontal flip) is needed for \"marker\" location, then all objects are globally H-flipped. If a \"local\" transformation (vertical flip) is needed for the marker location, then the other objects are identity (they do not undergo transformations).\n*   **Object Layout is Critical:** I concluded that the final output involves a composition of individual objects, where \"gravity\" for arrangement, with the pixel 5 anchored to top-left.\n*   **Refinement with the Test Case:** Applying this strategy to the Test Input. Based on the position of pixel 5, I predict a horizontal and vertical flip (a rotation of 180 degrees) will happen to that part of the grid.\n*   **Output Grid Size Derivation:** Considering the objects' individual dimensions (height and width), I'm able to predict the dimensions of the final output grid and the layout of the objects in the final result.\n*   **Final Rule Set:**\n    1.  The object containing the pixel with color \"5\" is reoriented to put pixel \"5\" at position (0,0).\n        *   Horizontal Flip if marker is on Right (within the object).\n        *   Vertical Flip if marker is on Bottom (within the object).\n    2.  H-Flip to all other objects if needed for \"marker\" placement (step 1 above).\n    3.  Arrange the objects such that there is minimal overlap to make the final output grid.\n*   **Final Output Description:** Finally, I'll provide an accurate description of the final output, outlining its size and the precise placement of each object to construct the final output.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the examples and the test input, here are the identified transformations:\n\n1.  **Anchor Identification**: The transformation is anchored by the \"Marker Pixel\" (Color 5). The entire output grid is constructed such that this pixel moves to position (0,0) (Top-Left).\n2.  **Transformation Determination**: The transformation applied to the object containing the marker (Object 7) depends on the marker's position relative to the object's bounding box in the input:\n    *   **Top-Left**: No transformation (Identity). (Example 3)\n    *   **Top-Right**: Horizontal Flip. (Example 1)\n    *   **Bottom-Left**: Vertical Flip. (Example 2)\n    *   **Bottom-Right**: Vertical Flip + Horizontal Flip (equivalent to 180-degree Rotation). (Test Input)\n3.  **Global Transformation**:\n    *   If the marker (Color 5) is in the **Right** half of its object, a **Horizontal Flip** is applied to **ALL** other objects in the grid as well. (Example 1, Test Input).\n    *   If the marker is in the **Left** half, other objects remain in their original orientation (Identity). (Example 2, Example 3).\n4.  **Layout/Packing**:\n    *   The objects are rearranged into a compact grid.\n    *   The object containing the marker is placed at the Top-Left.\n    *   The other objects are placed in the remaining quadrants/space, generally following a pattern that rotates their original quadrant positions:\n        *   Input Bottom-Left (Main) -> Output Top-Left.\n        *   Input Bottom-Right -> Output Top-Right.\n        *   Input Top-Right -> Output Bottom-Left.\n        *   Input Top-Left -> Output Bottom-Right.\n    *   Objects are packed upwards to minimize empty space, forming columns.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Marker Position**: Color 5 is at the bottom-right of the Color 7 region.\n*   **Transformations**:\n    *   **Object 7**: 5 is Bottom-Right -> **Rotate 180\u00b0** (V-Flip + H-Flip).\n    *   **Other Objects (2, 3, 8)**: 5 is Right -> **Horizontal Flip**.\n*   **Layout**:\n    *   **Top-Left**: Object 7 (Rotated).\n    *   **Top-Right**: Object 8 (H-Flipped). (Originally BR).\n    *   **Bottom-Left**: Object 3 (H-Flipped). (Originally TR).\n    *   **Bottom-Right**: Object 2 (H-Flipped). (Originally TL).\n    *   **Packing**: Object 7 is 10 rows high; Object 3 starts at row 10. Object 8 is 9 rows high; Object 2 starts at row 9.\n\n<transformation_summary>\n1.

Identify the object containing the marker pixel (color 5).\n2. Determine the transformation for this main object to move the marker to the top-left (0,0):\n   - If marker is Top-Left: Identity.\n   - If marker is Top-Right: Horizontal Flip.\n   - If marker is Bottom-Left: Vertical Flip.\n   - If marker is Bottom-Right: Rotate 180 degrees.\n3. Apply a global transformation to all other objects based on the marker's horizontal position:\n   - If marker is on the Right: Apply Horizontal Flip to all other objects.\n   - If marker is on the Left: Keep all other objects as is.\n4. Arrange the transformed objects into a compact grid starting with the main object at (0,0). Pack other objects into columns adjacent to and below the main object, rotating their relative quadrant positions (BL->TL, BR->TR, TR->BL, TL->BR) and sliding them up to eliminate vertical gaps.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
