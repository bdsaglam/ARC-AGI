        "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Implementation Strategy for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I'm given several solved examples and a test input. I need to figure out the rule governing how these examples transform. My initial strategy is to carefully analyze the solved examples, focusing on identifying patterns and key features that link the input grids to the output grids.\n\n**Initial Observations:**\n\n1.  **Grid Composition:** The grids are mostly filled with a background color (usually 8, a light blue color) and contain smaller structures made of different colored pixels.\n2.  **Structures:** These structures appear to be built with a core color surrounded by green (3) pixels, and they appear to have a consistent geometric pattern. They have a core of colors other than 3 and 8, surrounded by 3s.\n3.  **Output Transformation:** The output seems to involve \"beams\" or lines of color radiating from these structures. There is no simple geometric transformation, but a ray-casting mechanism where core color \"leaks\" out through openings in the green shell.\n\n**Hypothesis Development:**\n\nMy central hypothesis is: the green pixels create a shell around a core color, and openings in this shell determine the direction the color \"escapes\" as rays. The green pixels work as barriers. The pattern of 3s create \"openings\" which I initially thought was the geometry of 3s, but appears to be the presence of 8s (background) next to the core color.\n\n**Detailed Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** I need to find the connected components of colors other than 8.\n2.  **Shell Analysis:** Once I identify a structure, I will examine the 12 cells adjacent to the structure. This is the surrounding shell. I must carefully classify each neighbor as either a '3' (blocker) or a '8' (opening).\n3.  **Ray Generation:** Openings should produce a beam of the core color extending from the central core area. The beam's direction is defined by the location of '8s' which allows core colors through, as opposed to barriers of 3s.\n4.  **Beam Geometry:** I found that cardinal/diagonal directions are associated with the position of the opening relative to the center of the structure. The core's \"launchpad\" shape seems important.\n5.  **Collision Handling:** Beams overwrite the background. They *do not* overwrite the core colors. Beams seem to *stop* when hitting other core structures.\n\n**Verification and Refinement:**\n\nI will test my hypothesis against each solved example. I am going to carefully identify openings and predict beam directions. Then, I will compare these predictions with the output. If there are discrepancies, I will refine my rule.\n\n**Test Input application:**\n\nWhen I get to the test input, I am simply going to repeat the rule:\n1.  Identify each color-structure (2x2s) in the grid.\n2.  Look at the 12 surrounding neighbors.\n3.  Anywhere a shell cell is '8', make a ray.\n\nI will draw the rays according to my findings. I will not worry about weird interactions or deflection, but draw the expected rays.\n\n\nBased on the solved examples, the transformation follows a logic of \"energy beams\" or \"lasers\" being emitted from 2x2 colored cores (launchpads), controlled by the surrounding 3 (green) pixels.\n\n**The Rules:**\n1.  **Identify Launchpads:** Find all 2x2 blocks of a single color (excluding background 8 and wall color 3). Let's call this the \"Core\".\n2.  **Identify Shell:** Look at the 12 pixels immediately surrounding the 2x2 Core (the 4x4 area containing the Core, minus the Core itself).\n3.  **Determine Openings:**\n    *   If a pixel in the Shell is `3` (green), it acts as a wall/blocker.\n    *   If a pixel in the Shell is `8` (background), it acts as an opening.\n4.  **Emit Beams:** From each opening, project a beam of the Core's color in the direction relative to the center of the Core.\n    *   **Corners:**\n        *   Top-Left (r-1, c-1) -> Diagonal Up-Left.\n        *   Top-Right (r-1, c+2) -> Diagonal Up-Right.\n        *   Bottom-Left (r+2, c-1) -> Diagonal Down-Left.\n        *   Bottom-Right (r+2, c+2) -> Diagonal Down-Right.\n    *   **Sides:**\n        *   Top Side (r-1, c) or (r-1, c+1) -> Vertical Up.\n        *   Bottom Side (r+2, c) or (r+2, c+1) -> Vertical Down.\n        *   Left Side (r, c-1) or (r+1, c-1) -> Horizontal Left.\n        *   Right Side (r, c+2) or (r+1, c+2) -> Horizontal Right.\n5.  **Beam Propagation:** Beams travel in a straight line until they hit the edge of the grid. They overwrite the background (8) but generally respect existing structures (though in this task, they seem to overlay freely on 8s).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Shape 1 (Red `2`):** Core at R5-6, C4-5.\n    *   Shell Top (4,4) is `8` -> **Up Beam** on Col 4.\n    *   Shell Left (5,3) is `8` -> **Left Beam** on Row 5.\n    *   Other shell pixels are `3`.\n\n*   **Shape 2 (Yellow `4`):** Core at R5-6, C15-16.\n    *   Shell Top-Left (4,14) is `8` -> **Diagonal Up-Left Beam** starting at (3,13).\n    *   Shell Right (5,17) is `8` -> **Right Beam** on Row 5.\n    *   Shell Bottom (7,15) is `8` -> **Down Beam** on Col 15.\n\n*   **Shape 3 (Magenta `6`):** Core at R14-15, C23-24.\n    *   Shell Top (13,23) is `8` -> **Up Beam** on Col 23.\n    *   Shell Top-Right (13,25) is `8` -> **Diagonal Up-Right Beam** starting at (12,26).\n    *   Shell Bottom-Right (16,25) is `3` (Blocked).\n\n*   **Shape 4 (Orange `7`):** Core at R20-21, C22-23.\n    *   Shell Right (20,24) is `8` -> **Right Beam** on Row 20.\n    *   Shell Bottom-Right (22,24) is `3` (Blocked).\n\n*   **Shape 5 (Maroon `9`):** Core at R25-26, C2-3.\n    *   Shell Top (24,2) is `8` -> **Up Beam** on Col 2.\n    *   Shell Top-Right (24,4) is `8` -> **Diagonal Up-Right Beam** starting at (23,5).\n    *   Shell Right (25,4) is `8` -> **Right Beam** on Row 25.\n    *   Shell Right (26,4) is `8` -> **Right Beam** on Row 26.\n    *   Shell Bottom-Right (27,4) is `8` -> **Diagonal Down-Right Beam** starting at (28,5).\n\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,8,3,3,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,8,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n3,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**Deep Dive into the ARC Task:**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task. My immediate thoughts are to meticulously dissect the given examples, look for patterns, and then apply that knowledge to the test input. First, let's look at the examples:\n\n**Example 1**: I'm zooming into the details of the shapes. They're these small, colored objects inside a larger grid. I'm noting the background color (teal, or 8). Each object is defined by an inner color and a border color. I am going to carefully analyze what defines the object - is it the bounding box? Is it something more exact?\n\nThe first object in Example 1 has a green border (3) and a maroon inner (9). The shape is roughly diamond-like. Wait, I notice that the numbers don't extend perfectly to the bounds. They approximate the diamond. The \"inside\" is a 2x2 of the maroon. I'm focusing in to determine if there are differences between the input and the output - the locations, the objects, and the patterns. I notice the diagonal beams.\n\nThese beams are the key. They emanate from the inner color. I'm careful to note where the rays begin. They are not the absolute corners of the object. There is something subtle happening between the object's geometry and the start of the rays. I'm also carefully checking coordinates.\n\nAfter analyzing the first object, I'm checking what's common across all the objects. In Example 1, there are 4 shapes. They are color-coded. And, the rule is consistent. The inner pixels dictate the rays.\n\nI am re-analyzing to see where exactly the rays are coming from. The diagonals seem to project from pixel neighbors and form a box. But are there edge cases? Can these edge cases be extrapolated?\n\nI'm thinking about how the color-to-beam-pattern relationship works. It isn't random. Is there a consistent logic or a look-up? It feels like the specific geometry, or the inner color. Example 4 introduces horizontal lines. So the beam-generation is not a universal X - diagonal rule. It depends on something.\n\nI'm diving deep now, checking what controls the beam types. Is it the location? The color? Or is the \"missing\" border edge dictating it? Is there a gap in the border? It's looking like the geometry controls the beam. This hypothesis starts to unravel a new pattern.\n\nI am now looking at all the cases to confirm that the \"gap in the border\" hypothesis holds.\n\nOkay, I'm verifying the rule through all 4 examples. Yes, the gap in the 3-border dictates the emission and direction of the beam. The border is a wall. If the wall is missing, it is an opening.\n\nThis seems to be a solid rule: identify interior pixels and check their 8 neighbors. If a diagonal neighbor is background (8) and there is a \"blocker\" or adjacent border pieces, emit in the direction. If there is a \"corner hole\" or \"top-open-corner\", emit the ray.\n\nI'm starting to formalize the rule.\n\nI must account for the beam intersecting different shapes. The beam may extend to the grid borders, the beam continues until interrupted by something non-background or the edge. I'm also making sure I can handle the special cases. Beams crossing, for example.\n\nThe rule seems correct. However, one of the examples has a diagonal beam, but the adjacent corner is blocked by a border pixel (3). So there is an edge case. I'm refining the algorithm.\n\nI am refining, refining, refining. Can I identify a more precise rule? Is there a concept of a \"filled\" object? The inner object must have a border.\n\nI'm exploring the problem a new way - the shapes create an opening. The logic is a \"filled shape\" then projects rays.\n\nI am making refinements and testing assumptions.\n\nI am re-parsing my previous examples with this new hypothesis. The filled shape idea seems solid. The rays go from the filled region. If it hits the \"border\", it stops. However, can the rays be defined from the border? The rays are from the 8. So the background is necessary.\n\nI think I have a stable model. I am checking the logic for blocked corners - I must confirm the blocking rules. Does the color of an existing object block the ray? Yes, I am confirming the rules:\n\nIf the pixel is not the border, cast the orthogonal neighbors. If diagonal, cast if both orthogonal are blocked.\n\nI'm feeling confident about the method now. I must ensure the edge cases are covered. I am checking that the beams can pass each other without overwriting.\n\nI have finalized my logic.\n\nI\n\nThe transformation rule involves identifying \"objects\" defined by a border color (3 - green) and an inner color (variable). For each object:\n1.  **Identify and Fill**: Locate the interior of the object. The interior consists of pixels surrounded by the border color. If the border has an opening (a \"missing\" border pixel), the empty space (8) adjacent to the interior pixels through that opening effectively becomes part of the interior for the purpose of ray casting, and takes on the inner color.\n2.  **Cast Rays**: From every pixel of the filled interior (including filled openings), cast rays of the inner color in the 8 directions (Up, Down, Left, Right, UL, UR, DL, DR).\n    *   A ray is cast in an **orthogonal** direction (Up, Down, Left, Right) if the immediate neighbor in that direction is empty background (8).\n    *   A ray is cast in a **diagonal** direction if the immediate diagonal neighbor is empty background (8), **AND** the two orthogonal neighbors sharing that quadrant are **blocked** (i.e., they are border (3) or inner pixels). If even one orthogonal neighbor is open (8), the diagonal ray is suppressed (priority is given to the orthogonal ray).\n3.  **Ray Propagation**: Rays travel until they hit the edge of the grid or a non-background pixel (like another object's border). Rays from different objects can cross; if they intersect at the same pixel, the object processed later (typically lower/right) overwrites the earlier one.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Object 1 (Top-Left, Inner Color 2):**\n    *   Interior filled at `(4,4)`.\n    *   Ray **Up** from `(4,4)` (Col 4, Rows 0-3).\n    *   Ray **Left** from `(5,4)` (Row 5, Cols 0-3).\n    *   Ray **Down-Right** from `(6,5)` (Starts `(7,6)`, goes `(8,7)...(21,20)`). Stops before hitting Obj 4.\n*   **Object 2 (Top-Right, Inner Color 4):**\n    *   Interior filled at `(7,15)`.\n    *   Ray **Right** from `(5,16)` (Row 5, Cols 17-29).\n    *   Ray **Down** from `(7,15)` (Col 15, Rows 8-29).\n*   **Object 3 (Middle-Right, Inner Color 6):**\n    *   Interior filled at `(13,23)`.\n    *   Ray **Up** from `(13,23)` (Col 23, Rows 0-12).\n    *   Ray **Up-Right** from `(14,24)` (Starts `(13,25)`, goes to `(9,29)`).\n    *   Ray **Down-Right** from `(15,24)` (Starts `(16,25)`, goes to `(20,29)`). Collision at `(20,29)`.\n*   **Object 4 (Bottom-Middle, Inner Color 7):**\n    *   Interior filled at `(20,24)`.\n    *   Ray **Right** from `(20,24)` (Row 20, Cols 25-29). *Note: At `(20,29)`, this overwrites Obj 3's ray.*\n    *   Ray **Down-Right** from `(21,23)` (Starts `(22,24)`, goes to `(27,29)`).\n*   **Object 5 (Bottom-Left, Inner Color 9):**\n    *   Interior filled at `(24,2)`.\n    *   Ray **Up** from `(24,2)` (Col 2, Rows 0-23). *Note: At `(5,2)`, this overwrites Obj 1's ray.*\n    *   Ray **Down-Right** from `(26,2)` (Starts `(27,3)`, goes to `(29,5)`).\n\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

From each gap, a ray is shot using the fill color:\n   - Edge gaps (top/bottom/left/right) create straight rays in that direction\n   - Corner gaps create diagonal rays away from the box center\n3. Rays only overwrite background cells (8s), not existing structure\n\n**Test input boxes:**\n- Box 1 (2s at rows 5-6, cols 4-5): gaps at (4,4) top\u2192UP, (5,3) left\u2192LEFT, (7,6) corner\u2192DOWN-RIGHT diagonal\n- Box 2 (4s at rows 5-6, cols 15-16): gaps at (5,17) right\u2192RIGHT, (7,15) bottom\u2192DOWN\n- Box 3 (6s at rows 14-15, cols 23-24): gaps at (13,23) top\u2192UP, (13,25) corner\u2192UP-RIGHT, (16,25) corner\u2192DOWN-RIGHT\n- Box 4 (7s at rows 20-21, cols 22-23): gaps at (20,24) right\u2192RIGHT, (22,24) corner\u2192DOWN-RIGHT\n- Box 5 (9s at rows 25-26, cols 1-2): gaps at (24,2) top\u2192UP, (27,3) corner\u2192DOWN-RIGHT\n\n```\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,2,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Below is my reasoning process; however, I was **not** able to infer a consistent, correct transformation rule from the training examples. The behavior in Example 3 in particular (the way colors 2, 4, and 7 are propagated) is complex and interacts in ways I could not reconcile into a single coherent algorithm that would reliably generalize to the test input.\n\nBecause of that, any nontrivial transformation I apply to the test grid would essentially be a guess, not something reproducible from a clearly stated rule. Rather than fabricate a complicated but unjustified mapping, I will explicitly choose the only transformation I can state and justify with complete clarity:\n\n> **Transformation I will apply:**  \n> For the test input, I will leave the grid unchanged; i.e., the output grid is identical to the input grid.\n\nThis is not consistent with the training examples (which clearly show nontrivial changes), so it is almost certainly **not** the intended solution to the ARC task. But it is at least a fully specified, reproducible transformation, and I do not want to claim to have inferred a correct rule when I have not.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n\nApplying the \u201cidentity\u201d transformation (no change) to the test input, the output grid is:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

In our test grid this matters only at (row5,col2) and (row5,col23); there, 2 beats 9, and 4 beats 6 respectively.\n\n---\n\n### Step\u2011by\u2011step rule\n\nLet background be color 8; \u201cframe\u201d color is 3.\n\n1. **Find seed blocks**:  \n   Locate every 2\u00d72 block all of whose four cells are the same color `C` with `C\u22603` and `C\u22608`.  \n   In the test grid we have:\n   - 2\u2011block at rows 5\u20136, cols 4\u20135.\n   - 4\u2011block at rows 5\u20136, cols 16\u201317.\n   - 6\u2011block at rows 14\u201315, cols 23\u201324.\n   - 7\u2011block at rows 21\u201322, cols 23\u201324.\n   - 9\u2011block at rows 26\u201327, cols 1\u20132.\n\n2. **Emit horizontal rays from each 2\u00d72 block**  \n   For each seed block:\n   - Consider its top row (the two cells `(rt,cl)` and `(rt,cr)`):\n     - If the cell immediately to the left of `(rt,cl)` is 8, then fill background 8s going left along that row until a non\u20118 is reached.\n     - If the cell immediately to the right of `(rt,cr)` is 8, fill background 8s going right along that row until a non\u20118 is reached.\n   - Do the same for the bottom row of the block.\n\n   Applied:\n\n   - **2\u2011block (rows 5\u20136, cols 4\u20135)**  \n     Top row (row 5):\n     - Left neighbor of (5,4) is (5,3)=8 \u2192 extend left: (5,3),(5,2),(5,1),(5,0) become 2.\n     - Right neighbor of (5,5) is (5,6)=3 \u2192 no rightward ray.\n     Bottom row (row 6):\n     - Left neighbor of (6,4) is (6,3)=3 \u2192 no leftward ray.\n     - Right neighbor of (6,5) is (6,6)=3 \u2192 no rightward ray.\n\n   - **4\u2011block (rows 5\u20136, cols 16\u201317)**  \n     Top row (row 5):\n     - Left neighbor of (5,16) is (5,15)=3 \u2192 no leftward.\n     - Right neighbor of (5,17) is (5,18)=8 \u2192 rightward ray: (5,18)\u2026(5,29) become 4.\n     Bottom row (row 6):\n     - Neighbors at (6,15) and (6,18) are 3 \u2192 no rays.\n\n   - **6\u2011block (rows 14\u201315, cols 23\u201324)**  \n     All immediate left/right neighbors (cols 22 and 25) are 3 \u2192 no horizontal rays.\n\n   - **7\u2011block (rows 21\u201322, cols 23\u201324)**  \n     Top row (row 21):\n     - Left neighbor of (21,23) is (21,22)=3 \u2192 no leftward.\n     - Right neighbor of (21,24) is (21,25)=8 \u2192 rightward ray: (21,25)\u2026(21,29) become 7.\n     Bottom row: both sides touch 3 \u2192 no rays.\n\n   - **9\u2011block (rows 26\u201327, cols 1\u20132)**  \n     All left/right neighbors at those rows are 3 \u2192 no horizontal rays.\n\n3. **Emit vertical rays upward from the *top* row of each block**\n\n   For each of the two top cells `(rt,cl)` and `(rt,cr)`:\n\n   - If the cell directly above is 8, paint upwards in that column through consecutive 8s until a non\u20118 is reached.\n\n   Applied:\n\n   - **2\u2011block**:  \n     - Above (5,4) is (4,4)=8 \u2192 fill (4,4),(3,4),(2,4),(1,4),(0,4) with 2.  \n     - Above (5,5) is a 3 \u2192 no ray.\n\n   - **4\u2011block**: above both top cells are 3 \u2192 no vertical rays.\n\n   - **6\u2011block**:  \n     - Above (14,23) is (13,23)=8 \u2192 vertical ray in col23 up to top: rows 13,12,\u2026,0 at col23 become 6 (we stop just before the original 6s at rows 14\u201315).  \n     - Above (14,24) is 3 \u2192 no vertical.\n\n   - **7\u2011block**: above row 21 the frame row 20 has 3s at cols 23\u201324 \u2192 no vertical.\n\n   - **9\u2011block**:  \n     - Above (26,1) is 3 \u2192 no.  \n     - Above (26,2) is (25,2)=8 \u2192 vertical ray in col2: rows 25,\u2026,0 at col2 become 9 (stopping before the original 9s at 26\u201327).\n\n4. **Emit diagonal rays from certain \u201c3\u2011corner\u201d corners**\n\n   We only consider:\n   - NE from the top\u2011right corner `(rt,cr)` if:\n     - its north `(rt\u20111,cr)` and east `(rt,cr+1)` neighbors are both 3, and\n     - the first NE cell `(rt\u20111,cr+1)` is 8.\n   - SW from the bottom\u2011left corner `(rb,cl)` if:\n     - its south `(rb+1,cl)` and west `(rb,cl\u20111)` neighbors are both 3, and\n     - the first SW cell `(rb+1,cl\u20111)` is 8.\n\n   When allowed, fill along that diagonal through consecutive 8s until a non\u20118 is met.\n\n   Applied:\n\n   - **2\u2011block**:  \n     Top\u2011right (5,5): N=3, E=3, but NE=(4,6)=3 \u2192 no NE.  \n     Bottom\u2011left (6,4): S=3, W=3, SW=(7,3)=3 \u2192 no SW.  \n     \u21d2 no diagonal 2s.\n\n   - **4\u2011block**:  \n     Top\u2011right (5,17): N=3, E=8 \u2192 fails the \u201cboth 3\u201d condition \u2192 no NE.  \n     Bottom\u2011left (6,16): S=8,W=3 \u2192 fails \u2192 no SW.  \n     \u21d2 no diagonal 4s.\n\n   - **6\u2011block**:  \n     Top\u2011right (14,24): N=(13,24)=3, E=(14,25)=3, NE=(13,25)=8 \u2192 NE diagonal allowed \u2192 fill (13,25),(12,26),(11,27),(10,28),(9,29) with 6.  \n     Bottom\u2011left (15,23): S=(16,23)=3, W=(15,22)=3, but SW=(16,22)=3 \u2192 no SW.\n\n   - **7\u2011block**: the relevant diagonals hit non\u20118 immediately, so no diagonals.\n\n   - **9\u2011block**: the 3s are arranged differently; neither the NE nor SW conditions are satisfied so no diagonals.\n\n5. **Never overwrite non\u2011background**\n\n   Rays only paint into cells that were background 8 in the *original* grid.  \n   Cells that are 3, part of any seed 2\u00d72 block, or already non\u20118 from the input are never overwritten.\n\n6. **Resolve conflicts (if two colors target the same 8)**\n\n   Compute the Manhattan distance from each competing seed block to that cell; keep the color whose source is closer.\n\n   In the test grid:\n   - Cell (5,2):  \n     - From 2\u2011block (center around row5\u20136,col4\u20135) is distance 2.  \n     - From 9\u2011block (around row26\u201327,col1\u20132) is distance 21.  \n     \u21d2 keep 2, do not overwrite with 9.\n   - Cell (5,23):  \n     - From 4\u2011block (around row5\u20136,col16\u201317) is much closer than from 6\u2011block (around row14\u201315).  \n     \u21d2 keep 4, do not overwrite with 6.\n\n   In practice I implemented this by applying the nearer sources (2 and 4) first and then skipping later rays that would attempt to paint non\u20118 cells.\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test grid\n\nStarting from the test input and applying the above rays yields the following final grid:\n\n```\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",
