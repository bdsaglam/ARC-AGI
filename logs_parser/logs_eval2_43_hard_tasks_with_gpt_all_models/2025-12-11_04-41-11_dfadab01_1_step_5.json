            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analyzing and Devising a Solution for an ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to solve this ARC task by deciphering the rules that transform the input into the output. My approach will be to meticulously analyze the given examples, searching for consistent patterns and relationships between the input and output grids.\n\nI'll begin by focusing on identifying potential transformation rules. The examples seem to involve a grid structure, likely composed of tiles or blocks. I'll need to determine the size of these blocks and how they relate to the overall grid dimensions.\n\nMy initial hypothesis is that the input contains specific markers or \"seeds\" that determine the placement and potentially the form of shapes in the output. I'll need to identify the nature of these markers. Are they specific pixel values, geometric shapes, or something else?\n\nI'll pay close attention to the examples' inputs and outputs, identifying potential Templates that might be used as basis of the output shapes. I'll look for recurring patterns or \"dictionaries\" that map specific input elements to their corresponding output elements or colors.\n\nA crucial observation is that specific input elements seem to produce consistent output shapes. I will verify if there is a relationship between these input elements and the shape in the output, such as color mapping or geometric transformations.\n\nI'll examine the examples for any hidden Templates used to create shapes in the output. Or are they constant and defined globally?\n\nTo ensure the rules are consistent, I'll analyze multiple examples of the task, comparing and contrasting their features to find the correct mappings and any potential edge cases.\n\nOnce the rules are found, I'll verify if the Test Input aligns with these rules. I will extract all the markers and the associated Shapes. I will construct the final output based on these extractions.\n\nThis process involves a lot of detective work, identifying clues, forming hypotheses, testing them, and refining them until a complete and consistent set of rules is discovered. The goal is to produce an output that accurately reflects the intended transformation.\n\n\nThe task requires transforming a grid containing \"markers\" (single pixels of a specific color) and potentially a \"template shape\" into a grid filled with that shape.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The grid is treated as a lattice of 4x4 blocks. For a 20x20 grid, this results in a 5x5 array of blocks.\n2.  **Markers and Templates:**\n    *   The input contains single colored pixels (markers) positioned within these 4x4 blocks.\n    *   The input may also contain a fully drawn 4x4 shape (a template).\n3.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   Identify the **Template Shape** present in the input. In the test input, an Orange (7) shape is visible in the block at **(Row 1, Column 1)** (indices relative to the 5x5 block grid).\n    *   Identify the **Marker Color** associated with that shape. From the solved examples, specific markers map to specific shape colors (e.g., Red `2` $\\to$ Yellow `4`, Green `3` $\\to$ Blue `1`, Grey `5` $\\to$ Pink `6`). In the test case, the markers are Azure (`8`), and the shape is Orange (`7`). This establishes the mapping `8` $\\to$ Shape `7`.\n    *   **Populate the Output:**\n        *   For every 4x4 block in the input that contains a Marker (`8`), place the Template Shape in the corresponding block of the output.\n        *   The block containing the original Template Shape is cleared (becomes empty) in the output, unless it also contains a marker (which it does not in this case).\n        *   All other blocks remain empty (black/0).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Template:** The Orange (7) shape is found at block coordinates **(1, 1)** (Rows 4-7, Cols 4-7 in 0-indexed pixel coordinates).\n    *   Shape pattern:\n        ```\n        7 0 0 7\n        0 7 7 0\n        0 7 7 0\n        7 0 0 7\n        ```\n*   **Markers (`8`):** Scanning the 20x20 input grid for `8`s:\n    *   **Block Row 0:** Markers at Cols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. $\\rightarrow$ **All 5 blocks are Shapes.**\n    *   **Block Row 1:** Markers at Cols 0 and 4. The Template is at Col 1. Cols 2 and 3 are empty. $\\rightarrow$ **[Shape, Empty, Empty, Empty, Shape]**.\n    *   **Block Row 2:** Markers at Cols 0, 2, 4. $\\rightarrow$ **[Shape, Empty, Shape, Empty, Shape]**.\n    *   **Block Row 3:** Markers at Cols 0, 3, 4. $\\rightarrow$ **[Shape, Empty, Empty, Shape, Shape]**.\n    *   **Block Row 4:** Markers at Cols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. $\\rightarrow$ **All 5 blocks are Shapes.**\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\nConstruct the 20x20 grid by filling the 4x4 blocks according to the layout derived above.\n\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Analysis and Hypothesis Formation**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The objective is to decipher the transformation rules between input and output grids in these ARC tasks. I'm focusing on identifying consistent patterns and mappings. It seems like the core idea here is a tile-based grid, where the input defines the layout and content of these tiles, and the output reflects these definitions. Let's start with Example 1: a 20x20 input to a 20x20 output.\n\n**Example 1 Deciphering and Rule Finding**\n\nInitial thoughts: the input seems sparse, single pixels are \"anchors\" of the pattern. Examining the structure, it appears the grid is divided into 4x4 tiles, that make up a 5x5 meta grid in the 20x20 example.\nThe initial thoughts about diagonal checkerboard-like patterns were close but the data is cleaner than first thought. Specifically, there is color assignment in the tiles. These small colored shapes are repeated. I'm seeing patterns here.\nThe output seems composed of these repeating 4x4 tiles.\nInput features appear to define the content, maybe via these anchors or \"seeds\" of the tile patterns. Example 1 shows us that the `6,6` in the anchor define what output the final 4x4 block will look like. The output shows pattern `6` is a color. Let's keep this in mind.\nNow, the 20x20 means a 5x5 layout of 4x4 tiles. Let's look at the meta layout of the Input for where the patterns \"start\".\nIf we look at example 2, in a 10x10. If we split this into 4x4 tiles. The input row 1 column 1 has a `3`. The output is the color for the `3`. Input row 1 column 5 has a `2`. and the corresponding output tile is the color of the `2`.\nAlso, in example 2, it is noted that the last two columns and last two rows are all `0`. Therefore, the 10x10 example, the grid is 8x8 with 0 borders. So `3` and `2` correspond to the colors of what pattern they will be. We're on the right track here!\n\n**Hypothesis Refinement: Mapping and Definitions**\n\nIt's becoming clear: the input uses single-pixel markers to \"point\" to a specific output pattern. These single pixels are acting as \"keys\" and the 4x4 tiles are the blocks to make the output. Further analysis of examples 1 and 2, and 3: the Input marker \"seeds\" act as an \"Instruction\". So if the input is:\n`3,0,0,0`\n`0,0,0,0`\n...\nthe output is Pattern 3 (or the appropriate color) to the 4x4 pattern.\n\n**Expanding the Analysis with Example 2**\n\nGoing back to Example 2: a 10x10 grid with non-zero pixels at (1,1), (1,5), (5,1), and (5,5) that are marker pixels. The marker pixel defines the block, and also, the pixel can be mapped to another location via an \"Instruction\". So we're looking at what is the instruction, and, where is it. The example shows there is a \"map\" that allows you to figure out what color each marker has, and where it must be mapped. Here's what's going on: (1,1)=3, (1,5)=2, (5,1)=2, (5,5)=3\n(1,1)=3 should map to the instruction of the `3` pixel, but the `2` pixel has an `0`. So the single pixels instruct.\nExample 3: the non-zero pixels are at (0,0), (0,6), (4,4), and (6,0) that are marker pixels, or blocks.\nThe 0 and 10 and 6 rows of pixels create the colored structure of each instruction.\nThe pixel values are the \"Key\". For Example 3:\nPixel 4 is the instruction and key.\n`2` is the pixel and key.\nIn Example 1:\n`6` is the pixel and key.\nThe key here is that the values act as \"Keys\" for the colors in the blocks in the output. And can map to their appropriate positions.\n\n**The Marker System and Universal Mapping**\n\nThe crucial insight: markers serve as references to pattern definitions, with the color of the marker being the associated color of the pattern. The key here is not the *color*, but the relationship\n\nThe problem involves identifying a grid of 4x4 tiles where each tile's content is determined by a \"marker\" pixel at its top-left corner in the input grid.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Grid Structure**: The input and output grids are divided into 4x4 regions (tiles), often aligned to specific rows and columns.\n2.  **Markers & Patterns**:\n    *   Single non-zero pixels (markers) in the input indicate which pattern should be filled into that 4x4 tile in the output.\n    *   There is a consistent mapping from Marker Value $\\rightarrow$ Pattern Color & Shape.\n    *   **Mapping found from examples:**\n        *   Marker `2` $\\rightarrow$ Pattern `4` (Yellow hollow square).\n        *   Marker `3` $\\rightarrow$ Pattern `1` (Blue diamond).\n        *   Marker `5` $\\rightarrow$ Pattern `6` (Magenta checkerboard).\n        *   Marker `8` $\\rightarrow$ Pattern `7` (Orange X-shape).\n3.  **Pattern Definitions**:\n    *   The specific shape of a pattern is sometimes explicitly defined in the input grid itself. A tile will contain the marker at the top-left, and the rest of the 4x4 area shows the pattern pixels.\n    *   In the output, \"definition tiles\" are cleared to 0 (unless the marker is also a pointer to itself, which is not the case for `6`, `4`, `7`).\n    *   \"Pointer tiles\" (tiles with just the marker) are filled with the corresponding pattern.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Scan for Markers**:\n    *   Row 0: All 0s.\n    *   Row 1: Markers `8` at columns 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n    *   Row 5: Marker `8` at col 0, `7` at col 4, `8` at col 16. Columns 8 and 12 are 0.\n        *   Note: The tile at (5,4) contains the full pattern for color 7: `7,0,0,7` / `0,7,7,0` ... This confirms the pattern for `7`. Since `7` is the definition marker and `8` is the pointer, this tile will be cleared in the output.\n    *   Row 9: Markers `8` at columns 0, 8, 16.\n    *   Row 13: Markers `8` at columns 0, 12, 16.\n    *   Row 17: Markers `8` at columns 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n\n2.  **Determine Pattern**:\n    *   Marker `8` maps to Pattern `7`.\n    *   Pattern `7` (from the definition at Row 5, Col 4) is:\n        ```\n        7, 0, 0, 7\n        0, 7, 7, 0\n        0, 7, 7, 0\n        7, 0, 0, 7\n        ```\n\n3.  **Construct Output**:\n    *   **Row 0**: Empty (0s).\n    *   **Rows 1-4**: Fill Pattern `7` at cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n    *   **Rows 5-8**: Fill Pattern `7` at cols 0 and 16. Clear col 4 (definition). Cols 8, 12 are empty.\n    *   **Rows 9-12**: Fill Pattern `7` at cols 0, 8, 16.\n    *   **Rows 13-16**: Fill Pattern `7` at cols 0, 12, 16.\n    *   **Rows 17-19**: Fill Pattern `7` at cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. Note: The grid ends at row 19, so the last row of the 4x4 pattern is truncated.\n\n**Final Output Grid Generation**:\n\n*   **Row 1**: `7,0,0,7` repeated.\n*   **Row 2, 3**: `0,7,7,0` repeated.\n*   **Row 4**: `7,0,0,7` repeated.\n*   **Row 5**: `7,0,0,7` at start/end. Middle 0s.\n*   ...and so on following the marker layout.\n\noutput:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**The Strategy for ARC Task Solving**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this ARC task, and it seems I need to figure out how to transform some input grids into output grids.  I've got a few examples to work with, which is great.  Looking at them, I'm noticing a few things right off the bat: the inputs are usually sparse, just a few colored pixels, while the outputs are denser with recognizable patterns, often looking like repeated tiles. The grid dimensions are all the same, 20x20.\n\nMy immediate thought is that these 4x4 blocks are key, that the whole grid is somehow broken down into those units. I analyze the examples, focusing on how input pixels map to output patterns, always keeping in mind the 4x4 blocks.  I start noticing there's a relationship between the color of a pixel in the input and the pattern it generates in the output. For example, a red pixel in the input generates a yellow square in the output. I start taking notes on the color mappings I observe.\n\nThe patterns are all 4x4, and there's usually a 1 pixel gap between each of the blocks. The question that has me is about how these blocks are arranged: it's not a direct pixel-to-pixel mapping, that much is clear, instead it seems the input is used as a type of key or seed, and the colors are a type of pattern library.\n\nSo, I figure that I need to find the \"seed\" pixels, then apply the correct pattern in the corresponding position in the output.  The output is a 20x20 grid of 4x4 blocks separated by 1-pixel spacing.  The seed is defined as a non-zero pixel in the input which drives the color of a 4x4 block in the output.  This is proven by analyzing all the examples, finding cases where seeds are at 1 row off, 1 column off and still defining the 4x4 block pattern.\n\nIt turns out that some blocks are empty, which means the seed in input grid needs a color, so if it's the right color, it drives a particular output pattern. The rule is simple: Each seed color maps to a unique 4x4 pattern, like a red pixel always results in yellow blocks, a green pixel blue ring and so on. If the input contains a pattern which \"should be the output,\" it's ignored. I need to handle cases where there are overlapping seed locations, so the pattern should be overwritten in that case.  The color 6, for instance, produces an empty black block in output. The Test input requires me to convert color 8 into an orange pattern.\n\nSo, I need to look at each seed position in the input and replace the appropriate area of the output grid with the corresponding pattern.\n\nI construct a strategy, and work the test input, by starting with a zero grid. Then I identify each seed pixel in the test input, and use their coordinates to construct the final output. The main problem is building and identifying the pattern and color mappings. All examples are considered by following the coordinate position in each of them.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a sparse input grid into a patterned output grid based on observed rules from examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:**\n    *   The grids are conceptually divided into 4x4 blocks.\n    *   The \"seeds\" in the input determine where these 4x4 patterns appear in the output.\n    *   The top-left corner of the seed pixel in the input corresponds to the top-left corner of the 4x4 pattern in the output.\n\n2.  **Color Mapping and Patterns:**\n    *   Input **Red (2)** $\\rightarrow$ Output **Yellow (4)** Hollow Square.\n        Pattern:\n        ```\n        4 4 4 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 4 4 4\n        ```\n    *   Input **Green (3)** $\\rightarrow$ Output **Blue (1)** Ring.\n        Pattern:\n        ```\n        0 1 1 0\n        1 0 0 1\n        1 0 0 1\n        0 1 1 0\n        ```\n    *   Input **Gray (5)** $\\rightarrow$ Output **Magenta (6)** Checkerboard.\n        Pattern:\n        ```\n        6 6 0 0\n        6 6 0 0\n        0 0 6 6\n        0 0 6 6\n        ```\n    *   Input **Teal (8)** $\\rightarrow$ Output **Orange (7)** Pattern.\n        Pattern:\n        ```\n        7 0 0 7\n        0 7 7 0\n        0 7 7 0\n        7 0 0 7\n        ```\n\n3.  **Behavior of Other Inputs:**\n    *   Input pixels that are part of a pre-drawn pattern (e.g., the magenta blocks in Ex 1, the yellow square in Ex 3, the partial orange pattern in the test input) are ignored and result in empty (0) output cells. Only the specific single-pixel \"seeds\" trigger the pattern generation.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Input Seeds:** The input contains color **8 (Teal)**.\n*   **Target Pattern:** Color 8 maps to the **Orange (7)** pattern.\n*   **Locations:**\n    *   Row 1: Seeds at columns 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. $\\rightarrow$ Full row of 5 patterns.\n    *   Row 5: Seeds at columns 0, 16. (The columns 4-7 contain the Orange pattern itself, which is ignored). $\\rightarrow$ Patterns at ends only.\n    *   Row 9: Seeds at columns 0, 8, 16. $\\rightarrow$ Patterns at ends and center.\n    *   Row 13: Seeds at columns 0, 12, 16. $\\rightarrow$ Patterns at ends and col 12.\n    *   Row 17: Seeds at columns 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. $\\rightarrow$ Full row of 5 patterns.\n*   **Grid Dimensions:** 20x20.\n    *   Row 0 corresponds to input row 0 (empty).\n    *   Input Row 1 seed generates pattern in output Rows 1-4.\n    *   Input Row 5 seed generates pattern in output Rows 5-8.\n    *   Input Row 9 seed generates pattern in output Rows 9-12.\n    *   Input Row 13 seed generates pattern in output Rows 13-16.\n    *   Input Row 17 seed generates pattern in output Rows 17-19 (Row 20 is out of bounds, so the last row of the pattern is clipped).\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\n\n*   **Row 0:** All 0s.\n*   **Rows 1-4:** 5 blocks of Orange pattern.\n    *   `7,0,0,7` repeated 5 times.\n    *   `0,7,7,0` repeated 5 times.\n    *   `0,7,7,0` repeated 5 times.\n    *   `7,0,0,7` repeated 5 times.\n*   **Rows 5-8:** Blocks at col 0 and 16. Middle columns empty.\n    *   `7,0,0,7`, then 12 `0`s, then `7,0,0,7`.\n    *   `0,7,7,0`, then 12 `0`s, then `0,7,7,0`.\n    *   `0,7,7,0`, then 12 `0`s, then `0,7,7,0`.\n    *   `7,0,0,7`, then 12 `0`s, then `7,0,0,7`.\n*   **Rows 9-12:** Blocks at 0, 8, 16.\n    *   Pattern, 0000, Pattern, 0000, Pattern.\n*   **Rows 13-16:** Blocks at 0, 12, 16.\n    *   Pattern, 0000, 0000, Pattern, Pattern.\n*   **Rows 17-19:** 5 blocks (bottom clipped).\n    *   Pattern Row 0.\n    *   Pattern Row 1.\n    *   Pattern Row 2.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Thoughts & Grid Pattern Discovery**\n\nMy task is to decode a pattern-generating system from a set of solved examples. I see large grids, typically filled with sparse, non-zero pixel data. The outputs appear similar in size to the inputs. A key observation is the recurrence of 4x4 blocks in the output. I note Example 2's size and consider the block-based structuring. I re-examine Example 1's input and notice pixel coordinates, color codes (like magenta '6' and yellow '4') and identify trigger points, pixels (1,8) and (1,13) result in identical yellow block patterns in the output, while pixel (5,5) creates nothing. Further examination reveals that the inputs can be split into 4x4 blocks, and that the positions of pixels relative to these cells determine output placement.\n\n**Hypothesis Formation: Pixel-to-Pattern Mapping & Initial Rule**\n\nI hypothesize that a non-zero pixel at a coordinate (r, c) with a color 'C' triggers a specific 4x4 pattern, the top-left corner of which is placed at (r, c). I now begin to map color codes to unique patterns. For example, a red '2' generates a Yellow Hollow Square, green '3' generates a blue diamond and grey '5' creates a magenta 2x2. The pixel at (5,5) seems to break the rule, producing nothing. The top-left corner placement seems to be consistent across examples, including the 10x10 ones. I note that even in those cases where '5' does produce an output, like (11,8), it's a 2x2.\n\n**Rule Refinement & \"Solo Pixel\" Filtering**\n\nI examine why (5,5) input generates no output: (5,5) is alone on its row. I test this \"solo pixel\" rule against other examples. I find that pixels that form a group, i.e. are not alone in a row, cause output. I refine my rules with the trigger colors {2,3,5,8} and add a filter that discards trigger pixels that are alone in their row.\n\n**Pattern Preservation & Output Construction: The \"Orange X\"**\n\nAnalyzing the test input, I observe that some pixels form recognizable 7-based orange 'X' patterns. This leads me to believe I need to incorporate existing patterns. Any existing \"7\" blocks are to be kept and not overwritten.\n\n**Final Rule Set & Code Generation**\n\nIn summary, the rule is to generate the appropriate 4x4 pattern for all input colors {2,3,5,8}, discarding those that have no other non-zero pixels in their respective rows, and adding the existing 7s to the output.\n\nApplying the rule to the test input: I generate the appropriate output Orange X shape for colors that have valid input points, following the color code's specific patterns. These outputs are created by copying an existing orange 7 pattern to create the output, ensuring a final 20x20 grid that represents the test answer.\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the rules inferred from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Rules:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**: The output grids are composed of $4 \\times 4$ patterns. The position of these patterns corresponds to the position of \"trigger\" pixels in the input grid. Specifically, a non-zero pixel at $(r, c)$ in the input triggers the drawing of a $4 \\times 4$ pattern with its top-left corner at $(r, c)$ in the output.\n\n2.  **Color Mapping**: Each input color maps to a specific output pattern and color scheme.\n    *   **Input 2 (Red)** $\\rightarrow$ **Output 4 (Yellow)**: A hollow $4 \\times 4$ square.\n        ```\n        4 4 4 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 4 4 4\n        ```\n    *   **Input 3 (Green)** $\\rightarrow$ **Output 1 (Blue)**: A diamond/circle shape.\n        ```\n        0 1 1 0\n        1 0 0 1\n        1 0 0 1\n        0 1 1 0\n        ```\n    *   **Input 5 (Grey)** $\\rightarrow$ **Output 6 (Magenta)**: Two diagonal $2 \\times 2$ blocks.\n        ```\n        6 6 0 0\n        6 6 0 0\n        0 0 6 6\n        0 0 6 6\n        ```\n    *   **Input 8 (Azure)** (From Test Input/Example 4) $\\rightarrow$ **Output 7 (Orange)**: An \"X\" or hourglass shape.\n        ```\n        7 0 0 7\n        0 7 7 0\n        0 7 7 0\n        7 0 0 7\n        ```\n\n3.  **Filtering/Noise**:\n    *   Pixels of colors not in the trigger list (like 6 in Example 1) are ignored (noise).\n    *   **Isolation Rule**: A trigger pixel is only valid if it is **not** the only non-zero pixel in its row. In Example 1 and 3, isolated pixels (5 at (5,5), 2 at (4,4)) produced no output. In the test input, all trigger rows contain multiple elements, satisfying this condition.\n\n4.  **Preservation**: If the input already contains a partial or complete pattern (like the Orange X formed by 7s in the test input), it is preserved or treated as a trigger for that pattern.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Row 1**: Contains 8s at indices 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. These are valid triggers. We draw the Orange X pattern at each location.\n*   **Row 5**: Contains 8s at 0, 16. It also contains 7s at cols 4-7 forming an Orange X. This counts as a valid pattern at index 4. Indices 8 and 12 are empty gaps.\n    *   Pattern sequence: Pattern, Pattern, Gap, Gap, Pattern.\n*   **Row 9**: Contains 8s at 0, 8, 16. Gaps at 4, 12.\n    *   Pattern sequence: Pattern, Gap, Pattern, Gap, Pattern.\n*   **Row 13**: Contains 8s at 0, 12, 16. Gaps at 4, 8.\n    *   Pattern sequence: Pattern, Gap, Gap, Pattern, Pattern.\n*   **Row 17**: Contains 8s at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. All filled.\n    *   Pattern sequence: Pattern, Pattern, Pattern, Pattern, Pattern.\n    *   Note: The pattern starts at row 17. It occupies rows 17, 18, 19, 20. Since the grid is $20 \\times 20$ (rows 0-19), the last row of the pattern is clipped.\n\n**Constructing the Output Grid:**\n\n*   **Row 0**: All 0s.\n*   **Rows 1-4**: Filled by patterns from Row 1 input.\n*   **Rows 5-8**: Filled by patterns/preservation from Row 5 input.\n*   **Rows 9-12**: Filled by patterns from Row 9 input.\n*   **Rows 13-16**: Filled by patterns from Row 13 input.\n*   **Rows 17-19**: Filled by patterns from Row 17 input (clipped).\n\n**Pattern Logic (P = Orange X, _ = Empty):**\nRow 1: P P P P P\nRow 5: P P _ _ P\nRow 9: P _ P _ P\nRow 13: P _ _ P P\nRow 17: P P P P P\n\noutput:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0",

Each marker color maps to a specific pattern:\n   - Color 2 \u2192 hollow square of 4s\n   - Color 3 \u2192 hollow square of 1s  \n   - Color 5 \u2192 diagonal 2x2 blocks of 6s\n   - Color 8 \u2192 diagonal corners pattern of 7s\n\n3. **Pattern placement**: At each marker position on the grid, the corresponding pattern is placed. Empty grid positions remain zeros.\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n- The template is the 7-pattern (diagonal corners) at rows 5-8, cols 4-7:\n  ```\n  7,0,0,7\n  0,7,7,0\n  0,7,7,0\n  7,0,0,7\n  ```\n- Markers (8s) form a 5\u00d75 grid at rows {1,5,9,13,17} and cols {0,4,8,12,16}\n- Pattern size is 4\u00d74\n\n**Grid positions with markers (8 \u2192 7 pattern):**\n- Row 1: all 5 columns have 8s\n- Row 5: cols 0, 4 (template), 16 have markers; cols 8, 12 are empty\n- Row 9: cols 0, 8, 16 have 8s; cols 4, 12 are empty\n- Row 13: cols 0, 12, 16 have 8s; cols 4, 8 are empty\n- Row 17: all 5 columns have 8s\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Understanding the rule from the examples**\n\n1. **All outputs are made of 4\u00d74 \u201ctiles\u201d.**  \n   In every example, non\u2011zero cells in the output always form one of a few fixed 4\u00d74 patterns.\n\n2. **There are four tile types (patterns) and each has a fixed color:**\n\n   - **Tile A (color 4):** a 4\u00d74 hollow square of 4s (border of 4s, interior 0).  \n   - **Tile B (color 6):** two filled 2\u00d72 blocks of 6s on the main diagonal:\n     ```\n     6 6 0 0\n     6 6 0 0\n     0 0 6 6\n     0 0 6 6\n     ```\n   - **Tile C (color 7):**\n     ```\n     7 0 0 7\n     0 7 7 0\n     0 7 7 0\n     7 0 0 7\n     ```\n   - **Tile D (color 1):** a ring of 1s with empty corners:\n     ```\n     0 1 1 0\n     1 0 0 1\n     1 0 0 1\n     0 1 1 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Markers vs. templates.**\n\n   - Small **single pixels** of certain colors act as **markers** telling where to place tiles.\n   - Larger connected components of the tile\u2011colors themselves (4,1,6,7) are just **templates/prototypes** and are not copied as such; they are effectively removed unless a tile is drawn over them.\n\n4. **Color pairing (marker \u2192 tile type / color).**\n\n   From all four training examples we can read off consistent pairings:\n\n   - Marker **2 \u2192 Tile A (color 4)**\n   - Marker **3 \u2192 Tile D (color 1)**\n   - Marker **5 \u2192 Tile B (color 6)**\n   - Marker **8 \u2192 Tile C (color 7)**\n\n   These mappings are global across the task.\n\n5. **Placement rule.**\n\n   - For every marker pixel of one of these colors, place the corresponding 4\u00d74 tile whose **top\u2011left cell is at the marker\u2019s coordinates**, **provided** the entire 4\u00d74 block fits inside the grid (row \u2264 H\u22123 and col \u2264 W\u22123).  \n   - Cells that are not covered by any tile become 0, except that if two tiles ever overlapped the later one would overwrite, but in the given grids the tiles never overlap.\n\n6. **Handling prototype shapes.**\n\n   In examples 1 and 3, large shapes made from colors 6 and 4 appear in the inputs but are gone (or overwritten) in the outputs where no tile is drawn. So any pre\u2011existing multi\u2011cell shapes of the tile colors are treated as prototypes only and are **erased** unless overwritten by a tile.\n\n---\n\n**Applying the rule to the test input**\n\n- The test grid has colors **8** and **7**.\n- According to the mapping, **8 is a marker** for **Tile C (color 7)**.\n- The 7s in the centre form exactly the Tile\u2011C 4\u00d74 pattern; they are a **prototype**, not markers, so they are erased unless a tile overlaps them. No 8 marker lies at their top\u2011left, so no tile overlaps them: the prototype disappears.\n\n1. **Find all 8 markers** and keep only those that can host a full 4\u00d74 tile:\n\n   Grid is 20\u00d720, so valid anchors have row \u2264 17 and col \u2264 17.\n\n   8s at:\n   - Row 2: (2,1), (2,5), (2,9), (2,13), (2,17)\n   - Row 6: (6,1), (6,17)\n   - Row 10: (10,1), (10,9), (10,17)\n   - Row 14: (14,1), (14,13), (14,17)\n   - Row 18: (18,1), (18,5), (18,9), (18,13), (18,17)\n\n   Anchors on row 18 are invalid (18+3 > 20), so they are ignored; their cells become 0.\n\n   Valid anchors (13 of them):\n   (2,1), (2,5), (2,9), (2,13), (2,17),\n   (6,1), (6,17),\n   (10,1), (10,9), (10,17),\n   (14,1), (14,13), (14,17).\n\n2. **Place Tile C (pattern of 7s) at each valid anchor.**\n\n   For each anchor (r,c), fill rows r..r+3, cols c..c+3 with:\n   ```\n   7 0 0 7\n   0 7 7 0\n   0 7 7 0\n   7 0 0 7\n   ```\n\n3. **Erase the prototype 7s** in the original central 4\u00d74 region (rows 6\u20139, cols 5\u20138) that are not covered by tiles; set them to 0.\n\nAfter doing this, the resulting grid is:\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Look at the training pairs.**\n\n   In every example the outputs are made of only four non\u2011black colors  \n   `{4,1,6,7}`, arranged in **4\u00d74 tiles**.\n\n   The four tile shapes (read from example 4) are:\n\n   - **Tile T\u2082 (blue, color 4)** \u2013 a hollow 4\u00d74 square:\n\n     ```\n     4 4 4 4\n     4 0 0 4\n     4 0 0 4\n     4 4 4 4\n     ```\n\n   - **Tile T\u2083 (pink, color 1)** \u2013 a ring without corners:\n\n     ```\n     0 1 1 0\n     1 0 0 1\n     1 0 0 1\n     0 1 1 0\n     ```\n\n   - **Tile T\u2085 (orange, color 6)** \u2013 two diagonal 2\u00d72 blocks:\n\n     ```\n     6 6 0 0\n     6 6 0 0\n     0 0 6 6\n     0 0 6 6\n     ```\n\n   - **Tile T\u2088 (yellow, color 7)** \u2013 a pattern of 7s:\n\n     ```\n     7 0 0 7\n     0 7 7 0\n     0 7 7 0\n     7 0 0 7\n     ```\n\n2. **Which inputs create which tiles?**\n\n   From example 4 (and confirmed by 1\u20133):\n\n   - Input color **2 \u2192 tile T\u2082 (4s)**.\n   - Input color **3 \u2192 tile T\u2083 (1s)**.\n   - Input color **5 \u2192 tile T\u2085 (6s)**.\n   - Input color **8 \u2192 tile T\u2088 (7s)**.\n\n   In each case, the colored input pixel is the **top\u2011left corner** of its\n   4\u00d74 tile in the output, and the original pixels of that color disappear.\n\n3. **Recognise a tile drawn directly in the input.**\n\n   In the **test input** there are many 8s arranged on a 4\u2011step grid, and\n   also a block of 7s in rows 6\u20139, columns 5\u20138:\n\n   ```\n   7 0 0 7\n   0 7 7 0\n   0 7 7 0\n   7 0 0 7\n   ```\n\n   This is exactly tile **T\u2088**, i.e. the 4\u00d74 tile that outputs from an 8.\n   So this 7\u2011block is just one already\u2011present tile; all the 8s must produce\n   the same 4\u00d74 pattern of 7s.\n\n4. **Apply the rule to the test input.**\n\n   - For **each 8** at position `(r,c)`, paint tile T\u2088 with its top\u2011left at\n     `(r,c)`.\n   - The 7\u2011block at `(6,5)` already matches T\u2088, so it can be left as is\n     (or equivalently, repainted with the same tile).\n   - Cells that were 8 become 7 (since T\u2088 has 7 in its top\u2011left).\n   - There are no 2,3,5 in the test, so no other tiles are created.\n   - Where a tile would extend below row 20 (the 8s in row 18), we simply\n     keep the part that fits inside the grid.\n\n   The 8s lie on a 4\u2011step grid at rows `2,6,10,14,18` and columns\n   `1,5,9,13,17`.  Overlaying tile T\u2088 at those positions (and at the\n   existing 7\u2011block at `(6,5)`) yields the final grid below.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\nRow by row:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7  \n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0  \n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0  \n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7  \n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7  \n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0  \n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0  \n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7  \n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7  \n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0  \n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0  \n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7  \n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7  \n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0  \n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0  \n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7  \n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7  \n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0  \n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "The four training pairs can be explained by a simple painting rule. Only input colours 2,\u202f3,\u202f5 and\u202f8 are \u201cactive\u201d. For each active pixel you try to stamp a 4\u00d74 motif into a fresh zero grid, anchored at the same row and column. The motif depends only on the input colour:\n- 2 \u2192 colour\u202f4, full 4\u00d74 hollow square (border all round),\n- 3 \u2192 colour\u202f1, hollow square with the four corners missing,\n- 5 \u2192 colour\u202f6, two 2\u00d72 blocks on the main diagonal of the 4\u00d74,\n- 8 \u2192 colour\u202f7, the four corners and the central 2\u00d72 of the 4\u00d74 filled.\nPixels of other colours are ignored. You process input pixels from bottom\u2011right to top\u2011left, stamping a motif only if the entire 4\u00d74 block lies inside the grid and none of its cells has already been painted; otherwise you skip it. The output grid is initially all zeros and is the same size as the input.\n\nIn the test grid only colour\u202f8 pixels are active, so we place the \u201ccorners plus centre\u201d pattern of colour\u202f7 at each 8 that fits; the bottom\u2011row 8\u2019s are skipped because the 4\u00d74 would run off the grid. This yields:\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "The transformation used in the examples is a local substitution on a regular grid of \\(4\\times 4\\) tiles: choose the row and column offsets so that as many non\u2011zero anchors lie on positions \\(r\\equiv r_0\\pmod 4\\), \\(c\\equiv c_0\\pmod 4\\), and only process anchors for which a full \\(4\\times 4\\) tile fits inside the grid. Each tile encodes one of four symbols. A symbol may appear either as a single coloured pixel at the tile\u2019s top\u2013left, or as a previously expanded \\(4\\times 4\\) pattern. Decoding is by pattern shape; encoding uses a fixed pattern for each symbol. In the training set the only symbols are 2,\u202f3,\u202f5 and\u202f8, mapping to output patterns of colours 4,\u202f1,\u202f6 and\u202f7 respectively. Symbol\u202f8 uses the \u201cD\u201d pattern with colour\u202f7:\n\n```\n7 0 0 7\n0 7 7 0\n0 7 7 0\n7 0 0 7\n```\n\nThe test input aligns on a grid with row offset\u202f1 and column offset\u202f0; all fitting anchors at rows\u202f1,\u202f5,\u202f9,\u202f13 and columns\u202f0,\u202f4,\u202f8,\u202f12,\u202f16 are either single 8s or an existing D\u2011pattern in colour\u202f7, all encoding symbol\u202f8. We ignore the bottom row of anchors at row\u202f17 because a \\(4\\times 4\\) tile would overrun the grid. For each symbol\u202f8 tile we write the D\u2011pattern of colour\u202f7 into the corresponding \\(4\\times 4\\) block; all other cells remain 0. The resulting output grid is:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**My Reasoning for Solving the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task, meaning I need to transform a 20x20 grid based on some provided examples and hints.  My process is as follows:\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** I need to take an input grid and produce an output grid. The transformation is based on patterns that I have to figure out from the examples and hints.  The grid is 20x20, which is useful to know.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Hints:** I read the hints carefully. I'm told about \"Glyph Expansion\" (a single pixel becomes a 3x3 pattern \u2013 wait, I'll need to verify that!), color mappings (red to yellow, green to blue, light blue to orange, grey to pink), object preservation, and the deletion of unrecognized pixels.\n\n3.  **Validate Hints with Examples:** This is where the real work begins. I analyze the provided examples to see how the hints play out.\n    *   **Example 1:** I check the input and the output.  Right away, I see that blocks of the same color in the input might be transformed into larger shapes in the output. I start by focusing on individual pixels (the \"glyph expansion\" mentioned).\n    *   **Example 2:** This smaller example helps.  I focus on coordinate mapping and what I see is that a single pixel expands into a 4x4 block, not a 3x3 block as the hint suggests. The shape is specific to the input color. For example, green becomes a blue diamond. I have to correct the hint.\n    *   **Hint Validation:** Example 2 helps me confirm my correction to the hint; the hint's \"centered\" description is best understood as the top-left corner of the pixel's expansion. I also look closely at *Preservation*: The example shows that an existing shape of all 1's is preserved in the output. Then, I notice that the hint says \"larger than a single pixel are preserved\".  This is important.  A group of 1s *is* preserved.\n    *   I keep checking Example 2 to figure out the 4x4 patterns for Red, Green, Grey, Light Blue.\n    *   Example 1, and Ex 4: I check how grey is transformed and how the light blue is converted.\n\n4.  **Define the Glyph Transformations:** Based on the examples, I can now define the actual transformations:\n    *   Red (2) turns into a 4x4 hollow Yellow square\n    *   Green (3) becomes a Blue 4x4 circle or diamond\n    *   Grey (5) maps to a Magenta 4x4 checkerboard\n    *   Light Blue (8) transforms to an Orange 4x4 symmetric cross (or hollow circle).\n\n5.  **Solve the Test Input:** I carefully look at the given input grid.  I spot the pixels that correspond to the glyph transformations (the \"8\"s). I identify a block of orange 7s that is a 2x2.\n    *   **Apply Color Mappings:** For the \"8\" pixels, I'll apply the light blue -> orange mapping and generate the Orange pattern.\n    *   **Preservation is Key:** The 2x2 block of 7s must be preserved because it is a pattern of valid output characters.\n    *   **Deletion:**  I double-check to make sure single pixels of 7 are deleted.\n    *   I work my way through the grid, creating the output.\n6.  **Construct Output:** I draft out the output grid, row by row and double-check to verify the pattern is copied correctly.\n\n7.  **Final Verification:** I re-read the rules, to make sure I don't miss anything. Then I triple-check the grid for completeness and accuracy to ensure my pattern is correct, the object is there and the single-pixel 7s are gone. Then, I am done.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a 20x20 grid based on learned patterns from examples.\n\n### **Analysis of the Task**\n\n1.  **Transformation Rule (Glyph Expansion):**\n    *   Single pixels in the input act as \"seeds\" that expand into specific $4 \\times 4$ patterns in the output.\n    *   The top-left corner of the $4 \\times 4$ output pattern corresponds to the location of the source pixel.\n    *   **Mappings derived from examples:**\n        *   **Red (2) $\\to$ Yellow (4):** A hollow square.\n            ```\n            4 4 4 4\n            4 0 0 4\n            4 0 0 4\n            4 4 4 4\n            ```\n        *   **Green (3) $\\to$ Blue (1):** A hollow diamond/circle.\n            ```\n            0 1 1 0\n            1 0 0 1\n            1 0 0 1\n            0 1 1 0\n            ```\n        *   **Grey (5) $\\to$ Pink (6):** A checkerboard of $2 \\times 2$ blocks.\n            ```\n            6 6 0 0\n            6 6 0 0\n            0 0 6 6\n            0 0 6 6\n            ```\n        *   **Light Blue (8) $\\to$ Orange (7):** An \"X\" shape or inverted hollow circle.\n            ```\n            7 0 0 7\n            0 7 7 0\n            0 7 7 0\n            7 0 0 7\n            ```\n\n2.  **Preservation Rule:**\n    *   Existing objects larger than a single pixel are preserved.\n    *   In the test input, there is a $2 \\times 2$ block of Orange (7) pixels at rows 6-7, columns 5-6. This object must be copied to the output.\n    *   Unrecognized single pixels (like the isolated 7s in the test input) are deleted (become 0).\n\n3.  **Application to Test Input:**\n    *   **Source Pixels:** The input contains Light Blue (8) pixels at regular intervals.\n        *   Row 1: Columns 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n        *   Row 5: Columns 0, 16. (The isolated 7s at cols 4, 7 are deleted).\n        *   Row 9: Columns 0, 8, 16.\n        *   Row 13: Columns 0, 12, 16.\n        *   Row 17: Columns 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n    *   **Preserved Object:** The $2 \\times 2$ block of 7s at `(6,5), (6,6), (7,5), (7,6)` is kept.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Construction**\n\n*   **Row 0:** No source pixels start at row 0 or row -1 etc. The first sources are at Row 1. **Result:** All 0s.\n*   **Rows 1-4:** Sources at (1,0), (1,4), (1,8), (1,12), (1,16). We place the `8`$\\to$`7` pattern side-by-side.\n    *   Pattern row 1: `7,0,0,7` repeated.\n    *   Pattern row 2: `0,7,7,0` repeated.\n    *   Pattern row 3: `0,7,7,0` repeated.\n    *   Pattern row 4: `7,0,0,7` repeated.\n*   **Rows 5-8:** Sources at (5,0) and (5,16). The middle area contains the preserved object.\n    *   Left (Cols 0-3): Pattern from source (5,0).\n    *   Right (Cols 16-19): Pattern from source (5,16).\n    *   Center (Cols 4-15):\n        *   Cols 5-6, Rows 6-7 contain the preserved 7s.\n        *   Rest are 0.\n*   **Rows 9-12:** Sources at (9,0), (9,8), (9,16).\n    *   Patterns at cols 0-3, 8-11, 16-19. Gaps at 4-7, 12-15.\n*   **Rows 13-16:** Sources at (13,0), (13,12), (13,16).\n    *   Patterns at cols 0-3, 12-15, 16-19. Gaps at 4-7, 8-11.\n*   **Rows 17-19:** Sources at (17,0), (17,4), (17,8), (17,12), (17,16).\n    *   Full row of patterns (Row 4 of the pattern is cut off by grid boundary).\n\n### **Final Output Grid Generation**\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**The Problem-Solving Process**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants me to tackle an ARC problem, and the goal is to transform a grid based on some examples. It's an ARC task, so it's about finding the underlying logic and generalizing it.\n\n1.  **Understanding the Request**: The core task is clear: I have input grids, and I need to transform them to get output grids. I've got examples, which are super important because they hold the clues to the transformation. I also have some hints, but I know better than to just blindly trust them. They're often slightly off, or they only hint at part of the process.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Data**: My first step is to analyze the data. I've got examples to examine, a key aspect of these problems. I've to decode the transformation rules and see how the inputs turn into the outputs. Dimensions are constant. This is good to know, and the hints \"Glyph Expansion\", \"Rigid color mapping\", and \"Existing objects preserved\" are like breadcrumbs. I am very much checking those hints, but I know there may be a lot of nuances in the details!\n\n3.  **Digging into the examples**: The specific hint says \"Single pixels are 3x3 pattern.\" Oh, but the given examples looks like 4x4 patterns! Maybe the hint is misleading, or it's a simplification, or I'm missing something. That's a classic ARC thing, I think. I'm going to look very closely at the pixel expansions and build my understanding. The sizes seem to be: `2 -> 4-ring pattern`, `3-> 1(octagon) pattern`, `5 -> 6 pattern` etc.\n\n    *   **The Grid Size:** The input and output grids are of the same size across all examples. This offers clarity.\n\n    *   **Pattern Mapping:** The pattern is very important here. For example, if I see input `3`, the pattern that matches it seems to be centered around it. I have to align indices to the pattern grid. My intuition tells me that the top-left coordinate, (r,c), where an input value exists corresponds to the location of the top-left coordinate of the 4x4 output block.\n\n    *   **Expansion:** Input `3` at (1,1) becomes the center of a block. Input `2` at (1,5) expands to a 4x4 block. Input color, locations and the output shapes, and the pixel values of shapes within output are all related, and that's the key.\n\n    *   **Mapping Rules:** I create mapping rules: Input `3` becomes 1 Octagon. Input `2` becomes a 4-ring. Input `5` becomes 6 pattern, etc.\n\n    *   **Overlapping and Objects:** The hint states that \"Existing objects ... are preserved.\" But, is it? Example 1 seems to imply that objects that are not \"valid shapes\" will be removed. Does that mean the input objects (blocks of colors) have to conform to a specific list of *patterns*, and *colors*? Example 2 has some patterns being overwritten. I'm building a clearer view of this.\n\n4.  **Verifying Assumptions**: In example 1, I find the 2x2 blocks of `6` (magenta). They just *disappear* in the output. The hint \"existing objects...\" also doesn't apply? Is 6 a dead color? The same thing happens with example 3: the 4x4 block of yellow is just gone. My theory is that, while blocks are \"existing\" they need to be of known pattern. Or it's a matter of the \"Expansion\" overwriting the old objects.\n\n    *   I've got the rules for the patterns down to sizes and coordinates. The hint says \"expansion is centered\", but really, it's about the top-left coordinate.\n\n5.  **Let's check the test input**: The test input has a pre-existing Orange block of 7s that will, I think, be preserved.\n\n    *   I see a 4x4 `7` pattern, and a grid of `8`'s.\n    *   This is an existing object. It won't be modified in the output.\n    *   I think I need to expand the `8`s to create the pattern, but not to overwrite the original block.\n\n6.  **Forming a construction rule**: So here's the construction plan for each element in the final output grid:\n\n    *   Initialize the output grid (20x20).\n    *   Copy \"Existing Objects.\"\n    *   Find the single pixels with known colors (`\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid based on rules inferred from examples. Here is the step-by-step logical derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Transformation:**\n    The task is a \"Glyph Expansion\". Single pixels in the input (\"seeds\") are replaced by $4 \\times 4$ patterns in the output. The top-left corner of the $4 \\times 4$ output pattern corresponds to the coordinates of the input seed pixel.\n\n2.  **Determine Color Mappings and Patterns:**\n    By observing the examples, we can map specific input colors to output patterns (size $4 \\times 4$):\n    *   **Red (2) $\\to$ Yellow (4) Ring:** (Example 1 & 3)\n        ```\n        4 4 4 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 4 4 4\n        ```\n    *   **Green (3) $\\to$ Blue (1) Octagon:** (Example 2)\n        ```\n        0 1 1 0\n        1 0 0 1\n        1 0 0 1\n        0 1 1 0\n        ```\n    *   **Grey (5) $\\to$ Magenta (6) Pattern:** (Example 1)\n        ```\n        6 6 0 0\n        6 6 0 0\n        0 0 6 6\n        0 0 6 6\n        ```\n    *   **Light Blue (8) $\\to$ Orange (7) Hourglass:** (Example 4)\n        ```\n        7 0 0 7\n        0 7 7 0\n        0 7 7 0\n        7 0 0 7\n        ```\n\n3.  **Handle Existing Objects and Deletions:**\n    *   **Existing Objects:** Any pre-existing patterns that match the output format are preserved. The prompt notes that objects larger than a single pixel are copied. In the Test Input, there is a pre-formed Orange (7) pattern at rows 5-8, columns 4-7. This matches the result of an expansion, so it stays.\n    *   **Deletions:** Unrecognized single pixels or areas without seeds/objects become empty (0).\n\n4.  **Apply to Test Input:**\n    *   **Input Analysis:** The input contains seeds of color **8** (Light Blue) and one existing **7** (Orange) object.\n    *   **Grid Layout:** The seeds are positioned at intervals. They appear at rows 1, 5, 9, 13, and 17. Horizontally, they are at columns 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16.\n    *   **Expansion:** We replace every `8` with the $4 \\times 4$ Orange `7` pattern. We leave empty spaces (0) where seeds are missing. The existing object at (Row 5, Col 4) is preserved (which looks identical to an expanded seed).\n    *   **Boundary:** The grid is $20 \\times 20$.\n        *   Row 0 is empty.\n        *   Rows 1-4 contain the first row of patterns.\n        *   Rows 5-8 contain the second row of patterns.\n        *   Rows 9-12 contain the third row of patterns.\n        *   Rows 13-16 contain the fourth row of patterns.\n        *   Rows 17-19 contain the fifth row of patterns, but since the pattern is 4 pixels high and the grid ends at row 19, the last row of the pattern is truncated.\n\n    **Row-by-Row Construction Plan:**\n    *   **Row 0:** All `0`.\n    *   **Rows 1-4:** Seeds are present at cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. Full row of 5 patterns.\n    *   **Rows 5-8:** Seeds at 0, 16. Existing object at 4. Missing seeds at 8, 12. Result: Pattern, Pattern, Empty, Empty, Pattern.\n    *   **Rows 9-12:** Seeds at 0, 8, 16. Missing at 4, 12. Result: Pattern, Empty, Pattern, Empty, Pattern.\n    *   **Rows 13-16:** Seeds at 0, 12, 16. Missing at 4, 8. Result: Pattern, Empty, Empty, Pattern, Pattern.\n    *   **Rows 17-19:** Seeds at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. Full row of patterns (truncated to height 3).\n\noutput:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0",

expansion in those areas.\n*   Unrecognized single pixels (colors not in the mapping) are deleted.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct

expansion in those areas.\n*   Unrecognized single pixels (colors not in the mapping) are deleted.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

expansion in those areas.\n*   Unrecognized single pixels (colors not in the mapping) are deleted.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Understanding the transformation**\n\nFrom the solved examples you can reconstruct the rules in terms of digits (colors):\n\n1. **Seed colors and their expansions**\n\n   Single pixels of four specific colors act as *seeds* and are replaced by a fixed \\(4\\times4\\) glyph, always anchored with the seed at the **top\u2011left** of the \\(4\\times4\\) pattern:\n\n   - `2 \u2192 4` : yellow square ring of 4\u2019s  \n     Pattern (4\u00d74):\n     ```\n     4 4 4 4\n     4 0 0 4\n     4 0 0 4\n     4 4 4 4\n     ```\n   - `3 \u2192 1` : blue \u201cdiamond-ring\u201d of 1\u2019s  \n     Pattern:\n     ```\n     0 1 1 0\n     1 0 0 1\n     1 0 0 1\n     0 1 1 0\n     ```\n   - `5 \u2192 6` : orange pattern of 6\u2019s (two 2\u00d72 blocks on the NW and SE corners)  \n     Pattern:\n     ```\n     6 6 0 0\n     6 6 0 0\n     0 0 6 6\n     0 0 6 6\n     ```\n   - `8 \u2192 7` : pink pattern of 7\u2019s  \n     Pattern:\n     ```\n     7 0 0 7\n     0 7 7 0\n     0 7 7 0\n     7 0 0 7\n     ```\n\n   These patterns are seen explicitly in the outputs and, in some examples, also as \u201ctemplate glyphs\u201d in the inputs.\n\n2. **Anchoring and cropping**\n\n   - In all examples, a seed at \\((r,c)\\) places the top\u2011left of its \\(4\\times4\\) glyph at \\((r,c)\\).\n   - If part of the \\(4\\times4\\) would go outside the grid, that part is simply **cropped** (e.g. the 3 at (10,10) in Example 2 produces no visible pixels because all non\u2011zero pattern cells fall outside the 10\u00d710 grid).\n\n3. **What happens to the original input objects?**\n\n   From Examples 1\u20133:\n\n   - The seed colors (`2,3,5,8`) **never appear in the output**.\n   - Larger pre\u2011existing glyphs made of target colors (like the 4\u2011ring in Example 3 or the 6\u2011blocks in Example 1) **disappear at their original locations**; they only reappear where produced by seeds.\n   - The output can therefore be modelled as:\n     - Start with an all\u2011zero grid.\n     - For each seed pixel of colors `{2,3,5,8}`, stamp the corresponding glyph on the output (cropping at the borders).\n     - Ignore all other input pixels.\n\n   This simple \u201cerase then expand from seeds\u201d procedure reproduces all the given examples.\n\n4. **Applying to the test input**\n\n   The test input uses only colors `0,7,8`. The only seed color present is **8**, so:\n\n   - All 8\u2019s will generate the pink 7\u2011glyph.\n   - The existing 7\u2011shaped pattern in the middle of the input is **ignored as an input object** (it is a leftover pink glyph with no grey seed at its top\u2011left, just like the unused 4\u2011ring in Example 3).\n\n   **Locations of 8 seeds** (1\u2011based row, column):\n\n   - Row 2:  (2,1), (2,5), (2,9), (2,13), (2,17)\n   - Row 6:  (6,1), (6,17)\n   - Row 10: (10,1), (10,9), (10,17)\n   - Row 14: (14,1), (14,13), (14,17)\n   - Row 18: (18,1), (18,5), (18,9), (18,13), (18,17)\n\n   For each such (r,c), we stamp:\n\n   ```\n   at (r+0,c+0) = 7, (r+0,c+3) = 7\n   at (r+1,c+1) = 7, (r+1,c+2) = 7\n   at (r+2,c+1) = 7, (r+2,c+2) = 7\n   at (r+3,c+0) = 7, (r+3,c+3) = 7\n   ```\n   where those coordinates lie inside the 20\u00d720 grid. For seeds on row 18, the row `r+3 = 21` lies outside, so the bottom row of the pattern is cropped.\n\n   Because all seeds are spaced at least 4 cells apart in both directions, their \\(4\\times4\\) patterns do not overlap; we simply OR them into the zero grid.\n\n---\n\n### Final output grid\n\nPutting all of these stamped glyphs together gives the following 20\u00d720 output:\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The task is a \"Glyph Expansion\" where single pixels bloom into $3\\times3$ patterns centered on the original location.\n*   There is a rigid color mapping: Red $\\to$ Yellow Ring, Green $\\to$ Blue Ring, Light Blue $\\to$ Orange Ring, Grey $\\to$ Pink Pattern.\n*   Existing objects larger than a single pixel are preserved (copied) and prevent expansion in those areas.\n*   Unrecognized single pixels (colors not in the mapping) are deleted.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "First I\u2019ll describe the general rule that matches the examples, then I\u2019ll show how it applies to the test grid step by step.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Inferred transformation from the examples\n\nFrom the four solved examples and the provided hints:\n\n### 1.1. Which colors \u201cexpand\u201d\n\nOnly **single** pixels of the following colors act as seeds that create patterns:\n\n- 2 (red) \u2192 produces a **yellow ring** made of color 4  \n- 3 (green) \u2192 produces a **blue ring** made of color 1  \n- 5 (grey) \u2192 produces a **pink pattern** made of color 6  \n- 8 (light blue / cyan) \u2192 produces an **orange ring** made of color 7  \n\nAll other colors (including 7 itself) are **not** expansion seeds.\n\nAdditionally:\n\n- Connectivity is **4-connected** (up, down, left, right).\n- A pixel is a \u201csingle\u201d seed only if it is alone in its 4-connected component.\n- Multi-pixel (4-connected) objects of any color are just \u201cobjects\u201d, not seeds.\n\n### 1.2. What pattern each seed produces\n\nFrom Example 4 you can read off the exact 4\u00d74 glyphs placed by the seeds:\n\n1. **Seed color 2 \u2192 4\u00d74 yellow ring (color 4)**  \n\n   Placed with the seed at the **top-left corner** of the 4\u00d74 block:\n\n   ```\n   r0: 4 4 4 4\n   r1: 4 0 0 4\n   r2: 4 0 0 4\n   r3: 4 4 4 4\n   ```\n\n2. **Seed color 3 \u2192 4\u00d74 blue ring (color 1)**  \n\n   Again, seed is the top-left of the 4\u00d74 block:\n\n   ```\n   r0: 0 1 1 0\n   r1: 1 0 0 1\n   r2: 1 0 0 1\n   r3: 0 1 1 0\n   ```\n\n3. **Seed color 5 \u2192 4\u00d74 pink pattern (color 6)**  \n\n   A diagonal pair of 2\u00d72 squares of 6:\n\n   ```\n   r0: 6 6 0 0\n   r1: 6 6 0 0\n   r2: 0 0 6 6\n   r3: 0 0 6 6\n   ```\n\n4. **Seed color 8 \u2192 4\u00d74 orange \u201cring\u201d (color 7)**  \n\n   In Example 4, every 8 spawns this pattern of 7\u2019s, with the 8 at the **top-left corner**:\n\n   ```\n   r0: 7 0 0 7\n   r1: 0 7 7 0\n   r2: 0 7 7 0\n   r3: 7 0 0 7\n   ```\n\nSo for a seed at `(r,c)` of color 8, 7\u2019s appear at offsets:\n\n- (0,0), (0,3)\n- (1,1), (1,2)\n- (2,1), (2,2)\n- (3,0), (3,3)\n\nrelative to `(r,c)`.\n\n### 1.3. Boundaries\n\nFrom Example 2, the bottom-right green seed at (9,9) (0-based) does **not** create a ring, because a full 4\u00d74 pattern would go out of bounds. So the rule is:\n\n- Only seeds with `r \u2264 H\u22124` and `c \u2264 W\u22124` (so that `[r..r+3]\u00d7[c..c+3]` fits in the grid) expand.\n- Seeds too close to the bottom or right edge are ignored (deleted).\n\n### 1.4. Treatment of other pixels\n\n- **Unrecognized single pixels** (colors other than 2,3,5,8 that are 4-connected singletons) are removed unless they get overwritten by some pattern.\n- **Multi-pixel objects** (4-connected size > 1) are preserved in place. They are *not* seed pixels and do not expand. When patterns are drawn, we simply paint 7\u2019s on top; we never explicitly write 0\u2019s, so existing non-zero pixels are never erased by patterns.\n\nThis is consistent with Example 2: the scattered 1\u2019s are all 4-connected singletons and are removed; the only 1\u2019s left in the output come from the blue-ring patterns.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying the rule to the test input\n\n### 2.1. Identify seeds and objects\n\nThe test input (20\u00d720) has non-zero colors 8 and 7.\n\nCoordinates are 0-based (row, column):\n\n- **8\u2019s**:\n\n  - Row 1: (1,0), (1,4), (1,8), (1,12), (1,16)\n  - Row 5: (5,0), (5,16)\n  - Row 9: (9,0), (9,8), (9,16)\n  - Row 13: (13,0), (13,12), (13,16)\n  - Row 17: (17,0), (17,4), (17,8), (17,12), (17,16)\n\n  All these 8\u2019s are **single pixels** (no 4-connected neighbors of 8), so they are potential seeds.\n\n- **7\u2019s**:\n\n  - Single 7\u2019s: (5,4), (5,7), (8,4), (8,7)\n  - A 2\u00d72 block of 7\u2019s: (6,5), (6,6), (7,5), (7,6)\n\n  Using 4-connectivity, the four pixels at (6,5),(6,6),(7,5),(7,6) form a **single multi-pixel object** of color 7.  \n  The single 7\u2019s at (5,4),(5,7),(8,4),(8,7) are **unrecognized singletons**, so they will be deleted unless a pattern happens to paint 7 over them.\n\nThere are no seeds of colors 2,3, or 5 in this test; only color 8 seeds are relevant.\n\n### 2.2. Which 8\u2019s expand?\n\nGrid size is 20\u00d720, indices 0..19.\n\nFor a seed at `(r,c)` we need `r+3 \u2264 19` and `c+3 \u2264 19`.\n\n- All 8\u2019s at rows 1, 5, 9, 13 satisfy `r \u2264 16`.\n- 8\u2019s at row 17 have `r = 17`, so `r+3 = 20 > 19` \u2192 their 4\u00d74 pattern would go off the bottom of the grid, so **they do not expand** and are removed.\n- All columns used for 8\u2019s are 0,4,8,12,16; all have `c+3 \u2264 19`, so column-wise they are fine.\n\nSo the **expanding seeds** are:\n\n- Row 1: (1,0), (1,4), (1,8), (1,12), (1,16)\n- Row 5: (5,0), (5,16)\n- Row 9: (9,0), (9,8), (9,16)\n- Row 13: (13,0), (13,12), (13,16)\n\nA total of 13 seeds.\n\nThe 8\u2019s on row 17 are treated as unrecognized singletons and disappear.\n\n### 2.3. Preserve the multi-pixel object\n\nWe copy the 2\u00d72 block of 7\u2019s at:\n\n- (6,5), (6,6), (7,5), (7,6)\n\ninto the output as-is.\n\nBecause our patterns only place 7\u2019s and do not write zeros, even if a pattern overlaps these cells it would still leave them as 7, so no conflict.\n\nThe four single 7\u2019s at (5,4),(5,7),(8,4),(8,7) are **not** copied (they\u2019re unrecognized singletons).\n\n### 2.4. Draw the orange glyph for each 8\n\nFor each seed of color 8 at `(r,c)` we place 7\u2019s at:\n\n- (r+0,c+0), (r+0,c+3)\n- (r+1,c+1), (r+1,c+2)\n- (r+2,c+1), (r+2,c+2)\n- (r+3,c+0), (r+3,c+3)\n\nWe do this for all 13 seeds and take the union of all 7\u2019s plus the preserved 2\u00d72 block.\n\nLet\u2019s compute row by row.\n\n#### Rows 0 and 19, 18, 17\n\nNo patterns cover row 0, 17, 18, or 19 (since the lowest row index used by patterns is 1 and the highest is 16). So:\n\n- Row 0: all 0\n- Row 17: all 0\n- Row 18: all 0\n- Row 19: all 0\n\n#### Rows 1\u20134 (top band, 5 seeds across)\n\nSeeds at row 1: (1,0),(1,4),(1,8),(1,12),(1,16). Their 4\u00d74 blocks tile columns [0..3], [4..7], [8..11], [12..15], [16..19].\n\nUsing the base 4\u00d74 orange pattern:\n\n- Relative row 0 \u2192 absolute row 1:\n  - Pattern row: [7,0,0,7]\n  - Repeated across:  \n    \u2192 Row 1:  \n\n    `7,0,0,7, 7,0,0,7, 7,0,0,7, 7,0,0,7, 7,0,0,7`\n\n- Relative row 1 \u2192 absolute row 2:\n  - Pattern row: [0,7,7,0]\n  - Across 5 tiles:  \n    \u2192 Row 2:\n\n    `0,7,7,0, 0,7,7,0, 0,7,7,0, 0,7,7,0, 0,7,7,0`\n\n- Relative row 2 \u2192 absolute row 3: identical to row 2.\n\n- Relative row 3 \u2192 absolute row 4: identical to row 1.\n\nSo:\n\nRow 1: `7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7`  \nRow 2: `0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0`  \nRow 3: same as row 2  \nRow 4: same as row 1  \n\n#### Rows 5\u20138 (left & right seeds plus the 2\u00d72 block)\n\nSeeds at row 5: (5,0) and (5,16):\n\n- (5,0) affects rows 5\u20138, cols 0\u20133\n- (5,16) affects rows 5\u20138, cols 16\u201319\n\nFrom the pattern:\n\n- Row 5 (relative row 0 of these patterns):\n\n  - (5,0) \u2192 7 at (5,0) and (5,3)\n  - (5,16) \u2192 7 at (5,16) and (5,19)\n\n  So row 5: 7\u2019s at columns 0,3,16,19.\n\n- Row 6 (relative row 1):\n\n  - (5,0) \u2192 7 at (6,1),(6,2)\n  - (5,16) \u2192 7 at (6,17),(6,18)\n  - plus preserved block at (6,5),(6,6)\n\n  So row 6: 7 at columns 1,2,5,6,17,18.\n\n- Row 7 (relative row 2):\n\n  - (5,0) \u2192 7 at (7,1),(7,2)\n  - (5,16) \u2192 7 at (7,17),(7,18)\n  - plus preserved block at (7,5),(7,6)\n\n  So row 7: 7 at columns 1,2,5,6,17,18.\n\n- Row 8 (relative row 3):\n\n  - (5,0) \u2192 7 at (8,0),(8,3)\n  - (5,16) \u2192 7 at (8,16),(8,19)\n\n  So row 8: 7 at columns 0,3,16,19.\n\nThus:\n\nRow 5: `7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7`  \nRow 6: `0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0`  \nRow 7: `0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0`  \nRow 8: `7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7`  \n\n(You can see the preserved 2\u00d72 block in rows 6 and 7, columns 5\u20136.)\n\n#### Rows 9\u201312 (middle band: 3 seeds at columns 0,8,16)\n\nSeeds at row 9: (9,0), (9,8), (9,16).\n\n- Row 9 (relative row 0):\n\n  - 7 at (9,0),(9,3) from (9,0)\n  - 7 at (9,8),(9,11) from (9,8)\n  - 7 at (9,16),(9,19) from (9,16)\n\n  Row 9: columns 0,3,8,11,16,19.\n\n- Row 10 (relative row 1):\n\n  - (9,0) \u2192 7 at (10,1),(10,2)\n  - (9,8) \u2192 7 at (10,9),(10,10)\n  - (9,16) \u2192 7 at (10,17),(10,18)\n\n- Row 11 (relative row 2): same set as row 10.\n\n- Row 12 (relative row 3):\n\n  - (9,0) \u2192 7 at (12,0),(12,3)\n  - (9,8) \u2192 7 at (12,8),(12,11)\n  - (9,16) \u2192 7 at (12,16),(12,19)\n\nThus:\n\nRow 9:  `7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7`  \nRow 10: `0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0`  \nRow 11: same as row 10  \nRow 12: `7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7`  \n\n#### Rows 13\u201316 (lower band: 3 seeds at row 13)\n\nSeeds at row 13: (13,0),(13,12),(13,16).\n\n- Row 13 (relative row 0):\n\n  - (13,0) \u2192 7 at (13,0),(13,3)\n  - (13,12) \u2192 7 at (13,12),(13,15)\n  - (13,16) \u2192 7 at (13,16),(13,19)\n\n  \u2192 row 13: columns 0,3,12,15,16,19.\n\n- Row 14 (relative row 1):\n\n  - (13,0) \u2192 7 at (14,1),(14,2)\n  - (13,12) \u2192 7 at (14,13),(14,14)\n  - (13,16) \u2192 7 at (14,17),(14,18)\n\n- Row 15 (relative row 2): same as row 14.\n\n- Row 16 (relative row 3):\n\n  - (13,0) \u2192 7 at (16,0),(16,3)\n  - (13,12) \u2192 7 at (16,12),(16,15)\n  - (13,16) \u2192 7 at (16,16),(16,19)\n\nThus:\n\nRow 13: `7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7`  \nRow 14: `0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,7,7,0,0`  \nRow 15: same as row 14  \nRow 16: `7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7`  \n\nAgain, note that the seeds on row 17 do not expand at all, so rows 17\u201319 contain no 7\u2019s.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The task is a \"Glyph Expansion\" where single pixels bloom into $3\\times3$ patterns centered on the original location.\n*   There is a rigid color mapping: Red $\\to$ Yellow Ring, Green $\\to$ Blue Ring, Light Blue $\\to$ Orange Ring, Grey $\\to$ Pink Pattern.\n*   Existing objects larger than a single pixel are preserved (copied) and prevent expansion in those areas.\n*   Unrecognized single pixels (colors not in the mapping) are deleted.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "To solve this puzzle, I first looked at the four provided examples to spot a consistent rule. Every non\u2011zero pixel in the input that is an isolated singleton of a \u201cglyph\u201d colour is replaced by a fixed \\(4\\times 4\\) motif anchored with its top\u2011left corner at the original pixel location; all other input cells are ignored. The glyph colours and their output motifs are:\n\n- 2 (red) \u2192 colour\u202f4 motif: a full border ring `[[4,4,4,4],[4,0,0,4],[4,0,0,4],[4,4,4,4]]`\n- 3 (green) \u2192 colour\u202f1 motif: `[[0,1,1,0],[1,0,0,1],[1,0,0,1],[0,1,1,0]]`\n- 5 (grey) \u2192 colour\u202f6 motif: `[[6,6,0,0],[6,6,0,0],[0,0,6,6],[0,0,6,6]]`\n- 8 (light blue) \u2192 colour\u202f7 motif: `[[7,0,0,7],[0,7,7,0],[0,7,7,0],[7,0,0,7]]`\n\nOnly single\u2011pixel components of these colours are expanded; other colours and larger components are dropped. Patterns are clipped at the grid boundary, and because the seeds in the test are spaced by 4 both horizontally and vertically, none of the motifs overlap.\n\nIn the test input, the only glyph colour present is 8. Each 8 is isolated, so I placed the orange (7) motif at each of their coordinates, truncating the bottom row for motifs starting at row\u202f17. All other cells remain 0. The resulting 20\u00d720 output grid is:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0",

expansion in those areas.\n*   Unrecognized single pixels (colors not in the mapping) are deleted.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "To solve this task, first identify the \u201cseed\u201d pixels: isolated single pixels of the recognised input colours 2 (red), 3 (green), 5 (grey) and 8 (light blue). Every other input pixel is ignored. Each seed stamps a fixed 4\u00d74 pattern of an output colour with its top\u2011left corner at the seed\u2019s position.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Analysis and Rule Discovery for ARC-AGI Task**\n\nOkay, so here's my thought process. The objective is clear: analyze these image pairs and distill the underlying logic. Let's break it down methodically.\n\nFirst, a deep dive into the visual structure. I'm seeing sparse input grids transforming into denser outputs. Specific colors in the input seem to be \"seeds\" that drive the output. For example, red pixels become yellow hollow squares, green pixels turn into blue hollow squares. Crucially, the outputs appear to be a 3x3 expansion centered on the original pixel location.\n\nThe critical insight here is the color-to-pattern mapping. It's not a simple one-to-one correspondence but a transformation rule linked to color. This \"Rosetta Stone\" (Input 4) is invaluable; I'm using it to decode the color-to-pattern pairs. Red maps to a yellow hollow square, green to a blue hollow square, and light blue to an orange hollow square. The grey is the trickier one; it's definitely not a hollow square. Re-evaluating, the grey pixels translate to a distinct pink \"5-point\" shape (four corners and the center are pink).\n\nI'm also noting that pre-existing structures (like the yellow square or the blue ring) are preserved, acting as background elements. This highlights that the transformation acts primarily on single pixels, leaving existing, complex objects untouched. These are \"fixed\". Single pixels that are *not* recognized are deleted.\n\nThis is a critical observation, confirmed by the Pink pixels in Input 1. Their corresponding area is empty in the output. This signals either noise filtering or a more complex \"dictionary\" where certain colors are irrelevant. So far, the established rule is specific to the colors: Red, Green, Grey, Light Blue. Pink pixels are treated as noise/irrelevant/deleted.\n\nPutting it all together, the transformation rule is clear: *Single pixels of specific colors are expanded into predefined 3x3 patterns (Hollow squares for some, a distinct shape for others). Existing larger objects are preserved. Pink pixels, so far, are removed.*\n\nI'm imagining this as a \"seed expansion\" process. Each valid colored pixel acts as a seed, triggering the generation of a 3x3 pattern in a corresponding color.\n\nBefore moving on, I need to validate this thoroughly. I'm going to look at the exact shapes of these, to check if the rule always overwrites. This involves checking the edge case (what if it appears at the border?) and the overlap situation. Input 4's regular spacing suggests they will not overlap or are designed so that the pattern is preserved without altering it.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided image containing four input-output pairs, here is the breakdown:\n\n### **1. Describe the observable structures**\n\n*   **Inputs:**\n    *   The inputs are black grids containing mostly single isolated pixels of various colors (Red, Green, Grey, Light Blue, Pink).\n    *   Some inputs (Input 2, Input 3) contain larger pre-existing structures: a Blue hollow square ($3\\times3$) and a large Yellow hollow square ($5\\times5$ or similar).\n    *   Input 4 shows a dense, regular grid of single pixels spaced evenly (every 3rd unit).\n*   **Outputs:**\n    *   The single pixels from the input are replaced by $3\\times3$ patterned blocks centered on the original pixel's location.\n    *   The larger pre-existing structures (the Blue ring in Input 2, the Yellow frame in Input 3) appear unchanged in the output.\n    *   In Input 1, the top-left Pink pixels do not appear to have a corresponding structure in the output (that region is black).\n    *   The background remains black.\n\n### **2. Identify transformation categories**\n\n*   **Object movement**: Absent.\n*   **Object recoloring**: Present (Single pixels change color when expanded).\n*   **Bordering / outlining**: Maybe (The resulting shapes are often outlines/rings).\n*   **Filling holes or cavities**: Absent.\n*   **Removing noise / extracting main shape**: Present (The pink pixels in Input 1 seem to be removed).\n*   **Copying / pasting / repositioning**: Absent (Expansion is in-place).\n*   **Using a key anchor location**: Present (The input pixel acts as the center anchor).\n*   **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors**: Absent.\n*   **Size-based filtering or selection**: Present (Single pixels are transformed; larger objects are preserved).\n*   **Symmetry or reflection operations**: Absent.\n*   **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion**: Present (Dilation/Expansion of pixels into $3\\times3$ icons).\n*   **Cluster $\\to$ icon or icon $\\to$ cluster mapping**: Present (Pixel $\\to$ Icon).\n\n### **3. Extract the key non-obvious insights**\n\n*   **Pixel-to-Pattern Expansion:** The transformation maps single \"seed\" pixels to specific $3\\times3$ patterns. The input pixel coordinate becomes the center of the output pattern.\n*   **Specific Color Dictionary:** There is a fixed mapping of Input Color $\\to$ Output Pattern/Color:\n    *   **Red Input** $\\to$ **Yellow Hollow Square** ($3\\times3$).\n    *   **Green Input** $\\to$ **Blue Hollow Square** ($3\\times3$).\n    *   **Light Blue Input** $\\to$ **Orange Hollow Square** ($3\\times3$).\n    *   **Grey Input** $\\to$ **Pink Pattern** (Distinct from the squares, possibly a 5-point \"X\" or checkerboard shape).\n*   **Preservation of Complex Objects:** If an object in the input is already a formed structure (like the Blue ring in Input 2 or the big Yellow square in Input 3), it is preserved exactly as is. The rule only affects single, isolated pixels.\n*   **Selective Filtering:** Not all single pixels are valid seeds. The Pink pixels in the top-left of Input 1 appear to be deleted/ignored, as they do not generate a corresponding pattern in Output 1.\n*   **Grid Consistency:** The grid size does not change. The spacing in Input 4 (pixels every 3 units) perfectly accommodates the $3\\times3$ output blocks without overlap, creating a tiling effect.\n\n### **4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)**\n\nThe transformation scans the grid for **isolated single pixels** and **pre-existing structures**.\n1.  Any **multi-pixel structure** (loops, large frames) is treated as part of the background and is **copied to the output unchanged**.\n2.  Any **isolated single pixel** is checked against a color lookup table. If the color exists in the table (Red, Green, Grey, Light Blue), the pixel is **replaced by a specific $3\\times3$ icon** centered on the original pixel's location. The icon has a new specific color and shape (usually a hollow ring).\n3.  Isolated pixels with colors *not* in the lookup table (e.g., Pink in Input 1) are treated as noise and **removed** (replaced with black).\n\n### **5. List checks you would perform when solving**\n\n*   **Dictionary Validation:** Create a map of `{InputColor: OutputPattern}` and verify it is consistent across all four examples.\n*   **Center Alignment Check:** Verify mathematically that for every generated $3\\times3$ block, the center coordinate $(r, c)$ corresponds exactly to a pixel at $(r, c)$ in the input.\n*   **Overlap Handling:** Determine what happens if two seed pixels are closer than 3 units. (The examples don't show this, but one would need to decide if they overwrite or merge).\n*   **Structure Detection:** Algorithmically distinguish between \"single pixel\" and \"structure\". Is it just `count == 1`? Or `bounding_box_size == 1x1`?\n*   **Noise Identification:** Confirm that the Pink pixels in Input 1 are indeed removed and not shifted or transformed into black-on-black patterns.\n\n### **6. Summarize final insights**\n\nHINT_START\n*   The task is a \"Glyph Expansion\" where single pixels bloom into $3\\times3$ patterns centered on the original location.\n*   There is a rigid color mapping: Red $\\to$ Yellow Ring, Green $\\to$ Blue Ring, Light Blue $\\to$ Orange Ring, Grey $\\to$ Pink Pattern.\n*   Existing objects larger than a single pixel are preserved (copied) and prevent expansion in those areas.\n*   Unrecognized single pixels (colors not in the mapping) are deleted.\nHINT_END",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nObject Types Found in Grids **\n\nOkay, let's break down these grids. We're looking at two main object categories: 4x4 patterned shapes and individual pixel markers.  The background is consistently color 0.\n\nThe 4x4 shapes come in a few distinct types:\n\n*   **Box:**  Color 4, a hollow square frame: `4,4,4,4 / 4,0,0,4 / 4,0,0,4 / 4,4,4,4`.\n*   **Diamond/Octagon:** Color 1.  Looks like this: `0,1,1,0 / 1,0,0,1 / 1,0,0,1 / 0,1,1,0`.\n*   **X-shape:** Color 7.  The pattern is `7,0,0,7 / 0,7,7,0 / 0,7,7,0 / 7,0,0,7`.\n*   **Checkerboard Block:** Color 6.  Made up of 2x2 blocks of 6 and 0 in a diagonal pattern within the 4x4 space:  `6,6,0,0 / 6,6,0,0 / 0,0,6,6 / 0,0,6,6`.\n\nThen we have the single-pixel markers, which are just isolated pixels of color: 2, 3, 5, and 8.  They don't form any structure themselves, just appear scattered on the background.\n**\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nThe transformation replaces pixels with specific patterns. Single pixels, representing markers, generate 4x4 patterns on the output grid. The marker color determines the resulting pattern, and the marker's position determines the pattern's location (top-left). Markers 2, 3, 5, and 8 map to 4 (Box), 1 (Diamond), 6 (Checkerboard), and 7 (X-shape) respectively. Any existing non-marker shapes on the grid are cleared/removed.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, here's the breakdown of my thought process for tackling this ARC task.  It's all about pattern recognition and applying the provided rules!**\n\nFirst things first: I'm given an input grid of numbers (0-9) and I need to produce an output grid with a similar format. The key is to figure out the transformation.  I'm also told to infer the logic from a set of solved examples.  I need to use this information to determine how input grid values are mapped to output shapes.\n\nMy initial thought is to figure out the connection between the input grids and their descriptions.  The problem description gives me a mapping: `2->4`, `3->1`, `5->6`, `8->7`. So I know the value `2` should correspond to a shape with color `4` in the output, `3` corresponds to `1`, `5` maps to `6` and `8` to `7`. This seems important so I keep it in mind.\n\nI started examining **Example 1**: I'm hunting for patterns, trying to verify the initial mapping. I carefully look at the input and output grids, looking at the location of specific input values and the corresponding shapes in the output. I also made sure to confirm the grid sizes.  I realize that input values '2', '3', '5', '8' create shapes in the output.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing Example 1, I find out that the output shapes come from the *markers* which are values \"2\", \"3\", \"5\", \"8\"  In other words, the location of '2' gives the location of a 4x4 shape. I also notice existing input shapes (blocks of 6 in this example) completely disappear in the output.\n\nI confirm the initial assumption the description gives the correct mapping: `2->4`, `3->1`, `5->6`, `8->7` based on the coordinates. Example 1 also has a marker at (5,5). However, no shape is there!\n\nSo, I study **Example 2**: I look at where the values 2, 3, 5, or 8 are. The provided description says \"Any existing non-marker shapes on the grid are cleared/removed.\"  I see that values '1' form a shape. They disappear! I also see that existing shapes are removed in Example 2.\n\nI carefully examine the coordinates of these markers and corresponding shape color. I'm focusing to confirm my understanding of that transformation:\n*   Find markers: '2', '3', '5', '8'.\n*   The pixel becomes the upper-left corner of a 4x4 shape.\n\nDuring Example 2, I notice the location of an existing diamond shape made of '1's. When the markers are placed, the output has a shape made of '1's as the same color. It seems the pre-existing shapes are ignored or removed and only shapes based on input markers are present.\n\nNow for **Example 3**: I pay special attention to overlaps here, given the description. Example 3 has many '2' markers, all giving shapes. I also confirm the output here. However, I notice that one marker did not produce a shape, even though the description says markers produce a shape.\n\nI realize that shapes overlap in Example 3. I hypothesize the reason for this missing shape is the overlap: maybe there's a priority order when shapes overlap in the output grid (I'm leaning towards 'later one wins'). However, I don't know the full rule. I focus to find the rule behind this conflict.  I know that one shape is completely gone.\n\nI then study **Example 4**:  I carefully notice the input and the output.  It appears to be a much easier example.  All shapes are non-overlapping here.  I can verify here, all mappings appear correct in this example.  This reinforces my previous thinking: the conflict-free construction means all shapes are there. It looks like my assumption about overlaps is correct here.\n\nI go back to Example 3's issue.  The rule must be related to how to deal with conflicts and how the order of shapes matters.  I hypothesize:  If shape A and shape B overlap and shape B is 'later' in a specific sense (e.g. at the bottom-right of the overlapping area), B \"wins\" and overwrites A or cancels it out entirely.  I confirm it: it seems \"later one wins\", meaning, right and bottom coordinates have preference.\n\nNow, with this understanding, I can finally attack the main task!  I know the mapping from values to shape colors, the size of shapes and how to resolve overlaps (the \"later shape wins\" rule). I start from the new 20x20 grid now\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples and the object descriptions provided:\n\n1.  **Identify Transformation Rules**:\n    *   **Markers**: The input contains single pixels (values 2, 3, 5, 8) that act as \"markers\".\n    *   **Mapping**: Each marker value corresponds to a specific 4x4 pattern:\n        *   `2` $\\rightarrow$ Box (Color 4)\n        *   `3` $\\rightarrow$ Diamond (Color 1)\n        *   `5` $\\rightarrow$ Checkerboard (Color 6)\n        *   `8` $\\rightarrow$ X-shape (Color 7)\n    *   **Placement**: The marker's position $(r, c)$ becomes the top-left corner of the 4x4 pattern in the output.\n    *   **Cleanup**: Any non-marker non-zero pixels in the input (like the '7's forming a shape in the test input) are treated as background noise or existing shapes to be removed. The background is initialized to 0.\n    *   **Overlap/Clipping**: Based on the examples, patterns define the output. If a pattern extends beyond the grid boundaries (as seen in the analysis of the test input size), it is clipped.\n\n2.  **Analyze Test Input**:\n    *   **Grid Size**: 20x20.\n    *   **Markers Found**: The input contains markers with value `8`.\n        *   **Row 1** (Index 1): Cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n        *   **Row 5** (Index 5): Cols 0, 16. (Note: The shape made of 7s at (5,4) is ignored).\n        *   **Row 9** (Index 9): Cols 0, 8, 16.\n        *   **Row 13** (Index 13): Cols 0, 12, 16.\n        *   **Row 17** (Index 17): Cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n    *   **Pattern**: All markers are `8`, which maps to the **X-shape** (Color 7).\n        *   Row 0: `7, 0, 0, 7`\n        *   Row 1: `0, 7, 7, 0`\n        *   Row 2: `0, 7, 7, 0`\n        *   Row 3: `7, 0, 0, 7`\n\n3.  **Construct Output**:\n    *   **Row 0**: Empty (0s).\n    *   **Rows 1-4**: Markers at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 generate a full row of 5 X-shapes.\n    *   **Rows 5-8**: Markers at 0, 16 generate X-shapes at the far left and right. The center is empty.\n    *   **Rows 9-12**: Markers at 0, 8, 16 generate X-shapes at Left, Middle, Right.\n    *   **Rows 13-16**: Markers at 0, 12, 16 generate X-shapes at Left, and two on the Right side.\n    *   **Rows 17-19**: Markers at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 start a full row of X-shapes. However, since the grid ends at Row 19, only the first 3 rows of the pattern (Rows 17, 18, 19) are rendered. The 4th row of the pattern is clipped.\n\noutput:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nObject Types Found in Grids **\n\nOkay, let's break down these grids. We're looking at two main object categories: 4x4 patterned shapes and individual pixel markers.  The background is consistently color 0.\n\nThe 4x4 shapes come in a few distinct types:\n\n*   **Box:**  Color 4, a hollow square frame: `4,4,4,4 / 4,0,0,4 / 4,0,0,4 / 4,4,4,4`.\n*   **Diamond/Octagon:** Color 1.  Looks like this: `0,1,1,0 / 1,0,0,1 / 1,0,0,1 / 0,1,1,0`.\n*   **X-shape:** Color 7.  The pattern is `7,0,0,7 / 0,7,7,0 / 0,7,7,0 / 7,0,0,7`.\n*   **Checkerboard Block:** Color 6.  Made up of 2x2 blocks of 6 and 0 in a diagonal pattern within the 4x4 space:  `6,6,0,0 / 6,6,0,0 / 0,0,6,6 / 0,0,6,6`.\n\nThen we have the single-pixel markers, which are just isolated pixels of color: 2, 3, 5, and 8.  They don't form any structure themselves, just appear scattered on the background.\n**\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nThe transformation replaces pixels with specific patterns. Single pixels, representing markers, generate 4x4 patterns on the output grid. The marker color determines the resulting pattern, and the marker's position determines the pattern's location (top-left). Markers 2, 3, 5, and 8 map to 4 (Box), 1 (Diamond), 6 (Checkerboard), and 7 (X-shape) respectively. Any existing non-marker shapes on the grid are cleared/removed.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand how single-pixel markers transform into 4x4 patterns.\n\n## Analysis\n\nFrom the examples, I can see that:\n1. Markers (single pixels of colors 2, 3, 5, 8) generate specific 4x4 patterns\n2. The mapping is:\n   - 2 \u2192 Box pattern (color 4): `4,4,4,4 / 4,0,0,4 / 4,0,0,4 / 4,4,4,4`\n   - 3 \u2192 Diamond pattern (color 1): `0,1,1,0 / 1,0,0,1 / 1,0,0,1 / 0,1,1,0`\n   - 5 \u2192 Checkerboard (color 6): `6,6,0,0 / 6,6,0,0 / 0,0,6,6 / 0,0,6,6`\n   - 8 \u2192 X-shape (color 7): `7,0,0,7 / 0,7,7,0 / 0,7,7,0 / 7,0,0,7`\n3. Existing non-marker shapes are cleared\n\n## Test Input Analysis\n\nIdentifying markers (value 8) positions:\n- Row 1: cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16\n- Row 5: cols 0, 16 (col 4 has value 7, not a valid marker)\n- Row 9: cols 0, 8, 16\n- Row 13: cols 0, 12, 16\n- Row 17: cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16\n\nThe existing 7-pattern at rows 5-8, cols 4-7 should be cleared since there's no valid marker at that position (the value 7 is not a marker color).\n\nAll markers are 8, so all patterns will be X-shapes (color 7).\n\n## Output Construction\n\nFor each marker at position (r,c) with value 8, place the X-shape pattern at rows r to r+3, cols c to c+3.\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n```",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nObject Types Found in Grids **\n\nOkay, let's break down these grids. We're looking at two main object categories: 4x4 patterned shapes and individual pixel markers.  The background is consistently color 0.\n\nThe 4x4 shapes come in a few distinct types:\n\n*   **Box:**  Color 4, a hollow square frame: `4,4,4,4 / 4,0,0,4 / 4,0,0,4 / 4,4,4,4`.\n*   **Diamond/Octagon:** Color 1.  Looks like this: `0,1,1,0 / 1,0,0,1 / 1,0,0,1 / 0,1,1,0`.\n*   **X-shape:** Color 7.  The pattern is `7,0,0,7 / 0,7,7,0 / 0,7,7,0 / 7,0,0,7`.\n*   **Checkerboard Block:** Color 6.  Made up of 2x2 blocks of 6 and 0 in a diagonal pattern within the 4x4 space:  `6,6,0,0 / 6,6,0,0 / 0,0,6,6 / 0,0,6,6`.\n\nThen we have the single-pixel markers, which are just isolated pixels of color: 2, 3, 5, and 8.  They don't form any structure themselves, just appear scattered on the background.\n**\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nThe transformation replaces pixels with specific patterns. Single pixels, representing markers, generate 4x4 patterns on the output grid. The marker color determines the resulting pattern, and the marker's position determines the pattern's location (top-left). Markers 2, 3, 5, and 8 map to 4 (Box), 1 (Diamond), 6 (Checkerboard), and 7 (X-shape) respectively. Any existing non-marker shapes on the grid are cleared/removed.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Transformation recap:\n\n- The background is 0.\n- Single-pixel markers of colors 2, 3, 5, 8 are replaced by 4\u00d74 patterns:\n  - 2 \u2192 a 4\u00d74 hollow box of 4s\n  - 3 \u2192 a 4\u00d74 diamond of 1s\n  - 5 \u2192 a 4\u00d74 checkerboard block of 6s\n  - 8 \u2192 a 4\u00d74 \u201cX\u201d of 7s:\n\n    7,0,0,7  \n    0,7,7,0  \n    0,7,7,0  \n    7,0,0,7\n\n- Any existing non-marker pixels (including any 7s already present) are discarded; the output is built from scratch using only the markers.\n- A marker only generates its pattern if the full 4\u00d74 block fits inside the grid. If placing the pattern would go out of bounds (as shown by the bottom-right 3 in Example 2), that marker is ignored and produces nothing.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\n- The only markers present are 8s.\n- Valid 8s (those with room for a full 4\u00d74) are on rows 1, 5, 9, and 13 at the same columns as in the input (0,4,8,12,16 depending on the row).\n- The 8s on row 17 are too close to the bottom (row 17 + 3 = 20 \u2265 20), so their 4\u00d74 patterns would go out of bounds; therefore those markers are ignored.\n- For each valid 8, we stamp the 4\u00d74 X-pattern of 7s with its top-left corner at the marker\u2019s position. The rest of the grid remains 0.\n\nFinal output grid:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nObject Types Found in Grids **\n\nOkay, let's break down these grids. We're looking at two main object categories: 4x4 patterned shapes and individual pixel markers.  The background is consistently color 0.\n\nThe 4x4 shapes come in a few distinct types:\n\n*   **Box:**  Color 4, a hollow square frame: `4,4,4,4 / 4,0,0,4 / 4,0,0,4 / 4,4,4,4`.\n*   **Diamond/Octagon:** Color 1.  Looks like this: `0,1,1,0 / 1,0,0,1 / 1,0,0,1 / 0,1,1,0`.\n*   **X-shape:** Color 7.  The pattern is `7,0,0,7 / 0,7,7,0 / 0,7,7,0 / 7,0,0,7`.\n*   **Checkerboard Block:** Color 6.  Made up of 2x2 blocks of 6 and 0 in a diagonal pattern within the 4x4 space:  `6,6,0,0 / 6,6,0,0 / 0,0,6,6 / 0,0,6,6`.\n\nThen we have the single-pixel markers, which are just isolated pixels of color: 2, 3, 5, and 8.  They don't form any structure themselves, just appear scattered on the background.\n**\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nThe transformation replaces pixels with specific patterns. Single pixels, representing markers, generate 4x4 patterns on the output grid. The marker color determines the resulting pattern, and the marker's position determines the pattern's location (top-left). Markers 2, 3, 5, and 8 map to 4 (Box), 1 (Diamond), 6 (Checkerboard), and 7 (X-shape) respectively. Any existing non-marker shapes on the grid are cleared/removed.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "The solved cases show that all non\u2011background pixels in the input are treated as single\u2013pixel markers. Each marker is replaced by a 4\u00d74 pattern whose top\u2011left corner is at the marker\u2019s coordinates, and any other coloured input pixels are disregarded. The mapping from marker colour to pattern is:\n\n- 2 \u2192 hollow square of colour\u202f4:\n```\n4 4 4 4\n4 0 0 4\n4 0 0 4\n4 4 4 4\n```\n- 3 \u2192 diamond of colour\u202f1:\n```\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n```\n- 5 \u2192 checkerboard of colour\u202f6:\n```\n6 6 0 0\n6 6 0 0\n0 0 6 6\n0 0 6 6\n```\n- 8 \u2192 X\u2011shape of colour\u202f7:\n```\n7 0 0 7\n0 7 7 0\n0 7 7 0\n7 0 0 7\n```\n\nPatterns are simply clipped at the grid boundary if they would extend off the grid. In the test input only colour\u202f8 markers are present, so only the colour\u202f7 X\u2011patterns are drawn at each 8\u2019s position; the existing 7s in the input are ignored.\n\nApplying this, the output grid is:\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n```",

We're looking at two main object categories: 4x4 patterned shapes and individual pixel markers.  The background is consistently color 0.\n\nThe 4x4 shapes come in a few distinct types:\n\n*   **Box:**  Color 4, a hollow square frame: `4,4,4,4 / 4,0,0,4 / 4,0,0,4 / 4,4,4,4`.\n*   **Diamond/Octagon:** Color 1.  Looks like this: `0,1,1,0 / 1,0,0,1 / 1,0,0,1 / 0,1,1,0`.\n*   **X-shape:** Color 7.  The pattern is `7,0,0,7 / 0,7,7,0 / 0,7,7,0 / 7,0,0,7`.\n*   **Checkerboard Block:** Color 6.  Made up of 2x2 blocks of 6 and 0 in a diagonal pattern within the 4x4 space:  `6,6,0,0 / 6,6,0,0 / 0,0,6,6 / 0,0,6,6`.\n\nThen we have the single-pixel markers, which are just isolated pixels of color: 2, 3, 5, and 8.  They don't form any structure themselves, just appear scattered on the background.\n**</objects_summary>**\n\n\nThe objects in the provided grids can be categorized into two distinct types based on their size, structure, and color attributes. All objects appear against a background of color 0.\n\n**1. Composite 4x4 Patterned Shapes**\nThese objects are structured blocks occupying a 4x4 grid area. There are four distinct variations of these shapes, each associated with a specific color:\n\n*   **The Hollow Square (Color 4):** This object is a square frame. The outer boundary (top row, bottom row, left column, and right column) consists of pixels of color 4, while the central 2x2 area consists of color 0 (background).\n*   **The Hollow Octagon/Ring (Color 1):** This object resembles a rounded diamond or octagonal ring. The top and bottom rows follow the pattern `0, 1, 1, 0`, while the two middle rows follow the pattern `1, 0, 0, 1`. This creates a hollow shape with cut corners.\n*   **The X-Cross (Color 7):** This object forms an \"X\" shape. The top and bottom rows follow the pattern `7, 0, 0, 7`, while the two middle rows follow the pattern `0, 7, 7, 0`. The pixels of color 7 connect diagonally across the 4x4 space.\n*   **The Checkerboard Block (Color 6):** This object consists of 2x2 blocks of solid color 6 arranged diagonally within the 4x4 space. For example, the top-left and bottom-right 2x2 quadrants might be color 6, while the others are color 0 (or vice versa).\n\n**2. Single-Pixel Markers**\nThese objects consist of isolated, individual pixels. They are typically spaced apart and do not form larger contiguous patterns like the composite shapes.\n\n*   **Colors:** These single-pixel objects appear in color 2, color 3, color 5, and color 8.\n*   **Arrangement:** They appear at various coordinates, often seemingly marking specific points or potential grid intersections, but stand as singular entities rather than multi-pixel blocks.\n\n<objects_summary>\n1.  **Composite Shapes:** Fixed 4x4 patterned blocks including Hollow Squares (color 4), Hollow Octagons (color 1), X-Crosses (color 7), and Checkerboard Blocks (color 6).\n2.  **Single-Pixel Markers:** Isolated 1x1 units appearing in colors 2, 3, 5, and 8.\n3.  **Background:** Continuous field of color 0.\n</objects_summary>",

Objects Description\nObject Types Found in Grids **\n\nOkay, let's break down these grids. We're looking at two main object categories: 4x4 patterned shapes and individual pixel markers.  The background is consistently color 0.\n\nThe 4x4 shapes come in a few distinct types:\n\n*   **Box:**  Color 4, a hollow square frame: `4,4,4,4 / 4,0,0,4 / 4,0,0,4 / 4,4,4,4`.\n*   **Diamond/Octagon:** Color 1.  Looks like this: `0,1,1,0 / 1,0,0,1 / 1,0,0,1 / 0,1,1,0`.\n*   **X-shape:** Color 7.  The pattern is `7,0,0,7 / 0,7,7,0 / 0,7,7,0 / 7,0,0,7`.\n*   **Checkerboard Block:** Color 6.  Made up of 2x2 blocks of 6 and 0 in a diagonal pattern within the 4x4 space:  `6,6,0,0 / 6,6,0,0 / 0,0,6,6 / 0,0,6,6`.\n\nThen we have the single-pixel markers, which are just isolated pixels of color: 2, 3, 5, and 8.  They don't form any structure themselves, just appear scattered on the background.\n**",
                "response": "**My Thinking Process for Understanding the Transformations**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with these input/output grids and some object descriptions. My mission is to figure out the rules that transform the input into the output, using these numeric color codes. It looks like the main things to keep an eye on are the objects themselves.\n\nFirst, I see that the inputs have these single-pixel markers, acting like seeds. They're colors like 2, 3, 5, and 8. The outputs are these patterned 4x4 blocks.  The background is always 0 (Black).\n\nLooking at the examples, I can begin to see how the markers influence the output shapes. Let's trace it carefully:\n\n*   **Example 1**: I'm noticing that where a \"2\" marker is in the input, a specific 4x4 block, color \"4,\" appears in the output. It looks like the marker becomes the top-left corner of the block. I need to be exact here, keeping in mind the grid positions. Same for \"3\" becoming a \"1\", \"5\" becoming a \"6\", and \"8\" becoming \"7\".\n*   **Example 2**: This solidifies the link:  3 -> Diamond (1) and 2 -> Box (4).\n*   **Example 3**: This throws a curveball at first. It seems like the existing 4x4 blocks in the *input* are *removed* in the *output*. The marker colors drive the block shapes. Everything else is cleared or replaced. This implies a \"reset\" or \"clear grid\" action before generating the output.\n*   **Example 4**:  We get more evidence for the mapping and further verification of the \"clear grid\" hypothesis.  I see that 2 -> 4, 3 -> 1, 5 -> 6, and 8 -> 7. No existing blocks from the input are preserved, only those generated from the markers. This clears the grid.\n\nSo now I have a clearer picture:\n\n1.  **Triggers**: We've got single-pixel markers with colors 2, 3, 5, and 8.\n2.  **Mapping:**\n    *   2 (Red) becomes a Box (4) Pattern\n    *   3 (Green) becomes a Diamond (1) Pattern\n    *   5 (Magenta) becomes a Checkerboard (6) Pattern\n    *   8 (Brown) becomes an X-shape (7) Pattern\n3.  **Spatial Relation**: The marker pixel's position becomes the *top-left* pixel of the generated 4x4 block.\n4.  **\"Cleaning\" Rule**: Everything else in the input grid that isn't a marker gets erased/becomes background (0). This includes any existing 4x4 blocks.  This is based on example 3 where an existing 4x4 box was not in the output.\n\nNow, for the Test Input. Based on this, I expect the pre-existing X-shape (7) to disappear, with the output being 4 X-shapes generated from the 8 markers.\n\nLet's summarize it.\n\n`<transformation_summary>The transformation replaces pixels with specific patterns. Single pixels, representing markers, generate 4x4 patterns on the output grid. The marker color determines the resulting pattern, and the marker's position determines the pattern's location (top-left). Markers 2, 3, 5, and 8 map to 4 (Box), 1 (Diamond), 6 (Checkerboard), and 7 (X-shape) respectively. Any existing non-marker shapes on the grid are cleared/removed. </transformation_summary>`\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided examples and the test input, here is the description of the transformations involved.\n\n### Object Analysis\n\n**Input Objects:**\nThe input grids primarily contain two types of objects:\n1.  **Markers:** Single, isolated pixels of specific colors (2, 3, 5, 8) located on a black background (0). These act as \"seeds\" for the transformation.\n2.  **Pre-existing Patterns:** Some input grids (like Example 3 and the Test Input) contain full 4x4 patterned blocks (e.g., color 4 or color 7). These appear to be ignored or cleared if they do not correspond to a marker.\n\n**Output Objects:**\nThe output grids contain 4x4 patterned blocks. The specific pattern and color of the block depend on the color of the input marker.\n1.  **Box (Color 4):** A 4x4 hollow square.\n    *   Pattern: Top/bottom rows are `4,4,4,4`; middle rows are `4,0,0,4`.\n2.  **Diamond (Color 1):** A 4x4 diamond shape.\n    *   Pattern: Rows are `0,1,1,0`, `1,0,0,1`, `1,0,0,1`, `0,1,1,0`.\n3.  **Checkerboard (Color 6):** A 4x4 block consisting of diagonal 2x2 squares.\n    *   Pattern: Top two rows have 6s on the left (`6,6,0,0`), bottom two rows have 6s on the right (`0,0,6,6`).\n4.  **X-Shape (Color 7):** A 4x4 block forming an 'X'.\n    *   Pattern: Rows are `7,0,0,7`, `0,7,7,0`, `0,7,7,0`, `7,0,0,7`.\n\n### Transformations\n\nThe transformation process involves three steps: Clearing, Mapping, and Expansion.\n\n1.  **Clear Non-Marker Objects:**\n    Any object in the input grid that is not a single-pixel marker (2, 3, 5, or 8) is removed. This includes pre-existing 4x4 blocks found in the input (e.g., the block of color 4 in Example 3, or the block of color 7 in the Test Input). The background remains 0.\n\n2.  **Marker-to-Pattern Mapping:**\n    Each specific marker color transforms into a specific 4x4 pattern block.\n    *   **Input 2 $\\rightarrow$ Output 4:** A red pixel (2) becomes a yellow Box pattern (4).\n    *   **Input 3 $\\rightarrow$ Output 1:** A green pixel (3) becomes a blue Diamond pattern (1).\n    *   **Input 5 $\\rightarrow$ Output 6:** A grey pixel (5) becomes a magenta Checkerboard pattern (6).\n    *   **Input 8 $\\rightarrow$ Output 7:** A teal pixel (8) becomes an orange X-shape pattern (7).\n\n3.  **Positional Expansion:**\n    The input marker's coordinates $(r, c)$ define the **top-left corner** of the resulting 4x4 output block. The block occupies cells from row $r$ to $r+3$ and column $c$ to $c+3$. The original marker pixel is overwritten by the top-left pixel of the new pattern.\n\n<transformation_summary>\n1. Identify single-pixel markers in the input grid with colors 2, 3, 5, or 8.\n2. Clear the grid of all other non-background pixels (remove pre-existing shapes).\n3. Expand each marker into a specific 4x4 pattern where the marker's location becomes the top-left corner of the pattern:\n   - Marker 2 becomes a hollow Box of color 4.\n   - Marker 3 becomes a Diamond of color 1.\n   - Marker 5 becomes a Checkerboard block of color 6.\n   - Marker 8 becomes an X-shape of color 7.\n</transformation_summary>",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nObject Types Found in Grids **\n\nOkay, let's break down these grids. We're looking at two main object categories: 4x4 patterned shapes and individual pixel markers.  The background is consistently color 0.\n\nThe 4x4 shapes come in a few distinct types:\n\n*   **Box:**  Color 4, a hollow square frame: `4,4,4,4 / 4,0,0,4 / 4,0,0,4 / 4,4,4,4`.\n*   **Diamond/Octagon:** Color 1.  Looks like this: `0,1,1,0 / 1,0,0,1 / 1,0,0,1 / 0,1,1,0`.\n*   **X-shape:** Color 7.  The pattern is `7,0,0,7 / 0,7,7,0 / 0,7,7,0 / 7,0,0,7`.\n*   **Checkerboard Block:** Color 6.  Made up of 2x2 blocks of 6 and 0 in a diagonal pattern within the 4x4 space:  `6,6,0,0 / 6,6,0,0 / 0,0,6,6 / 0,0,6,6`.\n\nThen we have the single-pixel markers, which are just isolated pixels of color: 2, 3, 5, and 8.  They don't form any structure themselves, just appear scattered on the background.\n**\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nThe transformation replaces pixels with specific patterns. Single pixels, representing markers, generate 4x4 patterns on the output grid. The marker color determines the resulting pattern, and the marker's position determines the pattern's location (top-left). Markers 2, 3, 5, and 8 map to 4 (Box), 1 (Diamond), 6 (Checkerboard), and 7 (X-shape) respectively. Any existing non-marker shapes on the grid are cleared/removed.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain five main object types: (1) hollow rectangular frames of color 4 (4\u00d74 with 2\u00d72 hollow centers), (2) hollow diamond/rotated square shapes of color 1 (4\u00d74 bounding box), (3) diagonal 2\u00d72 block patterns in colors 6 and 7, (4) single-cell point markers in colors 2, 3, 5, and 8 arranged in regular grid patterns, and (5) color 0 background. Key attributes include consistent 4\u00d74 sizing for frame objects, hollow interiors, regular spatial arrangements, and single-color composition per object type.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Single-cell markers (2, 3, 5, 8) define pattern placement positions\n2. Each marker value maps to a 4\u00d74 pattern: 2\u2192color 4 rectangle, 3\u2192color 1 diamond, 5\u2192color 6 diagonal blocks, 8\u2192color 7 anti-diagonal\n3. Patterns are placed with the marker at the top-left corner\n4. Multi-cell template patterns in the input are cleared (set to 0)\n5. Overlapping patterns resolved by priority: higher row wins, then higher column\n6. Patterns extending beyond grid boundaries are not placed\n7. All non-pattern areas become 0 (background)\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Finalized ARC Task Solution**\n\nAlright, the user wants me to solve an ARC task, specifically this one based on examples and a test input. Let's break this down systematically.\n\n1.  **Understanding the Task:** I'm given a grid of numbers (0-9, representing colors), some examples, and a test grid. The goal is to figure out the transformation rule applied to the test input based on what I see in the examples.\n\n2.  **Initial Observations:** I have four examples. There are hints: \"Objects Description\" mentions shapes like frames, diamonds, and diagonals, and also \"markers\" which are single cells. The \"Transformation Description\" gives away the mapping. It says something like \"Marker 2 becomes a 4x4 frame of color 4,\" etc. So, single markers are turned into bigger patterns. The hint also specifies \"top-left corner alignment\" of patterns, meaning the marker's cell is the top left of the new shape. Also, \"Multi-cell template patterns in the input are cleared\" and something about \"overlapping patterns\".\n\n    I immediately think, \"Okay, this is typical ARC stuff,\" but I have to verify these claims against the examples. The examples are the key!\n\n3.  **Example Verification:** I will carefully look at Example 1: I see markers like '2', '3', and '5'. The output for each example must correspond to what the description says. For example, for marker '2', I'm expecting a 4x4 color-4 box. Yup, that's what I see in the example. The marker '3' maps to a diamond of color 1 and marker '5' to the diagonal blocks.\n\n    However, I need to check the alignment. Let's see if the shape for each marker always begins at its position:\n\n    I looked at the specific cell, and it seems this is true. The 4x4 frame, Diamond, Diagonal blocks all start at the marker position.\n\n    But one question is, how about the templates? They are present in the grid also, and the description says that the template must be erased.\n\n    I think the input grid also contains \"template shapes,\" which are like pre-drawn shapes that need to be removed. So I think the rule is that marker digits are seeds which are mapped to 4x4 shapes, but these are cleared first.\n\n4.  **Collision and Overlap Rules:** The description talks about \"overlapping patterns\". After analyzing Example 3, I think I understood the logic. The rule is that patterns at the \"bottom\" (higher row index) take priority, and if rows are the same, the rightmost wins. The \"lower\" pattern will be entirely removed. This means the other pattern has its place.\n\n    So, essentially: If patterns overlap, the one with the *larger* row or column (if rows are equal) takes precedence. The lower pattern is simply erased. This \"cancellation\" logic is a central part of how to approach the task.\n\n5.  **Defining the Shapes:** I will make sure the descriptions match what I am seeing.\n    *   **Marker '2':** A 4x4 frame of color 4.\n    *   **Marker '3':** A 4x4 diamond of color 1.\n    *   **Marker '5':** Two 2x2 diagonal blocks of color 6.\n    *   **Marker '8':** 4x4 shape. (Color 7). The prompt described it as an \"anti-diagonal\", but it's an X.\n\n6.  **Analyzing the Test Input:** It's time to test the rules against the provided test input. I start scanning for the markers (2, 3, 5, 8). I find a row of markers that appear to be '8'. I also note a pattern of \"7\" in the test input. It looks like the template that must be removed.\n\n    I need to pay attention to grid boundaries. Anything that overflows must be discarded. I also should verify and apply any found offset.\n\n7.  **Marker Validation and Boundary Rule:** I carefully analyze the positions of all found markers, making sure to apply the collision logic from the previous step. Any marker that overlaps with another will be considered invalid. Then, \"Patterns extending beyond grid boundaries are not placed\" must be considered. Anything at the right boundary must be removed because I have determined, the bottom 3 rows are out of bounds.\n\n    I then identify the coordinates of the valid markers (8s): (1,0), (1,4), (1,8), (1,12), (1,16) - (5,0), (5,16) - (9,0), (9,8), (9,16\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid containing \"marker\" pixels and \"template\" patterns into a final grid where markers are replaced by specific 4x4 shapes, and everything else is cleared.\n\n**1. identifying the Rules and Patterns:**\nBased on the provided examples and descriptions, we can deduce the following rules:\n\n*   **Markers & Shapes:**\n    *   **Marker `2`:** Produces a **4x4 Hollow Frame** of color **4**.\n        Pattern:\n        ```\n        4 4 4 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 4 4 4\n        ```\n    *   **Marker `3`:** Produces a **4x4 Hollow Diamond** of color **1**.\n        Pattern:\n        ```\n        0 1 1 0\n        1 0 0 1\n        1 0 0 1\n        0 1 1 0\n        ```\n    *   **Marker `5`:** Produces **4x4 Diagonal Blocks** of color **6**.\n        Pattern:\n        ```\n        6 6 0 0\n        6 6 0 0\n        0 0 6 6\n        0 0 6 6\n        ```\n    *   **Marker `8`:** Produces a **4x4 X-Shape (Anti-Diagonal + Diagonal)** of color **7**.\n        Pattern (inferred from Example 4):\n        ```\n        7 0 0 7\n        0 7 7 0\n        0 7 7 0\n        7 0 0 7\n        ```\n\n*   **Placement Logic:**\n    *   The marker's position in the input grid becomes the **top-left corner** (0,0) of the 4x4 pattern in the output grid.\n    *   **Boundaries:** Patterns that extend beyond the grid boundaries (e.g., if row + 3 >= grid height) are **not placed**.\n    *   **Priority/Overlaps:** If patterns overlap, the one with the higher row index (bottom-most) takes priority. If row indices are equal, the one with the higher column index (right-most) takes priority. Lower priority patterns are completely removed if they clash with a higher priority one.\n    *   **Cleanup:** Any pre-existing patterns or shapes in the input (templates) are cleared; only shapes generated by valid markers remain.\n\n**2. Applying to Test Input:**\nThe test input is a 20x20 grid. We scan for markers `2`, `3`, `5`, and `8`.\n\n*   **Found Markers (All are `8`):**\n    *   **Row 1:** (1,0), (1,4), (1,8), (1,12), (1,16).\n    *   **Row 5:** (5,0), (5,16). (Note: The shape at (5,4) is a template made of 7s, not a marker).\n    *   **Row 9:** (9,0), (9,8), (9,16).\n    *   **Row 13:** (13,0), (13,12), (13,16).\n    *   **Row 17:** (17,0), (17,4), (17,8), (17,12), (17,16).\n\n*   **Validity Check:**\n    *   The grid has rows 0-19.\n    *   Patterns starting at Row 17 would occupy rows 17, 18, 19, 20. Row 20 is out of bounds.\n    *   Therefore, **all markers on Row 17 are invalid** and produce no output.\n    *   All markers on rows 1, 5, 9, 13 are valid (they end at rows 4, 8, 12, 16 respectively).\n\n*   **Overlap Check:**\n    *   The valid markers are spaced such that their 4x4 areas (rows 1-4, 5-8, etc., and cols 0-3, 4-7, etc.) do not overlap.\n    *   We can simply place the X-shape (color 7) at each valid location.\n\n**3. Constructing the Output:**\n\n*   **Rows 0:** Empty (0s).\n*   **Rows 1-4:** Patterns at cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. This creates a continuous strip of patterns.\n    *   Row 1: `7,0,0,7` repeated 5 times.\n    *   Row 2: `0,7,7,0` repeated 5 times.\n    *   Row 3: `0,7,7,0` repeated 5 times.\n    *   Row 4: `7,0,0,7` repeated 5 times.\n*   **Rows 5-8:** Patterns at cols 0 and 16 only.\n*   **Rows 9-12:** Patterns at cols 0, 8, 16.\n*   **Rows 13-16:** Patterns at cols 0, 12, 16.\n*   **Rows 17-19:** Empty (0s) because row 17 markers were out of bounds.\n\nThe output grid is constructed based on these placements.\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain five main object types: (1) hollow rectangular frames of color 4 (4\u00d74 with 2\u00d72 hollow centers), (2) hollow diamond/rotated square shapes of color 1 (4\u00d74 bounding box), (3) diagonal 2\u00d72 block patterns in colors 6 and 7, (4) single-cell point markers in colors 2, 3, 5, and 8 arranged in regular grid patterns, and (5) color 0 background. Key attributes include consistent 4\u00d74 sizing for frame objects, hollow interiors, regular spatial arrangements, and single-color composition per object type.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Single-cell markers (2, 3, 5, 8) define pattern placement positions\n2. Each marker value maps to a 4\u00d74 pattern: 2\u2192color 4 rectangle, 3\u2192color 1 diamond, 5\u2192color 6 diagonal blocks, 8\u2192color 7 anti-diagonal\n3. Patterns are placed with the marker at the top-left corner\n4. Multi-cell template patterns in the input are cleared (set to 0)\n5. Overlapping patterns resolved by priority: higher row wins, then higher column\n6. Patterns extending beyond grid boundaries are not placed\n7. All non-pattern areas become 0 (background)\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "The transformation learned from the examples:\n\n- Certain *single-cell markers* in the input (colors 2, 3, 5, 8) each generate a **4\u00d74 pattern**, placed with the marker at the **top-left** of that 4\u00d74 block.\n- The patterns are:\n  - 2 \u2192 hollow 4\u00d74 rectangle of color 4.\n  - 3 \u2192 hollow diamond (rotated square) of color 1 inside a 4\u00d74 bounding box.\n  - 5 \u2192 diagonal 2\u00d72 blocks of color 6 in opposite corners of a 4\u00d74 box.\n  - 8 \u2192 a specific 4\u00d74 pattern of color 7:\n\n    Relative to the marker at (0,0), the 7s are at  \n    (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), i.e.:\n\n    ```\n    7 0 0 7\n    0 7 7 0\n    0 7 7 0\n    7 0 0 7\n    ```\n\n- Any multi-cell patterns already present in the input (e.g., existing rectangles, diamonds, or 7/6-block shapes) are just templates and **do not get copied**; only the single-cell markers matter.\n- The output is constructed as a fresh grid:\n  - Start with all 0s.\n  - For each valid marker, place its 4\u00d74 pattern if it fits entirely inside the grid.\n  - If a marker\u2019s 4\u00d74 box would go out of bounds, **skip** that marker.\n  - Non-pattern cells remain 0.\n\nIn this test input:\n\n- The only relevant markers are color **8** (there are no 2, 3, or 5).\n- There is a 4\u00d74 pattern of 7s around rows 6\u20139, cols 5\u20138 in the input; this matches the 8\u21927 pattern but has no 8 at its top-left, so it is a **template** and is ignored in the output.\n- Valid 8 markers (top-left coordinate \u2264 (17,17) so a full 4\u00d74 fits):\n  - Row 2: (2,1), (2,5), (2,9), (2,13), (2,17)\n  - Row 6: (6,1), (6,17)\n  - Row 10: (10,1), (10,9), (10,17)\n  - Row 14: (14,1), (14,13), (14,17)\n- Invalid (out-of-bounds) 8 markers (their 4\u00d74 would extend past row 20) are all at row 18: (18,1), (18,5), (18,9), (18,13), (18,17). These are **ignored**.\n\nWe then place the 7-pattern at each valid 8 location, with no overlaps between patterns in this case.\n\n---\n\nFinal output grid:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain five main object types: (1) hollow rectangular frames of color 4 (4\u00d74 with 2\u00d72 hollow centers), (2) hollow diamond/rotated square shapes of color 1 (4\u00d74 bounding box), (3) diagonal 2\u00d72 block patterns in colors 6 and 7, (4) single-cell point markers in colors 2, 3, 5, and 8 arranged in regular grid patterns, and (5) color 0 background. Key attributes include consistent 4\u00d74 sizing for frame objects, hollow interiors, regular spatial arrangements, and single-color composition per object type.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Single-cell markers (2, 3, 5, 8) define pattern placement positions\n2. Each marker value maps to a 4\u00d74 pattern: 2\u2192color 4 rectangle, 3\u2192color 1 diamond, 5\u2192color 6 diagonal blocks, 8\u2192color 7 anti-diagonal\n3. Patterns are placed with the marker at the top-left corner\n4. Multi-cell template patterns in the input are cleared (set to 0)\n5. Overlapping patterns resolved by priority: higher row wins, then higher column\n6. Patterns extending beyond grid boundaries are not placed\n7. All non-pattern areas become 0 (background)\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand the transformation rules from the examples:\n\n1. **Single-cell markers (2, 3, 5, 8)** define where patterns are placed\n2. **Each marker maps to a 4\u00d74 pattern:**\n   - 2 \u2192 color 4 rectangular frame\n   - 3 \u2192 color 1 diamond\n   - 5 \u2192 color 6 diagonal blocks\n   - 8 \u2192 color 7 anti-diagonal pattern\n3. **Patterns are placed with marker at top-left corner**\n4. **Template patterns in input are cleared**\n5. **Markers only produce patterns if in a row OR column with other markers** (isolated markers don't produce patterns)\n6. **Patterns extending beyond grid boundaries are not placed**\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n- Grid is 20\u00d720 (rows 0-19)\n- All markers are 8, producing color 7 anti-diagonal:\n  ```\n  7,0,0,7\n  0,7,7,0\n  0,7,7,0\n  7,0,0,7\n  ```\n- Template at rows 5-8, cols 4-7 (shows anti-diagonal pattern) - will be cleared\n- Markers at:\n  - Row 1: cols 0,4,8,12,16\n  - Row 5: cols 0,16\n  - Row 9: cols 0,8,16\n  - Row 13: cols 0,12,16\n  - Row 17: cols 0,4,8,12,16\n\n**Key observation:** Markers at row 17 would create patterns extending to row 20, which is outside the grid. Per rule 6, these patterns are not placed.\n\nAll other markers are not isolated (each is in a row/column with other markers) so they produce patterns.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain five main object types: (1) hollow rectangular frames of color 4 (4\u00d74 with 2\u00d72 hollow centers), (2) hollow diamond/rotated square shapes of color 1 (4\u00d74 bounding box), (3) diagonal 2\u00d72 block patterns in colors 6 and 7, (4) single-cell point markers in colors 2, 3, 5, and 8 arranged in regular grid patterns, and (5) color 0 background. Key attributes include consistent 4\u00d74 sizing for frame objects, hollow interiors, regular spatial arrangements, and single-color composition per object type.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Single-cell markers (2, 3, 5, 8) define pattern placement positions\n2. Each marker value maps to a 4\u00d74 pattern: 2\u2192color 4 rectangle, 3\u2192color 1 diamond, 5\u2192color 6 diagonal blocks, 8\u2192color 7 anti-diagonal\n3. Patterns are placed with the marker at the top-left corner\n4. Multi-cell template patterns in the input are cleared (set to 0)\n5. Overlapping patterns resolved by priority: higher row wins, then higher column\n6. Patterns extending beyond grid boundaries are not placed\n7. All non-pattern areas become 0 (background)\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "To solve this task, I first deduced from the examples that only the single\u2010cell markers with values 2, 3, 5, and 8 are significant. Each of these values is replaced by a fixed 4\u00d74 pattern anchored with its top\u2011left corner at the marker:\n\n- 2 \u2192 a hollow 4\u00d74 rectangle of color\u202f4.\n- 3 \u2192 a \u201cdiamond\u201d shape of color\u202f1:  \n  [[0,1,1,0],[1,0,0,1],[1,0,0,1],[0,1,1,0]].\n- 5 \u2192 two 2\u00d72 blocks on the main diagonal of color\u202f6:  \n  [[6,6,0,0],[6,6,0,0],[0,0,6,6],[0,0,6,6]].\n- 8 \u2192 an \u201cX\u201d shape of color\u202f7 (both diagonals):  \n  [[7,0,0,7],[0,7,7,0],[0,7,7,0],[7,0,0,7]].\n\nAll other nonzero input cells are ignored. A marker is used only if its entire 4\u00d74 pattern fits within the grid; otherwise it is skipped (as seen with out\u2011of\u2011bounds markers). If markers are isolated (the only one in their row and column), they are also ignored. When patterns are placed, other cells remain 0; overlaps aren\u2019t an issue here.\n\nFor the test input, the only relevant markers are the 8s. Markers on row\u202f17 are skipped because the 4\u00d74 pattern would extend beyond the bottom of the 20\u00d720 grid. Placing the 4\u00d74 X\u2011shaped 7\u2011patterns at the remaining marker positions yields the following output:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

                "response": "Looking at the examples, I'll analyze the transformations systematically.\n\n## Transformation Analysis\n\n### 1. Marker Identification\nThe input grids contain single-cell markers (values 2, 3, 5, 8) positioned at regular intervals. These markers act as position indicators for where patterns should be placed.\n\n### 2. Template Pattern Recognition\nEach input may contain a multi-cell \"template\" pattern (made of colors like 1, 4, 6, or 7) that demonstrates one of the possible output shapes. This template is **cleared** in the output.\n\n### 3. Marker-to-Pattern Mapping\nEach marker value maps to a specific 4\u00d74 pattern and color:\n- **Marker 2** \u2192 Hollow rectangular frame in **color 4**\n- **Marker 3** \u2192 Hollow diamond shape in **color 1**  \n- **Marker 5** \u2192 Diagonal 2\u00d72 blocks in **color 6**\n- **Marker 8** \u2192 Anti-diagonal pattern in **color 7**\n\n### 4. Pattern Placement Rules\n- The marker position becomes the **top-left corner** of the 4\u00d74 pattern\n- Patterns extend 4 cells down and 4 cells right from the marker\n\n### 5. Overlap Resolution\nWhen potential patterns would overlap:\n- Markers with **higher row numbers** have priority\n- For same rows, **higher column numbers** take precedence\n- Lower-priority markers are skipped (no pattern placed)\n\n### 6. Boundary Handling\nIf a 4\u00d74 pattern would extend beyond the grid boundaries, that marker is **skipped entirely** (pattern not placed).\n\n### 7. Template Clearing\nThe original template pattern region is replaced with 0s in the output, regardless of whether a marker overlaps it.\n\n<transformation_summary>\n1. Single-cell markers (2, 3, 5, 8) define pattern placement positions\n2. Each marker value maps to a 4\u00d74 pattern: 2\u2192color 4 rectangle, 3\u2192color 1 diamond, 5\u2192color 6 diagonal blocks, 8\u2192color 7 anti-diagonal\n3. Patterns are placed with the marker at the top-left corner\n4. Multi-cell template patterns in the input are cleared (set to 0)\n5. Overlapping patterns resolved by priority: higher row wins, then higher column\n6. Patterns extending beyond grid boundaries are not placed\n7.

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain five main object types: (1) hollow rectangular frames of color 4 (4\u00d74 with 2\u00d72 hollow centers), (2) hollow diamond/rotated square shapes of color 1 (4\u00d74 bounding box), (3) diagonal 2\u00d72 block patterns in colors 6 and 7, (4) single-cell point markers in colors 2, 3, 5, and 8 arranged in regular grid patterns, and (5) color 0 background. Key attributes include consistent 4\u00d74 sizing for frame objects, hollow interiors, regular spatial arrangements, and single-color composition per object type.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Single-cell markers (2, 3, 5, 8) define pattern placement positions\n2. Each marker value maps to a 4\u00d74 pattern: 2\u2192color 4 rectangle, 3\u2192color 1 diamond, 5\u2192color 6 diagonal blocks, 8\u2192color 7 anti-diagonal\n3. Patterns are placed with the marker at the top-left corner\n4. Multi-cell template patterns in the input are cleared (set to 0)\n5. Overlapping patterns resolved by priority: higher row wins, then higher column\n6. Patterns extending beyond grid boundaries are not placed\n7. All non-pattern areas become 0 (background)\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
