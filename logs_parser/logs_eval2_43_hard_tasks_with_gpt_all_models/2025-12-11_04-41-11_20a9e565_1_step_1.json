        "Full raw LLM response": "**Okay, let's break down this ARC task!** I need to figure out the rule that dictates how the input grids transform into the output. It seems to be based on recognizing patterns, specifically a combination of shapes, colors, and a special marker: the Gray `5`.\n\nI'm seeing that the `5`s have a crucial role. They define a region of interest, sort of like a window or crop on the input. In the examples, they're always grouped together, effectively creating a bounding box. My hypothesis is that this bounding box is where the action happens.\n\nLooking at example 1, the `5`s are in a specific pattern, kind of outlining an area. The output in example 1 has a Red color and seems to reflect the region \"selected\" by these `5`s. Maybe I need to look for repeating patterns to figure out the underlying logic.\n\nNow, Example 2. Here, the idea of the `5`s cropping a region is reinforced, but in a different way. The repeating parts of the input are the *background* pattern, and the `5`s are on top of it.  The output is a small window into that background pattern, showing a single pattern unit.  So it seems my goal is to figure out the background pattern and then take a small snippet from that pattern, where the 5s are. The output grid becomes a slice of the input's periodic pattern, and the width and height of this slice are precisely defined by the min/max rows and columns of the group of `5`s.  The output values are just a snippet of that.\n\nThis leads me to the Test Input. It's time to test my theory: find the pattern, then, apply the '5' window, and output a crop of the underlying structure.\nI see a repeating vertical sequence of colored blocks. These vertical blocks are \"yellow\", \"magenta\", etc, which alternate. I'm going to determine a unit of the repeating pattern, as the window will show the continuation of this. Specifically, I must analyze the magenta block. I determined how the Magenta Pattern works in detail and the rules of the vertical shapes, so I can fill in the window. The Test Input has the right combination of inputs, I have figured out which parts of the Magenta pattern I need. The 5s box is above this part of the pattern, so the window will be a bit of this pattern.\nI construct an output that will fulfill this pattern.\nI have a solid understanding of how I will generate the correct test grid:\n1.  Identify the repeating vertical pattern.\n2.  Locate the rows and columns with 5's.\n3.  The box defined by 5's defines the output grid.\n4.  Extrapolate the repeating pattern into the 5s' window, and report those values.\nFinal answer: \n0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0\n6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6\n\n\nThe task requires us to infer the contents of a region marked by gray pixels (value 5) based on the patterns present in the rest of the grid.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Example 1:** The grid contains a horizontal sequence of shapes growing in width: Blue (width 2), Red (width 3), Yellow (width 4), Blue (width 5). The sequence of colors is Blue, Red, Yellow, Blue, ... implying the next color is Red. The sequence of widths is 2, 3, 4, 5, ... implying the next width is 6. The gray pixels (5s) mark the location where this next shape would be. The output is a Red shape of width 6 with the specific geometry characteristic of the shapes (solid top and bottom rows, empty middle row except for the start).\n2.  **Example 2:** The grid contains a background pattern that repeats horizontally. The gray pixels (5s) act as a window or crop mask. The output is the continuation of the background pattern within the region defined by the gray pixels. The gray pixels effectively \"replace\" the underlying pattern, and the goal is to restore and crop it.\n3.  **Example 3:** Similar to Example 2, the grid has a repeating pattern (7,7,7 / 0 / 2,2,2 / 0 / 3,3,3 / 0 ...). The gray pixels mark a region (bounding box of all 5s). The output is the pattern that would exist in that region (which is `7,7,7`).\n\n**Analysis of Test Input:**\n1.  **Vertical Pattern:** The grid exhibits a vertically repeating sequence of blocks.\n    *   Rows 15-17: A Yellow (4) block.\n    *   Row 18: A gap of zeros.\n    *   Rows 19-21: A Magenta (6) block.\n    *   Row 22: A gap of zeros.\n    *   Rows 23-25: A Yellow (4) block.\n    *   Row 26: A gap of zeros.\n    *   Rows 27-29: A Magenta (6) block.\n    The sequence is alternating Yellow and Magenta blocks separated by gap rows.\n    Going upwards from Row 15 (Yellow), Row 14 should be a gap, and **Rows 11-13 should be a Magenta (6) block**.\n    The gray pixels (5s) are located in Rows 12 and 13. This corresponds to the Middle and Bottom rows of the inferred Magenta block.\n\n2.  **Horizontal Pattern within Blocks:**\n    *   **Magenta Middle Row (e.g., Row 20):** Groups of `6,6,6,6` separated by single `0`s. The pattern is symmetric. Groups are 4 wide. Gaps are 1 wide.\n        *   Indices (1-based): Gap at 13, Group 14-17 (Center), Gap at 18.\n        *   Extrapolating this to the full width: Groups at ..., 4-7, 9-12, 14-17, 19-22, 24-27, ... Gaps at 8, 13, 18, 23, 28.\n    *   **Magenta Bottom Row (e.g., Row 21):** This row forms the \"legs\" of the shapes.\n        *   Pattern consists of `6,6,6` (legs) separated by `0,0` (gaps).\n        *   Gaps are at indices 10-11, 15-16 (Center), 20-21.\n        *   Extrapolating: Gaps at 5-6, 10-11, 15-16, 20-21, 25-26.\n        *   Filled areas (`6,6,6`) at 2-4, 7-9, 12-14, 17-19, 22-24, 27-29.\n\n3.  **Region of Interest (Crop):**\n    *   The gray pixels (5s) are found in Row 12 (cols 8, 9, 28) and Row 13 (cols 8, 27, 28).\n    *   The bounding box defined by these pixels spans **Row 12 to 13** and **Column 8 to 28**.\n    *   We need to generate the pattern for Rows 12 and 13 and crop it to columns 8-28.\n\n**Construction:**\n\n*   **Row 1 (Pattern of Magenta Middle Row, cropped 8-28):**\n    *   The row contains `6,6,6,6` blocks separated by `0`.\n    *   Cols 8-28 cover:\n        *   Col 8: `0` (Gap)\n        *   Cols 9-12: `6,6,6,6`\n        *   Col 13: `0`\n        *   Cols 14-17: `6,6,6,6`\n        *   Col 18: `0`\n        *   Cols 19-22: `6,6,6,6`\n        *   Col 23: `0`\n        *   Cols 24-27: `6,6,6,6`\n        *   Col 28: `0` (Gap)\n    *   Result: `0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0`\n\n*   **Row 2 (Pattern of Magenta Bottom Row, cropped 8-28):**\n    *   The row contains `6,6,6` blocks separated by `0,0`.\n    *   Cols 8-28 cover:\n        *   Cols 8-9: Part of `6,6,6` (indices 7-9). So `6,6`.\n        *   Cols 10-11: `0,0`\n        *   Cols 12-14: `6,6,6`\n        *   Cols 15-16: `0,0`\n        *   Cols 17-19: `6,6,6`\n        *   Cols 20-21: `0,0`\n        *   Cols 22-24: `6,6,6`\n        *   Cols 25-26: `0,0`\n        *   Cols 27-28: Part of `6,6,6` (indices 27-29). So `6,6`.\n    *   Result: `6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6`\n\n0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0\n6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, let's break down this ARC problem. Here's how I'm thinking about it:**\n\nI see three solved examples and one test case. The goal is to generate an output grid based on some pattern observed in the input, and the grey (5) pixels seem to define the key.\n\n**Here's the process I'm using:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the solved examples:**\n    *   Look for recurring patterns in how the input relates to the output.\n    *   Identify the role of the gray (5) pixels: are they markers, bounding boxes, or something else?\n    *   What's the relationship between the colors in the input, and the output?\n2.  **Form a Hypothesis:**\n    *   Can I see a consistent method to predict the output given an input?\n    *   Do the 5's define the location or content of an object?\n3.  **Test the Hypothesis:**\n    *   Verify the hypothesis by applying it to all the solved examples.\n    *   Can the output be predicted in all cases?\n4.  **Apply to the Test Input:**\n    *   Use the confirmed method to generate the output grid.\n\n**Here's the detailed logic:**\n\n*   **Example 1**: I'm seeing a vertical arrangement of colored blocks. I'm focusing on how the grey pixels outline the result's size. It seems the input consists of horizontal objects of variable width, and maybe one is selected by the 5's. The output mirrors the shape and size of something in the input. Is the color selection based on some sequence? In this example, the output resembles a sideways 'C' or 'U' shape. The 5's are bounding the \"target area\". It looks like the region within the 5s, the window, defines the output size. The output color is based on an object outside the window. Is it based on order? Sequence of widths: 2, 3, 4, 5. The next width is 6. The 5s box gives height 3 and width 6, that's a window. It seems to be building a sequence (Bar, Stem, Bar for the output). It appears to show a repeating sequence of a horizontal (full-width) bar, a one row (or similar) stem, and a horizontal bar. The next output is based on a sequence.\n\n*   **Example 2**: I'm seeing vertically stacked objects. The output is a vertically stacked pattern of objects. It has different colors. The output size is defined by the bounding box, determined by the 5's. In this example, the 5s define the 2x14 output and the contents within this region. In Example 2, the 5's form a 14 row by 2-column bounding box. The output grid is 14 rows, and 2 columns. The hypothesis for this example is similar: **the output grid is the region of the input grid defined by the bounding box of the color 5 (gray) pixels.** The key is that it follows a similar structure to Ex 1: generate an object from a sequence, the window is defined by 5's and the pattern or content is repeated. So the output of Ex 2 must be based on repeating the pattern that's behind the bounding box in the input. It appears that the grey bounding box defines the region, and some underlying pattern is copied. This pattern is just repeated in the region.\n\n*   **Example 3**: Here the width is defined by columns of \"7\" 2 and 3. I'm seeing the same thing, the output size is determined by the 5's region. The Output is based on the sequence 7,2,3... This time it is a rectangle where the size is 3 and the 5's width is 2 with height 17. The color 7 is in the sequence (7,2,3). This is similar to Ex 1 and 2, the size from 5s and sequence. The 5s is based on index in sequence? Let's say index in the sequence is number 7.\n*   **Observations:** The 5's define the height and width of the output bounding box. The input consists of repeated patterns of colored shapes, and we choose something to render within the bounding box. The object to choose to render is based on a sequence.\n\n*   **Rule:** **Complete the sequence of objects.** The gray (5) brackets indicate the **location and size** of the next object in the sequence. The size (bounding box of 5s) tells us the dimensions. The task is to define a pattern of color, shape, and size in a horizontal arrangement.\n\n*   **Test\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the task involves identifying a sequence of objects arranged in the grid and using the gray (5) pixels as markers to define a \"target window\" where the next or missing part of the sequence should be generated.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Sequence:**\n    The test input contains horizontal rows of objects that repeat vertically with a shift.\n    -   **Row 1 (y=14-16):** Yellow (4) objects.\n    -   **Row 2 (y=18-20):** Magenta (6) objects.\n    -   **Row 3 (y=22-24):** Yellow (4) objects.\n    -   **Row 4 (y=26-28):** Magenta (6) objects.\n    \n    The pattern alternates colors (Yellow, Magenta) and moves vertically with a spacing of 4 rows (starts at 14, 18, 22, 26). The objects are arranged horizontally with regular spacing.\n\n2.  **Determine Target Parameters:**\n    -   **Location:** The gray markers (5s) are located in rows 11 and 12. Following the vertical spacing of 4, the row preceding the Yellow row at y=14 would start at **y=10**.\n    -   **Color:** Since the rows alternate Yellow, Magenta, Yellow, Magenta... the row at y=10 should be **Magenta (6)** (preceding Yellow).\n    -   **Dimensions:** The markers define a bounding box from column 7 to column 28 (width 22) and rows 11 to 12 (height 2).\n    -   **Shape:** The Magenta objects are 3 rows high.\n        -   Top (Row 1): Two pixels wide (`  XX  `).\n        -   Middle (Row 2): Four pixels wide (` XXXX `).\n        -   Bottom (Row 3): Two \"feet\" with a gap (`XX  XX`).\n    -   Since the target object starts at y=10, the markers at y=11 and y=12 capture the **Middle** and **Bottom** rows of the objects.\n\n3.  **Construct the Pattern:**\n    -   **Object Centers:** By observing the alignment of objects in the grid, the centers for this row extrapolate to indices 4.5, 9.5, 14.5, 19.5, 24.5, 29.5...\n    -   **Row 11 (Middle):** Contains blocks of 4 magenta pixels centered at these points.\n        -   Pattern: `...0 6666 0 6666...`\n        -   Inside the window (cols 7-28): Gaps fall at indices 7, 12, 17, 22, 27. The rest are 6s.\n    -   **Row 12 (Bottom):** Contains feet pattern. The right foot of one object and the left foot of the next overlap to form a block of 3 pixels (`666`).\n        -   Pattern: `...66 000 666 00...` (approx).\n        -   Inside the window (cols 7-28): We see the feet landing.\n            -   Indices 7,8: Overlap of first pair (`66`).\n            -   Indices 11-13: Overlap (`666`).\n            -   Indices 16-18: Overlap (`666`).\n            -   Indices 21-23: Overlap (`666`).\n            -   Indices 26-28: Overlap (`666`).\n            -   Gaps (0s) in between.\n\n4.  **Final Grid Generation:**\n    We construct the 22x2 grid based on these calculated pixel positions.\n\n    **Row 0 (y=11):** `0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6`\n    **Row 1 (y=12):** `6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6`\n\noutput:\n0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify:\n1. The two \"5\" markers that define a rectangular region\n2. What the main pattern would look like if extended to fill that region\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n\nThe two 5-markers are:\n- Upper-left L shape at rows 11-12, cols 7-8: `5,5` / `5`\n- Lower-right L shape at rows 11-12, cols 26-27: `5` / `5,5`\n\nThis defines a region: **2 rows \u00d7 21 columns** (rows 11-12, cols 7-27)\n\n**Understanding the main pattern:**\nThe input has a diamond pattern with alternating colors 4 and 6:\n- Rows 14-16: Color 4 (widest, at top)\n- Rows 18-20: Color 6 (narrower)\n- Rows 22-24: Color 4 (even narrower)\n- Rows 26-28: Color 6 (narrowest)\n\nThe pattern shrinks going down. Going UP from row 14, the pattern would continue with color 6 (following the 4-6 alternation).\n\n**Extending the pattern:**\nRows 11-12 would be part of a 6-colored layer above the existing pattern. Looking at the 6 pattern at rows 18-20:\n\n- Row 19 pattern: `0,6,6,6,6` repeating (period 5)\n- Row 20 pattern: `6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0...` pattern\n\nFor rows 11-12 (corresponding to middle/bottom of a 6 block), extending to cols 7-27:\n\n**Row 11** (like row 19 extended):\nTaking the period-5 pattern `0,6,6,6,6` and extending across 21 columns:\n`0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0`\n\n**Row 12** (like row 20 extended):\nFollowing the pattern `6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6...`:\n`6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,0,0,6,6,6`\n\n```\n0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0\n6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,0,0,6,6,6\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to identify the pattern transformation rule from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\nIn each example, there are two triangular \"5\" markers that define:\n1. The dimensions of the output grid (row span \u00d7 column span between the markers)\n2. Which pattern element to extract and tile\n\n**Example 1:** 5 markers at rows 26-28, cols 19-24 \u2192 Output 3\u00d76. The 2s pattern (3\u00d73) is tiled to fill.\n\n**Example 2:** 5 markers at rows 14-27, cols 19-20 \u2192 Output 14\u00d72. Pattern extracted from rightmost column.\n\n**Example 3:** 5 markers at rows 1-17, cols 25-27 \u2192 Output 17\u00d73. The 7s pattern (2\u00d73) is tiled vertically.\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\nFinding the 5 markers:\n- Upper marker: rows 11-12, cols 7-8 (shape: 5,5 / 5,0)\n- Lower marker: rows 11-12, cols 26-27 (shape: 0,5 / 5,5)\n\nOutput dimensions: 2 rows \u00d7 21 columns (both markers at same rows, spanning cols 7-27)\n\nThe main pattern has 4s and 6s in diagonal stripe formations. Looking at the 4s pattern (rows 14-15):\n- Row 14: 4s appear at specific intervals with pairs\n- Row 15: 4s appear in groups of 4 with gaps\n\nThe repeating 5-column unit starting from col 8:\n- Row 14: `0,4,4,0,0` (pattern period)\n- Row 15: `4,4,4,4,0` (pattern period)\n\nSince output starts at col 7 (one position before the unit start), col 7 gets value 0 from the end of previous unit.\n\nTiling this unit to fill 21 columns (21 = 1 + 4\u00d75):\n- Position 0 (col 7): from previous unit end\n- Positions 1-5, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20: four complete units\n\n**Output Grid:**\n\n```\n0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0\n0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0\n```",

The outputs are built from *nearby regular color blocks*, but reshaped/compressed to exactly match the 5-bounding-box\u2019s size.\n\nFor the **test input**:\n\n1. **Find the 5\u2019s:**\n\n   Non-zero 5\u2019s are at:\n   - Row 11: columns 7, 8, 27\n   - Row 12: columns 7, 26, 27\n\n   So the bounding box of all 5\u2019s is:\n\n   - Rows: 11\u201312 \u2192 height = 2\n   - Columns: 7\u201327 \u2192 width = 21\n\n   Therefore the **output must be 2\u00d721**.\n\n2. **Identify the structured color blocks near the 5\u2019s:**\n\n   Below the 5\u2019s there are two large, very regular blocks:\n\n   - A big block of **4\u2019s** at rows 14\u201316 (directly under the 5\u2019s).\n   - A big block of **6\u2019s** at rows 18\u201320 (next regular block under the 4\u2019s).\n\n   There are smaller 4- and 6-blocks further down, but the first strong, regular ones under the 5\u2019s are this big 4-block and big 6-block.\n\n3. **Construct a 2-row \u201csummary\u201d of those two blocks, aligned under the 5-bounding-box horizontally.**\n\n   The horizontal span of the 5-bounding-box is columns 7\u201327.  \n   So for each of the two rows of output:\n\n   - Take a **representative row** from the corresponding large block.\n   - Restrict it to columns 7\u201327.\n   - Use that as the row of the output.\n\n   For the **4-block**, the clearest representative is its central row, row 15:\n\n   Row 15 input:  \n   `0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0`\n\n   Cropping columns 7\u201327 (inclusive) gives:\n\n   - c7 = 0  \n   - c8 = 4  \n   - c9 = 4  \n   - c10 = 4  \n   - c11 = 4  \n   - c12 = 0  \n   - c13 = 4  \n   - c14 = 4  \n   - c15 = 4  \n   - c16 = 4  \n   - c17 = 0  \n   - c18 = 4  \n   - c19 = 4  \n   - c20 = 4  \n   - c21 = 4  \n   - c22 = 0  \n   - c23 = 4  \n   - c24 = 4  \n   - c25 = 0  \n   - c26 = 0  \n   - c27 = 0  \n\n   So the first output row is:\n\n   `0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0,0,0`\n\n   For the **6-block**, take its central row, row 19:\n\n   Row 19 input:  \n   `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\n   Cropping columns 7\u201327:\n\n   - c7 = 0  \n   - c8 = 6  \n   - c9 = 6  \n   - c10 = 6  \n   - c11 = 6  \n   - c12 = 0  \n   - c13 = 6  \n   - c14 = 6  \n   - c15 = 6  \n   - c16 = 6  \n   - c17 = 0  \n   - c18 = 6  \n   - c19 = 6  \n   - c20 = 6  \n   - c21 = 6  \n   - c22 = 0  \n   - c23 = 0  \n   - c24 = 0  \n   - c25 = 0  \n   - c26 = 0  \n   - c27 = 0  \n\n   So the second output row is:\n\n   `0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\nThus the completed output grid is:\n\n0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0,0,0\n0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Below is the reasoning I used; it is not guaranteed to match the original ARC author\u2019s intent, but it is sufficient to reconstruct the output I produce.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Structural observations on the training examples\n\nAcross the three examples:\n\n- The large input grids are mostly zero, with several colored \u201cbands\u201d or clusters.\n- Color `5` appears sparingly and in separate small clusters, away from the main repeated colored structures.\n- Other non-zero colors (e.g. `{1,2,4}`, `{4,8,9}`, `{7,2,3}`) form structured, repeated motifs.\n\nThe outputs are much smaller grids and focus on **one particular color-pattern band**, ignoring the rest of the grid.\n\nFrom this I infer a rough procedure:\n\n1. **Ignore background (`0`) and the sparse marker color (`5`).**  \n   The main structure is in the other colors.\n2. **Identify the \u201cfeatured\u201d color band** associated with the main repeated pattern in the middle of the image.\n3. **Isolate one full horizontal strip of that band** \u2013 i.e., a few consecutive rows where that color\u2019s pattern is well-formed and most prominent.\n4. **Crop the minimal bounding box around that strip** (including interspersed zeros) and output it as the result.\n\nFor the purposes of this solution, step (2) is approximated as:\n- Choose, among the non-zero colors except `5`, the one forming the **most prominent band** near the center, aligned with the other structured colors.\n- Then pick a representative 2\u20133 row-tall horizontal band of that color where its motif is clearest.\n\nIn the training tasks:\n- Example 1: the clear middle-lower motif of color `2` is chosen and a compact representative band is output.\n- Example 3: the vertical band of `7`-motifs is chosen and a representative strip of its pattern is output.\n- Example 2: the central intertwined `4/8/9` region is summarized in a different, pairwise fashion, but the key commonality I use is still \u201cfocus on the main colored band, ignore `5` and zeros elsewhere, and output a compact representation of that band\u201d.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Applying the heuristic to the test input\n\nIn the test grid, the non-zero colors are `{4,5,6}`:\n\n- `5` occurs only in a small region around rows 12\u201313 and acts as a marker, as in the examples.\n- Large, clear repeated motifs appear for colors `4` and `6`:\n  - Color `4` forms a repeated band around rows 15\u201317 and again around rows 23\u201325.\n  - Color `6` forms a prominent repeated band around rows 19\u201321 and another around rows 27\u201329.\n\nThe central segment of the entire composition is best represented by the **first large `6` band** (rows 19\u201321), which is:\n- Between the `4` band above (rows 15\u201317) and another `4` band below (rows 23\u201325),\n- Conspicuous and structurally similar to the \u201cfeatured\u201d bands in the training examples.\n\nSo I select **color `6`** as the featured color and isolate its first main horizontal band.\n\n#### 2.1. Locating the band of 6\u2019s\n\nFrom the test input:\n\n- Row 19:\n  - 6\u2019s at columns 10\u201311, 15\u201316, 20\u201321\n- Row 20:\n  - 6\u2019s at columns 9\u201312, 14\u201317, 19\u201322\n- Row 21:\n  - 6\u2019s at columns 8\u20139, 12\u201313, 17\u201319, 22\u201323\n\nOverall, for this band:\n- The smallest column index containing a `6` is `8`.\n- The largest column index containing a `6` is `23`.\n- The rows of the band are `19` through `21`.\n\nThus the **minimal bounding box** for this `6` band is:\n- Rows: 19 to 21\n- Columns: 8 to 23\n\n#### 2.2. Extracting that subgrid\n\nTaking rows 19\u201321, columns 8\u201323 from the test input:\n\n- Row 19 (original):\n  - `..., 0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,...`\n  - Columns 8\u201323:  \n    `0,0,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,0,0`\n\n- Row 20 (original):\n  - `..., 0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,0,...`\n  - Columns 8\u201323:  \n    `0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0`\n\n- Row 21 (original):\n  - `...,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,...`\n  - Columns 8\u201323:  \n    `6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6`\n\nNo further modification is applied: we preserve the internal zeros and just crop out everything else.\n\nThis 3\u00d716 block is the final output grid.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Final output grid\n\nHere is the output grid in the same numeric comma-separated format:\n\nRow 1:  \n`0,0,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,0,0`\n\nRow 2:  \n`0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0`\n\nRow 3:  \n`6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6`\n\nSo the completed output is:\n\n0,0,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,0,0\n0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0\n6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6",

        "Full raw LLM response": "The transformation in the solved examples can be seen as taking a repeated alternating \u201cfull row/sparse row\u201d motif from the input, finding its progression in size, and then producing the next motif in the sequence. In the test input the 3\u2011row motifs built from colour\u202f4 and colour\u202f6 repeat down the image, with colour\u202f4 coming next in the colour alternation. The number of groups decreases, so the next motif is a single group of that pattern. Representing that as a compact 3\u00d74 motif with a full row, a sparse row filled on the right, and a full row again gives:\n\n```\n4,4,4,4\n0,0,4,4\n4,4,4,4\n```",
