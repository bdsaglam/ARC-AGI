Here's how I'm thinking about it:**\n\nI see three solved examples and one test case. The goal is to generate an output grid based on some pattern observed in the input, and the grey (5) pixels seem to define the key.\n\n**Here's the process I'm using:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the solved examples:**\n    *   Look for recurring patterns in how the input relates to the output.\n    *   Identify the role of the gray (5) pixels: are they markers, bounding boxes, or something else?\n    *   What's the relationship between the colors in the input, and the output?\n2.  **Form a Hypothesis:**\n    *   Can I see a consistent method to predict the output given an input?\n    *   Do the 5's define the location or content of an object?\n3.  **Test the Hypothesis:**\n    *   Verify the hypothesis by applying it to all the solved examples.\n    *   Can the output be predicted in all cases?\n4.  **Apply to the Test Input:**\n    *   Use the confirmed method to generate the output grid.\n\n**Here's the detailed logic:**\n\n*   **Example 1**: I'm seeing a vertical arrangement of colored blocks. I'm focusing on how the grey pixels outline the result's size. It seems the input consists of horizontal objects of variable width, and maybe one is selected by the 5's. The output mirrors the shape and size of something in the input. Is the color selection based on some sequence? In this example, the output resembles a sideways 'C' or 'U' shape. The 5's are bounding the \"target area\". It looks like the region within the 5s, the window, defines the output size. The output color is based on an object outside the window. Is it based on order? Sequence of widths: 2, 3, 4, 5. The next width is 6. The 5s box gives height 3 and width 6, that's a window. It seems to be building a sequence (Bar, Stem, Bar for the output). It appears to show a repeating sequence of a horizontal (full-width) bar, a one row (or similar) stem, and a horizontal bar. The next output is based on a sequence.\n\n*   **Example 2**: I'm seeing vertically stacked objects. The output is a vertically stacked pattern of objects. It has different colors. The output size is defined by the bounding box, determined by the 5's. In this example, the 5s define the 2x14 output and the contents within this region. In Example 2, the 5's form a 14 row by 2-column bounding box. The output grid is 14 rows, and 2 columns. The hypothesis for this example is similar: **the output grid is the region of the input grid defined by the bounding box of the color 5 (gray) pixels.** The key is that it follows a similar structure to Ex 1: generate an object from a sequence, the window is defined by 5's and the pattern or content is repeated. So the output of Ex 2 must be based on repeating the pattern that's behind the bounding box in the input. It appears that the grey bounding box defines the region, and some underlying pattern is copied. This pattern is just repeated in the region.\n\n*   **Example 3**: Here the width is defined by columns of \"7\" 2 and 3. I'm seeing the same thing, the output size is determined by the 5's region. The Output is based on the sequence 7,2,3... This time it is a rectangle where the size is 3 and the 5's width is 2 with height 17. The color 7 is in the sequence (7,2,3). This is similar to Ex 1 and 2, the size from 5s and sequence. The 5s is based on index in sequence? Let's say index in the sequence is number 7.\n*   **Observations:** The 5's define the height and width of the output bounding box. The input consists of repeated patterns of colored shapes, and we choose something to render within the bounding box. The object to choose to render is based on a sequence.\n\n*   **Rule:** **Complete the sequence of objects.** The gray (5) brackets indicate the **location and size** of the next object in the sequence. The size (bounding box of 5s) tells us the dimensions. The task is to define a pattern of color, shape, and size in a horizontal arrangement.\n\n*   **Test\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the task involves identifying a sequence of objects arranged in the grid and using the gray (5) pixels as markers to define a \"target window\" where the next or missing part of the sequence should be generated.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Sequence:**\n    The test input contains horizontal rows of objects that repeat vertically with a shift.\n    -   **Row 1 (y=14-16):** Yellow (4) objects.\n    -   **Row 2 (y=18-20):** Magenta (6) objects.\n    -   **Row 3 (y=22-24):** Yellow (4) objects.\n    -   **Row 4 (y=26-28):** Magenta (6) objects.\n    \n    The pattern alternates colors (Yellow, Magenta) and moves vertically with a spacing of 4 rows (starts at 14, 18, 22, 26). The objects are arranged horizontally with regular spacing.\n\n2.  **Determine Target Parameters:**\n    -   **Location:** The gray markers (5s) are located in rows 11 and 12. Following the vertical spacing of 4, the row preceding the Yellow row at y=14 would start at **y=10**.\n    -   **Color:** Since the rows alternate Yellow, Magenta, Yellow, Magenta... the row at y=10 should be **Magenta (6)** (preceding Yellow).\n    -   **Dimensions:** The markers define a bounding box from column 7 to column 28 (width 22) and rows 11 to 12 (height 2).\n    -   **Shape:** The Magenta objects are 3 rows high.\n        -   Top (Row 1): Two pixels wide (`  XX  `).\n        -   Middle (Row 2): Four pixels wide (` XXXX `).\n        -   Bottom (Row 3): Two \"feet\" with a gap (`XX  XX`).\n    -   Since the target object starts at y=10, the markers at y=11 and y=12 capture the **Middle** and **Bottom** rows of the objects.\n\n3.  **Construct the Pattern:**\n    -   **Object Centers:** By observing the alignment of objects in the grid, the centers for this row extrapolate to indices 4.5, 9.5, 14.5, 19.5, 24.5, 29.5...\n    -   **Row 11 (Middle):** Contains blocks of 4 magenta pixels centered at these points.\n        -   Pattern: `...0 6666 0 6666...`\n        -   Inside the window (cols 7-28): Gaps fall at indices 7, 12, 17, 22, 27. The rest are 6s.\n    -   **Row 12 (Bottom):** Contains feet pattern. The right foot of one object and the left foot of the next overlap to form a block of 3 pixels (`666`).\n        -   Pattern: `...66 000 666 00...` (approx).\n        -   Inside the window (cols 7-28): We see the feet landing.\n            -   Indices 7,8: Overlap of first pair (`66`).\n            -   Indices 11-13: Overlap (`666`).\n            -   Indices 16-18: Overlap (`666`).\n            -   Indices 21-23: Overlap (`666`).\n            -   Indices 26-28: Overlap (`666`).\n            -   Gaps (0s) in between.\n\n4.  **Final Grid Generation:**\n    We construct the 22x2 grid based on these calculated pixel positions.\n\n    **Row 0 (y=11):** `0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6`\n    **Row 1 (y=12):** `6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6`\n\noutput:\n0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n<REASONING_MODEL_B model_id=\"gemini-3-high_3_step_3\">\n**Solving the ARC Task: My Thought Process**\n\nAlright, I'm diving into this ARC task. The user wants me to crack a pattern based on examples and a test input. Let's see...\n\nI start with Example 1, a 30x30 grid with a weird structure at the bottom right.  It's got some colors: blue, red, yellow, and gray.  I try to break down the non-black pixels, focusing on their arrangement.  Looks like vertical towers, some \"behind\" others. The output, a 3x6 grid, seems *way* smaller, a real head-scratcher.\n\nThe gray pixels grab my attention. In ARC, they're often a \"selector\" or a \"mask.\"  I pinpoint the coordinates of these gray pixels. It looks like they outline a rectangle! Hey! The output's dimensions perfectly match the dimensions defined by those gray pixels, a 3x6 rectangle.\n\nThen the red pixels in the input catches my eye. If I look to the left, I find that a red \"E-shape\" or a \"U shape on its side\", spanning a bounding box that's wider than it is high. The output is all red, but it doesn't look like any of the shapes in the input.\n\nIt's all about that gray region. Now, let's look for a deeper pattern! I think. The gray pixels are pointing me at the right horizontal and vertical spans:\nRow 26, Cols 19-24, looks like 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0.\nRow 27, 5,0,0,0,5.\nRow 28, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5,5.\n\nBut the output is all red! Maybe the gray pixels are an instruction, telling me *where* to look. Or maybe they are instructing me to *transform* the pattern I see around the pixels to the left. I start noticing some width-based objects to the left:\nBlue width is 5\nYellow is 4\nRed is 3\nGray area is width 6.\nSo it is some sort of width-based sequence, leading to the gray region. And the color matches the sequence: 2,4,1,2. Ah, ha! I think I've got it.\n\nOkay, let's test it on Example 2. It has gray markers at the top and bottom of a long region. This is likely an indication I need to horizontally continue a pattern to the region specified by the gray marker. And, that's what seems to happen!\n\nNow, Example 3, has a diagonal pattern with 7s, 2s, and 3s. There are gray markers that tell me what the pattern at the end of the input will be. It's essentially extending the pattern by one iteration, which is the sequence 7, 2, 3...\nSo the pattern seems to be: extend the sequence to the target region.\n\nTest input time!  The new input has a bunch of \"5\" pixels in it, defining the target, and I need to figure out what it's supposed to look like based on the previous objects.\n\nI map the sequence from above into this new test input, and I construct a final result! \n\n\nThe problem asks us to solve an ARC task where we must infer a transformation rule from examples and apply it to a test input.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Example 1:** The input contains several colored \"objects\" (Red, Yellow, Blue) arranged horizontally. A box defined by gray (5) pixels appears to the right of the sequence. The output grid matches the dimensions of this gray box. The content of the output is a Red (2) shape.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The objects form a sequence.\n        *   Red object (width 3).\n        *   Yellow object (width 4).\n        *   Blue object (width 5).\n        *   The gray box has width 6.\n        *   The sequence of widths is 3, 4, 5, -> 6.\n        *   The sequence of colors is 2, 4, 1. If this cycles (2, 4, 1, 2...), the next color is 2.\n        *   The output is a generated object of color 2 and width 6, following the morphological pattern of the previous objects (top/bottom full, middle row ends-only).\n\n2.  **Example 2:** The input contains a repeating background pattern of vertical columns. Two gray markers define a rectangular region. The output matches the size of this region and contains the continuation of the background pattern (colors 9, 8, 4) that would logically exist in that space.\n\n3.  **Example 3:** The input contains a diagonal/wave pattern of objects (7, 2, 3...). A gray box defines a target region. The output is filled with the pattern of the object (7) that logically belongs in that column based on the horizontal sequence (7, 2, 3, 7, 2, -> 3, -> 7).\n\n**General Rule:**\nThe gray pixels define a **target region**. The task is to identify the underlying pattern or sequence of objects in the grid (extrapolating position, size, color, and shape) and generate the content that should logically fill that target region.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Identify Target Region:**\n    *   Gray pixels (5) are found in Row 11 (cols 7, 8, 27) and Row 12 (cols 7, 27, 28).\n    *   These mark the corners of a rectangular region from **Row 11 to Row 12** and **Column 7 to Column 28**.\n    *   Output dimensions: Height 2, Width 22.\n\n2.  **Analyze Grid Patterns:**\n    *   The grid consists of horizontal layers of objects.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom, Rows 26-28):** Pink (6) objects. Centers are at x = ..., 14.5, 19.5, ... (Interleaved positions).\n    *   **Layer 2 (Rows 22-24):** Yellow (4) objects. Centers are at x = 7, 12, 17, 22, 27 (Aligned positions).\n    *   **Layer 3 (Rows 18-20):** Pink (6) objects. Interleaved.\n    *   **Layer 4 (Rows 14-16):** Yellow (4) objects. Aligned.\n    *   **Layer 5 (Target, Rows 10-12):** This continues the vertical sequence.\n    *   **Sequence:** Pink, Yellow, Pink, Yellow, -> **Pink**.\n    *   Therefore, the target region should contain **Pink (6)** objects.\n\n3.  **Determine Object Properties:**\n    *   **Position:** Pink objects in this grid are \"interleaved\", meaning they are centered halfway between the Yellow objects. Yellow centers are 7, 12, 17, 22, 27 (gap 5). Pink centers are 4.5, 9.5, 14.5, 19.5, 24.5, 29.5.\n    *   **Vertical Alignment:** The layers are separated by 1 row of zeros. Layer 4 is 14-16. Layer 5 (Target) is 10-12.\n    *   **Shape:** Based on Pink objects in layers 1 and 3:\n        *   **Top Row:** Width 2 centered.\n        *   **Middle Row:** Width 4 centered (Indices: center-1.5 to center+1.5).\n        *   **Bottom Row:** \"Legs\" at the edges. Indices: [center-2.5, center-1.5] and [center+1.5, center+2.5]. Note that legs of adjacent objects merge (e.g., right leg of 9.5 and left leg of 14.5 overlap/touch).\n\n4.  **Generate Output:**\n    *   The target region (Rows 11-12) corresponds to the **Middle** and **Bottom** rows of the Pink objects (since the full object is height 3, occupying rows 10-12).\n    *   We need to fill the output (2 x 22) with the Middle and Bottom rows of Pink objects centered at 9.5, 14.5, 19.5, 24.5, and the edges of objects at 4.5 and 29.5 if they overlap.\n    *   **Row 0 (Middle Row):**\n        *   Objects are 4 pixels wide (e.g., center 9.5 spans 8-11).\n        *   Cols 8-11, 13-16, 18-21, 23-26, 28-31.\n        *   Mapped to output cols (grid col - 7):\n            *   Grid 8-11 -> Out 1-4.\n            *   Grid 13-16 -> Out 6-9.\n            *   Grid 18-21 -> Out 11-14.\n            *   Grid 23-26 -> Out 16-19.\n            *   Grid 28 -> Out 21.\n    *   **Row 1 (Bottom Row):**\n        *   Legs span 2 pixels at outer edges (e.g., center 9.5 has legs 7-8 and 11-12).\n        *   Adjacent legs merge/touch (e.g., 11-12 and 12-13 create a block 11-13).\n        *   Resulting pattern segments (Grid indices):\n            *   (4.5 Right Leg 6-7 + 9.5 Left Leg 7-8) -> **7, 8** are filled.\n            *   (9.5 Right Leg 11-12 + 14.5 Left Leg 12-13) -> **11, 12, 13** are filled.\n            *   (14.5 Right + 19.5 Left) -> **16, 17, 18** filled.\n            *   (19.5 Right + 24.5 Left) -> **21, 22, 23** filled.\n            *   (24.5 Right + 29.5 Left) -> **26, 27, 28** filled.\n        *   Mapped to output cols:\n            *   Grid 7-8 -> Out 0-1.\n            *   Grid 11-13 -> Out 4-6.\n            *   Grid 16-18 -> Out 9-11.\n            *   Grid 21-23 -> Out 14-16.\n            *   Grid 26-28 -> Out 19-21.\n\noutput:\n0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6\n</REASONING_MODEL_B>\n<REASONING_MODEL_C model_id=\"gemini-3-high_12_step_5_opus_gen_sol\">\n**Okay, let's break this down.** I'm being asked to solve an ARC puzzle using the rules I've deduced from three solved examples and a test input. I need to figure out a transformation rule and explain my reasoning, then apply it to the test data. I'm given some hints to get me started.\n\n**First, I need to understand the task.**  I'm looking at a 30x30 grid, and my goal is to figure out how to transform a given input into an output. The examples are crucial here. I need to identify the pattern and how it applies.\n\n**The \"Object\" Description seems key.** I'm given hints about what objects are in the grid, but I must verify if the given description is true by analyzing the examples.  I need to find the rule. The examples tell a story: find some marked region, and extract a pattern there.\n\n**Let's start with Example 1.** I need to understand how the output relates to the input. The color 5 markers are the most important here.  I noticed that the L-shaped markers seem to define a region. I need to know how. The markers are made of the digit 5.  This means they are markers. Then I examine the raw data.  I need to trace the marker shapes in the examples. Rows and columns contain the data.  A corner shape is defined. I need to find the box dimensions. How high, how wide. What is inside? I deduce the width and the height. What is the pattern? Where is the connection to the pattern and to the output? It's all about the box. The output seems to be related to the objects inside. Where do they come from? I look for other colors (objects).  There is a repeated 2 pattern on the side.  The marker area looks empty. I need to understand how the marker bounds connect to the output. Is the output a subsection of an adjacent object?\n\n**The Transformation Description hint is crucial.** It's about \"selecting appropriate colored pattern.\" I must figure out what \"nearest to\" means in this context. It seems that the pattern selection is based on the region. And that region is defined by the L-shaped Markers. In Ex 1, I noticed a color 2 object, and I see a possible mapping from the color 2 object to the output. I start with the rows that the marker defines and then find if those rows match the output. I need to trace this in the other examples to prove this point. I need to deduce that the markers define the *bounding box*, and then use a slice of the given shape inside the bounding box. Is that all?  This looks like a *horizontal stretch*. The dimensions must match up.\n\n**Example 2 seems different.** There's a diamond pattern. I need to verify that this is similar. This time it seems the L-marker defined region is *Vertical*!   The bounding box dimension is very tall, and the output is vertical. This is different!  Maybe the markers define the output window.  I start the analysis again from raw data.   I extract all of the 5.  I deduce the rows and columns. This confirms this is tall. Is the pattern periodic? I check for the periodic parts in this object. This means tracing the columns of a diamond in all rows that match the L-mark's defined area.  This diamond has a period of 3 columns, if I remove one. The markers have a width of 2.  Then I start again to read the provided text.  I must verify that I got it correct.  There is a specific word in the hint: I must *extract* a pattern, not create one. So the bounding box is the output box. The bounding box is a window over the pattern. I check the periodicity by extracting a specific sequence of digits. I can verify it in the input.\n\n**Example 3 is the most complicated.** It has an object 7 pattern! Now the \"Object selection\" is more tricky, or seems more tricky. The key here is there is a recurring object 7 pattern.  Again, L-mark, draw rows and cols for the bounding box. The given digit is 5.  I need to find the object and extract the pattern. How does that object 7 pattern match the generated pattern? The dimensions, once more, are the keys.  The markers define the output window.  And the bounding box matches with a number from the repeating series. The number 7 seems critical here.  I must read the provided hints again! \"Horizontal and Vertical\". OK. Check all of those colors.  Now find periodicity.  There seems to be a vertical periodicity. Each column has its pattern. All examples seem similar. I need to prove that the vertical or horizontal alignment is correct.\n\n**The \"Extrapolation\" logic\n\nTo solve this problem, I will follow the steps derived from the analysis of the solved examples and the test input properties.\n\n**1. Analyze Input and Locate Markers:**\nThe input grid contains two L-shaped markers in color 5 (grey).\n- **Left Marker:** Located at rows 11-12, columns 7-8. The pixels are `(11,7)`, `(11,8)`, and `(12,7)`. This forms a `\u250c` shape (top-left corner).\n- **Right Marker:** Located at rows 11-12, columns 27-28. The pixels are `(11,27)`, `(12,27)`, and `(12,28)`. This forms a `\u2514` shape (bottom-left corner).\n- **Bounding Box:** The region defined by the extremes of these markers is from Row 11 to Row 12 (Height = 2) and from Column 7 to Column 28 (Width = 22).\n- **Output Dimensions:** The output grid will be 2 rows high and 22 columns wide.\n\n**2. Identify the Target Pattern:**\nI need to determine what pattern to fill into this bounding box.\n- **Existing Objects:** The grid contains a series of horizontal \"wave\" or \"peak\" patterns stacked vertically.\n    - Rows 26-28: Color 6 pattern.\n    - Rows 22-24: Color 4 pattern.\n    - Rows 18-20: Color 6 pattern.\n    - Rows 14-16: Color 4 pattern.\n- **Series Logic:**\n    - **Position:** The objects are spaced 4 rows apart (starts at 26, 22, 18, 14). Following this sequence upwards, the next object would start at Row 10 (14 - 4 = 10) and span Rows 10-12.\n    - **Color:** The colors alternate: 6, 4, 6, 4. The next color in the sequence (for the object at 10-12) should be **Color 6**.\n- **Target Selection:** The markers are located at Rows 11-12. This corresponds to the middle and bottom rows of the hypothetical \"phantom\" object at Rows 10-12. Therefore, we need to generate the **Color 6 wave pattern**, specifically its middle and bottom rows.\n\n**3. Extract Pattern Rules:**\nI will derive the repeating structure of the Color 6 wave pattern using the existing object at Rows 18-20 (or 26-28).\n- **Base Object (Rows 18-20):**\n    - **Top Row (18):** Corresponds to the hypothetical Row 10.\n    - **Middle Row (19):** Corresponds to the hypothetical Row 11 (Output Row 1).\n        - Looking at Input Row 19, the pattern is `...6,6,6,6,0...`.\n        - Aligned to Column 7 (start of our output), the pattern repeats every 5 columns: `0, 6, 6, 6, 6`.\n        - Verification at Col 7 (index 0): `0`. Col 8-11: `6,6,6,6`. Col 12: `0`. Matches input.\n    - **Bottom Row (20):** Corresponds to the hypothetical Row 12 (Output Row 2).\n        - Looking at Input Row 20, the pattern is `...6,6,0,0,6...`.\n        - Aligned to Column 7, the pattern repeats every 5 columns: `6, 6, 0, 0, 6`.\n        - Verification at Col 7-8: `6,6`. Col 9-10: `0,0`. Col 11: `6`. Matches input.\n\n**4. Construct Output:**\nI will fill the 2x22 output grid by repeating the identified base units for the calculated rows.\n- **Row 1 (Pattern Row Mid):** Repeat `0, 6, 6, 6, 6` for 22 columns.\n    - Sequence: `0,6,6,6,6` `0,6,6,6,6` `0,6,6,6,6` `0,6,6,6,6` `0,6`\n- **Row 2 (Pattern Row Bot):** Repeat `6, 6, 0, 0, 6` for 22 columns.\n    - Sequence: `6,6,0,0,6` `6,6,0,0,6` `6,6,0,0,6` `6,6,0,0,6` `6,6`\n\n**Final Output Grid:**\n0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6\n</REASONING_MODEL_C>\n</CANDIDATE 1>\n<CANDIDATE 2>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 2x21\n066660666606666066660\n660066600666006600666\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_2_step_1\">\nLooking at the examples, I need to identify:\n1.

I've got a detailed description of how the pixels are arranged, and I'm supposed to use these examples to work out the rules.\n\n1.  **Understand the Basics**: The inputs are large 30x30 grids with colored pixels.\n2.  **Analyze the Examples**: I have three solved examples that show input and output grids.\n3.  **Object & Transform Description**: There are descriptions of shapes (like columns, ladders, etc.) and what I'm supposed to do to them (find a \"bounding box,\" and extract a pattern).\n\nNow, let's break this down.\n\n**The Strategy**\n\n*   **Marker Box is Key**:  There are \"L-shaped markers\" (color 5) that define an area or a \"bounding box.\" This looks to determine the size of the output.\n*   **Find the Target**:  There is a \"primary complex object.\" I need to find the specific pattern it matches within the new grid.  The description is hinting at a \"Stepped Structure\" (color 4) for the test input. Let's see if this plays out.\n*   **Alignment is Crucial**: I have to \"align\" something. The idea of the transformation is to shift the target to the correct position (the vertical positioning seems important in this shift).\n*   **Extract and Crop**: The next step is to grab the pattern from the \"object,\" and then \"crop\" it down to the same width as the bounding box.\n\n**Going Through the Examples**\n\n*   **Example 1**: The markers look like L shapes. I have to verify where they are exactly. I'm noting the output is 3x6. Now, what's inside this 3x6 area? There are several items but there are objects with width 1 that are vertical.\n\n    *   The description is telling me to find the \"primary complex object\".\n    *   Example 1 Output is:\n        ```\n        2,2,2,2,2,2\n        2,0,0,0,0,0\n        2,2,2,2,2,2\n        ```\n    *   This looks like a \"U\" shape or two vertical lines with a connecting line. There's an object with the color 2 that I should be tracking.\n    *   Why are the output pixels 2? The shape described and labeled \"Bracket Shape.\"\n\n    I have to figure out how these values relate to the positions.  The \"align vertical start\" rule is key.  Are the markers defining a \"view\" of the input? Let's check the marker window vs. the \"Bracket Shape\" in the input again.  The width of the marker box is 6, and the bracket is 3...hmm.  Maybe the pattern is repeated to fill the marker box?\n\n*   **Example 2**: Two sets of markers (at different rows) are defined in the problem. The markers are at rows 14-15 and 27-28 in the input.\n\n    *   I'm looking at \"complex columns\" to find the object. It's repeating vertically. It looks like it is capturing a single column, shifted. There is \"0\" padding so the content may not be continuous in the input.\n    *   Output matches, column pattern of input (9,8).\n    *   The text is implying that this will be similar. But where is the alignment happening? The output is rows 14-27.\n    *   Align markers to the complex object? \"Align the vertical start of the marker box with the vertical start of the object.\" Is this a shift?\n\n*   **Example 3**:  It shows \"Ladder Objects\" and how to find them.\n\n    *   I should scan for patterns, specifically color 7. The markers here are also top and bottom, similar to Example 2.\n\n**Key Observations So Far**\n\n1.  **Markers Define Size**: The L-shaped markers definitely determine the size of the output. I need to be exact about where those markers are.\n2.  **Object Type**: The *type* of object I'm looking for is based on the problem.\n3.  **Horizontal Crop**: The final output width *appears* to be the same as the marker width.\n4.  **Vertical Shift?** The outputs always match *some* section of the target objects. The \u201calign\u201d instruction might involve some up/down shifting of the relevant part of the input.\n\n**Applying to the Test Input**\n\nI need to apply everything I've\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to interpret the transformation rule based on the provided examples and descriptions.\n\n**Transformation Logic:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Marker Box:** Locate the \"L-shaped\" markers (Color 5) in the grid. These markers define a bounding box that determines the dimensions (Height and Width) of the output grid.\n    *   In the Test Input, we find Color 5 markers in rows 11 and 12.\n    *   The top-left marker configuration is at `(Row 11, Col 7)` and `(Row 12, Col 7)`.\n    *   The bottom-right marker configuration is at `(Row 11, Col 27)` and `(Row 12, Col 28)`.\n    *   This defines a bounding box spanning **Rows 11 to 12** (Height = 2) and **Columns 7 to 28** (Width = 22).\n\n2.  **Locate the Primary Complex Object:** The prompt explicitly asks to locate the \"Stepped Structure, Color 4\".\n    *   Scanning the grid for Color 4, we find the first such structure starting at **Row 14**.\n    *   Looking at the columns in Row 14, the first pixel of this object appears at **Column 5**.\n\n3.  **Align and Extract:**\n    *   **Vertical Alignment:** The instruction \"Align the vertical start of the marker box with the vertical start of the object\" implies we calculate the offset between the marker start row (11) and the object start row (14). We then extract the number of rows corresponding to the marker box height (2 rows). Thus, we extract **Rows 14 and 15**.\n    *   **Horizontal Alignment:** Based on Example 2 and 3, where the output captures the object regardless of its horizontal position relative to the markers, we align the start of our extraction window with the start of the object. The marker box width is 22. The object starts at Column 5. So we extract 22 columns starting from Column 5 (Columns 5 to 26).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Grid Row 14 (Object Row 1):**\n    Original: `...0, 4, 0,0,0, 4,4, 0,0,0, 4,4, 0,0,0, 4,4, 0,0,0, 4, 0...`\n    Extraction (Cols 5-26): `4, 0,0,0, 4,4, 0,0,0, 4,4, 0,0,0, 4,4, 0,0,0, 4, 0,0`\n\n*   **Grid Row 15 (Object Row 2):**\n    Original: `...0, 4,4, 0, 4,4,4,4, 0, 4,4,4,4, 0, 4,4,4,4, 0, 4,4, 0...`\n    Extraction (Cols 5-26): `4,4, 0, 4,4,4,4, 0, 4,4,4,4, 0, 4,4,4,4, 0, 4,4, 0,0`\n\nThe resulting 2x22 grid is the solution.\n\n4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,0\n4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0,0\n</REASONING_MODEL_B>\n</CANDIDATE 23>\n<CANDIDATE 25>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 2x21\n400044000440004400040\n440444404444044440440\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_5_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n**Problem Decomposition and Pattern Recognition**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants me to solve an ARC task, likely involving some image manipulation. Based on the examples, I see this as a pattern recognition and transformation problem, essentially a \"find the rule\" type of challenge. The examples provide the key, and my job is to crack the code.\n\n**Initial Analysis and Hypothesis**\n\nI'm starting by breaking down each example into its core components. I'm looking for distinct objects, repeating patterns, and clues about the input-output relationship. The significantly smaller output size hints at some form of summarization, cropping, or feature extraction. The presence of those \"separator\" pixels in the input is intriguing, I need to understand their role.\n\n**Detailed Example Inspection**\n\nLet's dissect Example 1. There's a clear repeating structure, but also some unique features. I'm focusing on those colored shapes, especially the ones near the bottom. They look like characters or codes. The grey pixels seem crucial, forming a specific shape. I'm wondering if this grey shape acts as an index or a key, selecting a corresponding output.\nAfter that detailed look I am coming up with this: I noticed that shapes are repeated or are encoded by colors.\nI noticed a set of distinct columns and rows of shapes: these shapes are made of other sub-shapes, and are in a very specific order.\nThe output shape is one of them, but not any in the input.\n\n**Refining the Approach**\n\nAha! The grey shape isn't just a random element; it defines the output's size and, more importantly, hints at a dictionary or table of mappings.\nMaybe the Grey shapes are delimiters or indexes to a source and destination, and the output is one of the source shapes.\n\n**Hypothesis Testing**\n\nNow, I'm going to test this theory rigorously. I'll meticulously compare the grey shape's characteristics to the output in each example. For example, in Ex 1, I believe the output is the shape pointed to by the Grey Object. I suspect there is a simple offset function that takes the current shape and makes the output.\nIn Ex 2, a similar approach will be taken, though I suspect the logic is different there and more complex as I see multiple colors in the output, hinting at composition.\nAnd so on, to each example.\n\n**The Bigger Picture**\nThe goal now becomes to find the underlying rule of pattern.\nThe grey shape seems to define a window on the input and somehow, we are extracting the object in that window and doing something to it.\n\n**The Test Input**\nLet's see the Test Input.\nThe test input is similar to the first example: the Grey shape defines a rectangular region and, the non-grey values in the test grid is something to be \"queried\" using the values of the box.\n\n**Final Analysis and Solution**\n\nThe algorithm is defined to crop a region based on the grey area and then project it to the output, and do this across a set of inputs and outputs.\nNow that it's all defined, I can write the logic.\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the test input grid into an output grid based on the logic inferred from the three solved examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:**\n    *   The input grids contain various colorful patterns/objects and a specific set of **Grey (5)** pixels.\n    *   The Grey (5) pixels form a bounding box or \"brackets\" that seem to define a region of interest.\n    *   The Output grids are significantly smaller than the inputs and contain patterns that resemble parts of the input objects.\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule - \"Crop and Capture\":**\n    *   In **Example 3**, the Grey pixels define a tall, thin rectangular region (17x3) on the right side of the grid. The output is exactly 17x3 and contains the pattern of the Orange (7) object found on the left side of the grid. The rule appears to be: use the dimensions of the Grey bounding box to create a \"crop window,\" project this window horizontally to the left-most object, and capture the content.\n    *   In **Example 1**, the Grey pixels define a 3x6 region. The output is 3x6 and contains a pattern derived from the Red (2) object.\n    *   In **Example 2**, the Grey pixels define a 14x2 region. The output is 14x2.\n\n3.  **Application to Test Input:**\n    *   **Grey (5) Markers:** In the Test Input, the Grey pixels are located in rows 11 and 12.\n        *   Left markers: `5,5` at cols 7,8 and `5` at col 7 (row 12).\n        *   Right markers: `5` at col 26 (row 11) and `5,5` at cols 26,27 (row 12).\n        *   These markers define a bounding box spanning **Rows 11-12** (Height 2) and **Columns 7-27** (Width 21).\n    *   **Projection:** Unlike the other examples where the \"crop window\" was side-by-side with the objects, here the crop window is **above** the objects. The objects (Yellow shapes) start at Row 14. This suggests a **Vertical Projection** downwards.\n    *   **Capture:** We translate the 2x21 crop window downwards to the first non-zero object it encounters. The first object is the Yellow (4) structure starting at Row 14.\n    *   **Alignment:** We align the start of the object (Column 5) with the start of the crop window relative to the object's structure, or simply capture the pattern corresponding to the window's width. In Example 3, the capture aligned the top-left of the box with the top-left of the object. Here, we align the left of the crop box (Col 7) with the left of the object? Or simply capture the object's extent?\n    *   Looking closely at Example 3, the window was 3 wide, and the object was 3 wide. The capture was exact.\n    *   In the Test Input, the Grey box is width 21 (Cols 7-27). The Yellow object is width 20 (Cols 5-24). However, typically in ARC, we align the \"start\" of the container with the \"start\" of the content.\n    *   Aligning the start (left-most pixel) of the Yellow object (Col 5) with the start of the capture window implies we extract 21 pixels starting from Col 5.\n\n**Execution:**\n*   **Source Rows:** Row 14 and Row 15 (the top 2 rows of the Yellow object).\n*   **Source Columns:** Starting at Column 5, length 21 (Columns 5 through 25).\n*   **Data Extraction:**\n    *   **Row 14 (Input):** `...0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,0...`\n        *   Extract cols 5-25: `4`, `0,0,0`, `4,4`, `0,0,0`, `4,4`, `0,0,0`, `4,4`, `0,0,0`, `4`, `0`.\n        *   Result: `4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,0`\n    *   **Row 15 (Input):** `...0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0...`\n        *   Extract cols 5-25: `4,4`, `0`, `4,4,4,4`, `0`, `4,4,4,4`, `0`, `4,4,4,4`, `0`, `4,4`, `0`.\n        *   Result: `4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0`\n\nThe output is a 2x21 grid containing these values.\n\n4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,0\n4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n<REASONING_MODEL_B model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\nThe grey markers in the test input appear only on rows\u202f12\u201313.

Find the marker bounding box (color 5)\n\nIn the test input, the non\u2011zero pixels of color `5` are:\n\n- Top marker (an L\u2011shape on the left):\n  - (row 11, col 7)\n  - (row 11, col 8)\n  - (row 12, col 7)\n\n- Top marker (an L\u2011shape on the right):\n  - (row 11, col 27)\n  - (row 12, col 26)\n  - (row 12, col 27)\n\n(Using 0\u2011based indexing for rows and columns.)\n\nThe bounding box that contains all 5\u2011pixels therefore has:\n\n- Top row = 11\n- Bottom row = 12  \u2192 height \\(H = 12 - 11 + 1 = 2\\)\n- Left column = 7\n- Right column = 27 \u2192 width \\(W = 27 - 7 + 1 = 21\\)\n\nSo the **output grid must be 2 rows by 21 columns**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Locate the primary complex object (stepped 4\u2011structure)\n\nLooking at the test grid, the first substantial non\u2011marker structure is a stepped structure made of color `4` in rows 15\u201317, then repeated lower down. According to your description, this is the \u201cprimary complex object (Stepped Structure, Color 4)\u201d.\n\nWe take the *first* occurrence of this 4\u2011structure as the primary object.\n\nIn that object, the earliest (topmost) row containing a 4 is:\n\n- **Object top row** = 15 (0\u2011based)\n\nThe leftmost 4 of that object is at:\n\n- **Object left column** = 5\n\n(From row 15, col 5 = 4.)\n\n---\n\n### 3. Align marker box vertically with the object\n\nPer your rule:\n\n> Align the vertical start of the marker box with the vertical start of the object.\n\n- Marker box height \\(H = 2\\).\n- Object top row = 15.\n\nSo we take **2 consecutive rows from the object starting at row 15**:\n\n- Rows 15 and 16 of the input.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Extract these rows from the object\n\nWe now look at rows 15 and 16 in the test input.\n\nRow 15 (full, indices 0\u201329):\n`0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 16 (full, indices 0\u201329):\n`0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0`\n\n---\n\n### 5. Crop horizontally to match the marker box width\n\nThe marker box width is \\(W = 21\\).  \nWe crop these two rows starting from the **leftmost 4 of the primary object**, i.e. column 5, and take 21 cells (columns 5 through 25 inclusive).\n\n#### Row 15, columns 5\u201325:\n\nIndices and values:\n\n- c5 = 4  \n- c6 = 0  \n- c7 = 0  \n- c8 = 0  \n- c9 = 4  \n- c10 = 4  \n- c11 = 0  \n- c12 = 0  \n- c13 = 0  \n- c14 = 4  \n- c15 = 4  \n- c16 = 0  \n- c17 = 0  \n- c18 = 0  \n- c19 = 4  \n- c20 = 4  \n- c21 = 0  \n- c22 = 0  \n- c23 = 0  \n- c24 = 4  \n- c25 = 0  \n\nSo row 0 of the output is:\n`4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,0`\n\n#### Row 16, columns 5\u201325:\n\n- c5 = 4  \n- c6 = 4  \n- c7 = 0  \n- c8 = 4  \n- c9 = 4  \n- c10 = 4  \n- c11 = 4  \n- c12 = 0  \n- c13 = 4  \n- c14 = 4  \n- c15 = 4  \n- c16 = 4  \n- c17 = 0  \n- c18 = 4  \n- c19 = 4  \n- c20 = 4  \n- c21 = 4  \n- c22 = 0  \n- c23 = 4  \n- c24 = 4  \n- c25 = 0  \n\nSo row 1 of the output is:\n`4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0`\n\n---\n\n### 6. Final output grid\n\nPutting those two cropped rows together, the resulting 2\u00d721 grid is:\n\n```\n4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,0\n4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_C>\n</CANDIDATE 25>\n</INPUT_DATA>\n\n<AUDIT_PROTOCOL>\nExecute this pipeline sequentially for every Candidate.

                "response": "**Solution Path for ARC Puzzle**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of the problem. It looks like the user wants me to go through and analyze some proposed solutions for an ARC puzzle. I'll need to really dig into the example cases to figure out the underlying logic and then test the solutions against that.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n1.  **Example 1:**\n    *   I see a grid, with a sequence of colored objects in some regions, markers in a block near them. The markers seem to define a box. The output is basically an expansion of a section near the markers, and it looks like it follows a pattern based on width, size, and color. Specifically, I'm noting a pattern in the object widths: 2, 3, 4, 5... and the next is 6.  The pattern is about extrapolating sequence of color/width, and then replicating the shape. Okay, looks like it.\n\n2.  **Example 2:**\n    *   This is a vertical sequence, also with the markers and a box. The output seems to extend the pattern vertically.  Markers bound the vertical strip/region. Need to pay attention to that region of extension.\n\n3.  **Example 3:**\n    *   This one is trickier. It's a diagonal pattern, and the output is filling the region in the same diagonal but shifted based on the position and color.  The markers are near the end, and the output just extends what's *supposed* to be there - pattern sequence. The extrapolation principle is confirmed.\n\n4.  **Test Input:**\n    *   Okay, here's the real test. The user has given me grey markers and other patterns, and I am supposed to make the logic work. The markers bound the region from Row 11-12, starting from Col 7. The markers define a rectangular region. The pattern, going down, is a sequence of objects. Specifically, 4, 6, 4, 6, and I need to figure out the missing object based on the pattern, which indicates *6* is next. Okay, I believe I can do it. The missing object is magenta (6), and I need to extrapolate to complete the marker region pattern. The size of the box is the critical component. I get the size: 2 rows (rows 11-12) by 21 columns (columns 7-27). Then I look for objects based on these coordinates. In our case, the best is 6.\n\n**Candidate Evaluation**\n\n*   I check through each of the candidate solutions, looking for consistent pattern matching and correct bounding box:\n    *   Candidate 1 has the correct color, but a wrong size.\n    *   Candidate 2: size is correct, color is 6.\n    *   All the other Candidates (3, 22, 25) are wrong color. So I can immediately reject them.\n    *   Candidate 1 and 2 make use of extrapolation, I should pick them.\n*   I carefully check the details of candidates 1 and 2.\n    *   I see that Candidate 2 has the best match since it uses correct width (7-27=21) as opposed to a width of 22 (Candidate 1). It has the correct color and, most importantly, the same strategy as shown by the given examples (Example 1, 2, 3).\n    *   I do confirm that this answer works with all examples.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nBased on this analysis, Candidate 2 appears to be the most accurate and logical. It correctly identifies the region to fill, the pattern, the dimension, and accurately generates the expected output.\n\n\n<AUDIT_LOG>\n**PHASE 1: LOGIC SELECTION & CRYSTALLIZATION**\n\nI am analyzing Candidate 2.\n- **Reasoning Analysis:** The candidate correctly identifies the bounding box defined by the grey (5) markers: Rows 11-12, Cols 7-27 (21 columns). It identifies the alternating sequence of objects (Color 4, 6, 4, 6) moving upwards, correctly deducing that the target region (Rows 11-12) corresponds to the next object in the sequence, which should be **Color 6**. It constructs the output by extracting the pattern from the existing Color 6 object (Rows 19-20) and extending it to fill the marker width, extrapolating into the empty space on the right.\n- **Crystallized Rule:**\n    1.  Identify the bounding box defined by the `5` (grey) markers. (Test Input: Rows 11-12, Cols 7-27).\n    2.  Determine the target color sequence based on vertical object progression. (Test Input: 4->6->4->6 -> Next is **6**).\n    3.  Locate the nearest instance of the target color object (Test Input: Color 6 at Rows 18-20).\n    4.  Extract the rows from the source object that correspond to the marker's relative vertical position (Middle and Bottom rows).\n    5.  Map the pattern from the source object columns to the output columns. Copy literal pixels where they exist; extrapolate the repeating pattern into empty space if the markers extend beyond the source object.\n\n**PHASE 2: THE GROUND TRUTH AUDIT**\n\n- **Example 1:**\n    - *Hypothesis:* Markers at 26-28 define 3x6 box. Sequence 1(Blue)->2(Red)->4(Yellow)->1(Blue). Next is **2 (Red)**. Copy Red pattern.\n    - *Observation:* Output is 3x6 Red C-shape.\n    - *Verdict:* PASS.\n- **Example 2:**\n    - *Hypothesis:* Markers define 14x2 vertical box. Pattern is repeating vertical columns. Extend sequence.\n    - *Observation:* Output is 14x2, matches the pattern continuation.\n    - *Verdict:* PASS.\n- **Example 3:**\n    - *Hypothesis:* Markers define 17x3 box. Sequence 7->2->3. Next is **7**. Generate 7 pattern.\n    - *Observation:* Output is 17x3, filled with 7 pattern.\n    - *Verdict:* PASS.\n\n**PHASE 3: EXECUTION CONSISTENCY**\n\n- **Test Input Analysis:**\n    - **Bounding Box:** Rows 11-12, Cols 7-27. Width 21, Height 2. Candidate 2 output size is 2x21. (Correct).\n    - **Target Color:** Sequence 4,6,4,6 -> Next is 6. Candidate 2 uses Color 6. (Correct).\n    - **Pattern Logic:**\n        - Source: Rows 19-20 (Color 6 object).\n        - **Row 0 (from Row 19):** Pattern `066660...`. Candidate 2: `066660666606666066660`. Matches the source period perfectly.\n        - **Row 1 (from Row 20):** Source pattern in grid is `...66006660066000...` (Note the `66` at the end of the visible sequence in the text input, followed by `0`s).\n        - Candidate 2 Output: `660066600666006600666`.\n        - Checks:\n            - Indices 0-1 (`66`) match Grid Cols 7-8.\n            - Indices 14-15 (`66`) match Grid Cols 21-22 (`66` in text).\n            - Indices 18-20 (`666`) extrapolate into Grid Cols 26-28 (Empty/Markers). This correctly applies the \"Fill empty space\" rule seen in Example 3.\n            - Note: Candidate 2 preserves the \"broken\" `66` from the input text (Cols 21-22) rather than \"repairing\" it to `666`. This is a faithful \"Copy + Extend\" execution, which is generally safer than \"Idealized Repair\" without explicit evidence.\n- **Verdict:** The execution is logically sound and consistent with the input data.\n\n**PHASE 4: STACK RANKING**\n\n- **Candidate 2:** **GOLD**. Correct dimensions, correct color logic (sequence), and faithful pixel execution.\n- **Candidate 1:** **SILVER**. Correct color logic and \"Idealized\" pattern repair (changing the broken `66` to `666`), which is a strong hypothesis. However, it fails on dimensions (2x22 instead of 2x21), likely due to an off-by-one error in marker calculation.\n- **Candidates 3, 11, 16, 22, 25:** **INVALID**. All failed to identify the sequence logic, selecting Color 4 (Yellow) because it was \"closest\" rather than the logically next item (Color 6). Example 1 explicitly contradicts the \"closest\" rule (choosing Red over the closer Blue/Yellow neighbors based on sequence).\n- **Candidate 19:** **INVALID**. Hallucinated output size from Example 1.\n\n</AUDIT_LOG>\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 2,\n      \"score\": 9.5,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Correctly deduced the 'Sequence' logic (Color 6) and 'Bounding Box' logic.

ARC problem. Here's how I'm thinking about it:**\n\nI see three solved examples and one test case. The goal is to generate an output grid based on some pattern observed in the input, and the grey (5) pixels seem to define the key.\n\n**Here's the process I'm using:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the solved examples:**\n    *   Look for recurring patterns in how the input relates to the output.\n    *   Identify the role of the gray (5) pixels: are they markers, bounding boxes, or something else?\n    *   What's the relationship between the colors in the input, and the output?\n2.  **Form a Hypothesis:**\n    *   Can I see a consistent method to predict the output given an input?\n    *   Do the 5's define the location or content of an object?\n3.  **Test the Hypothesis:**\n    *   Verify the hypothesis by applying it to all the solved examples.\n    *   Can the output be predicted in all cases?\n4.  **Apply to the Test Input:**\n    *   Use the confirmed method to generate the output grid.\n\n**Here's the detailed logic:**\n\n*   **Example 1**: I'm seeing a vertical arrangement of colored blocks. I'm focusing on how the grey pixels outline the result's size. It seems the input consists of horizontal objects of variable width, and maybe one is selected by the 5's. The output mirrors the shape and size of something in the input. Is the color selection based on some sequence? In this example, the output resembles a sideways 'C' or 'U' shape. The 5's are bounding the \"target area\". It looks like the region within the 5s, the window, defines the output size. The output color is based on an object outside the window. Is it based on order? Sequence of widths: 2, 3, 4, 5. The next width is 6. The 5s box gives height 3 and width 6, that's a window. It seems to be building a sequence (Bar, Stem, Bar for the output). It appears to show a repeating sequence of a horizontal (full-width) bar, a one row (or similar) stem, and a horizontal bar. The next output is based on a sequence.\n\n*   **Example 2**: I'm seeing vertically stacked objects. The output is a vertically stacked pattern of objects. It has different colors. The output size is defined by the bounding box, determined by the 5's. In this example, the 5s define the 2x14 output and the contents within this region. In Example 2, the 5's form a 14 row by 2-column bounding box. The output grid is 14 rows, and 2 columns. The hypothesis for this example is similar: **the output grid is the region of the input grid defined by the bounding box of the color 5 (gray) pixels.** The key is that it follows a similar structure to Ex 1: generate an object from a sequence, the window is defined by 5's and the pattern or content is repeated. So the output of Ex 2 must be based on repeating the pattern that's behind the bounding box in the input. It appears that the grey bounding box defines the region, and some underlying pattern is copied. This pattern is just repeated in the region.\n\n*   **Example 3**: Here the width is defined by columns of \"7\" 2 and 3. I'm seeing the same thing, the output size is determined by the 5's region. The Output is based on the sequence 7,2,3... This time it is a rectangle where the size is 3 and the 5's width is 2 with height 17. The color 7 is in the sequence (7,2,3). This is similar to Ex 1 and 2, the size from 5s and sequence. The 5s is based on index in sequence? Let's say index in the sequence is number 7.\n*   **Observations:** The 5's define the height and width of the output bounding box. The input consists of repeated patterns of colored shapes, and we choose something to render within the bounding box. The object to choose to render is based on a sequence.\n\n*   **Rule:** **Complete the sequence of objects.** The gray (5) brackets indicate the **location and size** of the next object in the sequence. The size (bounding box of 5s) tells us the dimensions. The task is to define a pattern of color, shape, and size in a horizontal arrangement.\n\n*   **Test\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the task involves identifying a sequence of objects arranged in the grid and using the gray (5) pixels as markers to define a \"target window\" where the next or missing part of the sequence should be generated.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Sequence:**\n    The test input contains horizontal rows of objects that repeat vertically with a shift.\n    -   **Row 1 (y=14-16):** Yellow (4) objects.\n    -   **Row 2 (y=18-20):** Magenta (6) objects.\n    -   **Row 3 (y=22-24):** Yellow (4) objects.\n    -   **Row 4 (y=26-28):** Magenta (6) objects.\n    \n    The pattern alternates colors (Yellow, Magenta) and moves vertically with a spacing of 4 rows (starts at 14, 18, 22, 26). The objects are arranged horizontally with regular spacing.\n\n2.  **Determine Target Parameters:**\n    -   **Location:** The gray markers (5s) are located in rows 11 and 12. Following the vertical spacing of 4, the row preceding the Yellow row at y=14 would start at **y=10**.\n    -   **Color:** Since the rows alternate Yellow, Magenta, Yellow, Magenta... the row at y=10 should be **Magenta (6)** (preceding Yellow).\n    -   **Dimensions:** The markers define a bounding box from column 7 to column 28 (width 22) and rows 11 to 12 (height 2).\n    -   **Shape:** The Magenta objects are 3 rows high.\n        -   Top (Row 1): Two pixels wide (`  XX  `).\n        -   Middle (Row 2): Four pixels wide (` XXXX `).\n        -   Bottom (Row 3): Two \"feet\" with a gap (`XX  XX`).\n    -   Since the target object starts at y=10, the markers at y=11 and y=12 capture the **Middle** and **Bottom** rows of the objects.\n\n3.  **Construct the Pattern:**\n    -   **Object Centers:** By observing the alignment of objects in the grid, the centers for this row extrapolate to indices 4.5, 9.5, 14.5, 19.5, 24.5, 29.5...\n    -   **Row 11 (Middle):** Contains blocks of 4 magenta pixels centered at these points.\n        -   Pattern: `...0 6666 0 6666...`\n        -   Inside the window (cols 7-28): Gaps fall at indices 7, 12, 17, 22, 27. The rest are 6s.\n    -   **Row 12 (Bottom):** Contains feet pattern. The right foot of one object and the left foot of the next overlap to form a block of 3 pixels (`666`).\n        -   Pattern: `...66 000 666 00...` (approx).\n        -   Inside the window (cols 7-28): We see the feet landing.\n            -   Indices 7,8: Overlap of first pair (`66`).\n            -   Indices 11-13: Overlap (`666`).\n            -   Indices 16-18: Overlap (`666`).\n            -   Indices 21-23: Overlap (`666`).\n            -   Indices 26-28: Overlap (`666`).\n            -   Gaps (0s) in between.\n\n4.  **Final Grid Generation:**\n    We construct the 22x2 grid based on these calculated pixel positions.\n\n    **Row 0 (y=11):** `0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6`\n    **Row 1 (y=12):** `6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6`\n\noutput:\n0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6\n      6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"B\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_3_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Solving the ARC Task: My Thought Process**\n\nAlright, I'm diving into this ARC task. The user wants me to crack a pattern based on examples and a test input. Let's see...\n\nI start with Example 1, a 30x30 grid with a weird structure at the bottom right.  It's got some colors: blue, red, yellow, and gray.  I try to break down the non-black pixels, focusing on their arrangement.  Looks like vertical towers, some \"behind\" others. The output, a 3x6 grid, seems *way* smaller, a real head-scratcher.\n\nThe gray pixels grab my attention. In ARC, they're often a \"selector\" or a \"mask.\"  I pinpoint the coordinates of these gray pixels. It looks like they outline a rectangle! Hey! The output's dimensions perfectly match the dimensions defined by those gray pixels, a 3x6 rectangle.\n\nThen the red pixels in the input catches my eye. If I look to the left, I find that a red \"E-shape\" or a \"U shape on its side\", spanning a bounding box that's wider than it is high. The output is all red, but it doesn't look like any of the shapes in the input.\n\nIt's all about that gray region. Now, let's look for a deeper pattern! I think. The gray pixels are pointing me at the right horizontal and vertical spans:\nRow 26, Cols 19-24, looks like 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0.\nRow 27, 5,0,0,0,5.\nRow 28, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5,5.\n\nBut the output is all red! Maybe the gray pixels are an instruction, telling me *where* to look. Or maybe they are instructing me to *transform* the pattern I see around the pixels to the left. I start noticing some width-based objects to the left:\nBlue width is 5\nYellow is 4\nRed is 3\nGray area is width 6.\nSo it is some sort of width-based sequence, leading to the gray region. And the color matches the sequence: 2,4,1,2. Ah, ha! I think I've got it.\n\nOkay, let's test it on Example 2. It has gray markers at the top and bottom of a long region. This is likely an indication I need to horizontally continue a pattern to the region specified by the gray marker. And, that's what seems to happen!\n\nNow, Example 3, has a diagonal pattern with 7s, 2s, and 3s. There are gray markers that tell me what the pattern at the end of the input will be. It's essentially extending the pattern by one iteration, which is the sequence 7, 2, 3...\nSo the pattern seems to be: extend the sequence to the target region.\n\nTest input time!  The new input has a bunch of \"5\" pixels in it, defining the target, and I need to figure out what it's supposed to look like based on the previous objects.\n\nI map the sequence from above into this new test input, and I construct a final result! \n\n\nThe problem asks us to solve an ARC task where we must infer a transformation rule from examples and apply it to a test input.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Example 1:** The input contains several colored \"objects\" (Red, Yellow, Blue) arranged horizontally. A box defined by gray (5) pixels appears to the right of the sequence. The output grid matches the dimensions of this gray box. The content of the output is a Red (2) shape.\n    *   **Reasoning:** The objects form a sequence.\n        *   Red object (width 3).\n        *   Yellow object (width 4).\n        *   Blue object (width 5).\n        *   The gray box has width 6.\n        *   The sequence of widths is 3, 4, 5, -> 6.\n        *   The sequence of colors is 2, 4, 1. If this cycles (2, 4, 1, 2...), the next color is 2.\n        *   The output is a generated object of color 2 and width 6, following the morphological pattern of the previous objects (top/bottom full, middle row ends-only).\n\n2.  **Example 2:** The input contains a repeating background pattern of vertical columns. Two gray markers define a rectangular region. The output matches the size of this region and contains the continuation of the background pattern (colors 9, 8, 4) that would logically exist in that space.\n\n3.  **Example 3:** The input contains a diagonal/wave pattern of objects (7, 2, 3...). A gray box defines a target region. The output is filled with the pattern of the object (7) that logically belongs in that column based on the horizontal sequence (7, 2, 3, 7, 2, -> 3, -> 7).\n\n**General Rule:**\nThe gray pixels define a **target region**. The task is to identify the underlying pattern or sequence of objects in the grid (extrapolating position, size, color, and shape) and generate the content that should logically fill that target region.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Identify Target Region:**\n    *   Gray pixels (5) are found in Row 11 (cols 7, 8, 27) and Row 12 (cols 7, 27, 28).\n    *   These mark the corners of a rectangular region from **Row 11 to Row 12** and **Column 7 to Column 28**.\n    *   Output dimensions: Height 2, Width 22.\n\n2.  **Analyze Grid Patterns:**\n    *   The grid consists of horizontal layers of objects.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Bottom, Rows 26-28):** Pink (6) objects. Centers are at x = ..., 14.5, 19.5, ... (Interleaved positions).\n    *   **Layer 2 (Rows 22-24):** Yellow (4) objects. Centers are at x = 7, 12, 17, 22, 27 (Aligned positions).\n    *   **Layer 3 (Rows 18-20):** Pink (6) objects. Interleaved.\n    *   **Layer 4 (Rows 14-16):** Yellow (4) objects. Aligned.\n    *   **Layer 5 (Target, Rows 10-12):** This continues the vertical sequence.\n    *   **Sequence:** Pink, Yellow, Pink, Yellow, -> **Pink**.\n    *   Therefore, the target region should contain **Pink (6)** objects.\n\n3.  **Determine Object Properties:**\n    *   **Position:** Pink objects in this grid are \"interleaved\", meaning they are centered halfway between the Yellow objects. Yellow centers are 7, 12, 17, 22, 27 (gap 5). Pink centers are 4.5, 9.5, 14.5, 19.5, 24.5, 29.5.\n    *   **Vertical Alignment:** The layers are separated by 1 row of zeros. Layer 4 is 14-16. Layer 5 (Target) is 10-12.\n    *   **Shape:** Based on Pink objects in layers 1 and 3:\n        *   **Top Row:** Width 2 centered.\n        *   **Middle Row:** Width 4 centered (Indices: center-1.5 to center+1.5).\n        *   **Bottom Row:** \"Legs\" at the edges. Indices: [center-2.5, center-1.5] and [center+1.5, center+2.5]. Note that legs of adjacent objects merge (e.g., right leg of 9.5 and left leg of 14.5 overlap/touch).\n\n4.  **Generate Output:**\n    *   The target region (Rows 11-12) corresponds to the **Middle** and **Bottom** rows of the Pink objects (since the full object is height 3, occupying rows 10-12).\n    *   We need to fill the output (2 x 22) with the Middle and Bottom rows of Pink objects centered at 9.5, 14.5, 19.5, 24.5, and the edges of objects at 4.5 and 29.5 if they overlap.\n    *   **Row 0 (Middle Row):**\n        *   Objects are 4 pixels wide (e.g., center 9.5 spans 8-11).\n        *   Cols 8-11, 13-16, 18-21, 23-26, 28-31.\n        *   Mapped to output cols (grid col - 7):\n            *   Grid 8-11 -> Out 1-4.\n            *   Grid 13-16 -> Out 6-9.\n            *   Grid 18-21 -> Out 11-14.\n            *   Grid 23-26 -> Out 16-19.\n            *   Grid 28 -> Out 21.\n    *   **Row 1 (Bottom Row):**\n        *   Legs span 2 pixels at outer edges (e.g., center 9.5 has legs 7-8 and 11-12).\n        *   Adjacent legs merge/touch (e.g., 11-12 and 12-13 create a block 11-13).\n        *   Resulting pattern segments (Grid indices):\n            *   (4.5 Right Leg 6-7 + 9.5 Left Leg 7-8) -> **7, 8** are filled.\n            *   (9.5 Right Leg 11-12 + 14.5 Left Leg 12-13) -> **11, 12, 13** are filled.\n            *   (14.5 Right + 19.5 Left) -> **16, 17, 18** filled.\n            *   (19.5 Right + 24.5 Left) -> **21, 22, 23** filled.\n            *   (24.5 Right + 29.5 Left) -> **26, 27, 28** filled.\n        *   Mapped to output cols:\n            *   Grid 7-8 -> Out 0-1.\n            *   Grid 11-13 -> Out 4-6.\n            *   Grid 16-18 -> Out 9-11.\n            *   Grid 21-23 -> Out 14-16.\n            *   Grid 26-28 -> Out 19-21.\n\noutput:\n0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6\n      6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"C\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_12_step_5_opus_gen_sol\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Okay, let's break this down.** I'm being asked to solve an ARC puzzle using the rules I've deduced from three solved examples and a test input. I need to figure out a transformation rule and explain my reasoning, then apply it to the test data. I'm given some hints to get me started.\n\n**First, I need to understand the task.**  I'm looking at a 30x30 grid, and my goal is to figure out how to transform a given input into an output. The examples are crucial here. I need to identify the pattern and how it applies.\n\n**The \"Object\" Description seems key.** I'm given hints about what objects are in the grid, but I must verify if the given description is true by analyzing the examples.  I need to find the rule. The examples tell a story: find some marked region, and extract a pattern there.\n\n**Let's start with Example 1.** I need to understand how the output relates to the input. The color 5 markers are the most important here.  I noticed that the L-shaped markers seem to define a region. I need to know how. The markers are made of the digit 5.  This means they are markers. Then I examine the raw data.  I need to trace the marker shapes in the examples. Rows and columns contain the data.  A corner shape is defined. I need to find the box dimensions. How high, how wide. What is inside? I deduce the width and the height. What is the pattern? Where is the connection to the pattern and to the output? It's all about the box. The output seems to be related to the objects inside. Where do they come from? I look for other colors (objects).  There is a repeated 2 pattern on the side.  The marker area looks empty. I need to understand how the marker bounds connect to the output. Is the output a subsection of an adjacent object?\n\n**The Transformation Description hint is crucial.** It's about \"selecting appropriate colored pattern.\" I must figure out what \"nearest to\" means in this context. It seems that the pattern selection is based on the region. And that region is defined by the L-shaped Markers. In Ex 1, I noticed a color 2 object, and I see a possible mapping from the color 2 object to the output. I start with the rows that the marker defines and then find if those rows match the output. I need to trace this in the other examples to prove this point. I need to deduce that the markers define the *bounding box*, and then use a slice of the given shape inside the bounding box. Is that all?  This looks like a *horizontal stretch*. The dimensions must match up.\n\n**Example 2 seems different.** There's a diamond pattern. I need to verify that this is similar. This time it seems the L-marker defined region is *Vertical*!   The bounding box dimension is very tall, and the output is vertical. This is different!  Maybe the markers define the output window.  I start the analysis again from raw data.   I extract all of the 5.  I deduce the rows and columns. This confirms this is tall. Is the pattern periodic? I check for the periodic parts in this object. This means tracing the columns of a diamond in all rows that match the L-mark's defined area.  This diamond has a period of 3 columns, if I remove one. The markers have a width of 2.  Then I start again to read the provided text.  I must verify that I got it correct.  There is a specific word in the hint: I must *extract* a pattern, not create one. So the bounding box is the output box. The bounding box is a window over the pattern. I check the periodicity by extracting a specific sequence of digits. I can verify it in the input.\n\n**Example 3 is the most complicated.** It has an object 7 pattern! Now the \"Object selection\" is more tricky, or seems more tricky. The key here is there is a recurring object 7 pattern.  Again, L-mark, draw rows and cols for the bounding box. The given digit is 5.  I need to find the object and extract the pattern. How does that object 7 pattern match the generated pattern? The dimensions, once more, are the keys.  The markers define the output window.  And the bounding box matches with a number from the repeating series. The number 7 seems critical here.  I must read the provided hints again! \"Horizontal and Vertical\". OK. Check all of those colors.  Now find periodicity.  There seems to be a vertical periodicity. Each column has its pattern. All examples seem similar. I need to prove that the vertical or horizontal alignment is correct.\n\n**The \"Extrapolation\" logic\n\nTo solve this problem, I will follow the steps derived from the analysis of the solved examples and the test input properties.\n\n**1. Analyze Input and Locate Markers:**\nThe input grid contains two L-shaped markers in color 5 (grey).\n- **Left Marker:** Located at rows 11-12, columns 7-8. The pixels are `(11,7)`, `(11,8)`, and `(12,7)`. This forms a `\u250c` shape (top-left corner).\n- **Right Marker:** Located at rows 11-12, columns 27-28. The pixels are `(11,27)`, `(12,27)`, and `(12,28)`. This forms a `\u2514` shape (bottom-left corner).\n- **Bounding Box:** The region defined by the extremes of these markers is from Row 11 to Row 12 (Height = 2) and from Column 7 to Column 28 (Width = 22).\n- **Output Dimensions:** The output grid will be 2 rows high and 22 columns wide.\n\n**2. Identify the Target Pattern:**\nI need to determine what pattern to fill into this bounding box.\n- **Existing Objects:** The grid contains a series of horizontal \"wave\" or \"peak\" patterns stacked vertically.\n    - Rows 26-28: Color 6 pattern.\n    - Rows 22-24: Color 4 pattern.\n    - Rows 18-20: Color 6 pattern.\n    - Rows 14-16: Color 4 pattern.\n- **Series Logic:**\n    - **Position:** The objects are spaced 4 rows apart (starts at 26, 22, 18, 14). Following this sequence upwards, the next object would start at Row 10 (14 - 4 = 10) and span Rows 10-12.\n    - **Color:** The colors alternate: 6, 4, 6, 4. The next color in the sequence (for the object at 10-12) should be **Color 6**.\n- **Target Selection:** The markers are located at Rows 11-12. This corresponds to the middle and bottom rows of the hypothetical \"phantom\" object at Rows 10-12. Therefore, we need to generate the **Color 6 wave pattern**, specifically its middle and bottom rows.\n\n**3. Extract Pattern Rules:**\nI will derive the repeating structure of the Color 6 wave pattern using the existing object at Rows 18-20 (or 26-28).\n- **Base Object (Rows 18-20):**\n    - **Top Row (18):** Corresponds to the hypothetical Row 10.\n    - **Middle Row (19):** Corresponds to the hypothetical Row 11 (Output Row 1).\n        - Looking at Input Row 19, the pattern is `...6,6,6,6,0...`.\n        - Aligned to Column 7 (start of our output), the pattern repeats every 5 columns: `0, 6, 6, 6, 6`.\n        - Verification at Col 7 (index 0): `0`. Col 8-11: `6,6,6,6`. Col 12: `0`. Matches input.\n    - **Bottom Row (20):** Corresponds to the hypothetical Row 12 (Output Row 2).\n        - Looking at Input Row 20, the pattern is `...6,6,0,0,6...`.\n        - Aligned to Column 7, the pattern repeats every 5 columns: `6, 6, 0, 0, 6`.\n        - Verification at Col 7-8: `6,6`. Col 9-10: `0,0`. Col 11: `6`. Matches input.\n\n**4. Construct Output:**\nI will fill the 2x22 output grid by repeating the identified base units for the calculated rows.\n- **Row 1 (Pattern Row Mid):** Repeat `0, 6, 6, 6, 6` for 22 columns.\n    - Sequence: `0,6,6,6,6` `0,6,6,6,6` `0,6,6,6,6` `0,6,6,6,6` `0,6`\n- **Row 2 (Pattern Row Bot):** Repeat `6, 6, 0, 0, 6` for 22 columns.\n    - Sequence: `6,6,0,0,6` `6,6,0,0,6` `6,6,0,0,6` `6,6,0,0,6` `6,6`\n\n**Final Output Grid:**\n0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6\n      6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"2\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_2_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at the examples, I need to identify:\n1.

their unit is 3 cells wide, so we build a tall 3\u2011wide hollow column of 7s stacked.\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\nIn the test grid, the bottommost structured modules are the ones of colour `6` (rows 26\u201328).  \nLooking at that colour-6 pattern, its maximal horizontal run has length 3 (a little \u201cbar\u201d three 6s wide).  \n\nFollowing the rule:\n\n- rectangle height = 3\n- rectangle width = 2 \u00d7 3 = 6\n- border colour = 6\n- interior = 0\n\nSo the output grid is a 3\u00d76 hollow rectangle of 6s:\n\n### Output grid\n\n6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,0,0,0,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,0,0,0,0,0\n      6,6,6,6,6,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"B\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-high_6_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n6,6,6,6,6,6\n6,0,0,0,0,0\n6,6,6,6,6,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      6,6,6,6,6,6\n      6,0,0,0,0,0\n      6,6,6,6,6,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"22\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-high_12_step_5_opus_gen_sol\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nFirst, identify the two L-shaped markers in color 5 in the test input.\n\nThey are:\n\n- Left L (L1): cells (12,8), (12,9), (13,8) \u2014 an L made from three 5s in a 2\u00d72 block.\n- Right L (L2): cells (12,28), (13,27), (13,28) \u2014 another 3-cell L in a 2\u00d72 block.\n\nFrom these, compute the output dimensions according to the span between L1 and L2:\n\n- `min_row(L1) = 12`\n- `max_row(L2) = 13`\n- `min_col(L1) = 8`\n- `max_col(L2) = 28`\n\nSo:\n\n- Height = `max_row(L2) - min_row(L1) + 1 = 13 - 12 + 1 = 2`\n- Width  = `max_col(L2) - min_col(L1) + 1 = 28 - 8 + 1 = 21`\n\nThus the output must be a 2\u00d721 grid.\n\nNext, look for the main structured, non-background pattern that is horizontally oriented and near this region. The prominent candidate is the horizontal \u201cwave/peak\u201d band of 4s at rows 15\u201317. Since the L-markers are horizontal, we select this horizontal 4-band as the source pattern.\n\nWe now align the output horizontally with the L-span, so we take the columns from 8 to 28 of that 4-band.

I've got a detailed description of how the pixels are arranged, and I'm supposed to use these examples to work out the rules.\n\n1.  **Understand the Basics**: The inputs are large 30x30 grids with colored pixels.\n2.  **Analyze the Examples**: I have three solved examples that show input and output grids.\n3.  **Object & Transform Description**: There are descriptions of shapes (like columns, ladders, etc.) and what I'm supposed to do to them (find a \"bounding box,\" and extract a pattern).\n\nNow, let's break this down.\n\n**The Strategy**\n\n*   **Marker Box is Key**:  There are \"L-shaped markers\" (color 5) that define an area or a \"bounding box.\" This looks to determine the size of the output.\n*   **Find the Target**:  There is a \"primary complex object.\" I need to find the specific pattern it matches within the new grid.  The description is hinting at a \"Stepped Structure\" (color 4) for the test input. Let's see if this plays out.\n*   **Alignment is Crucial**: I have to \"align\" something. The idea of the transformation is to shift the target to the correct position (the vertical positioning seems important in this shift).\n*   **Extract and Crop**: The next step is to grab the pattern from the \"object,\" and then \"crop\" it down to the same width as the bounding box.\n\n**Going Through the Examples**\n\n*   **Example 1**: The markers look like L shapes. I have to verify where they are exactly. I'm noting the output is 3x6. Now, what's inside this 3x6 area? There are several items but there are objects with width 1 that are vertical.\n\n    *   The description is telling me to find the \"primary complex object\".\n    *   Example 1 Output is:\n        ```\n        2,2,2,2,2,2\n        2,0,0,0,0,0\n        2,2,2,2,2,2\n        ```\n    *   This looks like a \"U\" shape or two vertical lines with a connecting line. There's an object with the color 2 that I should be tracking.\n    *   Why are the output pixels 2? The shape described and labeled \"Bracket Shape.\"\n\n    I have to figure out how these values relate to the positions.  The \"align vertical start\" rule is key.  Are the markers defining a \"view\" of the input? Let's check the marker window vs. the \"Bracket Shape\" in the input again.  The width of the marker box is 6, and the bracket is 3...hmm.  Maybe the pattern is repeated to fill the marker box?\n\n*   **Example 2**: Two sets of markers (at different rows) are defined in the problem. The markers are at rows 14-15 and 27-28 in the input.\n\n    *   I'm looking at \"complex columns\" to find the object. It's repeating vertically. It looks like it is capturing a single column, shifted. There is \"0\" padding so the content may not be continuous in the input.\n    *   Output matches, column pattern of input (9,8).\n    *   The text is implying that this will be similar. But where is the alignment happening? The output is rows 14-27.\n    *   Align markers to the complex object? \"Align the vertical start of the marker box with the vertical start of the object.\" Is this a shift?\n\n*   **Example 3**:  It shows \"Ladder Objects\" and how to find them.\n\n    *   I should scan for patterns, specifically color 7. The markers here are also top and bottom, similar to Example 2.\n\n**Key Observations So Far**\n\n1.  **Markers Define Size**: The L-shaped markers definitely determine the size of the output. I need to be exact about where those markers are.\n2.  **Object Type**: The *type* of object I'm looking for is based on the problem.\n3.  **Horizontal Crop**: The final output width *appears* to be the same as the marker width.\n4.  **Vertical Shift?** The outputs always match *some* section of the target objects. The \u201calign\u201d instruction might involve some up/down shifting of the relevant part of the input.\n\n**Applying to the Test Input**\n\nI need to apply everything I've\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to interpret the transformation rule based on the provided examples and descriptions.\n\n**Transformation Logic:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Marker Box:** Locate the \"L-shaped\" markers (Color 5) in the grid. These markers define a bounding box that determines the dimensions (Height and Width) of the output grid.\n    *   In the Test Input, we find Color 5 markers in rows 11 and 12.\n    *   The top-left marker configuration is at `(Row 11, Col 7)` and `(Row 12, Col 7)`.\n    *   The bottom-right marker configuration is at `(Row 11, Col 27)` and `(Row 12, Col 28)`.\n    *   This defines a bounding box spanning **Rows 11 to 12** (Height = 2) and **Columns 7 to 28** (Width = 22).\n\n2.  **Locate the Primary Complex Object:** The prompt explicitly asks to locate the \"Stepped Structure, Color 4\".\n    *   Scanning the grid for Color 4, we find the first such structure starting at **Row 14**.\n    *   Looking at the columns in Row 14, the first pixel of this object appears at **Column 5**.\n\n3.  **Align and Extract:**\n    *   **Vertical Alignment:** The instruction \"Align the vertical start of the marker box with the vertical start of the object\" implies we calculate the offset between the marker start row (11) and the object start row (14). We then extract the number of rows corresponding to the marker box height (2 rows). Thus, we extract **Rows 14 and 15**.\n    *   **Horizontal Alignment:** Based on Example 2 and 3, where the output captures the object regardless of its horizontal position relative to the markers, we align the start of our extraction window with the start of the object. The marker box width is 22. The object starts at Column 5. So we extract 22 columns starting from Column 5 (Columns 5 to 26).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Grid Row 14 (Object Row 1):**\n    Original: `...0, 4, 0,0,0, 4,4, 0,0,0, 4,4, 0,0,0, 4,4, 0,0,0, 4, 0...`\n    Extraction (Cols 5-26): `4, 0,0,0, 4,4, 0,0,0, 4,4, 0,0,0, 4,4, 0,0,0, 4, 0,0`\n\n*   **Grid Row 15 (Object Row 2):**\n    Original: `...0, 4,4, 0, 4,4,4,4, 0, 4,4,4,4, 0, 4,4,4,4, 0, 4,4, 0...`\n    Extraction (Cols 5-26): `4,4, 0, 4,4,4,4, 0, 4,4,4,4, 0, 4,4,4,4, 0, 4,4, 0,0`\n\nThe resulting 2x22 grid is the solution.\n\n4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,0\n4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0,0\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,0\n      4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0,0\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"25\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_5_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Problem Decomposition and Pattern Recognition**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants me to solve an ARC task, likely involving some image manipulation. Based on the examples, I see this as a pattern recognition and transformation problem, essentially a \"find the rule\" type of challenge. The examples provide the key, and my job is to crack the code.\n\n**Initial Analysis and Hypothesis**\n\nI'm starting by breaking down each example into its core components. I'm looking for distinct objects, repeating patterns, and clues about the input-output relationship. The significantly smaller output size hints at some form of summarization, cropping, or feature extraction. The presence of those \"separator\" pixels in the input is intriguing, I need to understand their role.\n\n**Detailed Example Inspection**\n\nLet's dissect Example 1. There's a clear repeating structure, but also some unique features. I'm focusing on those colored shapes, especially the ones near the bottom. They look like characters or codes. The grey pixels seem crucial, forming a specific shape. I'm wondering if this grey shape acts as an index or a key, selecting a corresponding output.\nAfter that detailed look I am coming up with this: I noticed that shapes are repeated or are encoded by colors.\nI noticed a set of distinct columns and rows of shapes: these shapes are made of other sub-shapes, and are in a very specific order.\nThe output shape is one of them, but not any in the input.\n\n**Refining the Approach**\n\nAha! The grey shape isn't just a random element; it defines the output's size and, more importantly, hints at a dictionary or table of mappings.\nMaybe the Grey shapes are delimiters or indexes to a source and destination, and the output is one of the source shapes.\n\n**Hypothesis Testing**\n\nNow, I'm going to test this theory rigorously. I'll meticulously compare the grey shape's characteristics to the output in each example. For example, in Ex 1, I believe the output is the shape pointed to by the Grey Object. I suspect there is a simple offset function that takes the current shape and makes the output.\nIn Ex 2, a similar approach will be taken, though I suspect the logic is different there and more complex as I see multiple colors in the output, hinting at composition.\nAnd so on, to each example.\n\n**The Bigger Picture**\nThe goal now becomes to find the underlying rule of pattern.\nThe grey shape seems to define a window on the input and somehow, we are extracting the object in that window and doing something to it.\n\n**The Test Input**\nLet's see the Test Input.\nThe test input is similar to the first example: the Grey shape defines a rectangular region and, the non-grey values in the test grid is something to be \"queried\" using the values of the box.\n\n**Final Analysis and Solution**\n\nThe algorithm is defined to crop a region based on the grey area and then project it to the output, and do this across a set of inputs and outputs.\nNow that it's all defined, I can write the logic.\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the test input grid into an output grid based on the logic inferred from the three solved examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:**\n    *   The input grids contain various colorful patterns/objects and a specific set of **Grey (5)** pixels.\n    *   The Grey (5) pixels form a bounding box or \"brackets\" that seem to define a region of interest.\n    *   The Output grids are significantly smaller than the inputs and contain patterns that resemble parts of the input objects.\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule - \"Crop and Capture\":**\n    *   In **Example 3**, the Grey pixels define a tall, thin rectangular region (17x3) on the right side of the grid. The output is exactly 17x3 and contains the pattern of the Orange (7) object found on the left side of the grid. The rule appears to be: use the dimensions of the Grey bounding box to create a \"crop window,\" project this window horizontally to the left-most object, and capture the content.\n    *   In **Example 1**, the Grey pixels define a 3x6 region. The output is 3x6 and contains a pattern derived from the Red (2) object.\n    *   In **Example 2**, the Grey pixels define a 14x2 region. The output is 14x2.\n\n3.  **Application to Test Input:**\n    *   **Grey (5) Markers:** In the Test Input, the Grey pixels are located in rows 11 and 12.\n        *   Left markers: `5,5` at cols 7,8 and `5` at col 7 (row 12).\n        *   Right markers: `5` at col 26 (row 11) and `5,5` at cols 26,27 (row 12).\n        *   These markers define a bounding box spanning **Rows 11-12** (Height 2) and **Columns 7-27** (Width 21).\n    *   **Projection:** Unlike the other examples where the \"crop window\" was side-by-side with the objects, here the crop window is **above** the objects. The objects (Yellow shapes) start at Row 14. This suggests a **Vertical Projection** downwards.\n    *   **Capture:** We translate the 2x21 crop window downwards to the first non-zero object it encounters. The first object is the Yellow (4) structure starting at Row 14.\n    *   **Alignment:** We align the start of the object (Column 5) with the start of the crop window relative to the object's structure, or simply capture the pattern corresponding to the window's width. In Example 3, the capture aligned the top-left of the box with the top-left of the object. Here, we align the left of the crop box (Col 7) with the left of the object? Or simply capture the object's extent?\n    *   Looking closely at Example 3, the window was 3 wide, and the object was 3 wide. The capture was exact.\n    *   In the Test Input, the Grey box is width 21 (Cols 7-27). The Yellow object is width 20 (Cols 5-24). However, typically in ARC, we align the \"start\" of the container with the \"start\" of the content.\n    *   Aligning the start (left-most pixel) of the Yellow object (Col 5) with the start of the capture window implies we extract 21 pixels starting from Col 5.\n\n**Execution:**\n*   **Source Rows:** Row 14 and Row 15 (the top 2 rows of the Yellow object).\n*   **Source Columns:** Starting at Column 5, length 21 (Columns 5 through 25).\n*   **Data Extraction:**\n    *   **Row 14 (Input):** `...0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,0...`\n        *   Extract cols 5-25: `4`, `0,0,0`, `4,4`, `0,0,0`, `4,4`, `0,0,0`, `4,4`, `0,0,0`, `4`, `0`.\n        *   Result: `4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,0`\n    *   **Row 15 (Input):** `...0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0...`\n        *   Extract cols 5-25: `4,4`, `0`, `4,4,4,4`, `0`, `4,4,4,4`, `0`, `4,4,4,4`, `0`, `4,4`, `0`.\n        *   Result: `4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0`\n\nThe output is a 2x21 grid containing these values.\n\n4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,0\n4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,0\n      4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"B\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nThe grey markers in the test input appear only on rows\u202f12\u201313.

Find the marker bounding box (color 5)\n\nIn the test input, the non\u2011zero pixels of color `5` are:\n\n- Top marker (an L\u2011shape on the left):\n  - (row 11, col 7)\n  - (row 11, col 8)\n  - (row 12, col 7)\n\n- Top marker (an L\u2011shape on the right):\n  - (row 11, col 27)\n  - (row 12, col 26)\n  - (row 12, col 27)\n\n(Using 0\u2011based indexing for rows and columns.)\n\nThe bounding box that contains all 5\u2011pixels therefore has:\n\n- Top row = 11\n- Bottom row = 12  \u2192 height \\(H = 12 - 11 + 1 = 2\\)\n- Left column = 7\n- Right column = 27 \u2192 width \\(W = 27 - 7 + 1 = 21\\)\n\nSo the **output grid must be 2 rows by 21 columns**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Locate the primary complex object (stepped 4\u2011structure)\n\nLooking at the test grid, the first substantial non\u2011marker structure is a stepped structure made of color `4` in rows 15\u201317, then repeated lower down. According to your description, this is the \u201cprimary complex object (Stepped Structure, Color 4)\u201d.\n\nWe take the *first* occurrence of this 4\u2011structure as the primary object.\n\nIn that object, the earliest (topmost) row containing a 4 is:\n\n- **Object top row** = 15 (0\u2011based)\n\nThe leftmost 4 of that object is at:\n\n- **Object left column** = 5\n\n(From row 15, col 5 = 4.)\n\n---\n\n### 3. Align marker box vertically with the object\n\nPer your rule:\n\n> Align the vertical start of the marker box with the vertical start of the object.\n\n- Marker box height \\(H = 2\\).\n- Object top row = 15.\n\nSo we take **2 consecutive rows from the object starting at row 15**:\n\n- Rows 15 and 16 of the input.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Extract these rows from the object\n\nWe now look at rows 15 and 16 in the test input.\n\nRow 15 (full, indices 0\u201329):\n`0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 16 (full, indices 0\u201329):\n`0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0`\n\n---\n\n### 5. Crop horizontally to match the marker box width\n\nThe marker box width is \\(W = 21\\).  \nWe crop these two rows starting from the **leftmost 4 of the primary object**, i.e. column 5, and take 21 cells (columns 5 through 25 inclusive).\n\n#### Row 15, columns 5\u201325:\n\nIndices and values:\n\n- c5 = 4  \n- c6 = 0  \n- c7 = 0  \n- c8 = 0  \n- c9 = 4  \n- c10 = 4  \n- c11 = 0  \n- c12 = 0  \n- c13 = 0  \n- c14 = 4  \n- c15 = 4  \n- c16 = 0  \n- c17 = 0  \n- c18 = 0  \n- c19 = 4  \n- c20 = 4  \n- c21 = 0  \n- c22 = 0  \n- c23 = 0  \n- c24 = 4  \n- c25 = 0  \n\nSo row 0 of the output is:\n`4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,0`\n\n#### Row 16, columns 5\u201325:\n\n- c5 = 4  \n- c6 = 4  \n- c7 = 0  \n- c8 = 4  \n- c9 = 4  \n- c10 = 4  \n- c11 = 4  \n- c12 = 0  \n- c13 = 4  \n- c14 = 4  \n- c15 = 4  \n- c16 = 4  \n- c17 = 0  \n- c18 = 4  \n- c19 = 4  \n- c20 = 4  \n- c21 = 4  \n- c22 = 0  \n- c23 = 4  \n- c24 = 4  \n- c25 = 0  \n\nSo row 1 of the output is:\n`4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0`\n\n---\n\n### 6. Final output grid\n\nPutting those two cropped rows together, the resulting 2\u00d721 grid is:\n\n```\n4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,0\n4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,0\n      4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n</CANDIDATES>\n\n<INSTRUCTIONS>\nYou must behave as an AUDITOR, not a solver.\n\nYour overall goal:\n- For each candidate, choose a representative explanation and treat it as that\n  candidate's proposed rule.\n- Audit that rule against all training examples.\n- Check whether the candidate's predicted test OUTPUT_GRID actually follows\n  that rule.\n- Assign each candidate a score from 0 to 10 and rank all candidates.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\nSTEP 1 -- CHOOSE A REPRESENTATIVE RULE PER CANDIDATE\nFor each CANDIDATE:\n\n  1. It may have multiple ANSWER blocks, all with the same OUTPUT_GRID.\n  2. Among its ANSWERs, choose a \"representative explanation\":\n     - Prefer the explanation that is:\n       - most complete,\n       - least self-contradictory,\n       - easiest to understand.\n  3. Treat that explanation as the candidate's rule. \n  4. Treat the OUTPUT_GRID from any ANSWER as the candidate's predicted\n     test output (they are guaranteed identical within that candidate).\n\nSTEP 2 -- EXAMPLE CONSISTENCY AUDIT (DO NOT USE THE TEST INPUT HERE)\nFor each candidate's representative rule:\n\n  1.

                "response": "**Audit of ARC Task Solutions**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I'm looking at several proposed solutions for this ARC task, and it's all about grids with patterns and markers. The goal is to figure out how to take an input grid, which is pretty big, and generate a smaller output grid based on some rules. The main thing seems to be these gray pixels, the \"markers,\" which define a bounding box or target region within the larger grid.\n\nI've got a working hypothesis. The task is to \"fill\" the marked bounding box with a pattern already present in the grid. But, the real question is *which* pattern. The examples given are helping me dial in.\n\n**Initial Observations:**\n\n*   **Example 1:** Here's where it gets interesting. I see a big grid (30x30), and markers that define a 3x6 region. The output isn't just a direct copy of something nearby. Instead, I see a \"C\" shape made of 2s, but the markers don't have those values. Hmmm, the input has objects of widths 2, 3, 4, and 5 and the markers are width 6 and the corresponding color is 2. The output is a width 6 object.\n*   **Example 2:** Markers define a 14x2 region, and the output matches a vertical pattern from elsewhere in the grid. Seems straightforward.\n*   **Example 3:** Similar to Example 2. Markers define a region, and the output copies a vertical pattern from another part of the grid.\n\n**Hypothesis Refining:**\n\nSo, the gray pixels are the crucial bounding boxes (target region). The task is to \"fill\" this box with a pattern from the grid. And the pattern looks to be sequence-driven.\n\n*   In Example 1, I see that the object widths are 2, 3, 4, and 5. The markers represent a width of 6. The sequence of color is 2, 4, 1. The next one loops to color 2 and the output is color 2. The *sequence* seems key.\n*   Example 2 supports this, as we're extending the existing pattern into the marked area.\n*   And Example 3 supports it too, with the output being the same pattern.\n\n**Analyzing Test Input:**\n\nNow, onto the test input. There are two \"L\" shaped markers. The bounding box they define is two rows high and roughly 21 columns wide (columns 7 to 27). There are patterns below the markers - alternating waves of yellow (4) and pink (6). The question is, which pattern do we put into the marker box, a continuation, a nearby one?\n\n*   The pattern on row 14 starts with yellow (4). The sequence is yellow, pink, yellow, pink, etc.. Going *up* from row 14, the sequence is pink, yellow, pink, yellow. So the sequence \"up\" from the test input would be pink, 6.\n*   Given the periodic waves of 4s and 6s, the next wave would be pink (6) given the pattern.\n\n**Candidate Solutions:**\n\nNow, here's where the rubber meets the road. I've been presented with some candidate solutions, and I have to put them through the wringer.\n\n**Candidate 1:** I see that the rule is to complete the sequence. The test input, the sequence is yellow, pink, yellow, pink. The next up should be pink (6). The output is filled with 6s. I like this. It is consistent with the example provided. I see that the output rows correspond to the mid and bottom of the pink object, and the dimensions are 21.\n\n**Candidate 2:** The rule is to extend the existing pattern, which is the sequence. It's similar to Candidate 1 and also predicts a pink (6) pattern, and the dimension is also 21. Looks good!\n\n**Candidate 3, 11, 22, 23, 25:** These are throwing me. The rule appears to be to use the nearest pattern which is the Yellow. They all predict a yellow (4) pattern. That's a fail because of Example 1!\n\n**Candidate 16:** Does that but gets the height wrong and produces 3 instead of 2.\n\n**Candidate 19:** This one is wild. Its logic is that its extracting a rectangle from example 1, but ignoring dimension of the bounding box!\n\n**Candidate 22:** This, it gets the width right, extracts the rows, but follows the \"Nearest\".\n\n**Analysis and Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Candidate 2:** I think candidate \n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 2,\n      \"score\": 9.8,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Correctly identifies the 'sequence completion' logic (predicting the next color/shape in the series) and the bounding box alignment rules.
