        "Full raw LLM response": "**Solution Strategy for ARC Task: Movable Particles in Pipes**\n\nOkay, so the challenge here is to figure out how these colored dots are moving around within a grid. It seems like the inputs and outputs are the same size, with shapes made from contiguous blocks of different colors, and the only real difference is the position of these \"yellow\" pixels (represented by the number 4).  My initial observations show that these yellows move, and they're usually inside of other shapes. I've broken down the steps involved:\n\n**1. Analyze the movement:**  The yellow pixels don't seem to just jump randomly, they're more like particles in a tube. They stay within the boundary of the same shape and change its location, but not its size.\n\n**2. Detect the governing rule:** By looking at a few examples, it became clear that the rules are as follows:\n   -   They seem to have \u201cheads\u201d, which dictate a direction for movement, and are usually arranged within the bounding boxes that constitute the different colored shapes. These heads are identifiable by a pattern of blue (1) and red (2) pixels. I figured that the arrangement of these color pixels within the head pattern gives direction.\n   -   From the \u201chead\u201d, yellow pixels move horizontally or vertically until they hit the boundary of the shape.\n   -   The \"boundary\" is the same color as the shape itself.\n   - The dot stops at the last empty location before hitting a wall.\n  \n**3. Decipher the direction:**  I need to interpret the arrangement of blue (1) and red (2) pixels to find the head position, which then determines a direction. In the shapes, the number 2 is acting as an arrow, so, I figured out that if the heads arrangement is 1,1,2, then the direction is Right (like the arrow). If the arrangement is 2,1,1, the direction is Left (like the arrow).\n\n**4. Build a test:**  I will start by finding all yellow pixels (4s) in the test input, then trace their path based on the rule. It appears that the dots are not moving to empty spots, but to empty adjacent (or diagonal) locations within the \"pipe\" (area of same shape).\n\n**5. Applying the rules and Output:** Then, based on the positions of the yellow pixels, I'll then construct the output by placing all the yellow pixels in their final destination. The dots don't block each other.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the final positions of yellow pixels (represented by the integer 4) within a grid containing various shapes.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Shapes and Containers:** The grid contains static structures made of specific colors (Magenta 6 and Green 3 in the test input). These structures act as containers or obstacles. The yellow pixels (4) are located inside the empty spaces (0) within these structures.\n\n2.  **Identify Directional Indicators (\"Heads\"):** Each colored structure has a specific \"Head\" block containing a pattern of Blue (1) and Red (2) pixels. These patterns define a movement direction vector for the yellow pixels within that color's shape. The vector points from the average position of the Blue pixels (1) towards the average position of the Red pixels (2).\n\n    *   **Magenta Shape (6):** The head is in the top-left corner.\n        *   Red pixels (2) are in Row 1.\n        *   Blue pixels (1) are in Rows 2 and 3.\n        *   The Red pixels are above the Blue pixels.\n        *   **Direction:** **UP** (Vector: -1, 0).\n\n    *   **Green Shape (3):** The head is in the bottom-right quadrant (rows 14-19, cols 13-19).\n        *   Red pixels (2) are at (15,16) and (16,14). Average Row ~15.5, Average Col ~15.\n        *   Blue pixels (1) are at (16,17), (17,15), (17,18), (18,16). Average Row ~17, Average Col ~16.5.\n        *   The Red pixels are Above and to the Left of the Blue pixels.\n        *   **Direction:** **UP-LEFT** (Vector: -1, -1).\n\n3.  **Apply Movement:** Each yellow pixel (4) moves in the direction determined by its enclosing shape's color.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's my thought process:**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task. It's about taking grids with shapes made of colors and transforming them, focusing on small pixels, often yellow \"4\"s, that seem to move. The goal is to figure out the rule.\n\nI start by looking at examples. I see shapes of different colors, and then \"keys\". These keys are small rectangular blocks with interior patterns. The yellow pixels are *inside* larger shapes that seem to be the same color as the borders of these key blocks. The output shows the yellow pixels moving or changing.\n\nI analyze Example 1. There are shapes and keys, with some colored pixels inside them. I find patterns in the key blocks: they seem to have blue (1) and red (2) pixels. The outputs make it look like those yellow dots, inside some color shape, move relative to some key, often to an empty space.\n\nI hypothesize that the keys are somehow related to the movement of these yellow pixels. I investigate the position of pixels within the shapes and compare to positions in the key, but it doesn't work directly because the shapes are irregular.\n\nThen, I analyze the yellow dot movement. In Example 1, some move right, and some move left. In the key, there are blue(1) and red(2) pixels. The pixels 1 and 2, which are the interiors of the blocks, appear to determine the direction the dots move. I notice how the \"2\" pixel is on the right for one key and the left for the other.\n\nThis leads me to the idea that the number and position of 1s and 2s in these \"key\" blocks have meaning. I check sums of these blocks. The total numbers don't matter.\n\nI check Example 1 and find:\n- Orange is associated with moving dots right. The Key is 1,1,2 (right).\n- Grey is associated with moving dots left. The Key is 2,1,1 (left).\n\nI think the 1 and 2 locations in those rectangular \"Key\" blocks, determine the shift direction for the dots.\n\nThen, I check to see if the key can have a 5x7 block, in which the \"2\" is on the bottom-right. Example 2 confirms this pattern because the dots moves diagonally down and to the right.\n\nTo find the exact shift vector, I make this hypothesis: The direction is related to the location of the 1s and 2s in those \"key\" blocks. I propose to calculate the vector between the centroids (average position) of the 1s and the 2s to determine the \"gravity\" or direction the yellow dots should go, within a given shape.\n\nIn Example 2, this hypothesis explains why the yellow dots shift down-right.\n\nNext, I check Example 3 and see if this vector approach holds. The Example 3 Key is a similar situation where the 2s are at the bottom of the Key. The dots in Example 3 are moved down. I apply the same hypothesis.\n\nNow I look for a refined rule:\n1.  **Find the \"Key\" block.** It has a border color C and an interior of 1s and 2s.\n2.  **Determine the movement vector (V).** It is derived from centroid of 1s to centroid of 2s, V = Centroid(2) - Centroid(1).\n3.  **Find the direction (D).** Simplify from the vector's coordinates, for example (0,+2) -> (Up), (+1,0) -> (Right), (1,1) -> (Down-Right).\n4.  **For all yellow pixels.** They move until they hit a wall. Stop when 8-way adjacent to a wall.\n\nI check this new rule in my examples and test it out.\n\nThen I get to the Test Input and use all I've found to solve it. I use the previous examples to decode how the yellow pixels shift. I get all the new positions.\n\n\nThe transformation rule involves moving the yellow pixels (4) inside the hollow colored shapes. The direction of movement is determined by a \"key\" block of the same color.\n\n**1. Identifying the Keys and Directions:**\n*   **Orange Key (Color 6):** Located at the top-left (Rows 0-4, Cols 0-4).\n    *   Interior Logic: We calculate the vector from the centroid of `1`s (Blue) to the centroid of `2`s (Red).\n    *   `1`s are at rows 2 and 3. Average Row \u2248 2.5.\n    *   `2`s are at row 1. Average Row = 1.\n    *   Vector direction is Up (Row 1 < Row 2.5).\n    *   **Rule for Orange Shapes:** Move yellow dots **UP** until they are adjacent to an orange wall.\n\n*   **Green Key (Color 3):** Located at the bottom-right (Rows 14-19, Cols 13-19).\n    *   Interior Logic:\n        *   `2`s are at local coordinates (1,3) and (2,1). Average Row \u2248 1.5, Average Col \u2248 2.\n        *   `1`s are at local coordinates (2,4), (3,2), (3,5), (4,3). Average Row \u2248 3, Average Col \u2248 3.5.\n    *   Vector direction (from `1`s to `2`s): Row decreases (Up), Col decreases (Left).\n    *   **Rule for Green Shapes:** Move yellow dots **UP-LEFT** (diagonally) until they are adjacent to a green wall.\n\n**2. Applying the Rules to Yellow Dots:**\n\n*   **Orange Shape (Top Right Loop):**\n    *   Dot at **(5, 16)**: Moves Up. Wall at (3, 16). Stops at **(4, 16)**.\n    *   Dot at **(8, 18)**: Moves Up. Wall at (1, 18). Stops at **(2, 18)**.\n\n*   **Green Shape (Large Central Loop):**\n    *   Dot at **(7, 9)**: Moves Up-Left. Path: (6,8) -> (5,7). Wall at (5,6). Stops at **(5, 7)**.\n    *   Dot at **(8, 11)**: Moves Up-Left. Path: (7,10) -> (6,9) -> (5,8) -> (4,7). Wall at (4,6). Stops at **(4, 7)**.\n    *   Dot at **(13, 6)**: Moves Up-Left. Path: (12,5). Wall at (12,4). Stops at **(12, 5)**.\n    *   Dot at **(17, 5)**: Moves Up-Left. Path: (16,4) -> (15,3). Wall at (15,2). Stops at **(15, 3)**.\n\n**3.

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern for the number 4 markers.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1. Each grid has template patterns (bounded by colors like 5, 6, 7) and enclosed regions containing 4s\n2. The 4s mark positions inside enclosed regions\n3. The transformation moves each 4 to be adjacent to the boundary on the **opposite side** of the region from where it's closest\n\n**Rule:** For each 4, find the nearest boundary of its enclosing region, then move the 4 to be adjacent to the boundary on the opposite side.\n\n**Applying to test input:**\n\nFinding the 4 positions:\n- (5, 16): In 6-bounded region. Closest boundary is left (col 14). Moves toward right \u2192 (5, 18)\n- (7, 9): In 3-bounded region. Closest boundary is bottom (row 9). Moves toward top \u2192 (2, 9)\n- (8, 11): In 3-bounded region. Closest boundary is bottom (row 9). Moves toward top \u2192 (2, 11)\n- (8, 18): In 6-bounded region. Closest boundary is right (col 19). Moves toward left \u2192 (8, 17)\n- (13, 6): In 3-bounded region. Closest boundary is left (cols 3-4). Moves toward right \u2192 (13, 9)\n- (17, 5): In 3-bounded region. Closest boundary is bottom (row 18).

        "Full raw LLM response": "**High\u2011level pattern**\n\nLooking at the three solved examples:\n\n- The only color that ever changes position is **4**.  \n- Colors 0,1,2 and the \u201cmain shape\u201d colors (5,7, etc.) never change.\n- In each example, all 4\u2019s move in the **same direction** within that puzzle:\n  - Example 1: purely horizontal moves.\n  - Example 2: diagonal down\u2011right.\n  - Example 3: purely vertical down.\n- After moving, every 4 ends up on a **0\u2011cell that is immediately adjacent (in the movement direction) to a non\u2011zero cell of the main shape** (color 5 or 7 in the examples).\n\nSo the task is:\n\n> For each puzzle, infer a global \u201cmovement direction\u201d from the 1/2 pattern, then slide every 4 along that direction through zeros until it is just before the first non\u2011zero cell in that direction.\n\n---\n\n### How the movement direction is determined\n\nIn all training examples, the digits **1 and 2** form a small motif that indicates the direction:\n\n- **Example 1**\n\n  In the left block of 7\u2019s we see `1,1,2` arranged horizontally (rows 2 & 4, columns 2\u20134).  \n  In the right block of 5\u2019s we see `2,1,1`, also horizontal.  \n  That tells us the axis is **horizontal**.\n\n  Every 4 then slides horizontally through zeros until it is just before the next non\u2011zero cell along the chosen horizontal direction in its row.\n\n  You can verify:\n  - (7,10) \u2192 (7,12) ends just before a 7 at column 13.\n  - (11,5) \u2192 (11,9) ends just before a 7 at column 10.\n  - (13,16) \u2192 (13,12) ends just before a 5 at column 11.\n  - (16,5) \u2192 (16,3), (17,14) \u2192 (17,8), each stops just before a 5.\n\n- **Example 2**\n\n  The 1s and 2s in the top\u2011right 5\u2011block form a pattern whose dominant direction is **down\u2011right** (for instance from 1 at (3,15) to 2 at (5,17) is (2,+2)).  \n  So the global direction is **diagonal down\u2011right** (dr=+1, dc=+1).\n\n  For each 4:\n  - Start at its position.\n  - Step repeatedly (row+1, col+1) as long as the next cell is 0.\n  - Stop at the last 0 just before the first non\u2011zero.\n\n  Examples:\n  - (10,4) \u2192 (11,5) (0) \u2192 (12,6) (0) \u2192 next (13,7)=5. So final is (12,6).\n  - (16,12) \u2192 (17,13) (0) \u2192 next (18,14)=5. Final is (17,13).\n\n- **Example 3**\n\n  The 1/2 motif in the top\u2011right is vertical: 1s above, 2s below in the same columns, so axis is **vertical**. The direction from 1s to 2s is **downward**.\n\n  For each 4, we:\n  - Move straight **down** through zeros.\n  - Stop on the last zero before the first non\u2011zero below.\n\n  Check:\n  - Column 6: 4 at (7,6), below: 0,0,0,5 \u2192 stop at (10,6).  \n  - Column 7: 4 at (14,7), below: 0,0,0,0,0,5 \u2192 stop at (19,7).  \n  - Column 11: 4 at (14,11), below: 0,0,0,5 \u2192 stop at (17,11).\n\n  In all cases the final 4 is immediately above a 5.\n\nSo the **rule** that fits all training examples is:\n\n> 1. Use the arrangement of 1s/2s to pick a single global direction vector D (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).  \n> 2. For each 4, repeatedly step one cell along D as long as the next cell is 0.  \n> 3. Stop when the next cell along D is non\u2011zero or outside the grid.  \n> 4. Place the 4 at the last 0 you visited (its new position).  \n>    (If the next cell from the starting position is already non\u2011zero, the 4 does not move.)\n\nAfter movement, each 4 sits on a 0\u2011cell which has a non\u2011zero neighbor exactly one step in direction D.\n\n---\n\n### Applying the rule to the test input\n\nFirst identify the direction from the 1/2 patterns.\n\nIn the test grid:\n\n- Top\u2011left around the 6\u2011frame:\n  - Column 2: row2=2, rows3\u20134=1 \u2192 2 above 1s \u2192 vertical.\n  - Column 4: same structure.\n- Bottom\u2011right inside the 3\u2011area:\n  - Column 17: row16=2, row19=1 \u2192 again 2 above 1.\n\nSo in both regions the 2s are **above** 1s in the same column. That matches the vertical **downward** direction from 2 to 1, exactly like in Example 3.  \nTherefore, the global direction D for this puzzle is:\n\n> **Downwards** (dr=+1, dc=0)\n\nNow process each 4.\n\nThe original 4s are at:\n\n- A: (6,17)\n- B: (8,10)\n- C: (9,12)\n- D: (9,19)\n- E: (14,7)\n- F: (18,6)\n\nWe use the original grid, move every 4 **straight down** through zeros, and stop at the last zero before a non\u2011zero.\n\n---\n\n#### A: 4 at (6,17)\n\nColumn 17 values (rows 1\u219220):\n\n`[0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 3, 3, 1, 3]`\n\nFrom row 6:\n\n- row7,col17 = 6 (non\u2011zero) immediately below.\n\nSo there is **no zero below** it; it already sits directly on top of a non\u2011zero.  \nBy the rule, A does **not move**: stays at (6,17).\n\n---\n\n#### B: 4 at (8,10)\n\nColumn 10 values (rows 1\u219220):\n\n`[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]`\n\nFrom (8,10):\n\n- row9,col10 = 0 \u2192 can move down.\n- row10,col10 = 3 (non\u2011zero) \u2192 barrier.\n\nSo we stop on the last 0 before the 3, at row 9.  \nB moves: **(8,10) \u2192 (9,10)**.\n\n---\n\n#### C: 4 at (9,12)\n\nColumn 12 values:\n\n`[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom (9,12):\n\n- row10,col12 = 3 (non\u2011zero) directly below.\n\nSo no zero below; C does **not move**: stays at **(9,12)**.\n\n---\n\n#### D: 4 at (9,19)\n\nColumn 19 values:\n\n`[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3]`\n\nFrom (9,19):\n\n- row10,col19 = 0 \u2192 can move down.\n- row11,col19 = 6 (non\u2011zero) \u2192 barrier.\n\nSo D moves to row 10: **(9,19) \u2192 (10,19)**.\n\n---\n\n#### E: 4 at (14,7)\n\nColumn 7 values:\n\n`[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]`\n\nFrom (14,7):\n\n- row15,col7 = 0\n- row16,col7 = 0\n- row17,col7 = 0\n- row18,col7 = 0\n- row19,col7 = 0\n- row20,col7 = 3 (non\u2011zero)\n\nSo we slide all the way to row 19, the last 0 before the 3 at row 20:  \nE moves: **(14,7) \u2192 (19,7)**.\n\n---\n\n#### F: 4 at (18,6)\n\nColumn 6 values:\n\n`[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3]`\n\nFrom (18,6):\n\n- row19,col6 = 3 (non\u2011zero) just below.\n\nSo F does **not move**, stays at **(18,6)**.\n\n---\n\n### Constructing the output grid\n\nWe start from the input grid, turn the original 4\u2011cells to 0, then set 4 at the new positions:\n\n- (6,17): remains 4 (unchanged)\n- (8,10): becomes 0 (B moved)\n- (9,12): remains 4\n- (9,19): becomes 0\n- (10,19): becomes 4\n- (14,7): becomes 0 (E moved)\n- (18,6): remains 4\n- (19,7): becomes 4\n\nAll other cells stay as they are.\n\nFinal output grid:\n\nRow1:  `6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow2:  `6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6`  \nRow3:  `6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,6,0,0,6`  \nRow4:  `6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6`  \nRow5:  `6,6,6,6,6,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,0,0,0,0,6`  \nRow6:  `0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,4,0,0,6`  \nRow7:  `0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6`  \nRow8:  `0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6`  \nRow9:  `0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6`  \nRow10: `0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,4,6`  \nRow11: `0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6`  \nRow12: `0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow13: `0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow14: `0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow15: `0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3`  \nRow16: `0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3`  \nRow17: `0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3`  \nRow18: `0,0,3,3,0,4,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3`  \nRow19: `0,0,0,3,3,3,4,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3`  \nRow20: `0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3`",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this puzzle, I need to identify the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\nIn each example, I notice:\n1. There are \"template\" patterns with colored borders (7, 5, 6, or 3) containing internal patterns of 1s and 2s\n2. There are enclosed irregular regions bounded by the same colors\n3. Each region contains one or more markers (4s)\n4. The 4s move within their enclosed regions to be adjacent to boundaries\n\n**Key Pattern Discovery:**\nThe 4s slide in a specific direction until they hit a boundary wall. The direction depends on:\n- The orientation of the template's internal pattern (vertical stripes = vertical movement)\n- When two templates exist horizontally, movement is horizontal\n- The 4 moves the maximum distance possible in the allowed direction\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\nTemplates identified:\n- 6-bordered template (top-left, rows 0-4, cols 0-4): Has vertical stripe pattern (2,1,1)\n- 3-bordered template (bottom-right, rows 14-19, cols 13-19)\n\n4s located at:\n- (5,16): 6-bounded region \u2192 vertical movement, moves UP to (4,16)\n- (7,9): 3-bounded region \u2192 horizontal movement, moves LEFT to (7,3)  \n- (8,11): 3-bounded region \u2192 horizontal movement, moves LEFT to (8,4)\n- (8,18): 6-bounded region \u2192 vertical movement, moves UP to (2,18)\n- (13,6): 3-bounded region (lower) \u2192 vertical movement, moves DOWN to (18,6)\n- (17,5): 3-bounded region (lower) \u2192 vertical movement, moves UP to (11,5)\n\n**Output Grid:**\n\n```\n6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,6,0,4,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,6,6,6,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,0,4,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,0,6\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n0,0,0,3,3,3,4,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Explanation of the transformation**\n\nIn all the provided examples nothing changes except the positions of the cells with value\u202f4. The direction in which a 4 is \u201cslid\u201d is determined by the placement of the digits\u202f1 and\u202f2 in the input:\n\n- If the set of rows of the 1s and 2s are the same but the columns differ, the movement is horizontal.\n- If the set of columns are the same but the rows differ, the movement is vertical.\n- If both rows and columns differ, the movement is along a diagonal.\n\nThe orientation along that axis is from the 1s toward the 2s (e.g. if the 2s are below the 1s the movement is downward; if the 2s are above/left, the movement is up\u2011left, etc.). If an axis is ambiguous, the 4 is slid to the farther end along that axis, as seen in example\u202f1.\n\nFor each 4, starting from its current position, step cell by cell in the determined direction through zeros until the next step would hit a non\u2011zero cell or go out of bounds; place the 4 in the last zero before that obstacle, and clear its original position.\n\nIn the test grid the 2s are on average above and to the left of the 1s, so the direction is up\u2011left (row\u202f\u22121, col\u202f\u22121). Sliding each 4 in that direction until just before a non\u2011zero gives the following output.\n\n**Output grid**\n\n6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,6,0,0,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,6,6,6,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,4,0,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,4,0,6\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,0,6\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3",

        "Full raw LLM response": "The solved examples show that the digits\u202f1 and\u202f2 embedded in a coloured region encode a direction: the vector from the centroid of the 1s to the centroid of the 2s (normalized to \u22121, 0, 1 steps) gives the movement direction for 4s associated with that colour. For each grid, determine the direction for each colour with an embedded 1/2 pattern. Then, for each 4, choose the colour of the nearest non\u2011zero cell and move the 4 one step at a time along that colour\u2019s direction through empty cells until the next step would hit any non\u2011zero; place the 4 in the last empty cell and clear its original position.\n\nIn the test grid, the 1/2 pattern in the 6\u2011coloured block points upward, and the pattern in the 3\u2011coloured block points up\u2011left.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**High\u2011level pattern**\n\n1. In each training pair there is at least one **5\u00d75 \u201cframe\u201d** made of some color \\(B\\) (7, 5, 3 or 6) with digits 1 and 2 embedded.\n2. The arrangement of the 1\u2019s and 2\u2019s in that 5\u00d75 block encodes a **direction vector**:\n   - Compute the centroid of all 1\u2019s and the centroid of all 2\u2019s in that 5\u00d75.\n   - The vector from the 1\u2011centroid to the 2\u2011centroid gives a direction \\(D_B\\) \u2208 {(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1), (-1,-1), (1,1), (-1,1), (1,-1)} after normalization to unit steps.\n3. The only cells that change are the **4\u2019s**. For each relevant color \\(B\\):\n   - Look along the line through a 4 in direction \\(D_B\\) and in direction \\(-D_B\\).\n   - If in both directions you eventually hit a cell of color \\(B\\), and *all* cells strictly between the 4 and those B\u2019s are either 0 or 4, then the 4 lies in a **\u201ccorridor\u201d of zeros between two B\u2019s** along direction \\(D_B\\).\n   - That 4 is associated with color \\(B\\).\n4. For each such 4, you then **slide it along the direction \\(D_B\\)** (from 1s towards 2s), moving step by step through zeros, and stop at the last 0 just before the first non\u2011zero cell in that direction.\n\nThis rule explains all three training examples:\n\n- Example 1:\n  - Two 5\u00d75 frames:\n    - Color 7 frame: 1\u2019s cluster left, 2\u2019s cluster right \u2192 \\(D_7 = (0,+1)\\) (east).\n    - Color 5 frame (on the right): 1\u2019s right, 2\u2019s left \u2192 \\(D_5 = (0,-1)\\) (west).\n  - Each 4 lies in a horizontal zero corridor between two 7\u2019s or two 5\u2019s.  \n    It is slid horizontally in the direction of the corresponding arrow (east for 7, west for 5), exactly matching the output.\n\n- Example 2:\n  - Single 5\u00d75 frame of color 5 with arrow down\u2011right: centroid(1) \u2192 centroid(2) \u2248 (1.5,1.5) \u2192 \\(D_5 = (1,1)\\).\n  - Each 4 sits in a diagonal corridor between two 5\u2019s along that diagonal; they slide down\u2011right until just before the next 5.\n\n- Example 3:\n  - Single 5\u00d75 frame of color 5 with arrow straight down: \\(D_5 = (1,0)\\).\n  - Each 4 lies in a vertical zero corridor between two 5\u2019s; they slide straight down until they rest just above the lower 5\u2011segment.\n\nSo: **\u201cThe 5\u00d75 1/2\u2011pattern acts like an arrow; 4\u2019s in B\u2011colored corridors slide in that arrow\u2019s direction until they hit the B\u2011structure.\u201d**\n\n---\n\n## Applying to the test input\n\n### 1. Find the 5\u00d75 \u201carrow\u201d blocks\n\nThere are two distinct colors participating with 1/2\u2011patterns:\n\n#### Color 6 (top\u2011left)\n\nRows 1\u20135, columns 1\u20135:\n\n```\n6 6 6 6 6\n6 2 6 2 6\n6 1 6 1 6\n6 1 6 1 6\n6 6 6 6 6\n```\n\nLocal coordinates (row, col) in this 5\u00d75:\n\n- 1\u2019s: (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4)\n- 2\u2019s: (2,2), (2,4)\n\nCentroids:\n\n- mean(1) = (3.5, 3)\n- mean(2) = (2,   3)\n\nVector from 1 \u2192 2: (2 \u2212 3.5, 3 \u2212 3) = (\u22121.5, 0) \u2192 normalized to \\(D_6 = (-1, 0)\\) (straight up).\n\nSo for color 6, the arrow points **upwards**.\n\n#### Color 3 (bottom\u2011right)\n\nDigits 1 and 2 for color 3 cluster in rows 15\u201319, columns 15\u201319. That 5\u00d75 patch is:\n\n(rows 15\u201319, cols 15\u201319)\n\n```\n3 3 3 3 3\n3 3 2 3 3\n2 3 3 1 3\n3 1 3 3 1\n3 3 3 1 3\n```\n\nLocal coordinates:\n\n- 2\u2019s: (2,3), (3,1)\n- 1\u2019s: (3,4), (4,2), (4,5), (5,4)\n\nCentroids:\n\n- mean(1) = (4.0, 3.75)\n- mean(2) = (2.5, 2.0)\n\nVector 1 \u2192 2: (2.5 \u2212 4.0, 2.0 \u2212 3.75) = (\u22121.5, \u22121.75) \u2248 (\u22121, \u22121).\n\nSo for color 3 we take \\(D_3 = (-1, -1)\\): **diagonal up\u2011left**.\n\n### 2.
