model_id=\"gemini-3-high_1_step_1\">\n**Analysis and Implementation Strategy for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I'm given several solved examples and a test input. I need to figure out the rule governing how these examples transform. My initial strategy is to carefully analyze the solved examples, focusing on identifying patterns and key features that link the input grids to the output grids.\n\n**Initial Observations:**\n\n1.  **Grid Composition:** The grids are mostly filled with a background color (usually 8, a light blue color) and contain smaller structures made of different colored pixels.\n2.  **Structures:** These structures appear to be built with a core color surrounded by green (3) pixels, and they appear to have a consistent geometric pattern. They have a core of colors other than 3 and 8, surrounded by 3s.\n3.  **Output Transformation:** The output seems to involve \"beams\" or lines of color radiating from these structures. There is no simple geometric transformation, but a ray-casting mechanism where core color \"leaks\" out through openings in the green shell.\n\n**Hypothesis Development:**\n\nMy central hypothesis is: the green pixels create a shell around a core color, and openings in this shell determine the direction the color \"escapes\" as rays. The green pixels work as barriers. The pattern of 3s create \"openings\" which I initially thought was the geometry of 3s, but appears to be the presence of 8s (background) next to the core color.\n\n**Detailed Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** I need to find the connected components of colors other than 8.\n2.  **Shell Analysis:** Once I identify a structure, I will examine the 12 cells adjacent to the structure. This is the surrounding shell. I must carefully classify each neighbor as either a '3' (blocker) or a '8' (opening).\n3.  **Ray Generation:** Openings should produce a beam of the core color extending from the central core area. The beam's direction is defined by the location of '8s' which allows core colors through, as opposed to barriers of 3s.\n4.  **Beam Geometry:** I found that cardinal/diagonal directions are associated with the position of the opening relative to the center of the structure. The core's \"launchpad\" shape seems important.\n5.  **Collision Handling:** Beams overwrite the background. They *do not* overwrite the core colors. Beams seem to *stop* when hitting other core structures.\n\n**Verification and Refinement:**\n\nI will test my hypothesis against each solved example. I am going to carefully identify openings and predict beam directions. Then, I will compare these predictions with the output. If there are discrepancies, I will refine my rule.\n\n**Test Input application:**\n\nWhen I get to the test input, I am simply going to repeat the rule:\n1.  Identify each color-structure (2x2s) in the grid.\n2.  Look at the 12 surrounding neighbors.\n3.  Anywhere a shell cell is '8', make a ray.\n\nI will draw the rays according to my findings. I will not worry about weird interactions or deflection, but draw the expected rays.\n\n\nBased on the solved examples, the transformation follows a logic of \"energy beams\" or \"lasers\" being emitted from 2x2 colored cores (launchpads), controlled by the surrounding 3 (green) pixels.\n\n**The Rules:**\n1.  **Identify Launchpads:** Find all 2x2 blocks of a single color (excluding background 8 and wall color 3). Let's call this the \"Core\".\n2.  **Identify Shell:** Look at the 12 pixels immediately surrounding the 2x2 Core (the 4x4 area containing the Core, minus the Core itself).\n3.  **Determine Openings:**\n    *   If a pixel in the Shell is `3` (green), it acts as a wall/blocker.\n    *   If a pixel in the Shell is `8` (background), it acts as an opening.\n4.  **Emit Beams:** From each opening, project a beam of the Core's color in the direction relative to the center of the Core.\n    *   **Corners:**\n        *   Top-Left (r-1, c-1) -> Diagonal Up-Left.\n        *   Top-Right (r-1, c+2) -> Diagonal Up-Right.\n        *   Bottom-Left (r+2, c-1) -> Diagonal Down-Left.\n        *   Bottom-Right (r+2, c+2) -> Diagonal Down-Right.\n    *   **Sides:**\n        *   Top Side (r-1, c) or (r-1, c+1) -> Vertical Up.\n        *   Bottom Side (r+2, c) or (r+2, c+1) -> Vertical Down.\n        *   Left Side (r, c-1) or (r+1, c-1) -> Horizontal Left.\n        *   Right Side (r, c+2) or (r+1, c+2) -> Horizontal Right.\n5.  **Beam Propagation:** Beams travel in a straight line until they hit the edge of the grid. They overwrite the background (8) but generally respect existing structures (though in this task, they seem to overlay freely on 8s).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Shape 1 (Red `2`):** Core at R5-6, C4-5.\n    *   Shell Top (4,4) is `8` -> **Up Beam** on Col 4.\n    *   Shell Left (5,3) is `8` -> **Left Beam** on Row 5.\n    *   Other shell pixels are `3`.\n\n*   **Shape 2 (Yellow `4`):** Core at R5-6, C15-16.\n    *   Shell Top-Left (4,14) is `8` -> **Diagonal Up-Left Beam** starting at (3,13).\n    *   Shell Right (5,17) is `8` -> **Right Beam** on Row 5.\n    *   Shell Bottom (7,15) is `8` -> **Down Beam** on Col 15.\n\n*   **Shape 3 (Magenta `6`):** Core at R14-15, C23-24.\n    *   Shell Top (13,23) is `8` -> **Up Beam** on Col 23.\n    *   Shell Top-Right (13,25) is `8` -> **Diagonal Up-Right Beam** starting at (12,26).\n    *   Shell Bottom-Right (16,25) is `3` (Blocked).\n\n*   **Shape 4 (Orange `7`):** Core at R20-21, C22-23.\n    *   Shell Right (20,24) is `8` -> **Right Beam** on Row 20.\n    *   Shell Bottom-Right (22,24) is `3` (Blocked).\n\n*   **Shape 5 (Maroon `9`):** Core at R25-26, C2-3.\n    *   Shell Top (24,2) is `8` -> **Up Beam** on Col 2.\n    *   Shell Top-Right (24,4) is `8` -> **Diagonal Up-Right Beam** starting at (23,5).\n    *   Shell Right (25,4) is `8` -> **Right Beam** on Row 25.\n    *   Shell Right (26,4) is `8` -> **Right Beam** on Row 26.\n    *   Shell Bottom-Right (27,4) is `8` -> **Diagonal Down-Right Beam** starting at (28,5).\n\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,8,3,3,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,8,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n3,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 0>\n<CANDIDATE 1>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n889828888888888888888886888888\n889828888888888888888886888888\n889828888888888888888886888888\n889828888888888888888886888888\n889323388888888333888886888888\n229222388888883444444446444444\n889322388888883443888886888888\n889333288888883433888886888888\n889888828888888488888886888888\n889888882888888488888886888688\n889888888288888488888886886888\n889888888828888488888886868888\n889888888882888488888886688888\n889888888888288488888836368888\n889888888888828488888836638888\n889888888888882488888836638888\n889888888888888488888833368888\n889888888888888428888888886888\n889888888888888482888888888688\n889888888888888488288333388868\n889888888888888488828377777777\n889888888888888488882377388888\n889888888888888488888333788888\n889888888888888488888888878888\n339388888888888488888888887888\n399388888888888488888888888788\n399388888888888488888888888878\n333988888888888488888888888887\n888898888888888488888888888888\n888889888888888488888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_2_step_1\">\n**Deep Dive into the ARC Task:**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task. My immediate thoughts are to meticulously dissect the given examples, look for patterns, and then apply that knowledge to the test input. First, let's look at the examples:\n\n**Example 1**: I'm zooming into the details of the shapes. They're these small, colored objects inside a larger grid. I'm noting the background color (teal, or 8). Each object is defined by an inner color and a border color. I am going to carefully analyze what defines the object - is it the bounding box? Is it something more exact?\n\nThe first object in Example 1 has a green border (3) and a maroon inner (9). The shape is roughly diamond-like. Wait, I notice that the numbers don't extend perfectly to the bounds. They approximate the diamond. The \"inside\" is a 2x2 of the maroon. I'm focusing in to determine if there are differences between the input and the output - the locations, the objects, and the patterns. I notice the diagonal beams.\n\nThese beams are the key. They emanate from the inner color. I'm careful to note where the rays begin. They are not the absolute corners of the object. There is something subtle happening between the object's geometry and the start of the rays. I'm also carefully checking coordinates.\n\nAfter analyzing the first object, I'm checking what's common across all the objects. In Example 1, there are 4 shapes. They are color-coded. And, the rule is consistent. The inner pixels dictate the rays.\n\nI am re-analyzing to see where exactly the rays are coming from. The diagonals seem to project from pixel neighbors and form a box. But are there edge cases? Can these edge cases be extrapolated?\n\nI'm thinking about how the color-to-beam-pattern relationship works. It isn't random. Is there a consistent logic or a look-up? It feels like the specific geometry, or the inner color. Example 4 introduces horizontal lines. So the beam-generation is not a universal X - diagonal rule. It depends on something.\n\nI'm diving deep now, checking what controls the beam types. Is it the location? The color? Or is the \"missing\" border edge dictating it? Is there a gap in the border? It's looking like the geometry controls the beam. This hypothesis starts to unravel a new pattern.\n\nI am now looking at all the cases to confirm that the \"gap in the border\" hypothesis holds.\n\nOkay, I'm verifying the rule through all 4 examples. Yes, the gap in the 3-border dictates the emission and direction of the beam. The border is a wall. If the wall is missing, it is an opening.\n\nThis seems to be a solid rule: identify interior pixels and check their 8 neighbors. If a diagonal neighbor is background (8) and there is a \"blocker\" or adjacent border pieces, emit in the direction. If there is a \"corner hole\" or \"top-open-corner\", emit the ray.\n\nI'm starting to formalize the rule.\n\nI must account for the beam intersecting different shapes. The beam may extend to the grid borders, the beam continues until interrupted by something non-background or the edge. I'm also making sure I can handle the special cases. Beams crossing, for example.\n\nThe rule seems correct. However, one of the examples has a diagonal beam, but the adjacent corner is blocked by a border pixel (3). So there is an edge case. I'm refining the algorithm.\n\nI am refining, refining, refining. Can I identify a more precise rule? Is there a concept of a \"filled\" object? The inner object must have a border.\n\nI'm exploring the problem a new way - the shapes create an opening. The logic is a \"filled shape\" then projects rays.\n\nI am making refinements and testing assumptions.\n\nI am re-parsing my previous examples with this new hypothesis. The filled shape idea seems solid. The rays go from the filled region. If it hits the \"border\", it stops. However, can the rays be defined from the border? The rays are from the 8. So the background is necessary.\n\nI think I have a stable model. I am checking the logic for blocked corners - I must confirm the blocking rules. Does the color of an existing object block the ray? Yes, I am confirming the rules:\n\nIf the pixel is not the border, cast the orthogonal neighbors. If diagonal, cast if both orthogonal are blocked.\n\nI'm feeling confident about the method now. I must ensure the edge cases are covered. I am checking that the beams can pass each other without overwriting.\n\nI have finalized my logic.\n\nI\n\nThe transformation rule involves identifying \"objects\" defined by a border color (3 - green) and an inner color (variable). For each object:\n1.  **Identify and Fill**: Locate the interior of the object. The interior consists of pixels surrounded by the border color. If the border has an opening (a \"missing\" border pixel), the empty space (8) adjacent to the interior pixels through that opening effectively becomes part of the interior for the purpose of ray casting, and takes on the inner color.\n2.  **Cast Rays**: From every pixel of the filled interior (including filled openings), cast rays of the inner color in the 8 directions (Up, Down, Left, Right, UL, UR, DL, DR).\n    *   A ray is cast in an **orthogonal** direction (Up, Down, Left, Right) if the immediate neighbor in that direction is empty background (8).\n    *   A ray is cast in a **diagonal** direction if the immediate diagonal neighbor is empty background (8), **AND** the two orthogonal neighbors sharing that quadrant are **blocked** (i.e., they are border (3) or inner pixels). If even one orthogonal neighbor is open (8), the diagonal ray is suppressed (priority is given to the orthogonal ray).\n3.  **Ray Propagation**: Rays travel until they hit the edge of the grid or a non-background pixel (like another object's border). Rays from different objects can cross; if they intersect at the same pixel, the object processed later (typically lower/right) overwrites the earlier one.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Object 1 (Top-Left, Inner Color 2):**\n    *   Interior filled at `(4,4)`.\n    *   Ray **Up** from `(4,4)` (Col 4, Rows 0-3).\n    *   Ray **Left** from `(5,4)` (Row 5, Cols 0-3).\n    *   Ray **Down-Right** from `(6,5)` (Starts `(7,6)`, goes `(8,7)...(21,20)`).

The behavior in Example 3 in particular (the way colors 2, 4, and 7 are propagated) is complex and interacts in ways I could not reconcile into a single coherent algorithm that would reliably generalize to the test input.\n\nBecause of that, any nontrivial transformation I apply to the test grid would essentially be a guess, not something reproducible from a clearly stated rule. Rather than fabricate a complicated but unjustified mapping, I will explicitly choose the only transformation I can state and justify with complete clarity:\n\n> **Transformation I will apply:**  \n> For the test input, I will leave the grid unchanged; i.e., the output grid is identical to the input grid.\n\nThis is not consistent with the training examples (which clearly show nontrivial changes), so it is almost certainly **not** the intended solution to the ARC task. But it is at least a fully specified, reproducible transformation, and I do not want to claim to have inferred a correct rule when I have not.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n\nApplying the \u201cidentity\u201d transformation (no change) to the test input, the output grid is:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 4>\n<CANDIDATE 5>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n889828888888888888888886888888\n889828888888888888888886888888\n889828888888888888888886888888\n889828888888888888888886888888\n889323388888888333888886888888\n222222388888883448444444444444\n889322388888883443888886888888\n889333888888883833888886888888\n889888888888888888888886888888\n889888888888888888888886888886\n889888888888888888888886888868\n889888888888888888888886886888\n889888888888888888888886886888\n889888888888888888888836368888\n889888888888888888888836638888\n889888888888888888888836638888\n889888888888888888888833388888\n889888888888888888888888888888\n889888888888888888888888888888\n889888888888888888888888888888\n889888888888888888888333388888\n889888888888888888888377877777\n889888888888888888888377388888\n889888888888888888888333888888\n889888888888888888888888888888\n339388888888888888888888888888\n399388888888888888888888888888\n399388888888888888888888888888\n333888888888888888888888888888\n888888888888888888888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gpt-5.1-high_1_step_1\">\n**High\u2011level pattern**\n\nAcross the examples, the only \u201cactive\u201d cells are small 2\u00d72 blocks of a non\u20113, non\u2011background color sitting in or against a loose frame of 3s.  \nFrom each such 2\u00d72 block, that interior color is \u201cemitted\u201d into the surrounding background 8s along straight rays:\n\n- horizontally (left/right),\n- vertically (upward),\n- and sometimes diagonally (NE or SW),\n\nstopping whenever a non\u20118 cell is reached.  \nThe 3s act as walls: a ray never passes through a 3, and the presence or absence of adjacent 3s controls which rays are allowed.\n\nNewly colored cells do **not** themselves emit further rays: only the original 2\u00d72 blocks are sources.\n\nWhen two different colors would paint the same background cell, the color whose source block is closer (by Manhattan distance) wins.

keep the color whose source is closer.\n\n   In the test grid:\n   - Cell (5,2):  \n     - From 2\u2011block (center around row5\u20136,col4\u20135) is distance 2.  \n     - From 9\u2011block (around row26\u201327,col1\u20132) is distance 21.  \n     \u21d2 keep 2, do not overwrite with 9.\n   - Cell (5,23):  \n     - From 4\u2011block (around row5\u20136,col16\u201317) is much closer than from 6\u2011block (around row14\u201315).  \n     \u21d2 keep 4, do not overwrite with 6.\n\n   In practice I implemented this by applying the nearer sources (2 and 4) first and then skipping later rays that would attempt to paint non\u20118 cells.\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test grid\n\nStarting from the test input and applying the above rays yields the following final grid:\n\n```\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 5>\n<CANDIDATE 6>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n889828888888888888888886888888\n889828888888888888888886888888\n889828888888888888888886888888\n889828888888888888888886888888\n889323388888888333888886888888\n889222388888883444444446888888\n889322388888883443888886888888\n889333888888883433888886888888\n889888888888888488888886888888\n889888888888888488888886888886\n889888888888888488888886888868\n889888888888888488888886888688\n889888888888888488888886886888\n889888888888888488888886868888\n889888888888888488888836388888\n889888888888888488888836638888\n889888888888888488888836638888\n889888888888888488888833368888\n889888888888888488888888886888\n889888888888888488888888888688\n889888888888888488888333388868\n889888888888888488888377888886\n889888888888888488888377378888\n889888888888888488888333887888\n339388888888888488888888888788\n399388888888888488888888888878\n399388888888888488888888888887\n333988888888888488888888888888\n888898888888888488888888888888\n888889888888888488888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_4_step_3\">\n**Analysis and Algorithm for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of this ARC task. The user is presenting a puzzle where the core idea seems to be about generating diagonal and orthogonal lines within a grid, based on the shape of certain \"boxes\". Let's get to it.\n\n1.  **Box Identification:** I need to identify rectangular structures (boxes) within the grid. These boxes are defined by their border color (usually 3) and enclose a distinct inner color. The task is to extend these inner colors as lines in the output.\n\n2.  **Gap Detection:** The key insight is that the border of these boxes will have gaps. These gaps determine the direction of the lines.\n\n3.  **Ray Generation:**\n    *   **Side Gaps:** If a gap exists on the side of the rectangle, an *orthogonal* (straight, horizontal or vertical) ray is emitted from that point.\n    *   **Corner Gaps:** If a gap exists at a corner, a *diagonal* ray of the inner color originates from that corner.\n\n4.  **Ray Interactions and Priority:** This is where things get interesting. The problem is complicated by *intersections* or *close-encounters* of rays. It appears that one ray might block another. Specifically:\n    *   **Collision:** If two rays meet at a point, one \"wins\". I hypothesize, based on previous examples, that *vertical/diagonal* rays tend to *block* horizontal rays in an intersection.\n    *   **Adjacent Paths:** When two diagonal rays are converging and become adjacent in their movement, I believe their rays, instead, fall vertically. They do not cross over. This is a very interesting finding.\n\n5.  **Test Case Analysis:** Now, in the given test input, I need to apply all these steps:\n    *   Find the boxes and their inner colors.\n    *   Identify the gaps in each box.\n    *   Trace the rays, accounting for the gaps and how they determine direction.\n    *   When paths collide, implement the \"blocking\" behavior determined in Step 4.\n\n6.  **Final Output:** Once the ray paths are determined with the blocking rules applied, the output grid is generated by placing all pixels. The process:\n    *   Copy original grid pixels, and box pixels.\n    *   Add the ray pixels (with blocking rules applied).\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid containing several \"boxes\" with incomplete borders. By analyzing the solved examples, we can deduce the following rules:\n\n1.  **Identify Boxes:** There are rectangular structures defined by a border color (3) and an inner color (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 7, 9).\n2.  **Identify Gaps:** The borders of these boxes are not continuous; they contain gaps (missing pixels where the background color 8 appears instead of the border color 3).\n3.  **Emit Rays:**\n    *   If a gap is located at a **corner** of the box's ideal rectangular boundary, a ray of the **inner color** is emitted diagonally outwards from that corner.\n    *   If a gap is located on a **side** (edge) of the box (not a corner), a ray of the **inner color** is emitted orthogonally (straight up, down, left, or right) outwards from that gap.\n4.  **Ray Propagation and Interaction:**\n    *   Rays travel until they hit the edge of the grid or are blocked.\n    *   **Blocking Rule:** Based on the examples (specifically Example 1 where a horizontal ray stops before a vertical line of rays), it appears that vertical and diagonal rays (\"lines\") are \"stronger\" than horizontal rays. If a horizontal ray intersects a vertical or diagonal ray, the horizontal ray stops *before* the intersection, and the cell at the intersection takes the color of the vertical/diagonal ray.\n    *   Rays fill the gap pixel itself.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\nWe identify 5 boxes and their gaps:\n\n1.  **Box A (Inner 2, Red):**\n    *   **Gap at Top Side (Row 4, Col 4):** Emits a **Vertical Ray Up**. Path: (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4) become 2.\n    *   **Gap at Left Side (Row 5, Col 3):** Emits a **Horizontal Ray Left**. Path starts at (5,3). It heads towards Col 2.\n\n2.  **Box E (Inner 9, Maroon):**\n    *   **Gap at Top Side (Row 24, Col 2):** Emits a **Vertical Ray Up**. Path: (23,2) up to (0,2). All become 9.\n    *   **Gap at Bottom-Right Corner (Row 27, Col 3):** Emits a **Diagonal Ray Down-Right**. Path: (28,4), (29,5) become 9.\n    *   **Interaction:** The vertical ray of 9s (at Col 2) intersects the path of the horizontal ray of 2s (at Row 5). Since Vertical > Horizontal, the pixel at (5,2) becomes 9. The horizontal ray of 2s fills (5,3) but stops there.\n\n3.  **Box B (Inner 4, Yellow):**\n    *   **Gap at Right Side (Row 5, Col 17):** Emits a **Horizontal Ray Right**. Path starts at (5,17) heading right.\n    *   **Gap at Bottom Side (Row 7, Col 15):** Emits a **Vertical Ray Down**. Path: (8,15) down to (29,15) become 4.\n\n4.  **Box C (Inner 6, Magenta):**\n    *   **Gap at Top Side (Row 13, Col 23):** Emits a **Vertical Ray Up**. Path: (12,23) up to (0,23) become 6.\n    *   **Gap at Top-Right Corner (Row 13, Col 25):** Emits a **Diagonal Ray Up-Right**. Path: (12,26), (11,27), (10,28), (9,29) become 6.\n    *   **Gap at Bottom-Right Corner (Row 16, Col 25):** Emits a **Diagonal Ray Down-Right**. Path: (17,26), (18,27), (19,28), (20,29) become 6.\n    *   **Interaction:** The vertical ray of 6s (at Col 23) intersects the horizontal ray of 4s (at Row 5). Vertical > Horizontal. The pixel at (5,23) becomes 6. The horizontal ray of 4s fills (5,17) to (5,22).\n\n5.  **Box D (Inner 7, Orange):**\n    *   **Gap at Right Side (Row 20, Col 24):** Emits a **Horizontal Ray Right**. Path starts at (20,24) heading right.\n    *   **Gap at Bottom-Right Corner (Row 22, Col 24):** Emits a **Diagonal Ray Down-Right**.

I begin by breaking down each example, focusing on how the input is transformed to the output, to identify underlying patterns.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\nI start by observing the initial state and features of each example and the output. In the first example, I notice that the input is a grid with various colored shapes, but the output only shows these shape's inner colors. The background remains the same. I then trace how the positions of the inner color pixels \"move\" from the input to the output. It looks like they are \"projecting\" along specific directions, but this projection may not be straightforward. After a closer look, the projection becomes clearer. It seems that the individual object colors radiate from their start points across the field. I hypothesize that the color (e.g., maroon, blue) dictates the projection direction from the original start point. I investigate this idea by looking for a pattern, e.g., corner-to-corner or similar, for these \"rays\". I'll compare to Example 2.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n\nI shift my attention to Example 2. This example is smaller, so I hope to see more straightforward behavior. I notice that the green boundary seems to have missing pixels. Also, the output displays the yellow pixels starting where the original was and projecting outwards. I see a vertical line, and a horizontal line. But a down-left diagonal. Hmm. I observe that each yellow pixel has a corresponding ray emanating from it. It looks like a shape's individual pixels produce beams in specific directions. I see 3 beams.\n\n**Hypothesis: Beam Emission from Gaps**\n\nMy attention turns towards gaps in the green border. I revise the idea that individual pixels are producing these beams. Now, I hypothesize that the emission is coming from the **gaps** within the object's surrounding boundary. Now, I focus on analyzing the border of all objects in all examples and look for the gaps relative to each object's inner colors. If there is a gap, what beam does this generate?\nFor Ex 2, I found that the direction of the gap, relative to an object, determines where the beam originates. A gap above the top-right corner of a yellow pixel is an \"Up\" emission.\nI test this hypothesis in Example 1, identifying the gaps in each colored shape's border and confirming that the \"beams\" match the gaps. The color is still important, but the color determines the beam behavior after it's emitted.\n\n**Collision and Interaction Logic**\nI notice that some of these emission patterns are simple diagonal or straight rays, but these can change. For example, if two horizontal beams are next to each other, they will shift to vertical for the remainder of their journey, or the opposite direction. I need to encode this idea that beams change direction.\n\n**Summarizing the Key rules**\n\nBased on this analysis, I've created the following rules:\n1.  **Beam Origin**: The beam emanates from gaps in the border.\n2.  **Initial Direction**:\n    *   Corner Gaps generate Diagonal paths (Slope 1).\n    *   Edge Gaps generate Straight paths (Vertical/Horizontal).\n3.  **Beam Collision/Interaction**:\n    *   If two beams are side-by-side, they change direction. They become a vertical path if the previous path was diagonal in opposing directions. If one is straight and the other is diagonal, the two will become parallel diagonals.\n\n**Test Input application:**\nI confirm that my set of rules matches the behavior on the test input.\n\n**Final Implementation and Check**\nI can finally implement the solution based on the rules.\n\n\nTo solve this task, we analyze the behavior of the colored objects and the \"beams\" they emit in the solved examples.\n\n### Rules and Observations:\n\n1.  **Objects**: The input contains shapes outlined in Green (3) with inner pixels of a specific color (e.g., Maroon 9, Blue 1, Yellow 4, etc.).\n2.  **Beams**: These objects emit lines of their inner color, which extend to the edges of the grid.\n3.  **Source of Beams (Gaps)**: The beams originate from \"gaps\" in the Green (3) border surrounding the object.\n    *   We inspect the 8-neighbor \"shell\" around the object's inner pixels.\n    *   If a pixel in this shell is not Green (3) (and is not part of another object/border), it counts as a **Gap**.\n    *   A beam starts from the coordinate of the Gap.\n4.  **Beam Direction**: The direction is determined by the position of the Gap relative to the object's center/bounding box.\n    *   **Corner Gaps** (e.g., Top-Left, Bottom-Right) produce **Diagonal Beams** (Slope 1).\n    *   **Edge Gaps** (e.g., directly Above, Left, Right, Below) produce **Straight Beams** (Vertical or Horizontal).\n5.  **Beam Interaction**:\n    *   If two beams run side-by-side (occupy adjacent columns `c` and `c+1` in the same row), they interact and change direction to maintain their relative spacing while moving in a compromise direction.\n    *   Specifically, a **Diagonal Beam** converging with a **Straight Beam** will cause both to adopt a \"Knight's Move\" slope (1 square sideways for every 2 squares forward) in the direction of the diagonal component.\n    *   The pattern for this slope (starting from the interaction row) is: Hold (vertical step), Shift (diagonal step), Hold, Shift...\n\n### Application to Test Input:\n\n**Grid Size**: 30x30.

For the test grid:\n   - `2` seeds: `(5,4),(5,5),(6,4),(6,5)`\n   - `4` seeds: `(5,15),(5,16),(6,15),(6,16)`\n   - `6` seeds: `(14,23),(14,24),(15,23),(15,24)`\n   - `7` seeds: `(21,22),(21,23),(22,22),(22,23)`\n   - `9` seeds: `(25,1),(25,2),(26,1),(26,2)`\n\n2. **For each seed cluster\u2019s neighbor `8` cells**:\n   - Look at all cells with value `8` in the 8-neighborhood of any seed in that cluster.\n   - For each such neighbor `p`, find one neighboring seed cell `q` of the same color:\n     - Prefer a 4-neighbor (up, down, left, right) if any, otherwise take a diagonal neighbor.\n   - Define direction vector `v = p - q` (row and column differences).\n\n3. **Cast a ray**:\n   - Starting from `p`, repeatedly add `v` to the position.\n   - At each step, if the cell is `8`, recolor it to the seed color.\n   - Stop when you leave the grid or meet a non-`8` cell.\n   - Do not recolor `3`s or other colored cells; they act as blockers.\n\n4. **Color priority / collisions**:\n   - I process colors in the order `2`, then `4`, then `6`, then `7`, then `9`.\n   - Rays never overwrite non-`8` cells; if a ray would hit a cell already colored (including by a previous ray), it stops just before that.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\n### Rays from each interior cluster\n\n#### Color 2 cluster at (5\u20136,4\u20135)\n\nSeeds: (5,4),(5,5),(6,4),(6,5).\n\n`8`-neighbors of seeds (unique):\n\n- (4,4) above seeds 5,4 and 5,5:\n  - Closest seed in 4-neighborhood: (5,4)  \n    Vector `v = (4,4)-(5,4) = (-1,0)` \u2192 straight up.\n  - Ray: (4,4) \u2192 (3,4) \u2192 (2,4) \u2192 (1,4) \u2192 (0,4).\n\n- (5,3) left of 5,4 and 6,4:\n  - `q = (5,4)`, `v = (5,3)-(5,4) = (0,-1)` \u2192 left.\n  - Ray: (5,3) \u2192 (5,2) \u2192 (5,1) \u2192 (5,0).\n\n- (7,6) down-right of 6,5:\n  - No 4-neighbor seeds; diagonal neighbor `q = (6,5)`.\n  - `v = (7,6)-(6,5) = (1,1)` \u2192 down-right.\n  - Ray: (7,6) \u2192 (8,7) \u2192 (9,8) \u2192 (10,9) \u2192 (11,10) \u2192 (12,11) \u2192 (13,12) \u2192 (14,13) \u2192 (15,14) \u2192 (16,15) \u2192 (17,16) \u2192 (18,17) \u2192 (19,18) \u2192 (20,19) \u2192 (21,20) then stops at a `3` beyond.\n\nThese recolor only `8` cells to `2`.

Background color is `8`. Color `3` forms \u201cwalls\u201d/frames.  \n   Other colors (2,4,6,7,9,1,\u2026) appear only in small 2\u00d72 blocks inside regions bounded by 3\u2019s.\n\n2. For each such non\u20113, non\u20118 2\u00d72 block (call its color `c`):\n   - Find all **gate cells**: cells with value `8` that are 8\u2011neighbours (including diagonals) of:\n     - at least one `c` cell, and  \n     - at least one `3` cell.\n   - For each gate cell `G`, choose one neighbouring `c` cell `I`:\n     - Prefer a 4\u2011neighbour (up/down/left/right).  \n     - If none, use a diagonal neighbour.\n   - Compute direction vector `D = G \u2212 I`. This is one of the 8 unit directions.\n   - Starting from `I`, walk along the ray `I, I+D, I+2D, \u2026`:\n     - For each step, if the cell is `8`, recolor it to `c` and continue.\n     - As soon as you reach a cell that is not `8`, stop the ray (do not overwrite non\u20118).\n   - This draws straight \u201cwires\u201d of color `c` going out of the framed block through each gate.\n\n3. Apply this independently to all such 2\u00d72 color blocks (2,4,6,7,9, etc.).  \n   Rays from different blocks may approach each other, but since we never overwrite non\u20118, whichever ray arrives first at a cell keeps it, and later rays stop before that cell.\n\nThis matches Examples 2 and 4 exactly, and the more complex Examples 1 and 3 are compositions of several such framed blocks and their rays.\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\nThere are five framed 2\u00d72 blocks:\n\n- Color **2** at rows 5\u20136, cols 4\u20135.\n- Color **4** at rows 5\u20136, cols 15\u201316.\n- Color

\u2192 ray left along row 5.\n- Gate (7,6) next to interior (6,5): `D = (1,1)` \u2192 ray diagonally down\u2011right from (6,5) until it hits a non\u20118 (a 3 at (22,21)).\n\nAll those 8\u2019s along the ray become 2\u2019s.\n\n#### Color 4 block (r5\u20136, c15\u201316)\n\nGates:\n\n- (4,14) next to (5,15): `D = (-1,-1)` \u2192 diagonal up\u2011left.\n- (5,17) next to (5,16): `D = (0,1)` \u2192

(r14\u201315, c23\u201324)\n\nGates:\n\n- (13,23) next to (14,23): `D = (-1,0)` \u2192 vertical up column 23, stopping just before a 4 at (5,23).\n- (13,25) next to (14,24): `D = (-1,1)` \u2192 diagonal up\u2011right.\n- (16,25) next to (15,24): `D = (1,1)` \u2192 diagonal down\u2011right.\n\nThose 8\u2019s become 6\u2019s.\n\n#### Color 7 block (r21\u201322, c22\u201323)\n\nGates (with walls of 3 around):\n\n- (21,24) next to (21,23): `D = (0,1)` \u2192 horizontal ray to the right along row 21.\n- (23,24) next to (22,23): `D = (1,1)` \u2192 diagonal down\u2011right.\n\nThese recolor 8\u2019s to 7\u2019s until they hit other non\u20118 cells.\n\n#### Color 9 block (r25\u201326, c1\u20132)\n\nGates:\n\n- (24,2) next to (25,2): `D = (-1,0)` \u2192 vertical up column 2, stopping one

model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_4_step_3\">\nLooking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. Each example contains colored 2x2 blocks surrounded by a border of 3s\n2. The 3-borders have \"gaps\" (positions where 3 should be but is 8 instead)\n3. From each gap, a line extends outward in the color of the inner block:\n   - **Edge gaps** (non-corner): produce straight lines perpendicular to that edge\n   - **Corner gaps**: produce diagonal lines (only when 2+ corners are gaps)\n4. The gap position itself gets filled with the block's color\n\nAnalyzing the test input blocks:\n- **Block 1 (2s)** at rows 5-6, cols 4-5: gaps at (4,4) top edge\u2192up, (5,3) left edge\u2192left, (7,6) corner\u2192diagonal\n- **Block 2 (4s)** at rows 5-6, cols 15-16: gaps at (4,14) corner\u2192diagonal, (5,17) right edge\u2192right, (7,15) bottom edge\u2192down\n- **Block 3 (6s)** at rows 14-15, cols 23-24: gaps at (13,23) top edge\u2192up, (13,25) & (16,25) corners\u2192diagonals\n- **Block 4 (7s)** at rows 20-21, cols 22-23: gap at (20,24) right edge\u2192right, (22,24) corner (only 1, no diagonal)\n- **Block 5 (9s)** at rows 25-26, cols 1-2: gap at (24,2) top edge\u2192up, (27,3) corner (only 1, no diagonal)\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 11>\n<CANDIDATE 12>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n889828888848888888888888889888\n889828888884888888888888898888\n889828888888488888888888988888\n889228888888848888888889888888\n889323388888884333888896888888\n889222388888883444444986888888\n889322388888883443889886888888\n889333288888883433898886888888\n889888828888888488988886888888\n889888882888888489888886888886\n889888888288888498888886888868\n889888888828888988888886888688\n889888888882889888888886886888\n889888888888298888888836368888\n889888888888928888888836638888\n889888888889882888888836638888\n889888888898888288888833368888\n889888888988888828888888886888\n889888889888888882888888888688\n839338898888888888288333388868\n889888988888888888828377777777\n889889888888888888882377388888\n889898888888888888888233788888\n889988888888888888888828878888\n339388888888888888888882887888\n399388888888888888888888288788\n399388888888888888888888828878\n333988888888888888888888882827\n888898888888888888888888888288\n888889888888888888888888888828\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_3_step_3\">\nThe transformation in the solved examples takes the coloured 2\u00d72 blocks contained within patterns of 3s and lets their colour leak out through any adjacent background openings.

Applying this in reverse scan order to the test grid gives the following result:\n\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,9,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,9,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,9,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,3,9,3,3,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,2,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 12>\n<CANDIDATE 13>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n288828888848888888888888888888\n828828888884888888888888888888\n282828888888488888888888888888\n828228888888848888888888888888\n882323388888884333888888888888\n222222388888883444444444444444\n888322388888883443888888888888\n888333288888883433888886888888\n888888828888884488688868888888\n888888882888848488868886888886\n888888888288488488886868888688\n888888888824888488888668888688\n888888888842888488888668886888\n888888888488288488888836368888\n888888884888828488888836638888\n888888848898882888888836638888\n888888488988888288888833368888\n888884889888888828888888886888\n888848898888888882888833338688\n888488988888888888288837777868\n884889888888888888828837738886\n848898888888888888882833378888\n489988888888888888888288887888\n339388888888888888888828888788\n399388888888888888888882888878\n399388888888888888888888288887\n333988888888888888888888828888\n888898888888888888888888882888\n888889888888888888888888888288\n888888988888888888888888888828\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_4_step_3\">\nThe transformation works by treating the 3\u2011coloured cells as walls and allowing the \u201cinner\u201d colours to leak out through any openings. From each non\u20113, non\u20118 cell you cast rays through adjacent background cells: straight rays through cardinal openings, and diagonal rays through corner openings (where both orthogonal neighbours are non\u2011background). A ray extends step by step through background cells, but it stops before an obstacle, leaving a gap of one cell between different colours. Obstacles are existing non\u2011background cells already present in the grid.\n\nApplying this to the test grid produces the following output:\n\n```\n2,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,8,2,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,2,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,8,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,9,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,6,8,8\n8,8,8,4,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7,8,6,8\n8,8,4,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,6\n8,4,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8\n4,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,7\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 13>\n<CANDIDATE 14>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n888889888888888848888886888888\n888889888888888848888886888888\n888889888888888848888886888888\n888889888888888848888886888888\n888889888888888848888886888888\n888333388888883333888886888888\n888322322222222443888886888888\n888322388888883443888886888888\n888333388888883834888886888888\n888889888888888888488886888868\n888889888888888888848886888688\n888889888888888888884886886888\n888889888888888888888486868888\n888889888888888888888846688888\n888889888888888888888834668888\n888889888888888888888836648888\n888889888888888888888836634888\n888889888888888888888688888488\n888889888888888888886888888848\n888889888888888888868333388884\n888889888888888888688377888888\n777779777777777777888377388888\n888889888888888868888333888888\n888889888888888688888888888888\n888889888888886888888888888888\n338389888888868888888888888888\n399389888888688888888888888888\n399389888886888888888888888888\n333889888868888888888888888888\n888889888688888888888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_11_step_5_gemini_gen_sol\">\n**Alright, let's break down this ARC problem. As an expert in this field, I'm thinking about how to dissect this. Here's my thought process:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Layout**: We've got a grid, mostly teal, with some interesting shapes inside. These shapes are the 'objects' we need to figure out how to manipulate.\n\n2.  **Define the Objects**:\n    *   **Background:** Always teal (8).\n    *   **Sources**: The key objects are 4x4 squares. The color inside the square will dictate the transformation. There is a border of color 3 (green) and the core color.\n    *   **Examples:** We've been given some examples with specific source colors: maroon, blue, yellow, and magenta.\n\n3.  **Find the Transformation Rule**: It looks like the core color 'projects' lines outwards. The given description sounds good, but let's check it against the data.\n\n4.  **Verify/Refine Rule**:\n\n    *   **Red (2):** The description says it shoots horizontal lines.\n        *   After carefully looking at Example 3 (Red), I can confirm that it works. The top core row shoots right, and the bottom row shoots left.\n    *   **Yellow (4):** The description is vague. It says vertical up, horizontal inwards, and diagonal down-outwards.\n        *   I've gone deep here. I've re-examined Example 2 and 3 and the logic of where the lines start.\n        *   My revised hypothesis is this:\n            *   Horizontal \"Inwards\" line: From either Top OR Bottom (depending where the square is) but towards the center.\n            *   Vertical: Right core column always (relative).\n            *   Diagonal: Down-Right.\n    *   **Magenta (6):** The description is correct.\n        *   Looks like diagonal `/` through the core and vertical lines up from the left core.\n    *   **Orange (7):** Horizontal left from the top core is all.\n    *   **Maroon (9):** Diagonals \"Outwards\" and vertical full-height line \"Inwards.\"\n    *   **Blue (1):** \"Bent ray\". This also looks good.\n\n5.  **Refine Rules and Interactions**: It all comes down to interactions:\n    *   **Red vs Yellow:** The issue is when these lines collide. After really thinking, my final guess is that red overwrites yellow, based on Ex 3.\n    *   We also need to know the rule about: Does a line end when it hits an obstacle?\n\n6.  **Apply and Construct the Test Input**: Okay, let's now make the solution for the specific example given.\n\n7.  **Draw Squares** (Borders 3, Cores). Keep them.\n\n8.  **Apply Transformations**:\n\n    *   Maroon (Bottom-Left): Vertical Line.\n    *   Red (Top-Left): Shoot 2s horizontally.\n    *   Yellow (Top-Right):\n        *   Horizontal: Shoot 4s (but Red overwrites).\n        *   Vertical, Diagonal.\n    *   Magenta (Middle-Right): Vertical, Diagonal.\n    *   Orange (Bottom-Right): Shoot 7s horizontally.\n9. **Address the Conflicts:**\n\n    *   Red over Yellow.\n    *   Yellow diagonal, where does it end.\n    *   Yellow vertical.\n\n10. **Write the code output for the pattern**:\n\nThis will need to be made into actual code to solve the challenge. But it gets me the right pattern.\n\nI understand all the rules and will get the right output pattern.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the examples and the provided description, here is the solution:\n\n**1. Object Identification:**\nThe input contains several 4x4 squares, each with a specific \"core\" color surrounded by a border of color 3 (green).\n*   **Maroon (9) Square:** Rows 25-28, Cols 0-3. (Bottom-Left)\n*   **Red (2) Square:** Rows 5-8, Cols 4-7. (Top-Left)\n*   **Yellow (4) Square:** Rows 5-8, Cols 14-17. (Top-Middle/Right)\n*   **Magenta (6) Square:** Rows 14-17, Cols 22-25. (Middle-Right)\n*   **Orange (7) Square:** Rows 20-23, Cols 21-24. (Bottom-Right)\n\n**2. Transformation Rules Application:**\nThe transformations involve projecting lines from these squares onto the background (color 8). Source squares occlude projected lines (lines do not overwrite cores, but may overwrite borders if emitting from there).\n\n*   **Maroon (9):** Projects a full-height vertical line on the \"inward\" side, with a gap of 1 or 2 pixels. Based on Example 1 (Square cols 3-6, Line col 8), the line is at `Right_Border + 2`.\n    *   Square Cols 0-3 -> Line at Col 5.\n    *   **Interaction:** The line passes through the Red Square (Cols 4-7). The Red Square is a source, so it blocks the line. The line appears in rows 0-4 and 9-29.\n\n*   **Red (2):**\n    *   **Top Core Row (Row 6):** Horizontal line to the **Right**.\n        *   Path: Cols 8-29.\n        *   **Interaction:** Hits the Yellow Square (Cols 14-17). The line overwrites the border at Col 14 but is blocked by the core at Cols 15-16. It does not continue past the solid object.\n    *   **Bottom Core Row (Row 7):** Horizontal line to the **Left**.\n        *   Path: Cols 0-3.\n        *   **Interaction:** Hits the Maroon Square (Cols 0-3). Blocked by the source. (No visible line).\n\n*   **Yellow (4):**\n    *   **Horizontal:** Inwards. For a Right-side square (or right of center), this is Left.\n        *   Top Core Row (Row 6).\n        *   **Interaction:** Conflicts with Red's line. Based on Example 3 where Red (2) appeared to overwrite Yellow (4), we prioritize the Red line filling the space between the squares.\n    *   **Vertical:** Upwards. Based on pattern, likely from the **Right Core Column** (Col 16).\n        *   Path: Rows 0-5.\n    *   **Diagonal:** Down-Outwards. For a top-right square, this is **Down-Right**.\n        *   Starts near bottom-right corner. Let's map from Ex 2/3. Ex 2 (Left) was Down-Left. Ex 3 (Right, Bottom) was Up-Right. The pattern is \"Outwards vertically and horizontally\". Since this is at the Top, it goes Down. Since Right, it goes Right.\n        *   Path: Starts (8,17). Goes `\\` (9,18), (10,19)...\n        *   **Interaction:** Hits Magenta Square (Cols 22-25, Rows 14-17) at (14,23). (14,23) is a border, becomes 4. (15,24) is core, remains 6. (16,25) is border, becomes 4.\n\n*   **Magenta (6):**\n    *   **Vertical:** Up from **Left Core Column** (Col 23).\n        *   Path: Rows 0-14.\n    *   **Diagonal:** `/` (Positive slope) through the core.\n        *   Center approx (15.5, 23.5).\n        *   Up-Right: (14,24), (13,25)...\n        *   Down-Left: (17,21), (18,20), (19,19)...\n\n*   **Orange (7):**\n    *   **Horizontal:** Left from **Top Core Row** (Row 21).\n        *   Path: Cols 0-20.\n        *   **Interaction:** Crosses Maroon Line (Col 5). Vertical lines typically occlude horizontal/diagonal lines (based on Ex 1 Blue vs Maroon). So (21,5) remains 9.\n        *   **Interaction:** Crosses Magenta Diagonal at (21,17). Horizontal (later) likely overwrites Diagonal. So (21,17) becomes 7.\n\n**3.

In the test grid these 2\u00d72 cores are:\n\n   - Red (2): rows 6\u20137, cols 5\u20136  \n   - Yellow (4): rows 6\u20137, cols 16\u201317  \n   - Magenta (6): rows 15\u201316, cols 24\u201325  \n   - Orange (7): rows 21\u201322, cols 23\u201324  \n   - Maroon (9): rows 26\u201327, cols 2\u20133  \n\n   Background is 8; 3 is used as border/structure and is not modified.\n\n2. **General projection conventions I used**\n\n   - Rays are cast only into the **background**: a cell is recolored only if its original value is 8.\n   - I treat rays from different emitters as if they are computed independently on the **original** grid. If several rays want to color the same 8\u2011cell, I conceptually could break ties (e.g. by color priority), but in this test configuration there is only one conflict (between colors 2 and 6) which I resolve explicitly below.\n   - Rays do **not overwrite non\u20118** cells and do **not pass through them**: when stepping along a ray, if the next cell is non\u20118 in the original grid, I stop the ray before that cell (I may \u201cskip\u201d over 3\u2011border cells in some patterns only where stated, but I never recolor them).\n\n3. **Concrete ray patterns per color (as I applied them here)**\n\n   I used the textual description as the template, simplified slightly where examples allowed ambiguity:\n\n   **(a) Red (2): horizontal from top and bottom**\n\n   Emitter: top-left `(r,c) = (6,5)` (so core at rows 6\u20137, cols 5\u20136).\n\n   - **Top row (row 6) \u2013 rightward ray:**\n\n     From the top\u2011right core cell (6,6), go right across row 6, *ignoring* any non\u20118 cells but only recoloring 8\u2019s:\n\n     - Original row 6 has a 3 at col 7, then 8\u2019s from cols 8\u201330.\n     - So new 2\u2019s at: row 6, cols 8\u201330.\n\n   - **Bottom row (row 7) \u2013 leftward ray:**\n\n     From the bottom\u2011left core cell (7,5), go left across row 7, similarly recoloring only 8\u2019s:\n\n     - At col 4 there is a 3 (border), so I skip it and continue.\n     - Cols 3,2,1 are 8\u2019s and become 2.\n\n     New 2\u2019s at: row 7, cols 1\u20133.\n\n   (No diagonal ray for 2 in this test; I restrict 2 to the horizontal pattern.)\n\n   **(b) Yellow (4): vertical up + horizontal inwards + diagonal down\u2011outwards**\n\n   Emitter: core at rows 6\u20137, cols 16\u201317 (top-left `(r,c) = (6,16)`).\n\n   The textual pattern says: vertical up, horizontal inwards and a diagonal down\u2011outwards. In the test grid the 4\u2011core is tightly enclosed by 3\u2019s on its \u201cinward\u201d side so every potential ray is immediately blocked by non\u20118 cells:\n\n   - Vertical from top\u2011right (6,17) upwards hits a 3 at (5,17) right away \u2192 **no vertical 4s**.\n   - Horizontal inwards (towards the center of the grid) from row 7 meets a 3 at (7,15) on the first step \u2192 **no horizontal 4s**.\n   - Diagonal down\u2011outwards from (6,17) first steps into (7,18) which is 3 \u2192 **no diagonal 4s**.\n\n   So in this test, the yellow emitter produces **no additional 4s beyond the 2\u00d72 core**.\n\n   **(c) Magenta (6): vertical up from left border + \u201c/\u201d diagonal through core**\n\n   Emitter: core at rows 15\u201316, cols 24\u201325 (top-left `(r,c) = (15,24)`).\n\n   - **Vertical up from the left border:**\n\n     From the top\u2011left core cell (15,24) step upwards in column 24, recoloring 8\u2019s until the top:\n\n     Original column 24 rows 1\u201314 are all 8.\n\n     \u2192 New 6\u2019s at: (1\u201314, 24).\n\n   - **Positive\u2011slope (`/`) diagonal through the core:**\n\n     Implemented as:\n     - from the top\u2011right core cell (15,25) step up\u2011right (\u22121,+1) until boundary or blocked,\n     - from the bottom\u2011left core cell (16,24) step down\u2011left (+1,\u22121).\n\n     Up\u2011right from (15,25): all intermediate cells are 8 until the edge:\n     - (14,26), (13,27), (12,28), (11,29), (10,30) \u2192 all become 6.\n\n     Down\u2011left from (16,24): the first cell (17,23) is a 3 (part of the 3\u2011structure) so that branch is blocked, producing no new 6\u2019s there.\n\n   So 6 introduces:\n   - Column\u201124 vertical 6\u2019s at rows 1\u201314;\n   - Diagonal 6\u2019s at (14,26), (13,27), (12,28), (11,29), (10,30).\n\n   Note that at (6,24) this vertical 6 ray collides with the red 2\u2019s horizontal ray; since both would recolor an 8, I choose the higher \u201cintensity\u201d 6 to win there.\n\n   **(d) Orange (7): horizontal left**\n\n   Emitter: core at rows 21\u201322, cols 23\u201324 (top-left `(r,c) = (21,23)`).\n\n   The rule is: from the top row of the 7\u2011core cast a horizontal line to the left, stopping at non\u20118.\n\n   - From (21,23) leftwards:\n     - (21,22) is 3 (border) immediately, so the ray is blocked.\n\n   Thus no new 7\u2019s beyond the 2\u00d72 core in this test.\n\n   **(e) Maroon (9): diagonals + inward vertical**\n\n   Emitter: core at rows 26\u201327, cols 2\u20133 (top-left `(r,c) = (26,2)`).\n\n   I treated it as:\n\n   - **Vertical line on the inward side:**\n\n     The grid is 30\u00d730, center column is 15.5; the emitter\u2019s center column is 2.5, so \u201cinward\u201d is to the right.\n\n     I approximate \u201cadjacent inward\u201d as the column just to the right of the whole 4\u00d74 composite square. The 4\u00d74 span is cols 1\u20134, so the inward\u2011adjacent column is col 5. I draw a full\u2011height vertical 9 line there, recoloring every original 8 in column 5:\n\n     - Column 5 has non\u20118 (2 or 3) at rows 6,7,8; all other rows have 8.\n     - So new 9\u2019s at column 5 for rows: 1\u20135 and 9\u201330.\n\n   - **Outward diagonals from the outer corners of the 4\u00d74:**\n\n     Bounding 4\u00d74 rows = 25\u201328, cols = 1\u20134; corners:\n\n     - TL = (25,1): already 3 \u2192 no change.\n     - TR = (25,4): stepping up\u2011right immediately hits a 3 at (25,4) or is blocked by that same corner being non\u20118 \u2192 no new 9\u2019s.\n     - BL = (28,1): 3 \u2192 no change.\n     - BR = (28,4): 8, and we step down\u2011right:\n\n       - (28,4) (corner itself) 8\u21929  \n       - (29,5) 8\u21929  \n       - (30,6) 8\u21929  \n\n       Next step is out of bounds.\n\n     So diagonals add 9\u2019s at (28,4), (29,5) and (30,6); (29,5) happens also to lie on the vertical 9 line, but it\u2019s the same color anyway.\n\n4. **Apply all modifications and resolve the one overlap**\n\n   Starting from the original grid, I apply:\n\n   - All the red 2 projections (row 6 col 8\u201330, row 7 col 1\u20133);\n   - All magenta 6 projections (column 24 rows 1\u201314, plus the diagonal cells);\n   - All maroon 9 projections (column 5 except at rows 6\u20138, and the three diagonal cells);\n   - Yellow 4 and orange 7 emitters add no extra cells in this test because they\u2019re fully blocked by 3\u2019s in every projected direction.\n\n   The only shared target is (6,24), where both 2 and 6 want to recolor an 8;

The user wants me to solve an ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) task. I'll break this down methodically. First, I need to understand the rules. From the examples and the description, it's clear there are structures, most likely 4x4 squares, with a border (green, color 3) and a center (fill color). Crucially, there are \"gaps\" in these borders, where the background color (teal, color 8) is visible. The transformation involves filling those gaps with a line of the center color, extending in a specific direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonal) until the grid edge. That seems straightforward enough.\n\nNow, I'll use the first example to solidify my understanding. I'm focusing on the top-right frame (yellow center, orange border). I noticed some inconsistencies with the example grid. But after meticulously counting and re-reading, it becomes clear. The gap locations are key; they determine the direction of the extending lines. This confirms that corner gaps lead to diagonal lines, and edge gaps result in straight ones. Example 1 is about to be very helpful for the test cases.\n\nThe next step is to strategize for the test input. It's a 30x30 grid, so I need an efficient approach. I'll read the grid and identify the 4x4 structures by finding the fill color that is inside the frames. Border cells are identified around the fill color's 2x2 area. I will process each frame, pinpointing the gaps in the border and determining the line directions for each. Then, it is just a matter of executing that logic.\n\nI'm now diving into the actual test input. I'm carefully scanning the grid and identifying each 4x4 frame. Each fill color is now known, along with the gap locations in the border. I now have identified the five frames in the test input. With all the coordinates identified, I'm now ready to start drawing the lines.\n\nAs I'm drawing the lines, I need to be careful. I have to make sure I'm writing the correct fill color and extending in the correct directions. The input background should stay the same. I then need to handle line intersections. I need to handle any collisions or overlaps. I need to make sure one \"wins\". I will analyze example grids to determine precedence. The direction or scan order needs to be verified. The later line should overwrite.\n\nI've carefully analyzed each intersection. The priority logic has been identified. It's time to construct the output grid based on all my previous analyses and reasoning. I'm proceeding systematically. The key is in those precise coordinates. I will follow each of the steps to ensure that the output is flawless. I need to make sure the process is correct. I have to handle line-frame collisions. I need to keep those borders intact.\n\nAll of my calculations are in place now. I can now verify the output one final time to be ready.\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to apply the transformation rules inferred from the examples to the test input.\n\n### Analysis of the Task\nThe task involves identifying \"framed structures\" and their associated \"gaps\" to project lines across the grid.\n\n1.  **Objects:**\n    *   **Background:** Color 8.\n    *   **Frames:** Approximately 4x4 structures with a border of color 3. Inside is a 2x2 region of a unique \"fill color\" (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9).\n    *   **Gaps:** The green (3) border is not continuous; there are specific positions where the border is missing (showing background 8).\n\n2.  **Transformation Rules:**\n    *   **Edge Gaps:** If a gap is on the top, bottom, left, or right edge of the frame, fill the gap with the interior color and extend a line perpendicularly (Up, Down, Left, Right) to the grid boundary.\n    *   **Corner Gaps:** If a gap is on a corner of the frame, fill the gap with the interior color and extend a line diagonally (Up-Left, Up-Right, Down-Left, Down-Right) to the grid boundary.\n    *   **Order/Priority:** Original frames are preserved. Where lines intersect, the logic implies a layering order (likely top-to-bottom or frame ID order), but generally, later/lower frames overwrite earlier/higher ones if lines collide.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution on Test Input\n\n**1. Identify Frames:**\nWe scan the grid for 2x2 regions of colors other than 3 and 8.\n\n*   **Frame 1 (Color 2):** Center at rows 5-6, cols 4-5.\n    *   Bounds: Rows 4-7, Cols 3-6.\n    *   **Gaps:**\n        *   Top Edge at (4, 4). Action: Line **UP**.\n        *   Left Edge at (5, 3). Action: Line **LEFT**.\n        *   Bottom-Right Corner at (7, 6). Action: Line **DOWN-RIGHT**.\n\n*   **Frame 2 (Color 4):** Center at rows 5-6, cols 15-16.\n    *   Bounds: Rows 4-7, Cols 14-17.\n    *   **Gaps:**\n        *   Top-Left Corner at (4, 14). Action: Line **UP-LEFT**.\n        *   Bottom Edge at (7, 15). Action: Line **DOWN**.\n        *   Right Edge at (5, 17). Action: Line **RIGHT**.\n\n*   **Frame 3 (Color 6):** Center at rows 14-15, cols 23-24.\n    *   Bounds: Rows 13-16, Cols 22-25.\n    *   **Gaps:**\n        *   Top Edge at (13, 23). Action: Line **UP**.\n        *   Top-Right Corner at (13, 25). Action: Line **UP-RIGHT**.\n        *   Bottom-Right Corner at (16, 25). Action: Line **DOWN-RIGHT**.\n\n*   **Frame 4 (Color 7):** Center at rows 20-21, cols 22-23.\n    *   Bounds: Rows 19-22, Cols 21-24.\n    *   **Gaps:**\n        *   Right Edge at (20, 24). Action: Line **RIGHT**.\n        *   Bottom-Right Corner at (22, 24). Action: Line **DOWN-RIGHT**.\n\n*   **Frame 5 (Color 9):** Center at rows 25-26, cols 1-2.\n    *   Bounds: Rows 24-27, Cols 0-3.\n    *   **Gaps:**\n        *   Top Edge at (24, 2). Action: Line **UP**.\n        *   Bottom-Right Corner at (27, 3). Action: Line **DOWN-RIGHT**.\n\n**2. Draw Lines & Handle Collisions:**\nWe draw the lines on the grid. Frames (color 3 borders and interior colors) are preserved. Lines overwrite the background (8) and each other based on frame order (reading order: Frame 1 to 5).\n\n*   **Line Collisions:**\n    *   (5, 2): Frame 1 (Left) vs Frame 5 (Up). Frame 5 is processed later. **Value: 9**.\n    *   (5, 23): Frame 2 (Right) vs Frame 3 (Up). Frame 3 is processed later. **Value: 6**.\n    *   (16, 15): Frame 1 (Diagonal DR) vs Frame 2 (Down). Frame 2 is processed later (or covers vertical over diagonal). **Value: 4**.\n    *   (20, 29): Frame 3 (Diagonal DR) vs Frame 4 (Right). Frame 4 is processed later. **Value: 7**.\n\n*   **Frame Collisions:**\n    *   (22, 21): Frame 1 (Diagonal DR) hits the border of Frame 4. Frame preservation rule applies. **Value: 3** (remains border).\n\n**3.

The transformation:\n\n1. For each 2\u00d72 solid block of the same non\u20113, non\u20118 color \\(c\\), treat it as the interior of a 4\u00d74 frame: one cell of 3s (or intended 3s) in every direction around it (top, bottom, left, right, and the four corners).\n2. Wherever a frame cell in that 4\u00d74 ring is missing (i.e. it is background 8 instead of 3), this is a \u201cgap\u201d.\n3. For each gap:\n   - Recolor the gap cell to the interior color \\(c\\).\n   - Extend a straight line of color \\(c\\) from the gap, going *away* from the interior:\n     - Top edge gap \u2192 line goes straight up.\n     - Bottom edge gap \u2192 line goes straight down.\n     - Left edge gap \u2192 line goes left.\n     - Right edge gap \u2192 line goes right.\n     - Corner gaps:\n       - Top\u2011left \u2192 up\u2011left diagonal.\n       - Top\u2011right \u2192 up\u2011right diagonal.\n       - Bottom\u2011left \u2192 down\u2011left diagonal.\n       - Bottom\u2011right \u2192 down\u2011right diagonal.\n   - While extending, recolor only background 8s; stop when you hit any non\u20118 or the grid boundary.\n4. Repeat for all such framed 2\u00d72 interiors. Original non\u20118 cells (3s, interiors, or previously drawn lines) are never overwritten.\n\nIn the test grid there are five such interiors:\n- Color 2 at rows 5\u20136, cols 4\u20135.\n- Color 4 at rows 5\u20136, cols 15\u201316.\n- Color 6 at rows 14\u201315, cols 23\u201324.\n- Color 7 at rows 20\u201321, cols 22\u201323.\n- Color 9 at rows 25\u201326, cols 1\u20132.\n\nApplying the above rules to each of these structures (and letting existing non\u20118 cells block further extension) gives the following output grid.\n\nFinal output grid:\n\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE

some colour (not 8 or 3) surrounded by a border of 3\u2019s, but with some border cells missing (left as 8). For each missing border cell you fill that cell with the interior colour and then draw a straight line of that colour away from the interior: straight up for a gap on the top edge, down for bottom edge, left or right for side gaps, and diagonally for a missing corner. The line continues cell by cell in that direction to the edge of the grid, overwriting background cells as it goes.\n\nIn the test grid there are five such frames:\n\n- Interior 2 at rows\u202f5\u20136, cols\u202f4\u20135 (top gap at 4,4; left gap at 5,3; bottom-right gap at 7,6).\n- Interior 4 at rows\u202f5\u20136, cols\u202f15\u201316 (gaps at 4,14; 5,17; 7,15).\n- Interior 6 at rows\u202f14\u201315, cols\u202f23\u201324 (gaps at 13,23; 13,25; 16,25).\n- Interior 7 at rows\u202f20\u201321, cols\u202f22\u201323 (gaps at 20,24; 22,24).\n- Interior 9 at rows\u202f25\u201326, cols\u202f1\u20132 (gaps at 24,2; 27,3).\n\nApplying the rule to each gap and drawing the lines gives the following output.\n\n**Output grid**\n\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n2,2,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4  \n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8,8  \n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8  \n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7  \n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 21>\n<CANDIDATE 22>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n889828888888888888888868888888\n889828888888888888888868888888\n889828888888888888888868888888\n889828888888888888888868888888\n889828888888888333888868888888\n229222388888883448888868888888\n889322388888883443888868888888\n889333888888883833888868888886\n889888888888888888888868888868\n889888888888888888888868888688\n889888888888888888888868886888\n889888888888888888888868868888\n889888888888888888888868688888\n889888888888888888888868688888\n889888888888888888888836638888\n889888888888888888888836638888\n889888888888888888888833388888\n889888888888888888888888888888\n889888888888888888888888888888\n889888888888888888888333388888\n889888888888888888888377777777\n889888888888888888888377388888\n889888888888888888888333888888\n889888888888888888888888888888\n339388888888888888888888888888\n399388888888888888888888888888\n399388888888888888888888888888\n333888888888888888888888888888\n888888888888888888888888888888\n888888888888888888888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_7_step_5_image\">\n**Analyzing ARC Task and Developing a Solution Strategy**\n\nThe task involves understanding patterns in grids of integers, particularly objects with colored cores and borders, and predicting how they emit \"beams\" of color.  I start by observing that most of the grid is filled with the background color 8, and objects are small, self-contained structures with a core color and a green border.  The border isn't always complete, sometimes with missing corners or sides. The core is usually a 2x2 square.\n\nAfter examining the provided examples, I hypothesize that the direction of the \"beams\" is determined by gaps in the green border surrounding the core. Specifically, I'm thinking about how missing border sections (gaps) might correlate with the path of the beams. The basic pattern seems to be that if there is a gap, there is a beam of the color out of that edge.\n\nI analyze the objects in detail, examining their core and border.  I carefully trace the values in the grid, specifically looking for the presence or absence of green border pixels surrounding each core.  I also look at the outputs from the example to get how the beams will behave.\n\nI see that for Red (2), Magenta (6), Maroon (9), Orange (7) follow a simple rule: a gap in the side of a border will emit a beam in the straight direction, and a gap in a corner of the border will emit a diagonal beam. I get confirmation of that rule with a test input.\n\nThe main challenge arises with Blue (1) and sometimes Yellow (4) where the \"gap\" rule seems to break. Blue's output is consistently orthogonal (straight lines) even when it has the gaps to create diagonals. It looks like with Blue (1) it emits orthogonal beams, no matter what shape. Yellow is more complicated; sometimes it follows the standard rule, but sometimes not, which I think is because of an interaction between the gap and the core. The Yellow exceptions might be specific to each case.\n\nFor the new test, I will implement a step-by-step approach. First, I identify each object's core. Second, for each object, I carefully check the border pixels surrounding the core for gaps. A gap means background pixels where a green pixel should be present. Third, based on the gap configuration, I predict the beam direction, using the standard rule (Side Gaps = Straight, Corner Gaps = Diagonal). Fourth, I draw beams of the corresponding core color from each core. I will resolve conflicts by giving diagonal > vertical > horizontal. This standard model is designed to correctly predict the behavior of the objects in the test case.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation follows a specific logic based on the \"Green (3) Border\" surrounding the core colored objects.\n\n**Rules inferred:**\n1.  **Object Structure:** Objects consist of a 2x2 \"core\" of a specific color (e.g., Red 2, Maroon 9, Magenta 6, etc.) surrounded by a ring of Green (3) pixels.\n2.  **Beams:** The objects emit \"beams\" of their core color into the background (8).\n3.  **Emission Logic (The \"Gap\" Rule):**\n    *   The Green border acts as a container/blocker.\n    *   Where there is a **gap** (an 8 instead of a 3) in the border, a beam escapes.\n    *   **Side Gaps:** If a gap appears on the North, South, East, or West side of the border (directly adjacent to the core faces), the beam shoots **Straight** (Orthogonal) in that direction.\n    *   **Corner Gaps:** If a gap appears at the NE, NW, SE, or SW corner of the border (diagonally adjacent to the core), the beam shoots **Diagonal** in that direction.\n4.  **Exceptions/Nuances:**\n    *   In Example 1, Blue (1) corners produced straight lines, suggesting a rotation for that specific color/case, but the majority of evidence (Maroon, Red, Magenta, Orange, Yellow Ex 2/3) supports the Standard Model described above. The test case contains colors 2, 6, 7, 9, which all follow the Standard Model in the examples.\n    *   **Intersections:** When beams cross, one color overwrites the other. Based on Example 1, vertical beams tend to overwrite horizontal ones, and diagonal beams tend to overwrite orthogonal ones.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Red Object (2)** at Top-Left (Core Rows 5-6, Cols 4-5):\n    *   **Gap at Top Side (Left Pixel):** At `(4,4)` (Row 4, Col 4).\n        *   Action: **Shoot Straight UP**.\n        *   Path: `(4,4)` to `(0,4)`.\n    *   **Gap at Left Side (Top Pixel):** At `(5,3)` (Row 5, Col 3).\n        *   Action: **Shoot Straight LEFT**.\n        *   Path: `(5,3)` to `(5,0)`.\n\n2.  **Magenta Object (6)** at Middle-Right (Core Rows 14-15, Cols 22-23):\n    *   **Gap at Top Side (Left Pixel):** At `(13,22)`.\n        *   Action: **Shoot Straight UP**.\n        *   Path: `(13,22)` to `(0,22)`.\n    *   **Gap at Top-Right Corner:** At `(13,24)`.\n        *   Action: **Shoot Diagonal UP-RIGHT**.\n        *   Path: `(13,24), (12,25), (11,26), (10,27), (9,28), (8,29)`.\n\n3.  **Orange Object (7)** at Bottom-Right (Core Rows 20-21, Cols 22-23):\n    *   **Gap at Right Side (Top Pixel):** At `(20,24)`.\n        *   Action: **Shoot Straight RIGHT**.\n        *   Path: `(20,24)` to `(20,29)`.\n\n4.  **Maroon Object (9)** at Bottom-Left (Core Rows 25-26, Cols 1-2):\n    *   **Gap at Top Side (Right Pixel):** At `(24,2)`.\n        *   Action: **Shoot Straight UP**.\n        *   Path: `(24,2)` to `(0,2)`.\n\n**Intersections:**\n*   The **Red Left Beam** (Row 5) and **Maroon Up Beam** (Col 2) intersect at `(5,2)`.\n*   Following the precedence observed (Vertical usually overwrites Horizontal), the cell `(5,2)` will be **Maroon (9)**.\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\nI will take the input grid and fill in the calculated beam paths with the respective colors, handling the intersection at `(5,2)`.\n\n*   **Red (2) Up:** `(0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)`\n*   **Red (2) Left:** `(5,3), (5,1), (5,0)` (Note: `(5,2)` is Maroon).\n*   **Maroon (9) Up:** `(0,2)` down to `(24,2)` inclusive.

First, I need to understand what's going on with the inputs. It's a grid of numbers 0-9, and the background is always the most frequent number, usually 8. There are these square-ish \"objects\" with a central color and a green border (color 3).\n\nI start by looking at a bunch of examples and try to make some sense out of this. I focus on how the green border interacts with these object cores. It's clear that the direction lines get launched from an object is related to gaps in the green border.\n\nMy initial thought is that if there is a gap, then launch the corresponding line. But that is clearly not correct.\n\nI need to nail down the precise rule. It turns out that I have to think about the individual pixels of each object and check each direction for green pixels. I'm focusing on the pixels that are on the border of the 2x2 core.\n\nIf a cardinal direction (up, down, left, right) is *not* blocked by green, I launch a line in that direction. If a cardinal direction is blocked, but the diagonal is not, I launch a line diagonally. And if everything is blocked, no line.\n\nSo, the rule has two parts. I check the cardinal neighbors first. If both are blocked, I check the diagonal.\n\nSo, for each 2x2 core, I check all four of the \"outer\" pixels. For each pixel, if its outside neighbor is not green (and within bounds), then draw a line in that direction. If it is green, I check the corresponding corner. If the corner is not green, I draw a diagonal line.\n\nNow, let's make sure this works across a bunch of examples and it looks like it works. I test it with the more examples.\n\nNow, I'm ready to write a program to apply it to the problem. I need to get the objects and their green borders.\n\nNow, let's look at this test case the user has given me, it's a 30x30 grid.\n\nI analyze the test input and find all the cores. I have to trace through to make sure I am finding the core. So I do that for each core. Now I will build my line launcher for each object.\n\nI construct each line.\n\nI also have to manage intersections and overlapping. It looks like the most recent object overwrites.\n\nNow, I'm ready to produce the output. I will build an image one line and write it out. Now I can show the user the result.\n\nAfter double checking each row, the output should be right. The output is ready and I'm ready to provide the results to the user.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation follows a consistent set of rules involving \"emitters\" and \"blockers\".\n\n**The Logic:**\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all 2x2 squares of a uniform, non-background color (the \"core\"). These cores are typically surrounded by a border of green (`3`) pixels, but the border might have gaps or be completely missing in some directions.\n2.  **Evaluate Emission for Each Pixel:** For each of the four pixels in a 2x2 core, check its outward-facing neighbors to determine if a line should be drawn.\n    *   **Cardinal Check:** For each pixel, check the two primary cardinal directions pointing away from the center of the 2x2 core.\n        *   *Top-Left Pixel:* Check **Up** and **Left**.\n        *   *Top-Right Pixel:* Check **Up** and **Right**.\n        *   *Bottom-Left Pixel:* Check **Down** and **Left**.\n        *   *Bottom-Right Pixel:* Check **Down** and **Right**.\n        *   **Rule:** If a cardinal neighbor is **not** a green (`3`) pixel (it is usually background `8`), emit a line of the core's color in that direction.\n    *   **Diagonal Check:** If **both** cardinal neighbors for a specific pixel are green (`3`) (blocked), then check the diagonal neighbor in that corner's direction.\n        *   *Top-Left Pixel:* Check **Up-Left**.\n        *   *Top-Right Pixel:* Check **Up-Right**.\n        *   *Bottom-Left Pixel:* Check **Down-Left**.\n        *   *Bottom-Right Pixel:* Check **Down-Right**.\n        *   **Rule:** If the diagonal neighbor is **not** a green (`3`) pixel, emit a diagonal line of the core's color in that direction.\n3.  **Drawing Lines:**\n    *   Lines extend from the neighbor cell until they hit the edge of the grid.\n    *   Lines are drawn on top of the background.\n    *   Where lines intersect, the object that appears later (reading order Top-to-Bottom, Left-to-Right) or has a higher index seems to overwrite the previous one. Based on the logic derived, we will assume standard overwriting.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Red Object (Color 2)** at Rows 5-6, Cols 4-5.\n    *   **Top-Left (5,4):** Up (4,4) is `8` (Open) $\\rightarrow$ Draw **UP**.

Interpreting the examples\n\nFrom the four training pairs (and the sketch) I treated the structures as:\n\n* Background: color `8`.\n* Frames: color `3`, forming \u201ccages\u201d around 2\u00d72 inner blocks.\n* Inner blocks: colors such as `2,4,6,7,9,1` etc.\n\nThe visible behavior in the simpler examples (2 and 4) can be summarised as:\n\n1. For each 2\u00d72 inner block, look at all cells with color `8` that are immediately adjacent (4- or 8-neighbourhood) to at least one inner cell **and** also touch at least one frame cell `3`.  \n   These `8` cells are \u201cports\u201d where a wire of the inner colour can exit the frame.\n\n2. For each port, select a corresponding inner cell and a direction vector from inner cell to port:\n   * If there is a choice (several inner cells touching the same port), prefer a **cardinal** direction (N, S, E, W) over a diagonal one.\n   * Otherwise, take the single available direction.\n\n3. From the chosen inner cell, extend a straight ray in that direction:\n   * Recolour each background cell `8` along that line with the inner colour.\n   * Stop just **before** you would step outside the grid or onto a non\u2011`8` cell (frame, original inner cell of another object, or a wire drawn earlier).\n\n4. Process the islands one by one; already\u2011drawn wires act as obstacles for later ones.\n\nThis rule exactly reproduces the wiring behavior for examples 2 and 4, and gives a consistent interpretation for how rays are anchored in all examples; I then applied it to the test.\n\nFor the test grid there are five inner islands:\n\n* `2` at rows 5\u20136, cols 4\u20135\n* `4` at rows 5\u20136, cols 15\u201316\n* `6` at rows 15\u201316, cols 23\u201324\n* `7` at rows 21\u201322, cols 22\u201323\n* `9` at rows 26\u201327, cols 1\u20132\n\nBelow I describe how I applied the rule island by island.\n\n---\n\n### 2.

Example 4: 2\u00d72 of `6` inside a ring of `3`.\n   - Example 2: 2\u00d72 of `4` inside `3`s.\n   - Example 3: cores of `2`, `4`, `7`.\n   - Example 1: cores of `9`, `1`, `4`, `6`.\n\n2. **Finding exits (gaps) around each object.**  \n   Around each 2\u00d72 core, consider the 4\u00d74 window that contains the core plus a one\u2011cell margin.  \n   Inside that window, cells of value `3` are the frame; cells of value `8` that are adjacent (in 8\u2011neighborhood) to at least one core cell are *gaps* where the frame is missing.\n\n   Example mappings:\n   - Example 4 (core `6`): 4\u00d74 pattern has `8` at positions above the top\u2011left, above the top\u2011right and below\u2011left; giving three gaps and thus three exits (up, up\u2011right, down\u2011left).\n   - Example 2 (core `4`): gaps above top\u2011right, to the right of bottom\u2011right, and below\u2011left of bottom\u2011left; exits go up, right, and down\u2011left.\n\n   Each gap is assigned to the adjacent core cell that touches it; if more than one core cell touches, prefer orthogonal adjacency over diagonal.\n\n3. **Drawing rays from each exit.**  \n   For every gap `g` attached to a core cell `c`:\n   - Let the direction vector `d = (dr, dc)` be `sign(g.r \u2212 c.r), sign(g.c \u2212 c.c)`; each component is in `{-1, 0, 1}`.\n   - Starting from the core cell `c`, step repeatedly by `d`:\n     - color every visited cell with the core color `X` **while** that cell is background `8` or already `X`;\n     - stop when stepping out of the grid or when the next cell is *not* `8`/`X` (i.e. you hit any existing structure).\n\n   Thus each gap produces a straight ray (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) of color `X` going away from the object.  \n   In Example 2 and 4 this exactly reproduces the three arms from the respective cores.  \n   In Example 1 and 3 the same rule applied to the different gap patterns gives the observed crosses and L\u2011shaped collections of straight rays.\n\n4. **Order of processing objects.**  \n   When two objects could send rays through the same background cell, we need an order so later rays see earlier rays as obstacles.  \n   Looking at Example 3, the `4`\u2011object\u2019s vertical ray blocks the `2`\u2011object\u2019s horizontal ray (which stops one cell before it would otherwise intersect), which is consistent if objects with *higher core color* are processed first.\n\n   So:\n   - Sort all objects by their core color in descending numeric order.\n   - Process them in that order, using the *current* grid as the obstacle map.\n\n5. **Apply to the test input.**\n\n   First detect all 2\u00d72 cores with surrounding `3`s:\n\n   - **Object E (color 9)** at rows 26\u201327, cols 1\u20132.\n   - **Object D (color 7)** at rows 20\u201321, cols 22\u201323.\n   - **Object C (color 6)** at rows 14\u201315, cols 23\u201324.\n   - **Object B (color 4)** at rows 5\u20136,  cols 15\u201316.\n   - **Object A (color 2)** at rows 5\u20136,  cols 4\u20135.\n\n   Process them in order: 9, 7, 6, 4, 2.\n\n   For each object we build its 4\u00d74 window, find 8\u2011valued neighbors of the core (gaps), assign each gap to the closest core cell (orth adjacency preferred), compute the direction, and then trace rays, stopping when we encounter any non\u20118 cell created earlier.\n\n   The resulting rays are:\n\n   -

The Task at Hand: Decoding the ARC Mystery**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this ARC task. The goal, as I understand it, is to figure out the underlying logic governing these visual transformations. The user has presented me with several examples, and my initial approach is to systematically analyze them to find patterns.\n\n**2. A Deep Dive into Example 1: The Building Blocks**\n\nExample 1 is where it all starts. There's this large grid, mostly filled with a teal color (8s in the text), and within it, several smaller, structured regions. These small structures are the key. They usually consist of a border and an inner color. The initial thought is that the goal of this transformation is to move the objects and color them. But after closer inspection, it's not so simple.\n\nThe outputs are, at first glance, a bit perplexing. It's like these inner structures have \"projected\" upwards, but not quite vertically. The color transitions are not as expected and something's clearly going on with the border colors. I note that the *inner* colors seem to be the primary driving force in the output. The inner color of these small structures is always the same as the \"projected\" color.\n\n**3. The Diagonal Projection Hypothesis: A Breakthrough**\n\nThen it hits me: *diagonal* beams! The output isn't about vertical or horizontal movement. Instead, it seems like each inner color \"shoots\" a diagonal beam starting at a certain border position. I trace the output and see if this is true. This theory starts to fall into place. It's not the entire structure moving. It's the inner color that's the starting point for diagonal beams.\n\n**4. The Key: Where Do the Beams Originate? The \"Hole\" Theory**\n\nThis \"beam\" idea is promising, but where exactly do these beams originate? Examining the borders of the small shapes, I notice these are not perfect. There are often missing border pixels (denoted as 8s). These \"missing\" pixels, or holes, are the key!\n\nThe Hypothesis: Beams are emitted from specific locations in the border of the inner shape. I've developed a set of rules for the specific beam positions. Corners create diagonals, and the edges create straight lines. Furthermore, they are based on the non-three color in the shape.\n\n**5. Refining the Physics: Beam Interactions**\n\nNow, things get a bit more complex. What happens when two beams collide? Or when a diagonal beam gets blocked? The answer is simple: they *merge*! Two diagonals become a vertical beam! This explains the output of the first example. They create a vertical track.\n\n**6. Testing and Validation: The Other Examples**\n\nI test my new physics model against the other examples provided. The hole theory and direction is holding up pretty nicely with different colored objects. They also create a similar structure, and by tracing their coordinates, I notice that the pattern is consistent.\n\n**7. Building the Rules: A Summary**\n\nThe summary is this: 1. Identify objects. 2. Identify the holes in borders. 3. Emit beams with the color. 4. Simulate. If two beams interact, combine. If a hole exists at a corner, make it diagonal. If at the edge, cardinal. The theory has been validated using the output examples provided.\n\n**8. Testing: The New Puzzle**\n\nThe task includes new data. It's a new 30x30 test grid. The task is to apply these physics and render them to get an output. Based on the previous rules, I have to draw beams from the relevant holes. This will involve working out:\n* Finding the beam origins (locations).\n* Determining beam directions.\n* Calculating beam paths.\n* Considering collisions and deflections.\n\n**9. Implementation Strategy**\n\nTo implement, I am going to:\n1.  **Analyze the test grid.** Identify each small structure (bounding box).\n2.  **Apply my rules to get a list of beams.** Compute the direction of each.\n3.  **Draw the beam paths.**\n4.  **Simulate and resolve collisions.** Where beams meet, calculate deflection.\n5.  **Output the final grid.** Fill the holes with the beam colors.\n\nI feel confident in my ability to generate a solution for the test grid. Let's start the final step!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid by identifying \"objects\" (boxes with a colored border and a different inner color) and projecting \"beams\" from them based on missing pixels in their borders (\"holes\").\n\n**1. Object and Hole Identification:**\nWe scan the grid for 4x4 structures. Each structure has a border color (usually 3) and an inner color. We identify \"holes\" where the border should be but is missing (value 8). The position of the hole determines the direction of the beam.\n*   **Edge Holes** (Top, Bottom, Left, Right) emit **Cardinal Beams** (North, South, West, East).\n*   **Corner Holes** (TL, TR, BL, BR) emit **Diagonal Beams** (NW, NE, SW, SE).\n*   **Beam Color** matches the **Inner Color** of the object.\n\n**2. Objects in Test Input:**\n*   **Object 1 (Red 2)**: Cols 3-6, Rows 4-7.\n    *   Hole (4,4) [Top Edge] $\\rightarrow$ **North** Beam.\n    *   Hole (5,3) [Left Edge] $\\rightarrow$ **West** Beam.\n    *   Hole (7,6) [BR Corner] $\\rightarrow$ **SE** Beam.\n*   **Object 2 (Yellow 4)**: Cols 15-18, Rows 4-7.\n    *   Hole (4,18) [TR Corner] $\\rightarrow$ **NE** Beam.\n    *   Hole (5,18) [Right Edge] $\\rightarrow$ **East** Beam.\n    *   Hole (7,16) [Bottom Edge] $\\rightarrow$ **South** Beam.\n*   **Object 3 (Magenta 6)**: Cols 22-25, Rows 13-16.\n    *   Hole (13,23) [Top Edge] $\\rightarrow$ **North** Beam.\n    *   Hole (13,25) [TR Corner] $\\rightarrow$ **NE** Beam.\n    *   Hole (16,25) [BR Corner] $\\rightarrow$ **SE** Beam.\n*   **Object 4 (Orange 7)**: Cols 21-24, Rows 19-22.\n    *   Hole (20,24) [Right Edge] $\\rightarrow$ **East** Beam.\n    *   Hole (22,24) [BR Corner] $\\rightarrow$ **SE** Beam.\n*   **Object 5 (Maroon 9)**: Cols 0-3, Rows 24-27.\n    *   Hole (24,2) [Top Edge] $\\rightarrow$ **North** Beam.\n    *   Hole (27,3) [BR Corner] $\\rightarrow$ **SE** Beam.\n\n**3. Interactions (Deflections):**\n*   **Red West + Maroon North**: Red West beam (Row 5) meets Maroon North beam (Col 2) at (5,2). They deflect NW.\n    *   Red turns NW starting (4,2).\n    *   Maroon turns NW starting (4,1).\n*   **Yellow East + Magenta North**: Yellow East beam (Row 5) meets Magenta North beam (Col 23) at (5,23). They deflect NE.\n    *   Yellow turns NE starting (4,23).\n    *   Magenta turns NE starting (4,24).\n*   **Red SE + Yellow South**: Red SE beam meets Yellow South beam (Col 16) at (17,16).\n    *   Red turns South to run parallel at (17,15).\n    *   Yellow continues South at (17,16).\n\n**4.

Analyzing the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task, and my job is to figure out the pattern. The core of the issue seems to be understanding how colored shapes in the input grid translate into the output.\n\n**2. The Initial Observations**\n\nI quickly noticed that a dominant teal color (8) acts as the background. Then I saw shapes made of other colors, usually \"boxes\" or \"containers\" outlined in green (3), enclosing a core color.  I analyzed an example with four distinct objects, looking for a pattern.\n\n**3. The Shape Analysis**\n\nI looked closely at the shapes. It seemed like the shape and position, plus the color of those shapes, influenced the output. The green outlines weren't always neat rectangles, and their form seemed to matter. I focused in, trying to map the input's green outline shape with the direction and nature of output beams.\n\n**4. The Beam Hypothesis**\n\nI formed a hypothesis. The shapes of the green outline have a correlation with the direction and nature of the output \"beams\" of color. I suspected that the \"gaps\" or \"holes\" within the green outlines might be where the color \"leaks\" from the core. I kept digging into the inputs. I started to think of them like walls, and the core color as a light source emitting beams. \n\n**5. Refining the Rules**\n\nThe beams are blocked by green pixels. Then, I had a new, much stronger hypothesis: the green outline forms walls, the inner color is a source, and the color will propagate in straight lines. Beams interact!\n\n**6. Beam Interactions**\n\nI considered a rule. Rays travel until they collide. What happens when rays intersect?  I realized that two rays becoming parallel and turn vertical is likely a condition.\n\n**7. Test Input**\n\nMoving to the test input, I found a few shapes were the same, but the shapes were simpler.\nThe same pattern existed. I analyzed the rays and their properties from each shape.\nThe core of the issue was that I needed a better mechanism.\n\n**8. Putting it All Together**\n\nThe rules boiled down to this. The program:\n*   Identifies a *core* of color in the middle.\n*   The green outlines *walls* which create the *holes*.\n*   The rays *propagate* in all directions from the *core*, until it encounters an obstacle.\n*   If an output encounters other output, and if the path will cross, the paths take their respective directions.\n*   I considered many iterations of collision models, but these interactions became consistent with previous observations.\n\n**9. The Execution Plan**\n\nI formulated a plan. I began with the input, and then built a series of steps to apply the rule. With a plan and my model, I should solve this.\n\n\nThe logic for this task involves identifying \"colored cores\" enclosed within \"green walls\" and projecting \"rays\" of the core color outwards through any \"holes\" (gaps) in the walls.\n\n**1. Object Analysis:**\nWe identify five distinct objects in the test input based on the green (3) outlines and their colored interiors:\n*   **Object 1 (Red 2):** Located top-left (Rows 4-7, Cols 3-6). Core is Red (2).\n*   **Object 2 (Yellow 4):** Located top-middle (Rows 4-7, Cols 14-17). Core is Yellow (4).\n*   **Object 3 (Magenta 6):** Located middle-right (Rows 13-16, Cols 22-25). Core is Magenta (6).\n*   **Object 4 (Orange 7):** Located bottom-right (Rows 19-22, Cols 21-24). Core is Orange (7).\n*   **Object 5 (Maroon 9):** Located bottom-left (Rows 24-27, Cols 0-3). Core is Maroon (9).\n\n**2. Hole Identification & Ray Casting:**\nFor each object, we find gaps in the surrounding 8-neighbor boundary (the \"green wall\") relative to the core pixels. Rays are cast from the hole coordinate in the direction of the gap.\n\n*   **Object 1 (Red 2):**\n    *   **Top Hole:** at `(4,4)` (North). Projects a Vertical Ray upwards: `(3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4)`.\n    *   **Left Hole:** at `(5,3)` (West). Projects a Horizontal Ray leftwards: `(5,3)`. (Stops at `(5,2)` due to collision).\n\n*   **Object 2 (Yellow 4):**\n    *   **Top-Left Hole:** at `(4,14)` (North-West). Projects a Diagonal Ray NW: `(4,14), (3,13), (2,12), (1,11), (0,10)`.\n    *   **Right Hole:** at `(5,17)` (East). Projects a Horizontal Ray rightwards: `(5,17)` to `(5,22)`. (Stops at `(5,23)` due to collision).\n    *   **Bottom Hole:** at `(7,15)` (South). Projects a Vertical Ray downwards: `(7,15)` to `(29,15)`.\n\n*   **Object 3 (Magenta 6):**\n    *   **Top Hole:** at `(13,23)` (North). Projects a Vertical Ray upwards: `(13,23)` to `(0,23)`.\n    *   **Top-Right Hole:** at `(13,25)` (North-East). Projects a Diagonal Ray NE: `(13,25), (12,26), (11,27), (10,28), (9,29)`.\n    *   **Bottom-Right Hole:** at `(16,25)` (South-East). Projects a Diagonal Ray SE: `(16,25), (17,26), (18,27), (19,28), (20,29)`.\n\n*   **Object 4 (Orange 7):**\n    *   **Right Hole:** at `(20,24)` (East). Projects a Horizontal Ray rightwards: `(20,24)` to `(20,28)`. (Blocked at `(20,29)`).\n    *   **Bottom-Right Hole:** at `(22,24)` (South-East). Projects a Diagonal Ray SE: `(22,24), (23,25), (24,26), (25,27), (26,28), (27,29)`.\n\n*   **Object 5 (Maroon 9):**\n    *   **Top Hole:** at `(24,2)` (North). Projects a Vertical Ray upwards: `(24,2)` to `(0,2)`.\n\n**3. Interaction Rules:**\n*   **Vertical Dominance:** Vertical rays act as solid pillars. Horizontal and diagonal rays stop when they hit a vertical ray.\n    *   **Red West vs Maroon North:** Red ray at `(5,3)` stops because `(5,2)` is occupied by the Maroon vertical ray.\n    *   **Yellow East vs Magenta North:** Yellow ray at Row 5 stops at Col 22 because `(5,23)` is occupied by the Magenta vertical ray.\n*   **Time-of-Arrival (Diagonal/Horizontal):** If rays collide, the one arriving first (or covering less distance) claims the cell.\n    *   **Magenta SE vs Orange East:** They converge at `(20,29)`. Magenta arrives at step 4, Orange at step 5. Magenta claims the cell. Orange stops at `(20,28)`.\n\n**output:**\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,7,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,7,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6\n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE

My initial thought process involves parsing the task requirements, identifying the input and output formats, and noting that the problem revolves around \"ray emitters\" within the grid. The examples are crucial to understanding the underlying logic.\n\nMy immediate focus is on the given hints, particularly the concept of a \"central colored pixel\" emitting rays, blocked by surrounding green pixels. I'll need to dissect these examples to grasp the specific structures and patterns in these grids. The task's core lies in determining how to interpret a colored blob as a ray emitter. I'll meticulously examine the inputs and outputs of the examples to find how the examples relate. I'm noting that there seems to be a special type of structure, possibly a cluster of pixels with a boundary, that acts as a ray emitter, and I'll carefully analyze the pixel relationships within these structures.\n\nI'm initially considering assuming a simplistic single central pixel that shoots rays, but I'm quickly led to re-evaluate the hints, and it becomes clear that a contiguous colored block likely forms a ray emitter, with an important consideration of the direction. The \"central pixel\" in the hint might be a simplification, so I'm investigating how multiple colored pixels might contribute to a combined ray emission, and I'm carefully analyzing the grid configurations around these colored areas.  I am re-reading the hint on \"not green,\" to see the ray generation is blocked by the wall's color.\n\nI'm considering a hypothesis: a structure of colored pixels surrounded by green pixels that act as walls, where each pixel within the structure examines its neighbors. The goal now is to understand the boundaries of ray emission. I'm testing the 3x3 window around the colored block with several examples to clarify any logical conflicts. This leads me to a hypothesis: Each colored pixel within the colored group checks neighbors outside the group, shooting a ray if there's no green, considering both cardinal and diagonal directions. I'm making several observations about the examples to confirm the hypothesis.\n\nI've tested with several examples, which show good validation of my current understanding, and the core rule has solidified: for a 2x2 block, consider a 3-direction corner, and for a 1x1 block, consider a full 8-direction ray emission.\n\nNow, my focus shifts to the test input. I'll scan the provided grid to find the colored clusters and surrounding wall pixels, carefully noting their positions and sizes. Based on the patterns found in the previous examples, I will be carefully creating the rays to draw. I'm making sure my previous assumptions remain consistent with the new test input.\n\nI am re-examining the hints, and also re-evaluating, by trying to understand how to apply the learned logic to the given test input. I will need to generate the rays for these clusters, keeping in mind the 2x2 and the general rule. The rays are going to be added to the grid.\n\nI've made a final check that the previous assumptions work with the test input and will create my output grid by starting with a copy of the given input grid, and I will place the generated rays in the grid. I'll then generate the final output in the required format. I'm checking to make sure I followed my own logic, which will give the final answer.\n\n\nTo solve this ARC task, we must identify the \"ray emitter\" structures in the grid and determine the rules for ray propagation based on the provided hints and solved examples.\n\n### Reasoning\n\n1.  **Identify Objects (Emitters):**\n    The grids contain distinct multicolor clusters. Analyzing the input data, these clusters are consistently **2x2 blocks of a single color**, surrounded by a \"ring\" of neighbor pixels. The ring consists of Green pixels (3), which act as **walls**, and other pixels (usually Black/8), which act as **openings**.\n\n2.  **Determine Emission Rules:**\n    By observing Example 2 and others, we can deduce a precise rule for how rays are emitted from a 2x2 cluster:\n    *   The 2x2 block has 4 pixels: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), and Bottom-Right (BR).\n    *   Each pixel in the block is responsible for checking the **3 neighbors** in its respective corner direction (Cardinal and Diagonal).\n        *   **TL Pixel:** Checks North, North-West, West.\n        *   **TR Pixel:** Checks North, North-East, East.\n        *   **BL Pixel:** Checks South, South-West, West.\n        *   **BR Pixel:** Checks South, South-East, East.\n    *   **Rule:** If a checked neighbor is **NOT Green (3)** (and not part of the cluster itself), it is considered an \"opening\".

I need to figure out how these abstract grids of numbers, representing colors, relate to each other in the input/output pairs. The initial request is to complete the task based on the provided examples, and provide an explanation of my thinking process, in the first person.\n\nFirst, I need to get a handle on the rules. From the problem description, I'm told this is an ARC task involving grids of numbers 0-9. The input is a grid of numbers, and I have to explain how to get the output. I'm given some hints: Multicolor clusters are like \"ray emitters\". Central colored pixel is the source, and a Green pixel boundary acts as a wall. Rays extend until they hit the grid edge. Overlapping is mentioned, but I'm unsure of the impact of the overlap.\n\nLet's begin by scrutinizing the first example.  I notice that the background is a constant color (8), which I'll call Teal. There seem to be three \"objects\" or clusters of other colors, and they appear to be some blocks surrounded by green (3). I need to determine the center of these objects. I'm told to find the \"central colored pixel\". I need to find the colors in the input, and understand the central structure.\n\nI begin by focusing on the first cluster. I'm examining rows and columns, looking for some pattern. The hint is \"The central colored pixel\". This implies the structure must be a 3x3 block, where the central pixel emits some rays. So, I must interpret the color in the cluster. If the center is composed of a 2x2 of the color 9, it is not just a central pixel.\n\nI see that the cluster 1 is composed of a block 2x2 of color 9 surrounded by the green 3s. There are several clusters of different colors in this example. I need to note the size and position of these blocks, and compare these with the output example. The block could be a 3x3, 4x4, 5x5... and surrounded by the Green (3).\n\nOkay, let's examine Cluster 1 in more detail. This could be 9s (Maroon). Surrounded by 3s (Green). Let's trace it row by row. This is not a classic 3x3 grid, but a 4x4. The \"central pixel\" hint isn't quite right, then. Or maybe it's just a simplification. Maybe I should consider the 2x2 center as a single entity, or that the hint is referring to a specific instance.\n\nI observe the pattern in the example. I focus on how the green 3s surrounding a center influence the output. I think the green 3s form walls around the color centers. Let's look at the hints again. \"The central colored pixel *attempts* to shoot rays in all 8 directions\". The 3s act as a barrier to those rays in certain directions. Maybe the central colored pixels are just \"lamps,\" and the green pixels are the \"walls\" of that lamp. The 2x2 blocks of center color and their surroundings of 3s appear to control ray output.\n\nFor example 1, if Green acts like a wall, it blocks the ray's output in those directions. Let's check with my theory. The ray is emitted only if the immediate neighbor isn't green. I'm going to revisit the data. Okay, cluster 1 seems to consist of a 2x2 blocks of 9 (Maroon), and that block has walls (3s) surrounding them. These boundaries are: Green, at the top, bottom, and left and right sides. I trace the output and confirm that this is true.\n\nI reexamine the structure, thinking I may have missed something. The clusters may not always have 2x2 central blocks. I must adjust my thinking. Let's confirm my hypothesis with additional examples.\n\nWith example 4, the test cluster is a different size. The test cluster has a central pixel that is 6 (Magenta). It is composed of a 2x2 of that color. If the Green walls surround this block, it must be the case that a ray is emitted if the neighborhood isn't Green. Let's examine the data again. I can verify that for each 2x2 blocks, there is a direction which is not bounded by a Green, that the ray is emitted.\n\nLet's refine the ray logic. For every pixel 'P' in an inner color (non-8, non-3), I check 8 neighbors. If a neighbor is 3\n\nThe transformation rule is inferred as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify \"Lamps\":** Locate all 2x2 blocks of uniform color (excluding the background `8` and the wall color `3`). These are the light sources.\n2.  **Identify Openings:** For each 2x2 lamp, examine the 12 cells immediately surrounding it (the 8 neighbors adjacent to the sides and the 4 neighbors at the corners).\n    *   Green pixels (`3`) in these positions act as walls/shutters.\n    *   Any other value (typically background `8`) indicates an opening.\n3.  **Cast Rays:** From each opening, cast a ray of the lamp's color in the corresponding direction. The mapping is:\n    *   **Side Neighbors:**\n        *   Top-Left Neighbor -> Up\n        *   Top-Right Neighbor -> Up\n        *   Bottom-Left Neighbor -> Down\n        *   Bottom-Right Neighbor -> Down\n        *   Left-Top Neighbor -> Left\n        *   Left-Bottom Neighbor -> Left\n        *   Right-Top Neighbor -> Right\n        *   Right-Bottom Neighbor -> Right\n    *   **Corner Neighbors:**\n        *   Top-Left Corner -> Diagonal Up-Left (NW)\n        *   Top-Right Corner -> Diagonal Up-Right (NE)\n        *   Bottom-Left Corner -> Diagonal Down-Left (SW)\n        *   Bottom-Right Corner -> Diagonal Down-Right (SE)\n4.  **Ray Propagation:** Rays travel in a straight line to the edge of the grid.\n5.  **Intersections:** Where rays intersect or overlap, the color of the ray from the cluster that appears later in a standard reading order (or has a higher numeric value) typically persists on top (e.g., Maroon `9` overwrites Yellow `4`).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Red Cluster (2)** [Rows 5-6, Cols 4-5]:\n    *   Openings at Top-Left (Up) and Left-Bottom (Left) and Bottom-Right Corner (SE).\n    *   Rays: Up from col 4; Left from row 5; SE diagonal starting (7,6).\n\n*   **Yellow Cluster (4)** [Rows 5-6, Cols 15-16]:\n    *   Openings at Bottom-Left (Down), Right-Top (Right), Top-Left Corner (NW), Top-Right Corner (NE), Bottom-Left Corner (SW).\n    *   Rays: Down from col 15; Right from row 5; NW diagonal from (4,14); NE diagonal from (4,17); SW diagonal from (7,14).\n\n*   **Magenta Cluster (6)** [Rows 14-15, Cols 23-24]:\n    *   Openings at Top-Left (Up), Top-Right Corner (NE), Bottom-Right Corner (SE).\n    *   Rays: Up from col 23; NE diagonal from (13,25); SE diagonal from (16,25).\n\n*   **Orange Cluster (7)** [Rows 20-21, Cols 23-24]:\n    *   Openings at Right-Top (Right), Top-Right Corner (NE), Bottom-Right Corner (SE).\n    *   Rays: Right from row 20; NE diagonal from (19,25); SE diagonal from (22,25).\n\n*   **Maroon Cluster (9)** [Rows 25-26, Cols 2-3]:\n    *   Openings at Top-Left (Up), Top-Right Corner (NE), Bottom-Right Corner (SE).\n    *   Rays: Up from col 2; NE diagonal from (24,4); SE diagonal from (27,4).\n\n**Notable Intersections:**\n*   (11,10): Yellow SW crosses Red SE. Result `4`.\n*   (13,15): Maroon NE crosses Yellow Down. Result `9`.\n*   (5,23): Maroon NE, Yellow Right, and Magenta Up intersect. Result `9`.\n*   (20,29): Orange Right crosses Magenta SE. Result `7`.\n\noutput:\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,9,8\n2,2,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,8,4,4,4,4,4,9,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,4,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,4,8,27,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,4,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,9,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,7,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,7,3,7,7,8,8,7,8,8,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,7,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,3,3,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 40>\n<CANDIDATE 41>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n889828888848888888888886888888\n889828888884888888888886888888\n889828888888488888888886888888\n889828888888848888888886888888\n889323388888884333888886888888\n222222388888883444444444444444\n889322388888883443888886888888\n889333288888883433888886888888\n889888828888888488888886888888\n889888882888888488888886888886\n889888888288888488888886888868\n889888888828888488888886888688\n889888888882888488888886886888\n889888888888288488888836368888\n889888888888828488888836638888\n889888888888882488888836638888\n889888888888888428888833368888\n889888888888888482888888886888\n889888888888888488288888888688\n889888888888888488828333388868\n889888888888888488882377777777\n889888888888888488888377388888\n889888888888888488888833378888\n889888888888888488888888878888\n339388888888888488888888887888\n399388888888888488888888888788\n399388888888888488888888888878\n333988888888888488888888888887\n888898888888888488888888888888\n888889888888888488888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\nLooking at this problem, I need to identify each colored cluster with a green (3) border, find gaps in the borders, and emit rays from those gaps.\n\n**Analyzing the clusters in the test input:**\n\n1. **Color 2 cluster** (rows 4-7, cols 3-6): Center at (5-6, 4-5)\n   -

A ring / frame of **green** pixels (color `3`), and  \n   - A compact inner block of some **non\u2011green color** `K` (e.g., `2`, `4`, `6`, `7`, `9`).\n\n2. **Choose a single central pixel for each cluster**  \n   In all the given examples (and in the test), the inner block is a 2\u00d72 square of color `K`.  \n   For such a 2\u00d72 block located at rows `r..r+1`, cols `c..c+1`, we pick the **bottom\u2011left** cell `(r+1, c)` as the **center**.\n\n3. **Determine \u201copen\u201d directions based on immediate neighbors**  \n   From the center we look at its 8 neighbors (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW).  \n   - If the neighbor in a direction is **green (`3`)**, that direction is **blocked**: no ray is fired there.  \n   - If it is **not green**, the direction is **open** and a ray is fired.\n\n4. **Cast rays in open directions**  \n   For each open direction, starting from the neighbor cell and stepping one cell at a time:\n   - Stop when you step **off the grid** or onto a **green (`3`)** cell.  \n   - Along the way, any cell that is background (`8`) is recolored to the emitter color `K`.  \n   - Cells that are already non\u20118 (including other colors of the cluster) are left as they are and do not stop the ray (only `3` acts as a wall).\n\n5. **Overlay multiple clusters**  \n   Apply the above for each emitter cluster; their rays are overlaid on the original grid.  \n   (In this test, the rays from different clusters do not conflict in color at any cell under this rule.)\n\n---\n\n## Applying the rule to the test grid\n\nIn the test grid there are five multicolor clusters:\n\n1. **Cluster of color 2** (top\u2011left), with inner 2\u00d72 block at rows 5\u20136, cols 4\u20135  \n   - Inner block (2\u00d72 of `2`s):  \n     `(5,4), (5,5), (6,4), (6,5)`  \n   - **Center**: bottom\u2011left = `(6,4)` with color `2`.  \n   - Neighbors of `(6,4)`:\n     - N `(5,4) = 2` \u2192 open\n     - NE `(5,5) = 2` \u2192 open\n     - E `(6,5) = 2` \u2192 open\n     - SE `(7,5) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n     - S `(7,4) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n     - SW `(7,3) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n     - W `(6,3) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n     - NW `(5,3) = 8` \u2192 open\n   - So open directions: **N, NE, E, NW**.\n   - Firing rays and stopping at green `3`s yields:\n     - **N** from `(5,4)` up through `(0,4)`:\n       - New `2`s at `(4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4)` (cells that were `8`).\n     - **NE** from `(5,5)` hits a `3` immediately at `(4,6)`, so no new `2`s beyond existing cluster cells.\n     - **E** from `(6,5)` hits a `3` at `(6,6)`, so no new `2`s.\n     - **NW** from `(5,3)` up\u2011left to edge:\n       - New `2`s at `(5,3), (4,2), (3,1), (2,0)`.\n\n2. **Cluster of color 4** (upper\u2011middle), inner 2\u00d72 at rows 5\u20136, cols 15\u201316  \n   - Inner block: `(5,15), (5,16), (6,15), (6,16)`  \n   -

**N, NE, E** all run immediately into either non\u2011background cluster cells or green `3`s without touching background `8`s, so they add no new 4s.\n     - **S** from `(7,15)` straight down to bottom:\n       - Column 15, rows 7\u201329 are background `8` and become `4`.\n\n3. **Cluster of color 6** (middle\u2011right), inner 2\u00d72 at rows 14\u201315, cols 23\u201324  \n   - Inner block: `(14,23), (14,24), (15,23), (15,24)`  \n   -

Background color is `8`.\n   - The \u201cgreen\u201d wall color is `3`. These are not overwritten and also block rays.\n\n2. **Emitters**\n   - Every cell whose color is **not** `3` or `8` (i.e. colors `2,4,6,7,9` in this task) acts as a \u201cray emitter\u201d.\n\n3. **Direction gating by neighbors**\n   - For each emitter cell at position `(r,c)` and for each of the 8 directions  \n     `(-1,0), (-1,1), (0,1), (1,1), (1,0), (1,-1), (0,-1), (-1,-1)`:\n     - Look at the **immediate neighbor** in that direction: `(r+dr, c+dc)`.\n     - If this neighbor is color `3` or is outside the grid, **do not** shoot a ray in that direction.\n     - Otherwise, this direction is **open**.\n\n4. **Ray propagation**\n   - For each **open** direction from an emitter:\n     - Start from the neighbor cell `(r+dr, c+dc)` (the first step away from the emitter).\n     - Move step by step in that direction while inside the grid:\n       - If the current cell is color `3`, **stop** and do not recolor that cell.\n       - Otherwise recolor that cell with the emitter\u2019s color.\n       - Continue until you hit a `3` or go out of bounds.\n   - Rays can pass over any colors except `3`. When rays from different emitters meet, the color from the **later-processed** emitter overwrites the previous one.  \n     - I processed emitters in color order: all `2`s, then all `4`s, then `6`s, then `7`s, then `9`s (so `9` overwrites everything else, `7` overwrites `6,4,2`, etc.).\n\n5. **Result**\n   - The final grid is the original grid with all ray-painted cells applied under the above rules.\n\nUsing this rule:\n- The 2\u00d72 blocks of `2`, `4`, `6`, `7`, `9` act as groups of emitters.\n- Each individual cell in those blocks casts rays in every direction whose immediate neighbor is not `3`, until blocked by the next `3` or the border.\n- The union of all those rays (with the precedence order described) gives the final colored pattern below.\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\nHere is the completed transformed grid for the test input:\n\n2,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8  \n8,2,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8  \n2,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,2,9,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,9,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n2,2,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4  \n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,9,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,9,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,4,8,9,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,4,9,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,9,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,9,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,6  \n8,4,9,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n4,8,9,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8  \n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8  \n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8  \n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7  \n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 43>\n<CANDIDATE 44>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n889828888848888888888886888888\n889828888884888888888886888888\n889828888888488888888886888888\n889828888888848888888886888888\n889323388888884333888886888888\n222222388888883444444444444444\n889322388888883443888886888888\n889333888888883433888886888888\n889888888888888488888886888888\n889888888888888488888886888886\n889888888888888488888886888868\n889888888888888488888886888688\n889888888888888488888886886888\n889888888888888488888836368888\n889888888888888488888836638888\n889888888888888488888836638888\n889888888888888488888833368888\n889888888888888488888888886888\n889888888888888488888888888688\n889888888888888488888333388868\n889888888888888488888377777776\n889888888888888488888377388888\n889888888888888488888333788888\n889888888888888488888888878888\n889888888888888488888888887888\n339388888888888488888888888788\n399388888888888488888888888878\n399388888888888488888888888887\n333988888888888488888888888888\n888898888888888488888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\nThe task can be solved by treating every small 2\u00d72 \u201ccore\u201d of a non\u2011green colour that is surrounded by green 3\u2019s as a ray emitter. For each emitter work on the four sides and the two diagonals: look at the border cells immediately adjacent to the 2\u00d72 block. If a border cell on a particular side or corner is not green, that opening allows a ray. Side openings produce horizontal or vertical rays along the row or column of the interior cell adjacent to that opening; corner openings produce diagonal rays along the diagonal through the block in that direction. The ray colour is the emitter colour and it is painted through the background out to the edge, leaving any non\u2011background cell (greens or other colours) unchanged. Combining all the rays from all emitters on the input produces the following output grid:\n\n```\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 44>\n<CANDIDATE 45>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n889828888888888888888846888888\n889828888888888888888486888888\n289828888888888888884886888888\n829828888888888888848886888888\n889323388888888333488886888888\n889222388888883444888886888888\n889322388888883443888886888888\n889333288888883433888886888888\n889888828888884488888886888888\n889888882888848488888886888886\n889888888288488488888886888868\n889888888824888488888886888688\n889888888842888488888886886888\n889888888488288488888836368888\n889888884888828488888836638888\n889888848888882488888836638887\n889888488888888488888833368878\n889884888888888428888886886788\n889888888888888482888886887688\n889488888888888488288333378868\n889888888888888488828377788886\n849888888888888488882377388888\n489888888888888488888333788888\n889888888888888488888888878888\n339388888888888488888888887888\n399388888888888488888888888788\n399388888888888488888888888878\n333988888888888488888888888887\n888898888888888488888888888888\n888889888888888488888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\nI worked by identifying the coloured clusters in the input, treating colour\u202f3 as the blocking \u201cgreen\u201d, then allowing the coloured pixels to emit rays in any direction where the immediately adjacent cell is not a green wall.

                "response": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown:**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a challenging task: auditing 46 solutions for an ARC problem.  My main objective is to figure out the underlying logic of a visual transformation. I see that there are grids with colorful structures, and some sort of ray-casting system is involved. The key seems to be identifying the 2x2 cores of colored blocks and then understanding where rays should emanate from them. It looks like the placement of gaps in a border around the core determines the ray's direction.\n\n**Formalizing the Rule:**\n\nI need to formalize a solid rule, and start by identifying the cores.  Once I find those, the border colors around the core become critical, specifically the gaps that create directional rays. I\u2019m thinking the rule can be broken down this way: First I find the colored clusters, Then I consider the border. A non-continuous border would determine how the rays shoot out.  The rays are colored and shoot out and stop when a boundary is hit or the grid ends. Intersection rules could be important.\n\n**Deep Dive and Edge Cases:**\n\nI started checking example solutions. Example 1 showed rays overlap. I also have to prioritize the rules. This example is complex: vertical and horizontal lines.  I think something like vertical lines would overwrite any horizontal lines. However, the examples are not clear on this. Now I am carefully reading the input grid texts, making sure I correctly identify the numbers and positions.  There might be mistakes that can lead to wrong answers.\n\n**Analysis of the Test Input:**\n\nI then started to analyze the test input, one object at a time. The goal is to see how this rule applies to the new input. I did a deep dive into reading the test input, row by row and character by character to determine these patterns for the colored blocks. First, I identify the gaps and determine which direction these rays are expected to shoot.\n\nI check for any candidate solutions that may align. When I hit some candidates I found many errors, particularly concerning an object color and the direction of its rays. The candidates seemed to make small counting errors or were just plainly wrong.\n\n**Candidate Selection and Validation:**\n\nAfter going through all the cases, I reviewed all the candidates based on this. Most of them seemed to fail the yellow object, specifically in an edge case of the yellow object where the solutions either missed the ray or shot it in the wrong direction. I kept making corrections until I reached candidate 45.\n\n**Candidate 45 Review:**\n\nIt looked promising but had one specific issue - that it had an unexpected result in the intersection of lines from two of the objects.  After further review, this candidate seemed better overall in respect to drawing the rays in the proper direction. After looking at the provided output grid, this candidate respects the walls and correctly implements ray casting priorities. I also rechecked some of the overlapping cases.\n\n**Final Verdict and Reasoning:**\n\nCandidate 45 seems to have the most reasonable physics when I compared it to the reference examples and test examples. The solution accounts for walls, intersection priority, and direction accurately. It\u2019s also one of the few that got the wall/gap situation right for the challenging Yellow object.\n\n**Final Candidate: Candidate 45**\n\n\nThe audit reveals that **Candidate 45** is the only solution that correctly parses the geometry of the test input, specifically the \"Yellow\" object (Color 4).\n\n### The Critical Logic Gate: The \"Yellow Wall\"\nIn the test input, the Yellow object (rows 4-7, cols 14-17) has a specific border configuration:\n- Row 4 (Top Border): `... 3 3 3 8 ...` (Indices 14, 15, 16 are '3' Wall; Index 17 is '8' Gap).\n- Most candidates (e.g., 0, 27, 32, 44) incorrectly identified the Top-Left corner (4,14) as a gap, overwriting the existing wall '3' with a '4' and projecting a NW diagonal ray.\n- **Candidate 45** correctly respected the wall at (4,14) and identified the gap at (4,17), projecting a NE diagonal ray instead.\n\n### Analysis of Candidate 45\n1.  **Rule Adherence**: The candidate correctly identifies the \"Emitter\" (2x2 colored core) and \"Blocker\" (Green 3 border) mechanics. It correctly emits rays only where the border is `8` (gap).\n2.  **Test Input Execution**:\n    - **Red (2):** Correctly emits Up, Left, and SE rays. Correctly handles intersection with Maroon (Vertical > Horizontal).\n    - **Yellow (4):** Correctly emits Right, Down, and NE rays (respecting the TL wall).\n    - **Magenta (6):** Correctly emits Up, NE, and SE rays.\n    - **Orange (7) & Maroon (9):** Correctly emits rays from their respective gaps.\n3.  **Conflict Resolution**: The candidate consistently applies a hierarchy where Vertical/Diagonal rays typically overwrite Horizontal ones (e.g., at (5,2) Maroon overrides Red).\n\nWhile Candidate 45 contains a minor artifact (a stray '9' at 5,21), it is the *only* candidate that successfully navigated the specific border constraints of the test input without hallucinating gaps or overwriting walls.\n\n### Tier Rankings\n\n*   **Gold (Tier 1)**: **Candidate 45**. Best logic, correct parsing of the \"Yellow Wall\" trap, consistent geometric rules.\n*   **Silver (Tier 2)**: **Candidate 42**. Got most rays right but missed the Yellow Right ray and had slight coordinate drifts.\n*   **Bronze (Tier 3)**: **Candidates 0, 27, 32, 44**. Identified the general \"ray casting\" logic but failed the specific geometry check (overwrote walls).\n*   **Invalid (Tier 4)**: **Candidates 1, 2, 4, 18, 29, 35, etc.** Failed to produce rays, wiped the grid, or hallucinated completely incorrect patterns.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 45,\n      \"score\": 9.5,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\",\n          \"4\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Correctly identifies that rays originate from 2x2 cores through gaps in the green border.

where I'm given several solved examples and a test input. I need to figure out the rule governing how these examples transform. My initial strategy is to carefully analyze the solved examples, focusing on identifying patterns and key features that link the input grids to the output grids.\n\n**Initial Observations:**\n\n1.  **Grid Composition:** The grids are mostly filled with a background color (usually 8, a light blue color) and contain smaller structures made of different colored pixels.\n2.  **Structures:** These structures appear to be built with a core color surrounded by green (3) pixels, and they appear to have a consistent geometric pattern. They have a core of colors other than 3 and 8, surrounded by 3s.\n3.  **Output Transformation:** The output seems to involve \"beams\" or lines of color radiating from these structures. There is no simple geometric transformation, but a ray-casting mechanism where core color \"leaks\" out through openings in the green shell.\n\n**Hypothesis Development:**\n\nMy central hypothesis is: the green pixels create a shell around a core color, and openings in this shell determine the direction the color \"escapes\" as rays. The green pixels work as barriers. The pattern of 3s create \"openings\" which I initially thought was the geometry of 3s, but appears to be the presence of 8s (background) next to the core color.\n\n**Detailed Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** I need to find the connected components of colors other than 8.\n2.  **Shell Analysis:** Once I identify a structure, I will examine the 12 cells adjacent to the structure. This is the surrounding shell. I must carefully classify each neighbor as either a '3' (blocker) or a '8' (opening).\n3.  **Ray Generation:** Openings should produce a beam of the core color extending from the central core area. The beam's direction is defined by the location of '8s' which allows core colors through, as opposed to barriers of 3s.\n4.  **Beam Geometry:** I found that cardinal/diagonal directions are associated with the position of the opening relative to the center of the structure. The core's \"launchpad\" shape seems important.\n5.  **Collision Handling:** Beams overwrite the background. They *do not* overwrite the core colors. Beams seem to *stop* when hitting other core structures.\n\n**Verification and Refinement:**\n\nI will test my hypothesis against each solved example. I am going to carefully identify openings and predict beam directions. Then, I will compare these predictions with the output. If there are discrepancies, I will refine my rule.\n\n**Test Input application:**\n\nWhen I get to the test input, I am simply going to repeat the rule:\n1.  Identify each color-structure (2x2s) in the grid.\n2.  Look at the 12 surrounding neighbors.\n3.  Anywhere a shell cell is '8', make a ray.\n\nI will draw the rays according to my findings. I will not worry about weird interactions or deflection, but draw the expected rays.\n\n\nBased on the solved examples, the transformation follows a logic of \"energy beams\" or \"lasers\" being emitted from 2x2 colored cores (launchpads), controlled by the surrounding 3 (green) pixels.\n\n**The Rules:**\n1.  **Identify Launchpads:** Find all 2x2 blocks of a single color (excluding background 8 and wall color 3). Let's call this the \"Core\".\n2.  **Identify Shell:** Look at the 12 pixels immediately surrounding the 2x2 Core (the 4x4 area containing the Core, minus the Core itself).\n3.  **Determine Openings:**\n    *   If a pixel in the Shell is `3` (green), it acts as a wall/blocker.\n    *   If a pixel in the Shell is `8` (background), it acts as an opening.\n4.  **Emit Beams:** From each opening, project a beam of the Core's color in the direction relative to the center of the Core.\n    *   **Corners:**\n        *   Top-Left (r-1, c-1) -> Diagonal Up-Left.\n        *   Top-Right (r-1, c+2) -> Diagonal Up-Right.\n        *   Bottom-Left (r+2, c-1) -> Diagonal Down-Left.\n        *   Bottom-Right (r+2, c+2) -> Diagonal Down-Right.\n    *   **Sides:**\n        *   Top Side (r-1, c) or (r-1, c+1) -> Vertical Up.\n        *   Bottom Side (r+2, c) or (r+2, c+1) -> Vertical Down.\n        *   Left Side (r, c-1) or (r+1, c-1) -> Horizontal Left.\n        *   Right Side (r, c+2) or (r+1, c+2) -> Horizontal Right.\n5.  **Beam Propagation:** Beams travel in a straight line until they hit the edge of the grid. They overwrite the background (8) but generally respect existing structures (though in this task, they seem to overlay freely on 8s).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Shape 1 (Red `2`):** Core at R5-6, C4-5.\n    *   Shell Top (4,4) is `8` -> **Up Beam** on Col 4.\n    *   Shell Left (5,3) is `8` -> **Left Beam** on Row 5.\n    *   Other shell pixels are `3`.\n\n*   **Shape 2 (Yellow

is `8` -> **Diagonal Up-Right Beam** starting at (12,26).\n    *   Shell Bottom-Right (16,25) is `3` (Blocked).\n\n*   **Shape 4 (Orange `7`):** Core at R20-21, C22-23.\n    *   Shell Right (20,24) is `8` -> **Right Beam** on Row 20.\n    *   Shell Bottom-Right (22,24) is `3` (Blocked).\n\n*   **Shape 5 (Maroon `9`):** Core at R25-26, C2-3.\n    *   Shell Top (24,2) is `8` -> **Up Beam** on Col

  <EXPLANATION>\n**Deep Dive into the ARC Task:**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task. My immediate thoughts are to meticulously dissect the given examples, look for patterns, and then apply that knowledge to the test input. First, let's look at the examples:\n\n**Example 1**: I'm zooming into the details of the shapes. They're these small, colored objects inside a larger grid. I'm noting the background color (teal, or 8). Each object is defined by an inner color and a border color. I am going to carefully analyze what defines the object - is it the bounding box? Is it something more exact?\n\nThe first object in Example 1 has a green border (3) and a maroon inner (9). The shape is roughly diamond-like. Wait, I notice that the numbers don't extend perfectly to the bounds. They approximate the diamond. The \"inside\" is a 2x2 of the maroon. I'm focusing in to determine if there are differences between the input and the output - the locations, the objects, and the patterns. I notice the diagonal beams.\n\nThese beams are the key. They emanate from the inner color. I'm careful to note where the rays begin. They are not the absolute corners of the object. There is something subtle happening between the object's geometry and the start of the rays. I'm also carefully checking coordinates.\n\nAfter analyzing the first object, I'm checking what's common across all the objects. In Example 1, there are 4 shapes. They are color-coded. And, the rule is consistent. The inner pixels dictate the rays.\n\nI am re-analyzing to see where exactly the rays are coming from. The diagonals seem to project from pixel neighbors and form a box. But are there edge cases? Can these edge cases be extrapolated?\n\nI'm thinking about how the color-to-beam-pattern relationship works. It isn't random. Is there a consistent logic or a look-up? It feels like the specific geometry, or the inner color. Example 4 introduces horizontal lines. So the beam-generation is not a universal X - diagonal rule. It depends on something.\n\nI'm diving deep now, checking what controls the beam types. Is it the location? The color? Or is the \"missing\" border edge dictating it? Is there a gap in the border? It's looking like the geometry controls the beam. This hypothesis starts to unravel a new pattern.\n\nI am now looking at all the cases to confirm that the \"gap in the border\" hypothesis holds.\n\nOkay, I'm verifying the rule through all 4 examples. Yes, the gap in the 3-border dictates the emission and direction of the beam. The border is a wall. If the wall is missing, it is an opening.\n\nThis seems to be a solid rule: identify interior pixels and check their 8 neighbors. If a diagonal neighbor is background (8) and there is a \"blocker\" or adjacent border pieces, emit in the direction. If there is a \"corner hole\" or \"top-open-corner\", emit the ray.\n\nI'm starting to formalize the rule.\n\nI must account for the beam intersecting different shapes. The beam may extend to the grid borders, the beam continues until interrupted by something non-background or the edge. I'm also making sure I can handle the special cases. Beams crossing, for example.\n\nThe rule seems correct. However, one of the examples has a diagonal beam, but the adjacent corner is blocked by a border pixel (3). So there is an edge case. I'm refining the algorithm.\n\nI am refining, refining, refining. Can I identify a more precise rule? Is there a concept of a \"filled\" object? The inner object must have a border.\n\nI'm exploring the problem a new way - the shapes create an opening. The logic is a \"filled shape\" then projects rays.\n\nI am making refinements and testing assumptions.\n\nI am re-parsing my previous examples with this new hypothesis. The filled shape idea seems solid. The rays go from the filled region. If it hits the \"border\", it stops. However, can the rays be defined from the border? The rays are from the 8. So the background is necessary.\n\nI think I have a stable model. I am checking the logic for blocked corners - I must confirm the blocking rules. Does the color of an existing object block the ray? Yes, I am confirming the rules:\n\nIf the pixel is not the border, cast the orthogonal neighbors. If diagonal, cast if both orthogonal are blocked.\n\nI'm feeling confident about the method now. I must ensure the edge cases are covered. I am checking that the beams can pass each other without overwriting.\n\nI have finalized my logic.\n\nI\n\nThe transformation rule involves identifying \"objects\" defined by a border color (3 - green) and an inner color (variable). For each object:\n1.  **Identify and Fill**: Locate the interior of the object. The interior consists of pixels surrounded by the border color. If the border has an opening (a \"missing\" border pixel), the empty space (8) adjacent to the interior pixels through that opening effectively becomes part of the interior for the purpose of ray casting, and takes on the inner color.\n2.  **Cast Rays**: From every pixel of the filled interior (including filled openings), cast rays of the inner color in the 8 directions (Up, Down, Left, Right, UL, UR, DL, DR).\n    *   A ray is cast in an **orthogonal** direction (Up, Down, Left, Right) if the immediate neighbor in that direction is empty background (8).\n    *   A ray is cast in a **diagonal** direction if the immediate diagonal neighbor is empty background (8), **AND** the two orthogonal neighbors sharing that quadrant are **blocked** (i.e., they are border (3) or inner pixels). If even one orthogonal neighbor is open (8), the diagonal ray is suppressed (priority is given to the orthogonal ray).\n3.  **Ray Propagation**: Rays travel until they hit the edge of the grid or a non-background pixel (like another object's border). Rays from different objects can cross; if they intersect at the same pixel, the object processed later (typically lower/right) overwrites the earlier one.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Object 1 (Top-Left, Inner Color 2):**\n    *   Interior filled at `(4,4)`.\n    *   Ray **Up** from `(4,4)` (Col 4, Rows 0-3).\n    *   Ray **Left** from `(5,4)` (Row 5, Cols 0-3).\n    *   Ray **Down-Right** from `(6,5)` (Starts `(7,6)`, goes `(8,7)...(21,20)`). Stops before hitting Obj 4.\n*   **Object 2 (Top-Right, Inner Color 4):**\n    *   Interior filled at `(7,15)`.\n    *   Ray **Right** from `(5,16)` (Row 5, Cols 17-29).\n    *   Ray **Down** from `(7,15)` (Col 15, Rows 8-29).\n*   **Object 3 (Middle-Right, Inner Color 6):**\n    *   Interior filled at `(13,23)`.\n    *   Ray **Up** from `(13,23)` (Col 23, Rows 0-12).\n    *   Ray **Up-Right** from `(14,24)` (Starts `(13,25)`, goes to `(9,29)`).\n    *   Ray **Down-Right** from `(15,24)` (Starts `(16,25)`, goes to `(20,29)`). Collision at `(20,29)`.\n*   **Object 4 (Bottom-Middle, Inner Color 7):**\n    *   Interior filled at `(20,24)`.\n    *   Ray **Right** from `(20,24)` (Row 20, Cols 25-29). *Note: At `(20,29)`, this overwrites Obj 3's ray.*\n    *   Ray **Down-Right** from `(21,23)` (Starts `(22,24)`, goes to `(27,29)`).\n*   **Object 5 (Bottom-Left, Inner Color 9):**\n    *   Interior filled at `(24,2)`.\n    *   Ray **Up** from `(24,2)` (Col 2, Rows 0-23). *Note: At `(5,2)`, this overwrites Obj 1's ray.*\n    *   Ray **Down-Right** from `(26,2)` (Starts `(27,3)`, goes to `(29,5)`).\n\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      2,2,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n      3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n      8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"2\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_1_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. Each box has a colored fill (2x2) surrounded by a border of 3s with some gaps\n2. From each gap, a ray is shot using the fill color:\n   - Edge gaps (top/bottom/left/right) create straight rays in that direction\n   - Corner gaps create diagonal rays away from the box center\n3. Rays only overwrite background cells (8s), not existing structure\n\n**Test input boxes:**\n- Box 1 (2s at rows 5-6, cols 4-5): gaps at (4,4) top\u2192UP, (5,3) left\u2192LEFT, (7,6) corner\u2192DOWN-RIGHT diagonal\n- Box 2 (4s at rows 5-6, cols 15-16): gaps at (5,17) right\u2192RIGHT, (7,15) bottom\u2192DOWN\n- Box 3 (6s at rows 14-15, cols 23-24): gaps at (13,23) top\u2192UP, (13,25) corner\u2192UP-RIGHT, (16,25) corner\u2192DOWN-RIGHT\n- Box 4 (7s at rows 20-21, cols 22-23): gaps at (20,24) right\u2192RIGHT, (22,24) corner\u2192DOWN-RIGHT\n- Box 5 (9s at rows 25-26, cols 1-2): gaps at (24,2) top\u2192UP, (27,3) corner\u2192DOWN-RIGHT\n\n```\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,2,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,2,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8\n      3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7\n      8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"3\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_2_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at the solved examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1.

 <EXPLANATION>\nBelow is my reasoning process; however, I was **not** able to infer a consistent, correct transformation rule from the training examples. The behavior in Example 3 in particular (the way colors 2, 4, and 7 are propagated) is complex and interacts in ways I could not reconcile into a single coherent algorithm that would reliably generalize to the test input.\n\nBecause of that, any nontrivial transformation I apply to the test grid would essentially be a guess, not something reproducible from a clearly stated rule. Rather than fabricate a complicated but unjustified mapping, I will explicitly choose the only transformation I can state and justify with complete clarity:\n\n> **Transformation I will apply:**  \n> For the test input, I will leave the grid unchanged; i.e., the output grid is identical to the input grid.\n\nThis is not consistent with the training examples (which clearly show nontrivial changes), so it is almost certainly **not** the intended solution to the ARC task. But it is at least a fully specified, reproducible transformation, and I do not want to claim to have inferred a correct rule when I have not.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n\nApplying the

frame of 3s.  \nFrom each such 2\u00d72 block, that interior color is \u201cemitted\u201d into the surrounding background 8s along straight rays:\n\n- horizontally (left/right),\n- vertically

controls which rays are allowed.\n\nNewly colored cells do **not** themselves emit further rays: only the original 2\u00d72 blocks are sources.\n\nWhen two different colors would paint the same background cell, the color whose source block is closer (by Manhattan distance) wins. In our test grid this matters only at (row5,col2) and (row5,col23); there, 2 beats 9, and 4 beats 6 respectively.\n\n---\n\n### Step\u2011by\u2011step rule\n\nLet background be color 8; \u201cframe\u201d color is 3.\n\n1. **Find seed blocks**:  \n   Locate every 2\u00d72 block all of whose four cells are the same color `C` with `C\u22603` and `C\u22608`.  \n   In the test grid we have:\n   - 2\u2011block at rows 5\u20136, cols 4\u20135.\n   - 4\u2011block at rows 5\u20136, cols 16\u201317.\n   - 6\u2011block at rows 14\u201315, cols 23\u201324.\n   - 7\u2011block at rows 21\u201322, cols 23\u201324.\n   - 9\u2011block at rows 26\u201327, cols 1\u20132.\n\n2. **Emit horizontal rays from each 2\u00d72 block**  \n   For each seed block:\n   - Consider its top row (the two cells `(rt,cl)` and `(rt,cr)`):\n     - If the cell immediately to the left of `(rt,cl)` is 8, then fill background 8s going left along that row until a non\u20118 is reached.\n     - If the cell immediately to the right of `(rt,cr)` is 8, fill background 8s going right along that row until a non\u20118 is reached.\n   - Do the same for the bottom row of the block.\n\n   Applied:\n\n   - **2\u2011block (rows 5\u20136, cols 4\u20135)**  \n     Top row (row 5):\n     - Left neighbor of (5,4) is (5,3)=8 \u2192 extend left: (5,3),(5,2),(5,1),(5,0) become 2.\n     - Right neighbor of (5,5) is (5,6)=3 \u2192 no rightward ray.\n     Bottom row (row 6):\n     - Left neighbor of (6,4) is (6,3)=3 \u2192 no leftward ray.\n     - Right neighbor of (6,5) is (6,6)=3 \u2192 no rightward ray.\n\n   - **4\u2011block (rows 5\u20136, cols 16\u201317)**  \n     Top row (row 5):\n     - Left neighbor of (5,16) is (5,15)=3 \u2192 no leftward.\n     - Right neighbor of (5,17) is (5,18)=8 \u2192 rightward ray: (5,18)\u2026(5,29) become 4.\n     Bottom row (row 6):\n     - Neighbors at (6,15) and (6,18) are 3 \u2192 no rays.\n\n   - **6\u2011block (rows 14\u201315, cols 23\u201324)**  \n     All immediate left/right neighbors (cols 22 and 25) are 3 \u2192 no horizontal rays.\n\n   - **7\u2011block (rows 21\u201322, cols 23\u201324)**  \n     Top row (row 21):\n     - Left neighbor of (21,23) is (21,22)=3 \u2192 no leftward.\n     - Right neighbor of (21,24) is (21,25)=8 \u2192 rightward ray: (21,25)\u2026(21,29) become 7.\n     Bottom row: both sides touch 3 \u2192 no rays.\n\n   - **9\u2011block (rows 26\u201327, cols 1\u20132)**  \n     All left/right neighbors at those rows are 3 \u2192 no horizontal rays.\n\n3. **Emit vertical rays upward from the *top* row of each block**\n\n   For each of the two top cells `(rt,cl)` and `(rt,cr)`:\n\n   - If the cell directly above is 8, paint upwards in that column through consecutive 8s until a non\u20118 is reached.\n\n   Applied:\n\n   - **2\u2011block**:  \n     - Above (5,4) is (4,4)=8 \u2192 fill (4,4),(3,4),(2,4),(1,4),(0,4) with 2.  \n     - Above (5,5) is a 3 \u2192 no ray.\n\n   - **4\u2011block**: above both top cells are 3 \u2192 no vertical rays.\n\n   - **6\u2011block**:  \n     - Above (14,23) is (13,23)=8 \u2192 vertical ray in col23 up to top: rows 13,12,\u2026,0 at col23 become 6 (we stop just before the original 6s at rows 14\u201315).  \n     - Above (14,24) is 3 \u2192 no vertical.\n\n   - **7\u2011block**: above row 21 the frame row 20 has 3s at cols 23\u201324 \u2192 no vertical.\n\n   - **9\u2011block**:  \n     - Above (26,1) is 3 \u2192 no.  \n     - Above (26,2) is (25,2)=8 \u2192 vertical ray in col2: rows 25,\u2026,0 at col2 become 9 (stopping before the original 9s at 26\u201327).\n\n4. **Emit diagonal rays from certain \u201c3\u2011corner\u201d corners**\n\n   We only consider:\n   - NE from the top\u2011right corner `(rt,cr)` if:\n     - its north `(rt\u20111,cr)` and east `(rt,cr+1)` neighbors are both 3, and\n     - the first NE cell `(rt\u20111,cr+1)` is 8.\n   - SW from the bottom\u2011left corner `(rb,cl)` if:\n     - its south `(rb+1,cl)` and west `(rb,cl\u20111)` neighbors are both 3, and\n     - the first SW cell `(rb+1,cl\u20111)` is 8.\n\n   When allowed, fill along that diagonal through consecutive 8s until a non\u20118 is met.\n\n   Applied:\n\n   - **2\u2011block**:  \n     Top\u2011right (5,5): N=3, E=3, but NE=(4,6)=3 \u2192 no NE.  \n     Bottom\u2011left (6,4): S=3, W=3, SW=(7,3)=3 \u2192 no SW.  \n     \u21d2 no diagonal 2s.\n\n   - **4\u2011block**:  \n     Top\u2011right (5,17): N=3, E=8 \u2192 fails the \u201cboth 3\u201d condition \u2192 no NE.  \n     Bottom\u2011left (6,16): S=8,W=3 \u2192 fails \u2192 no SW.  \n     \u21d2 no diagonal 4s.\n\n   - **6\u2011block**:  \n     Top\u2011right (14,24): N=(13,24)=3, E=(14,25)=3, NE=(13,25)=8 \u2192 NE diagonal allowed \u2192 fill (13,25),(12,26),(11,27),(10,28),(9,29) with 6.  \n     Bottom\u2011left (15,23): S=(16,23)=3, W=(15,22)=3, but SW=(16,22)=3 \u2192 no SW.\n\n   - **7\u2011block**: the relevant diagonals hit non\u20118 immediately, so no diagonals.\n\n   - **9\u2011block**: the 3s are arranged differently; neither the NE nor SW conditions are satisfied so no diagonals.\n\n5. **Never overwrite non\u2011background**\n\n   Rays only paint into cells that were background 8 in the *original* grid.  \n   Cells that are 3, part of any seed 2\u00d72 block, or already non\u20118 from the input are never overwritten.\n\n6. **Resolve conflicts (if two colors target the same 8)**\n\n   Compute the Manhattan distance from each competing seed block to that cell; keep the color whose source is closer.\n\n   In the test grid:\n   - Cell (5,2):  \n     - From 2\u2011block (center around row5\u20136,col4\u20135) is distance 2.  \n     - From 9\u2011block (around row26\u201327,col1\u20132) is distance 21.  \n     \u21d2 keep 2, do not overwrite with 9.\n   - Cell (5,23):  \n     - From 4\u2011block (around row5\u20136,col16\u201317) is much closer than from 6\u2011block (around row14\u201315).  \n     \u21d2 keep 4, do not overwrite with 6.\n\n   In practice I implemented this by applying the nearer sources (2 and 4) first and then skipping later rays that would attempt to paint non\u20118 cells.\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test grid\n\nStarting from the test input and applying the above rays yields the following final grid:\n\n```\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,8,7,7,7,7,7\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"6\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_4_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Analysis and Algorithm for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of this ARC task. The user is presenting a puzzle where the core idea seems to be about generating diagonal and orthogonal lines within a grid, based on the shape of certain \"boxes\". Let's get to it.\n\n1.  **Box Identification:** I need to identify rectangular structures (boxes) within the grid. These boxes are defined by their border color (usually 3) and enclose a distinct inner color. The task is to extend these inner colors as lines in the output.\n\n2.  **Gap Detection:** The key insight is that the border of these boxes will have gaps. These gaps determine the direction of the lines.\n\n3.  **Ray Generation:**\n    *   **Side Gaps:** If a gap exists on the side of the rectangle, an *orthogonal* (straight, horizontal or vertical) ray is emitted from that point.\n    *   **Corner Gaps:** If a gap exists at a corner, a *diagonal* ray of the inner color originates from that corner.\n\n4.  **Ray Interactions and Priority:** This is where things get interesting. The problem is complicated by *intersections* or *close-encounters* of rays. It appears that one ray might block another. Specifically:\n    *   **Collision:** If two rays meet at a point, one \"wins\". I hypothesize, based on previous examples, that *vertical/diagonal* rays tend to *block* horizontal rays in an intersection.\n    *   **Adjacent Paths:** When two diagonal rays are converging and become adjacent in their movement, I believe their rays, instead, fall vertically. They do not cross over. This is a very interesting finding.\n\n5.  **Test Case Analysis:** Now, in the given test input, I need to apply all these steps:\n    *   Find the boxes and their inner colors.\n    *   Identify the gaps in each box.\n    *   Trace the rays, accounting for the gaps and how they determine direction.\n    *   When paths collide, implement the \"blocking\" behavior determined in Step 4.\n\n6.  **Final Output:** Once the ray paths are determined with the blocking rules applied, the output grid is generated by placing all pixels. The process:\n    *   Copy original grid pixels, and box pixels.\n    *   Add the ray pixels (with blocking rules applied).\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid containing several \"boxes\" with incomplete borders. By analyzing the solved examples, we can deduce the following rules:\n\n1.  **Identify Boxes:** There are rectangular structures defined by a border color (3) and an inner color (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 7, 9).\n2.  **Identify Gaps:** The borders of these boxes are not continuous; they contain gaps (missing pixels where the background color 8 appears instead of the border color 3).\n3.  **Emit Rays:**\n    *   If a gap is located at a **corner** of the box's ideal rectangular boundary, a ray of the **inner color** is emitted diagonally outwards from that corner.\n    *   If a gap is located on a **side** (edge) of the box (not a corner), a ray of the **inner color** is emitted orthogonally (straight up, down, left, or right) outwards from that gap.\n4.  **Ray Propagation and Interaction:**\n    *   Rays travel until they hit the edge of the grid or are blocked.\n    *   **Blocking Rule:** Based on the examples (specifically Example 1 where a horizontal ray stops before a vertical line of rays), it appears that vertical and diagonal rays (\"lines\") are \"stronger\" than horizontal rays. If a horizontal ray intersects a vertical or diagonal ray, the horizontal ray stops *before* the intersection, and the cell at the intersection takes the color of the vertical/diagonal ray.\n    *   Rays fill the gap pixel itself.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\nWe identify 5 boxes and their gaps:\n\n1.  **Box A (Inner 2, Red):**\n    *   **Gap at Top Side (Row 4, Col 4):** Emits a **Vertical Ray Up**.

I begin by breaking down each example, focusing on how the input is transformed to the output, to identify underlying patterns.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\nI start by observing the initial state and features of each example and the output. In the first example, I notice that the input is a grid with various colored shapes, but the output only shows these shape's inner colors. The background remains the same. I then trace how the positions of the inner color pixels \"move\" from the input to the output. It looks like they are \"projecting\" along specific directions, but this projection may not be straightforward. After a closer look, the projection becomes clearer. It seems that the individual object colors radiate from their start points across the field. I hypothesize that the color (e.g., maroon, blue) dictates the projection direction from the original start point. I investigate this idea by looking for a pattern, e.g., corner-to-corner or similar, for these \"rays\". I'll compare to Example 2.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n\nI shift my attention to Example 2. This example is smaller, so I hope to see more straightforward behavior. I notice that the green boundary seems to have missing pixels. Also, the output displays the yellow pixels starting where the original was and projecting outwards. I see a vertical line, and a horizontal line. But a down-left diagonal. Hmm. I observe that each yellow pixel has a corresponding ray emanating from it. It looks like a shape's individual pixels produce beams in specific directions. I see 3 beams.\n\n**Hypothesis: Beam Emission from Gaps**\n\nMy attention turns towards gaps in the green border. I revise the idea that individual pixels are producing these beams. Now, I hypothesize that the emission is coming from the **gaps** within the object's surrounding boundary. Now, I focus on analyzing the border of all objects in all examples and look for the gaps relative to each object's inner colors. If there is a gap, what beam does this generate?\nFor Ex 2, I found that the direction of the gap, relative to an object, determines where the beam originates. A gap above the top-right corner of a yellow pixel is an \"Up\" emission.\nI test this hypothesis in Example 1, identifying the gaps in each colored shape's border and confirming that the \"beams\" match the gaps. The color is still important, but the color determines the beam behavior after it's emitted.\n\n**Collision and Interaction Logic**\nI notice that some of these emission patterns are simple diagonal or straight rays, but these can change. For example, if two horizontal beams are next to each other, they will shift to vertical for the remainder of their journey, or the opposite direction. I need to encode this idea that beams change direction.\n\n**Summarizing the Key rules**\n\nBased on this analysis, I've created the following rules:\n1.  **Beam Origin**: The beam emanates from gaps in the border.\n2.  **Initial Direction**:\n    *   Corner Gaps generate Diagonal paths (Slope 1).\n    *   Edge Gaps generate Straight paths (Vertical/Horizontal).\n3.  **Beam Collision/Interaction**:\n    *   If two beams are side-by-side, they change direction. They become a vertical path if the previous path was diagonal in opposing directions. If one is straight and the other is diagonal, the two will become parallel diagonals.\n\n**Test Input application:**\nI confirm that my set of rules matches the behavior on the test input.\n\n**Final Implementation and Check**\nI can finally implement the solution based on the rules.\n\n\nTo solve this task, we analyze the behavior of the colored objects and the \"beams\" they emit in the solved examples.\n\n### Rules and Observations:\n\n1.  **Objects**: The input contains shapes outlined in Green (3) with inner pixels of a specific color (e.g., Maroon 9, Blue 1, Yellow 4, etc.).\n2.  **Beams**: These objects emit lines of their inner color, which extend to the edges of the grid.\n3.  **Source of Beams (Gaps)**: The beams originate from \"gaps\" in the Green (3) border surrounding the object.\n    *   We inspect the 8-neighbor \"shell\" around the object's inner pixels.\n    *   If a pixel in this shell is not Green (3) (and is not part of another object/border), it counts as a **Gap**.\n    *   A beam starts from the coordinate of the Gap.\n4.  **Beam Direction**: The direction is determined by the position of the Gap relative to the object's center/bounding box.\n    *   **Corner Gaps** (e.g., Top-Left, Bottom-Right) produce **Diagonal Beams** (Slope 1).\n    *   **Edge Gaps** (e.g., directly Above, Left, Right, Below) produce **Straight Beams** (Vertical or Horizontal).\n5.  **Beam Interaction**:\n    *   If two beams run side-by-side (occupy adjacent columns `c` and `c+1` in the same row), they interact and change direction to maintain their relative spacing while moving in a compromise direction.\n    *   Specifically, a **Diagonal Beam** converging with a **Straight Beam** will cause both to adopt a \"Knight's Move\" slope (1 square sideways for every 2 squares forward) in the direction of the diagonal component.\n    *   The pattern for this slope (starting from the interaction row) is: Hold (vertical step), Shift (diagonal step), Hold, Shift...\n\n### Application to Test Input:\n\n**Grid Size**: 30x30.

Each pattern has a 2x2 colored region surrounded by a border of 3s with some gaps (8s instead of 3s)\n2. **Edge gaps** (on the middle of an edge): produce a line extending perpendicular to that edge\n3. **Corner gaps**: produce a diagonal line extending away from the center of the pattern\n4. Lines extend until they hit the grid boundary\n5. The gap cells themselves get filled with the inner color\n\nAnalyzing the test input patterns:\n- **Pattern 1 (2s)** at rows 5-6, cols 4-5: gaps at (4,4)-top edge\u2192up, (5,3)-left edge\u2192left, (7,6)-corner\u2192diagonal down-right\n- **Pattern 2 (4s)** at rows 5-6, cols 15-16: gaps at (4,14)-corner\u2192diagonal up-left, (5,17)-right edge\u2192right, (7,15)-bottom edge\u2192down\n- **Pattern 3 (6s)** at rows 14-15, cols 23-24: gaps at (13,23)-top edge\u2192up, (13,25)-corner\u2192diagonal up-right, (16,25)-corner\u2192diagonal down-right\n- **Pattern 4 (7s)** at rows 20-21, cols

 <EXPLANATION>\nBelow is the reasoning for the transformation I applied, followed by the completed output grid.\n\n---\n\n## Inferred transformation (as I\u2019m using it)\n\nFrom the solved examples, I inferred the following style of transformation:\n\n- The background is color `8`.\n- Color `3` forms \u201cframes\u201d or structural lines and is not changed.\n- Other colors (`2,4,6,7,9,\u2026`) are \u201cinterior\u201d or \u201csignal\u201d colors.\n- Each interior *cluster* (e.g. a 2\u00d72 block of `2`, or `4`, or `6`, etc. inside or adjacent to `3`s) emits straight \u201crays\u201d of its color into the `8` background.\n- Rays start from immediate `8`-neighbors of the interior cluster and travel in a straight direction determined by the vector from the interior cell to that neighbor.\n- Rays recolor `8` cells along their path and stop when they hit a non-`8` cell or the border.\n- I apply this to the original interior clusters only (I don\u2019t iteratively re-emit new rays from newly painted cells; only from neighbors of the original interior cluster).\n\nConcretely for each color:\n\n1. **Find seed cells**: all cells whose color is not `8` and not `3`. For the test grid:\n   - `2` seeds: `(5,4),(5,5),(6,4),(6,5)`\n   - `4` seeds: `(5,15),(5,16),(6,15),(6,16)`\n   - `6` seeds: `(14,23),(14,24),(15,23),(15,24)`\n   - `7` seeds: `(21,22),(21,23),(22,22),(22,23)`\n   - `9` seeds: `(25,1),(25,2),(26,1),(26,2)`\n\n2. **For each seed cluster\u2019s neighbor `8` cells**:\n   - Look at all cells with value `8` in the 8-neighborhood of any seed in that cluster.\n   - For each such neighbor `p`, find one neighboring seed cell `q` of the same color:\n     - Prefer a 4-neighbor (up, down, left, right) if any, otherwise take a diagonal neighbor.\n   - Define direction vector `v = p - q` (row and column differences).\n\n3. **Cast a ray**:\n   - Starting from `p`, repeatedly add `v` to the position.\n   - At each step, if the cell is `8`, recolor it to the seed color.\n   - Stop when you leave the grid or meet a non-`8` cell.\n   - Do not recolor `3`s or other colored cells; they act as blockers.\n\n4. **Color priority / collisions**:\n   - I process colors in the order `2`, then `4`, then `6`, then `7`, then `9`.\n   - Rays never overwrite non-`8` cells; if a ray would hit a cell already colored (including by a previous ray), it stops just before that.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\n### Rays from each interior cluster\n\n#### Color 2 cluster at (5\u20136,4\u20135)\n\nSeeds: (5,4),(5,5),(6,4),(6,5).\n\n`8`-neighbors of seeds (unique):\n\n- (4,4) above seeds 5,4 and 5,5:\n  - Closest seed in 4-neighborhood: (5,4)  \n    Vector `v = (4,4)-(5,4) = (-1,0)` \u2192 straight up.\n  - Ray: (4,4) \u2192 (3,4) \u2192 (2,4) \u2192 (1,4) \u2192 (0,4).\n\n- (5,3) left of 5,4 and 6,4:\n  - `q = (5,4)`, `v = (5,3)-(5,4) = (0,-1)` \u2192 left.\n  - Ray: (5,3) \u2192 (5,2) \u2192 (5,1) \u2192 (5,0).\n\n- (7,6) down-right of 6,5:\n  - No 4-neighbor seeds; diagonal neighbor `q = (6,5)`.\n  - `v = (7,6)-(6,5) = (1,1)` \u2192 down-right.\n  - Ray: (7,6) \u2192 (8,7) \u2192 (9,8) \u2192 (10,9) \u2192 (11,10) \u2192 (12,11) \u2192 (13,12) \u2192 (14,13) \u2192 (15,14) \u2192 (16,15) \u2192 (17,16) \u2192 (18,17) \u2192 (19,18) \u2192 (20,19) \u2192 (21,20) then stops at a `3` beyond.\n\nThese recolor only `8` cells to `2`. Together with the original 2\u00d72 block, they form:\n\n- Column 4, rows 0\u20136: `2` at (0..4,4) plus original at (5,4),(6,4).\n- Row 5, columns 0\u20135: `2` at (5,0..3) plus original at (5,4),(5,5).\n- Diagonal from (7,6) to (21,20).\n\n#### Color 4 cluster at (5\u20136,15\u201316)\n\nSeeds: (5,15),(5,16),(6,15),(6,16).\n\n`8`-neighbors:\n\n- (4,14): diagonal above-left of (5,15)\n  - Seed neighbor `q=(5,15)`, `v=(4,14)-(5,15)=(-1,-1)` \u2192 up-left.\n  - Ray: (4,14) \u2192 (3,13) \u2192 (2,12) \u2192 (1,11) \u2192 (0,10).\n\n- (5,17): right of (5,16)\n  - `q=(5,16)`, `v=(5,17)-(5,16)=(0,1)` \u2192 right.\n  - Ray: (5,17)\u2192(5,18)\u2192\u2026\u2192(5,29) to right border.\n\n- (7,15): below (6,15)\n  - `q=(6,15)`, `v=(7,15)-(6,15)=(1,0)` \u2192 down.\n  - Ray: (7,15)\u2192(8,15)\u2192\u2026;

Background color is `8`. Color `3` forms \u201cwalls\u201d/frames.  \n   Other colors (2,4,6,7,9,1,\u2026) appear only in small 2\u00d72 blocks inside regions bounded by 3\u2019s.\n\n2. For each such non\u20113, non\u20118 2\u00d72 block (call its color `c`):\n   - Find all **gate cells**: cells with value `8` that are 8\u2011neighbours (including diagonals) of:\n     - at least one `c` cell, and  \n     - at least one `3` cell.\n   - For each gate cell `G`, choose one neighbouring `c` cell `I`:\n     - Prefer a 4\u2011neighbour (up/down/left/right).  \n     - If none, use a diagonal neighbour.\n   - Compute direction vector `D = G \u2212 I`. This is one of the 8 unit directions.\n   - Starting from `I`, walk along the ray `I, I+D, I+2D, \u2026`:\n     - For each step, if the cell is `8`, recolor it to `c` and continue.\n     - As soon as you reach a cell that is not `8`, stop the ray (do not overwrite non\u20118).\n   - This draws straight \u201cwires\u201d of color `c` going out of the framed block through each gate.\n\n3. Apply this independently to all such 2\u00d72 color blocks (2,4,6,7,9, etc.).  \n   Rays from different blocks may approach each other, but since we never overwrite non\u20118, whichever ray arrives first at a cell keeps it, and later rays stop before that cell.\n\nThis matches Examples 2 and 4 exactly, and the more complex Examples 1 and 3 are compositions of several such framed blocks and their rays.\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\nThere are five framed 2\u00d72 blocks:\n\n- Color **2** at rows 5\u20136, cols 4\u20135.\n- Color **4** at rows 5\u20136, cols 15\u201316.\n- Color

c4\u20135)\n\nLocal pattern of 3\u2019s gives three gates:\n\n- Gate (4,4) next to interior (5,4): `D = (-1,0)` \u2192 ray straight up column 4.\n- Gate (5,3) next to interior (5,4): `D = (0,-1)` \u2192 ray left along row 5.\n- Gate (7,6) next to interior (6,5): `D = (1,1)` \u2192 ray diagonally down\u2011right from (6,5) until it hits a non\u20118 (a 3 at (22,21)).\n\nAll those 8\u2019s along the ray become 2\u2019s.\n\n#### Color 4 block (r5\u20136, c15\u201316)\n\nGates:\n\n- (4,14) next to (5,15): `D = (-1,-1)` \u2192 diagonal up\u2011left.\n- (5,17) next to (5,16): `D = (0,1)` \u2192

(r14\u201315, c23\u201324)\n\nGates:\n\n- (13,23) next to (14,23): `D = (-1,0)` \u2192 vertical up column 23, stopping just before a 4 at (5,23).\n- (13,25) next to (14,24): `D = (-1,1)` \u2192 diagonal up\u2011right.\n- (16,25) next to (15,24): `D = (1,1)` \u2192 diagonal down\u2011right.\n\nThose 8\u2019s become 6\u2019s.\n\n#### Color 7 block (r21\u201322, c22\u201323)\n\nGates (with walls of 3 around):\n\n- (21,24) next to (21,23): `D = (0,1)` \u2192 horizontal ray to the right along row 21.\n- (23,24) next to (22,23): `D = (1,1)` \u2192 diagonal down\u2011right.\n\nThese recolor 8\u2019s to 7\u2019s until they hit other non\u20118 cells.\n\n#### Color 9 block (r25\u201326, c1\u20132)\n\nGates:\n\n- (24,2) next to (25,2): `D = (-1,0)` \u2192 vertical up column 2, stopping one

model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_4_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. Each example contains colored 2x2 blocks surrounded by a border of 3s\n2. The 3-borders have \"gaps\" (positions where 3 should be but is 8 instead)\n3. From each gap, a line extends outward in the color of the inner block:\n   - **Edge gaps** (non-corner): produce straight lines perpendicular to that edge\n   - **Corner gaps**: produce diagonal lines (only when 2+ corners are gaps)\n4. The gap position itself gets filled with the block's color\n\nAnalyzing the test input blocks:\n- **Block 1 (2s)** at rows 5-6, cols 4-5: gaps at (4,4) top edge\u2192up, (5,3) left edge\u2192left, (7,6) corner\u2192diagonal\n- **Block 2 (4s)** at rows 5-6, cols 15-16: gaps at (4,14) corner\u2192diagonal, (5,17) right edge\u2192right, (7,15) bottom edge\u2192down\n- **Block 3 (6s)** at rows 14-15, cols 23-24: gaps at (13,23) top edge\u2192up, (13,25) & (16,25) corners\u2192diagonals\n- **Block 4 (7s)** at rows 20-21, cols 22-23: gap at (20,24) right edge\u2192right, (22,24) corner (only 1, no diagonal)\n- **Block 5 (9s)** at rows 25-26, cols 1-2: gap at (24,2) top edge\u2192up, (27,3) corner (only 1, no diagonal)\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      2,2,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"12\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_3_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nThe transformation in the solved examples takes the coloured 2\u00d72 blocks contained within patterns of 3s and lets their colour leak out through any adjacent background openings. For each such opening a straight ray of the inner colour is cast outwards, overwriting only 8s and 3s, and stopping before any other colour already present. Rays are cast in the eight compass directions according to which neighbouring cells are open.

From each non\u20113, non\u20118 cell you cast rays through adjacent background cells: straight rays through cardinal openings, and diagonal rays through corner openings (where both orthogonal neighbours are non\u2011background). A ray extends step by step through background cells, but it stops before an obstacle, leaving a gap of one cell between different colours.

These shapes are the 'objects' we need to figure out how to manipulate.\n\n2.  **Define the Objects**:\n    *   **Background:** Always teal (8).\n    *   **Sources**: The key objects are 4x4 squares. The color inside the square will dictate the transformation. There is a border of color 3 (green) and the core color.\n    *   **Examples:** We've been given some examples with specific source colors: maroon, blue, yellow, and magenta.\n\n3.  **Find the Transformation Rule**: It looks like the core color 'projects' lines outwards. The given description sounds good, but let's check it against the data.\n\n4.  **Verify/Refine Rule**:\n\n    *   **Red (2):** The description says it shoots horizontal lines.\n        *   After carefully looking at Example 3 (Red), I can confirm that it works. The top core row shoots right, and the bottom row shoots left.\n    *   **Yellow (4):** The description is vague. It says vertical up, horizontal inwards, and diagonal down-outwards.\n        *   I've gone deep here. I've re-examined Example 2 and 3 and the logic of where the lines start.\n        *   My revised hypothesis is this:\n            *   Horizontal \"Inwards\" line: From either Top OR Bottom (depending where the square is) but towards the center.\n            *   Vertical: Right core column always (relative).\n            *   Diagonal: Down-Right.\n    *   **Magenta (6):** The description is correct.\n        *   Looks like diagonal `/` through the core and vertical lines up from the left core.\n    *   **Orange (7):** Horizontal left from the top core is all.\n    *   **Maroon (9):** Diagonals \"Outwards\" and vertical full-height line \"Inwards.\"\n    *   **Blue (1):** \"Bent ray\". This also looks good.\n\n5.  **Refine Rules and Interactions**: It all comes down to interactions:\n    *   **Red vs Yellow:** The issue is when these lines collide. After really thinking, my final guess is that red overwrites yellow, based on Ex 3.\n    *   We also need to know the rule about: Does a line end when it hits an obstacle?\n\n6.  **Apply and Construct the Test Input**: Okay, let's now make the solution for the specific example given.\n\n7.  **Draw Squares** (Borders 3, Cores). Keep them.\n\n8.  **Apply Transformations**:\n\n    *   Maroon (Bottom-Left): Vertical Line.\n    *   Red (Top-Left): Shoot 2s horizontally.\n    *   Yellow (Top-Right):\n        *   Horizontal: Shoot 4s (but Red overwrites).\n        *   Vertical, Diagonal.\n    *   Magenta (Middle-Right): Vertical, Diagonal.\n    *   Orange (Bottom-Right): Shoot 7s horizontally.\n9. **Address the Conflicts:**\n\n    *   Red over Yellow.\n    *   Yellow diagonal, where does it end.\n    *   Yellow vertical.\n\n10. **Write the code output for the pattern**:\n\nThis will need to be made into actual code to solve the challenge. But it gets me the right pattern.\n\nI understand all the rules and will get the right output pattern.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the examples and the provided description, here is the solution:\n\n**1. Object Identification:**\nThe input contains several 4x4 squares, each with a specific \"core\" color surrounded by a border of color 3 (green).\n*   **Maroon (9) Square:** Rows 25-28, Cols 0-3. (Bottom-Left)\n*   **Red (2) Square:** Rows 5-8, Cols 4-7. (Top-Left)\n*   **Yellow (4) Square:** Rows 5-8, Cols 14-17. (Top-Middle/Right)\n*   **Magenta (6) Square:** Rows 14-17, Cols 22-25. (Middle-Right)\n*   **Orange (7) Square:** Rows 20-23, Cols 21-24. (Bottom-Right)\n\n**2. Transformation Rules Application:**\nThe transformations involve projecting lines from these squares onto the background (color 8). Source squares occlude projected lines (lines do not overwrite cores, but may overwrite borders if emitting from there).\n\n*   **Maroon (9):** Projects a full-height vertical line on the \"inward\" side, with a gap of 1 or 2 pixels. Based on Example 1 (Square cols 3-6, Line col 8), the line is at `Right_Border + 2`.\n    *   Square Cols 0-3 -> Line at Col 5.\n    *   **Interaction:** The line passes through the Red Square (Cols 4-7). The Red Square is a source, so it blocks the line. The line appears in rows 0-4 and 9-29.\n\n*   **Red (2):**\n    *   **Top Core Row (Row 6):** Horizontal line to the **Right**.\n        *   Path: Cols 8-29.\n        *   **Interaction:** Hits the Yellow Square (Cols 14-17). The line overwrites the border at Col 14 but is blocked by the core at Cols 15-16. It does not continue past the solid object.\n    *   **Bottom Core Row (Row 7):** Horizontal line to the **Left**.\n        *   Path: Cols 0-3.\n        *   **Interaction:** Hits the Maroon Square (Cols 0-3). Blocked by the source. (No visible line).\n\n*   **Yellow (4):**\n    *   **Horizontal:** Inwards. For a Right-side square (or right of center), this is Left.\n        *   Top Core Row (Row 6).\n        *   **Interaction:** Conflicts with Red's line. Based on Example 3 where Red (2) appeared to overwrite Yellow (4), we prioritize the Red line filling the space between the squares.\n    *   **Vertical:** Upwards. Based on pattern, likely from the **Right Core Column** (Col 16).\n        *   Path: Rows 0-5.\n    *   **Diagonal:** Down-Outwards. For a top-right square, this is **Down-Right**.\n        *   Starts near bottom-right corner. Let's map from Ex 2/3. Ex 2 (Left) was Down-Left. Ex 3 (Right, Bottom) was Up-Right. The pattern is \"Outwards vertically and horizontally\". Since this is at the Top, it goes Down. Since Right, it goes Right.\n        *   Path: Starts (8,17). Goes `\\` (9,18), (10,19)...\n        *   **Interaction:** Hits Magenta Square (Cols 22-25, Rows 14-17) at (14,23). (14,23) is a border, becomes 4. (15,24) is core, remains 6. (16,25) is border, becomes 4.\n\n*   **Magenta (6):**\n    *   **Vertical:** Up from **Left Core Column** (Col 23).\n        *   Path: Rows 0-14.\n    *   **Diagonal:** `/` (Positive slope) through the core.\n        *   Center approx (15.5, 23.5).\n        *   Up-Right: (14,24), (13,25)...\n        *   Down-Left: (17,21), (18,20), (19,19)...\n\n*   **Orange (7):**\n    *   **Horizontal:** Left from **Top Core Row** (Row 21).\n        *   Path: Cols 0-20.\n        *   **Interaction:** Crosses Maroon Line (Col 5). Vertical lines typically occlude horizontal/diagonal lines (based on Ex 1 Blue vs Maroon). So (21,5) remains 9.\n        *   **Interaction:** Crosses Magenta Diagonal at (21,17). Horizontal (later) likely overwrites Diagonal. So (21,17) becomes 7.\n\n**3.

\u201ccomposite squares\u201d.**\n\n   From the description and the examples, an emitter is a 2\u00d72 block of a non\u2011background, non\u2011border color inside a loose 3\u2011border. In the test grid these 2\u00d72 cores are:\n\n   - Red (2): rows 6\u20137, cols 5\u20136  \n   - Yellow (4): rows 6\u20137, cols 16\u201317  \n   - Magenta (6): rows 15\u201316, cols 24\u201325  \n   - Orange (7): rows 21\u201322, cols 23\u201324  \n   - Maroon (9): rows 26\u201327, cols 2\u20133  \n\n   Background is 8; 3 is used as border/structure and is not modified.\n\n2. **General projection conventions I used**\n\n   - Rays are cast only into the **background**: a cell is recolored only if its original value is 8.\n   - I treat rays from different emitters as if they are computed independently on the **original** grid. If several rays want to color the same 8\u2011cell, I conceptually could break ties (e.g. by color priority), but in this test configuration there is only one conflict (between colors 2 and 6) which I resolve explicitly below.\n   - Rays do **not overwrite non\u20118** cells and do **not pass through them**: when stepping along a ray, if the next cell is non\u20118 in the original grid, I stop the ray before that cell (I may \u201cskip\u201d over 3\u2011border cells in some patterns only where stated, but I never recolor them).\n\n3. **Concrete ray patterns per color (as I applied them here)**\n\n   I used the textual description as the template, simplified slightly where examples allowed ambiguity:\n\n   **(a) Red (2): horizontal from top and bottom**\n\n   Emitter: top-left `(r,c) = (6,5)` (so core at rows 6\u20137, cols 5\u20136).\n\n   - **Top row (row 6) \u2013 rightward ray:**\n\n     From the top\u2011right core cell (6,6), go right across row 6, *ignoring* any non\u20118 cells but only recoloring 8\u2019s:\n\n     - Original row 6 has a 3 at col 7, then 8\u2019s from cols 8\u201330.\n     - So new 2\u2019s at: row 6, cols 8\u201330.\n\n   - **Bottom row (row 7) \u2013 leftward ray:**\n\n     From the bottom\u2011left core cell (7,5), go left across row 7, similarly recoloring only 8\u2019s:\n\n     - At col 4 there is a 3 (border), so I skip it and continue.\n     - Cols 3,2,1 are 8\u2019s and become 2.\n\n     New 2\u2019s at: row 7, cols 1\u20133.\n\n   (No diagonal ray for 2 in this test; I restrict 2 to the horizontal pattern.)\n\n   **(b) Yellow (4): vertical up + horizontal inwards + diagonal down\u2011outwards**\n\n   Emitter: core at rows 6\u20137, cols 16\u201317 (top-left `(r,c) = (6,16)`).\n\n   The textual pattern says: vertical up, horizontal inwards and a diagonal down\u2011outwards. In the test grid the 4\u2011core is tightly enclosed by 3\u2019s on its \u201cinward\u201d side so every potential ray is immediately blocked by non\u20118 cells:\n\n   - Vertical from top\u2011right (6,17) upwards hits a 3 at (5,17) right away \u2192 **no vertical 4s**.\n   - Horizontal inwards (towards the center of the grid) from row 7 meets a 3 at (7,15) on the first step \u2192 **no horizontal 4s**.\n   - Diagonal down\u2011outwards from (6,17) first steps into (7,18) which is 3 \u2192 **no diagonal 4s**.\n\n   So in this test, the yellow emitter produces **no additional 4s beyond the 2\u00d72 core**.\n\n   **(c) Magenta (6): vertical up from left border + \u201c/\u201d diagonal through core**\n\n   Emitter: core at rows 15\u201316, cols 24\u201325 (top-left `(r,c) = (15,24)`).\n\n   - **Vertical up from the left border:**\n\n     From the top\u2011left core cell (15,24) step upwards in column 24, recoloring 8\u2019s until the top:\n\n     Original column 24 rows 1\u201314 are all 8.\n\n     \u2192 New 6\u2019s at: (1\u201314, 24).\n\n   - **Positive\u2011slope (`/`) diagonal through the core:**\n\n     Implemented as:\n     - from the top\u2011right core cell (15,25) step up\u2011right (\u22121,+1) until boundary or blocked,\n     - from the bottom\u2011left core cell (16,24) step down\u2011left (+1,\u22121).\n\n     Up\u2011right from (15,25): all intermediate cells are 8 until the edge:\n     - (14,26), (13,27), (12,28), (11,29), (10,30) \u2192 all become 6.\n\n     Down\u2011left from (16,24): the first cell (17,23) is a 3 (part of the 3\u2011structure) so that branch is blocked, producing no new 6\u2019s there.\n\n   So 6 introduces:\n   - Column\u201124 vertical 6\u2019s at rows 1\u201314;\n   - Diagonal 6\u2019s at (14,26), (13,27), (12,28), (11,29), (10,30).\n\n   Note that at (6,24) this vertical 6 ray collides with the red 2\u2019s horizontal ray; since both would recolor an 8, I choose the higher \u201cintensity\u201d 6 to win there.\n\n   **(d) Orange (7): horizontal left**\n\n   Emitter: core at rows 21\u201322, cols 23\u201324 (top-left `(r,c) = (21,23)`).\n\n   The rule is: from the top row of the 7\u2011core cast a horizontal line to the left, stopping at non\u20118.\n\n   - From (21,23) leftwards:\n     - (21,22) is 3 (border) immediately, so the ray is blocked.\n\n   Thus no new 7\u2019s beyond the 2\u00d72 core in this test.\n\n   **(e) Maroon (9): diagonals + inward vertical**\n\n   Emitter: core at rows 26\u201327, cols 2\u20133 (top-left `(r,c) = (26,2)`).\n\n   I treated it as:\n\n   - **Vertical line on the inward side:**\n\n     The grid is 30\u00d730, center column is 15.5; the emitter\u2019s center column is 2.5, so \u201cinward\u201d is to the right.\n\n     I approximate \u201cadjacent inward\u201d as the column just to the right of the whole 4\u00d74 composite square. The 4\u00d74 span is cols 1\u20134, so the inward\u2011adjacent column is col 5. I draw a full\u2011height vertical 9 line there, recoloring every original 8 in column 5:\n\n     - Column 5 has non\u20118 (2 or 3) at rows 6,7,8; all other rows have 8.\n     - So new 9\u2019s at column 5 for rows: 1\u20135 and 9\u201330.\n\n   - **Outward diagonals from the outer corners of the 4\u00d74:**\n\n     Bounding 4\u00d74 rows = 25\u201328, cols = 1\u20134; corners:\n\n     - TL = (25,1): already 3 \u2192 no change.\n     - TR = (25,4): stepping up\u2011right immediately hits a 3 at (25,4) or is blocked by that same corner being non\u20118 \u2192 no new 9\u2019s.\n     - BL = (28,1): 3 \u2192 no change.\n     - BR = (28,4): 8, and we step down\u2011right:\n\n       - (28,4) (corner itself) 8\u21929  \n       - (29,5) 8\u21929  \n       - (30,6) 8\u21929  \n\n       Next step is out of bounds.\n\n     So diagonals add 9\u2019s at (28,4), (29,5) and (30,6); (29,5) happens also to lie on the vertical 9 line, but it\u2019s the same color anyway.\n\n4. **Apply all modifications and resolve the one overlap**\n\n   Starting from the original grid, I apply:\n\n   - All the red 2 projections (row 6 col 8\u201330, row 7 col 1\u20133);\n   - All magenta 6 projections (column 24 rows 1\u201314, plus the diagonal cells);\n   - All maroon 9 projections (column 5 except at rows 6\u20138, and the three diagonal cells);\n   - Yellow 4 and orange 7 emitters add no extra cells in this test because they\u2019re fully blocked by 3\u2019s in every projected direction.\n\n   The only shared target is (6,24), where both 2 and 6 want to recolor an 8;

The user wants me to solve an ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) task. I'll break this down methodically. First, I need to understand the rules. From the examples and the description, it's clear there are structures, most likely 4x4 squares, with a border (green, color 3) and a center (fill color). Crucially, there are \"gaps\" in these borders, where the background color (teal, color 8) is visible. The transformation involves filling those gaps with a line of the center color, extending in a specific direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonal) until the grid edge. That seems straightforward enough.\n\nNow, I'll use the first example to solidify my understanding. I'm focusing on the top-right frame (yellow center, orange border). I noticed some inconsistencies with the example grid. But after meticulously counting and re-reading, it becomes clear. The gap locations are key; they determine the direction of the extending lines. This confirms that corner gaps lead to diagonal lines, and edge gaps result in straight ones. Example 1 is about to be very helpful for the test cases.\n\nThe next step is to strategize for the test input. It's a 30x30 grid, so I need an efficient approach. I'll read the grid and identify the 4x4 structures by finding the fill color that is inside the frames. Border cells are identified around the fill color's 2x2 area. I will process each frame, pinpointing the gaps in the border and determining the line directions for each. Then, it is just a matter of executing that logic.\n\nI'm now diving into the actual test input. I'm carefully scanning the grid and identifying each 4x4 frame. Each fill color is now known, along with the gap locations in the border. I now have identified the five frames in the test input. With all the coordinates identified, I'm now ready to start drawing the lines.\n\nAs I'm drawing the lines, I need to be careful. I have to make sure I'm writing the correct fill color and extending in the correct directions. The input background should stay the same. I then need to handle line intersections. I need to handle any collisions or overlaps. I need to make sure one \"wins\". I will analyze example grids to determine precedence. The direction or scan order needs to be verified. The later line should overwrite.\n\nI've carefully analyzed each intersection. The priority logic has been identified. It's time to construct the output grid based on all my previous analyses and reasoning. I'm proceeding systematically. The key is in those precise coordinates. I will follow each of the steps to ensure that the output is flawless. I need to make sure the process is correct. I have to handle line-frame collisions. I need to keep those borders intact.\n\nAll of my calculations are in place now. I can now verify the output one final time to be ready.\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to apply the transformation rules inferred from the examples to the test input.\n\n### Analysis of the Task\nThe task involves identifying \"framed structures\" and their associated \"gaps\" to project lines across the grid.\n\n1.  **Objects:**\n    *   **Background:** Color 8.\n    *   **Frames:** Approximately 4x4 structures with a border of color 3. Inside is a 2x2 region of a unique \"fill color\" (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9).\n    *   **Gaps:** The green (3) border is not continuous; there are specific positions where the border is missing (showing background 8).\n\n2.  **Transformation Rules:**\n    *   **Edge Gaps:** If a gap is on the top, bottom, left, or right edge of the frame, fill the gap with the interior color and extend a line perpendicularly (Up, Down, Left, Right) to the grid boundary.\n    *   **Corner Gaps:** If a gap is on a corner of the frame, fill the gap with the interior color and extend a line diagonally (Up-Left, Up-Right, Down-Left, Down-Right) to the grid boundary.\n    *   **Order/Priority:** Original frames are preserved. Where lines intersect, the logic implies a layering order (likely top-to-bottom or frame ID order), but generally, later/lower frames overwrite earlier/higher ones if lines collide.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution on Test Input\n\n**1. Identify Frames:**\nWe scan the grid for 2x2 regions of colors other than 3 and 8.\n\n*   **Frame 1 (Color 2):** Center at rows 5-6, cols 4-5.\n    *   Bounds: Rows 4-7, Cols 3-6.\n    *   **Gaps:**\n        *   Top Edge at (4, 4). Action: Line **UP**.\n        *   Left Edge at (5, 3). Action: Line **LEFT**.\n        *   Bottom-Right Corner at (7, 6). Action: Line **DOWN-RIGHT**.\n\n*   **Frame 2 (Color 4):** Center at rows 5-6, cols 15-16.\n    *   Bounds: Rows 4-7, Cols 14-17.\n    *   **Gaps:**\n        *   Top-Left Corner at (4, 14). Action: Line **UP-LEFT**.\n        *   Bottom Edge at (7, 15). Action: Line **DOWN**.\n        *   Right Edge at (5, 17). Action: Line **RIGHT**.\n\n*   **Frame 3 (Color 6):** Center at rows 14-15, cols 23-24.\n    *   Bounds: Rows 13-16, Cols 22-25.\n    *   **Gaps:**\n        *   Top Edge at (13, 23). Action: Line **UP**.\n        *   Top-Right Corner at (13, 25). Action: Line **UP-RIGHT**.\n        *   Bottom-Right Corner at (16, 25). Action: Line **DOWN-RIGHT**.\n\n*   **Frame 4 (Color 7):** Center at rows 20-21, cols 22-23.\n    *   Bounds: Rows 19-22, Cols 21-24.\n    *   **Gaps:**\n        *   Right Edge at (20, 24). Action: Line **RIGHT**.\n        *   Bottom-Right Corner at (22, 24). Action: Line **DOWN-RIGHT**.\n\n*   **Frame 5 (Color 9):** Center at rows 25-26, cols 1-2.\n    *   Bounds: Rows 24-27, Cols 0-3.\n    *   **Gaps:**\n        *   Top Edge at (24, 2). Action: Line **UP**.\n        *   Bottom-Right Corner at (27, 3). Action: Line **DOWN-RIGHT**.\n\n**2. Draw Lines & Handle Collisions:**\nWe draw the lines on the grid. Frames (color 3 borders and interior colors) are preserved. Lines overwrite the background (8) and each other based on frame order (reading order: Frame 1 to 5).\n\n*   **Line Collisions:**\n    *   (5, 2): Frame 1 (Left) vs Frame 5 (Up). Frame 5 is processed later. **Value: 9**.\n    *   (5, 23): Frame 2 (Right) vs Frame 3 (Up). Frame 3 is processed later. **Value: 6**.\n    *   (16, 15): Frame 1 (Diagonal DR) vs Frame 2 (Down). Frame 2 is processed later (or covers vertical over diagonal). **Value: 4**.\n    *   (20, 29): Frame 3 (Diagonal DR) vs Frame 4 (Right).

The transformation:\n\n1. For each 2\u00d72 solid block of the same non\u20113, non\u20118 color \\(c\\), treat it as the interior of a 4\u00d74 frame: one cell of 3s (or intended 3s) in every direction around it (top, bottom, left, right, and the four corners).\n2. Wherever a frame cell in that 4\u00d74 ring is missing (i.e. it is background 8 instead of 3), this is a \u201cgap\u201d.\n3. For each gap:\n   - Recolor the gap cell to the interior color \\(c\\).\n   - Extend a straight line of color \\(c\\) from the gap, going *away* from the interior:\n     - Top edge gap \u2192 line goes straight up.\n     - Bottom edge gap \u2192 line goes straight down.\n     - Left edge gap \u2192 line goes left.\n     - Right edge gap \u2192 line goes right.\n     - Corner gaps:\n       - Top\u2011left \u2192 up\u2011left diagonal.\n       - Top\u2011right \u2192 up\u2011right diagonal.\n       - Bottom\u2011left \u2192 down\u2011left diagonal.\n       - Bottom\u2011right \u2192 down\u2011right diagonal.\n   - While extending, recolor only background 8s; stop when you hit any non\u20118 or the grid boundary.\n4. Repeat for all such framed 2\u00d72 interiors. Original non\u20118 cells (3s, interiors, or previously drawn lines) are never overwritten.\n\nIn the test grid there are five such interiors:\n- Color 2 at rows 5\u20136, cols 4\u20135.\n- Color 4 at rows 5\u20136, cols 15\u201316.\n- Color 6 at rows 14\u201315, cols 23\u201324.\n- Color 7 at rows 20\u201321, cols 22\u201323.\n- Color 9 at rows 25\u201326, cols 1\u20132.\n\nApplying the above rules to each of these structures (and letting existing non\u20118 cells block further extension) gives the following output grid.\n\nFinal output grid:\n\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n

2\u00d72 interior of some colour (not 8 or 3) surrounded by a border of 3\u2019s, but with some border cells missing (left as 8). For each missing border cell you fill that cell with the interior colour and then draw a straight line of that colour away from the interior: straight up for a gap on the top edge, down for bottom edge, left or right for side gaps, and diagonally for a missing corner.

I start by observing that most of the grid is filled with the background color 8, and objects are small, self-contained structures with a core color and a green border.  The border isn't always complete, sometimes with missing corners or sides. The core is usually a 2x2 square.\n\nAfter examining the provided examples, I hypothesize that the direction of the \"beams\" is determined by gaps in the green border surrounding the core. Specifically, I'm thinking about how missing border sections (gaps) might correlate with the path of the beams. The basic pattern seems to be that if there is a gap, there is a beam of the color out of that edge.\n\nI analyze the objects in detail, examining their core and border.  I carefully trace the values in the grid, specifically looking for the presence or absence of green border pixels surrounding each core.  I also look at the outputs from the example to get how the beams will behave.\n\nI see that for Red (2), Magenta (6), Maroon (9), Orange (7) follow a simple rule: a gap in the side of a border will emit a beam in the straight direction, and a gap in a corner of the border will emit a diagonal beam. I get confirmation of that rule with a test input.\n\nThe main challenge arises with Blue (1) and sometimes Yellow (4) where the \"gap\" rule seems to break. Blue's output is consistently orthogonal (straight lines) even when it has the gaps to create diagonals. It looks like with Blue (1) it emits orthogonal beams, no matter what shape. Yellow is more complicated; sometimes it follows the standard rule, but sometimes not, which I think is because of an interaction between the gap and the core. The Yellow exceptions might be specific to each case.\n\nFor the new test, I will implement a step-by-step approach. First, I identify each object's core. Second, for each object, I carefully check the border pixels surrounding the core for gaps. A gap means background pixels where a green pixel should be present. Third, based on the gap configuration, I predict the beam direction, using the standard rule (Side Gaps = Straight, Corner Gaps = Diagonal). Fourth, I draw beams of the corresponding core color from each core. I will resolve conflicts by giving diagonal > vertical > horizontal. This standard model is designed to correctly predict the behavior of the objects in the test case.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation follows a specific logic based on the \"Green (3) Border\" surrounding the core colored objects.\n\n**Rules inferred:**\n1.  **Object Structure:** Objects consist of a 2x2 \"core\" of a specific color (e.g., Red 2, Maroon 9, Magenta 6, etc.) surrounded by a ring of Green (3) pixels.\n2.  **Beams:** The objects emit \"beams\" of their core color into the background (8).\n3.  **Emission Logic (The \"Gap\" Rule):**\n    *   The Green border acts as a container/blocker.\n    *   Where there is a **gap** (an 8 instead of a 3) in the border, a beam escapes.\n    *   **Side Gaps:** If a gap appears on the North, South, East, or West side of the border (directly adjacent to the core faces), the beam shoots **Straight** (Orthogonal) in that direction.\n    *   **Corner Gaps:** If a gap appears at the NE, NW, SE, or SW corner of the border (diagonally adjacent to the core), the beam shoots **Diagonal** in that direction.\n4.  **Exceptions/Nuances:**\n    *   In Example 1, Blue (1) corners produced straight lines, suggesting a rotation for that specific color/case, but the majority of evidence (Maroon, Red, Magenta, Orange, Yellow Ex 2/3) supports the Standard Model described above.

First, I need to understand what's going on with the inputs. It's a grid of numbers 0-9, and the background is always the most frequent number, usually 8. There are these square-ish \"objects\" with a central color and a green border (color 3).\n\nI start by looking at a bunch of examples and try to make some sense out of this. I focus on how the green border interacts with these object cores. It's clear that the direction lines get launched from an object is related to gaps in the green border.\n\nMy initial thought is that if there is a gap, then launch the corresponding line. But that is clearly not correct.\n\nI need to nail down the precise rule. It turns out that I have to think about the individual pixels of each object and check each direction for green pixels. I'm focusing on the pixels that are on the border of the 2x2 core.\n\nIf a cardinal direction (up, down, left, right) is *not* blocked by green, I launch a line in that direction. If a cardinal direction is blocked, but the diagonal is not, I launch a line diagonally. And if everything is blocked, no line.\n\nSo, the rule has two parts. I check the cardinal neighbors first. If both are blocked, I check the diagonal.\n\nSo, for each 2x2 core, I check all four of the \"outer\" pixels. For each pixel, if its outside neighbor is not green (and within bounds), then draw a line in that direction. If it is green, I check the corresponding corner. If the corner is not green, I draw a diagonal line.\n\nNow, let's make sure this works across a bunch of examples and it looks like it works. I test it with the more examples.\n\nNow, I'm ready to write a program to apply it to the problem. I need to get the objects and their green borders.\n\nNow, let's look at this test case the user has given me, it's a 30x30 grid.\n\nI analyze the test input and find all the cores. I have to trace through to make sure I am finding the core. So I do that for each core. Now I will build my line launcher for each object.\n\nI construct each line.\n\nI also have to manage intersections and overlapping. It looks like the most recent object overwrites.\n\nNow, I'm ready to produce the output. I will build an image one line and write it out. Now I can show the user the result.\n\nAfter double checking each row, the output should be right. The output is ready and I'm ready to provide the results to the user.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation follows a consistent set of rules involving \"emitters\" and \"blockers\".\n\n**The Logic:**\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all 2x2 squares of a uniform, non-background color (the \"core\"). These cores are typically surrounded by a border of green (`3`) pixels, but the border might have gaps or be completely missing in some directions.\n2.  **Evaluate Emission for Each Pixel:** For each of the four pixels in a 2x2 core, check its outward-facing neighbors to determine if a line should be drawn.\n    *   **Cardinal Check:** For each pixel, check the two primary cardinal directions pointing away from the center of the 2x2 core.\n        *   *Top-Left Pixel:* Check **Up** and **Left**.\n        *   *Top-Right Pixel:* Check **Up** and **Right**.\n        *   *Bottom-Left Pixel:* Check **Down** and **Left**.\n        *   *Bottom-Right Pixel:* Check **Down** and **Right**.\n        *   **Rule:** If a cardinal neighbor is **not** a green (`3`) pixel (it is usually background `8`), emit a line of the core's color in that direction.\n    *   **Diagonal Check:** If **both** cardinal neighbors for a specific pixel are green (`3`) (blocked), then check the diagonal neighbor in that corner's direction.\n        *   *Top-Left Pixel:* Check **Up-Left**.\n        *   *Top-Right Pixel:* Check **Up-Right**.\n        *   *Bottom-Left Pixel:* Check **Down-Left**.\n        *   *Bottom-Right Pixel:* Check **Down-Right**.\n        *   **Rule:** If the diagonal neighbor is **not** a green (`3`) pixel, emit a diagonal line of the core's color in that direction.\n3.  **Drawing Lines:**\n    *   Lines extend from the neighbor cell until they hit the edge of the grid.\n    *   Lines are drawn on top of the background.\n    *   Where lines intersect, the object that appears later (reading order Top-to-Bottom, Left-to-Right) or has a higher index seems to overwrite the previous one. Based on the logic derived, we will assume standard overwriting.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Red Object (Color 2)** at Rows 5-6, Cols 4-5.\n    *   **Top-Left (5,4):** Up (4,4) is `8` (Open) $\\rightarrow$ Draw **UP**.

Interpreting the examples\n\nFrom the four training pairs (and the sketch) I treated the structures as:\n\n* Background: color `8`.\n* Frames: color `3`, forming \u201ccages\u201d around 2\u00d72 inner blocks.\n* Inner blocks: colors such as `2,4,6,7,9,1` etc.\n\nThe visible behavior in the simpler examples (2 and 4) can be summarised as:\n\n1. For each 2\u00d72 inner block, look at all cells with color `8` that are immediately adjacent (4- or 8-neighbourhood) to at least one inner cell **and** also touch at least one frame cell `3`.  \n   These `8` cells are \u201cports\u201d where a wire of the inner colour can exit the frame.\n\n2. For each port, select a corresponding inner cell and a direction vector from inner cell to port:\n   * If there is a choice (several inner cells touching the same port), prefer a **cardinal** direction (N, S, E, W) over a diagonal one.\n   * Otherwise, take the single available direction.\n\n3. From the chosen inner cell, extend a straight ray in that direction:\n   * Recolour each background cell `8` along that line with the inner colour.\n   * Stop just **before** you would step outside the grid or onto a non\u2011`8` cell (frame, original inner cell of another object, or a wire drawn earlier).\n\n4. Process the islands one by one; already\u2011drawn wires act as obstacles for later ones.\n\nThis rule exactly reproduces the wiring behavior for examples 2 and 4, and gives a consistent interpretation for how rays are anchored in all examples; I then applied it to the test.\n\nFor the test grid there are five inner islands:\n\n* `2` at rows 5\u20136, cols 4\u20135\n* `4` at rows 5\u20136, cols 15\u201316\n* `6` at rows 15\u201316, cols 23\u201324\n* `7` at rows 21\u201322, cols 22\u201323\n* `9` at rows 26\u201327, cols 1\u20132\n\nBelow I describe how I applied the rule island by island.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Applying the rule to the test input\n\n#### 2.1 Island colour 2 (rows 5\u20136, cols 4\u20135)\n\nInner cells: (5,4), (5,5), (6,4), (6,5).\n\nPorts (8-cells touching both inner and a `3`):\n\n* (4,4) \u2014 above (5,4); direction from inner: up `(-1,0)`\n* (5,3) \u2014 left of (5,4); direction: left `(0,-1)`\n* (7,6) \u2014 diagonal from (6,5); direction: down-right `(1,1)`\n\nRays:\n\n* Up from (5,4): to (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4).\n* Left from (5,4): to (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (5,0).\n* Diagonal SE from (6,5):  \n  (7,6), (8,7), (9,8), (10,9), (11,10), (12,11), (13,12), (14,13), (15,14), (16,15), (17,16), (18,17), (19,18), (20,19), (21,20);  \n  stop before (22,21) which is a frame `3`.\n\nAll these cells were `8`, so they are recoloured to `2`.\n\n#### 2.2 Island colour 4 (rows 5\u20136, cols 15\u201316)\n\nInner cells: (5,15), (5,16), (6,15), (6,16).\n\nPorts:\n\n* (4,14) \u2014 diagonal from (5,15); dir `(-1,-1)`\n* (5,17) \u2014 right of (5,16); dir `(0,1)`\n* (7,15) \u2014 below (6,15); dir `(1,0)`\n\nRays:\n\n* NW from (5,15): (4,14), (3,13), (2,12), (1,11), (0,10).\n* East from (5,16): fills row 5 from col 17 through col 29.\n* South from (6,15): straight down column 15, but stopped when a non\u20118 was encountered:\n  * It runs from row 7 through row 15 at column 15.\n  * At row 16, column 15 is already occupied by the diagonal `2` wire; so the 4-wire stops at row 15.\n\nAll recoloured to `4`.\n\n#### 2.3 Island colour 6 (rows 15\u201316, cols 23\u201324)\n\nInner cells: (15,23), (15,24), (16,23), (16,24).\n\nPorts (cardinal ones preferred):\n\n* (14,23) \u2014 above (15,23); dir `(-1,0)`\n* (16,25) \u2014 right of (16,24); dir `(0,1)`\n* (17,25) \u2014 diagonal from (16,24); dir `(1,1)`\n\nRays:\n\n* Up from (15,23):\n  * Column 23: rows 14 down to 6.  \n    Stops at row 5 because (5,23) is already occupied by the horizontal `4` wire.\n* East from (16,24):\n  * Row 16, columns 25 to 29.\n* Diagonal SE from (16,24):\n  * (17,25), (18,26), (19,27), (20,28), (21,29).\n\nThese are coloured `6`.\n\n#### 2.4 Island colour 7 (rows 21\u201322, cols 22\u201323)\n\nInner cells: (21,22), (21,23), (22,22), (22,23).\n\nPorts:\n\n* (21,24) \u2014 right of (21,23); dir `(0,1)`\n* (23,24) \u2014 diagonal from (22,23); dir `(1,1)`\n\nRays:\n\n* East from (21,23):\n  * Row 21, columns 24\u201328.\n  * At column 29 there is already a `6` from the preceding island, so the ray stops at 28.\n* Diagonal SE from (22,23):\n  * (23,24), (24,25), (25,26), (26,27), (27,28), (28,29).\n\nThese cells are recoloured to `7`.\n\n#### 2.5 Island colour 9 (rows 26\u201327, cols 1\u20132)\n\nInner cells: (26,1), (26,2), (27,1), (27,2).\n\nPorts:\n\n* (25,2) \u2014 above (26,2); dir `(-1,0)`\n* (28,3) \u2014 diagonal from (27,2); dir `(1,1)`\n\nRays:\n\n* Up from (26,2):\n  * Column 2: rows 25 up to 6.  \n    Stops before row 5, column 2, because that cell is already `2` (from the left wire of the `2` island).\n* Diagonal SE from (27,2): (28,3), (29,4).\n\nAll recoloured to `9`.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

model_id=\"gpt-5.1-high_8_step_5_image\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Objects.**  \n   In every example the non\u2011background (non\u20118) cells form small \u201cblocks\u201d:\n   a 2\u00d72 solid core of some color `X` surrounded (partially) by a border of color `3`.  \n   Examples:\n   - Example 4: 2\u00d72 of `6` inside a ring of `3`.\n   - Example 2: 2\u00d72 of `4` inside `3`s.\n   - Example 3: cores of `2`, `4`, `7`.\n   - Example 1: cores of `9`, `1`, `4`, `6`.\n\n2. **Finding exits (gaps) around each object.**  \n   Around each 2\u00d72 core, consider the 4\u00d74 window that contains the core plus a one\u2011cell margin.  \n   Inside that window, cells of value `3` are the frame; cells of value `8` that are adjacent (in 8\u2011neighborhood) to at least one core cell are *gaps* where the frame is missing.\n\n   Example mappings:\n   - Example 4 (core `6`): 4\u00d74 pattern has `8` at positions above the top\u2011left, above the top\u2011right and below\u2011left; giving three gaps and thus three exits (up, up\u2011right, down\u2011left).\n   - Example 2 (core `4`): gaps above top\u2011right, to the right of bottom\u2011right, and below\u2011left of bottom\u2011left; exits go up, right, and down\u2011left.\n\n   Each gap is assigned to the adjacent core cell that touches it; if more than one core cell touches, prefer orthogonal adjacency over diagonal.\n\n3. **Drawing rays from each exit.**  \n   For every gap `g` attached to a core cell `c`:\n   - Let the direction vector `d = (dr, dc)` be `sign(g.r \u2212 c.r), sign(g.c \u2212 c.c)`; each component is in `{-1, 0, 1}`.\n   - Starting from the core cell `c`, step repeatedly by `d`:\n     - color every visited cell with the core color `X` **while** that cell is background `8` or already `X`;\n     - stop when stepping out of the grid or when the next cell is *not* `8`/`X` (i.e. you hit any existing structure).\n\n   Thus each gap produces a straight ray (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) of color `X` going away from the object.  \n   In Example 2 and 4 this exactly reproduces the three arms from the respective cores.  \n   In Example 1 and 3 the same rule applied to the different gap patterns gives the observed crosses and L\u2011shaped collections of straight rays.\n\n4. **Order of processing objects.**  \n   When two objects could send rays through the same background cell, we need an order so later rays see earlier rays as obstacles.  \n   Looking at Example 3, the `4`\u2011object\u2019s vertical ray blocks the `2`\u2011object\u2019s horizontal ray (which stops one cell before it would otherwise intersect), which is consistent if objects with *higher core color* are processed first.\n\n   So:\n   - Sort all objects by their core color in descending numeric order.\n   - Process them in that order, using the *current* grid as the obstacle map.\n\n5. **Apply to the test input.**\n\n   First detect all 2\u00d72 cores with surrounding `3`s:\n\n   - **Object E (color 9)** at rows 26\u201327, cols 1\u20132.\n   - **Object D (color 7)** at rows 20\u201321, cols 22\u201323.\n   - **Object C (color 6)** at rows 14\u201315, cols 23\u201324.\n   - **Object B (color 4)** at rows 5\u20136,  cols 15\u201316.\n   - **Object A (color 2)** at rows 5\u20136,  cols 4\u20135.\n\n   Process them in order: 9, 7, 6, 4, 2.\n\n   For each object we build its 4\u00d74 window, find 8\u2011valued neighbors of the core (gaps), assign each gap to the closest core cell (orth adjacency preferred), compute the direction, and then trace rays, stopping when we encounter any non\u20118 cell created earlier.\n\n   The resulting rays are:\n\n   - **Object 9 (E):**\n     - Gap above the top\u2011right core cell \u2192 vertical ray of `9` up column 2 from row 26 to row 0.\n     - Gap down\u2011right of the bottom\u2011right core cell \u2192 diagonal ray `9` from (27,2) \u2192 (28,3) \u2192 (29,4).\n\n   - **Object 7 (D):**\n     - Gap to right of the top\u2011right \u2192 horizontal ray `7` along row 20 from col 23 to 29.\n     - Gap down\u2011right of bottom\u2011right \u2192 diagonal ray `7` from (21,23) to (27,29).\n\n   - **Object 6 (C):**\n     - Gap above top\u2011left \u2192 vertical ray `6` up column 23 from row 14 to row 0.\n     - Gap above\u2011right of top\u2011right \u2192 diagonal NE ray `6` from (14,24) to (9,29).\n     - Gap down\u2011right of bottom\u2011right \u2192 diagonal SE ray `6` from (15,24) to (19,28), stopping before the `7` at (20,29).\n\n   - **Object 4 (B):**\n     - Gap up\u2011left of top\u2011left \u2192 diagonal NW ray `4` from (5,15) to (0,10).\n     - Gap to right of top\u2011right \u2192 horizontal ray `4` along row 5 from col 16 to col 22, stopping at col 22 because col 23 already holds `6`.\n     - Gap below top\u2011left (i.e. under bottom\u2011left) \u2192 vertical ray `4` down column 15 from row 6 to row 29.\n\n   - **Object 2 (A):**\n     - Gap above top\u2011left \u2192 vertical ray `2` up column 4 from row 5 to row 0.\n     - Gap left of top\u2011left \u2192 horizontal ray `2` along row 5 from col 4 leftwards, stopping at col 3 because col 2 is `9`.\n     - Gap down\u2011right of bottom\u2011right \u2192 diagonal SE ray `2` from (6,5) up to (11,10), stopping when it encounters the `3` of the central structure.\n\n   Overlaying these rays on the original grid yields the final output below.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n\nRow 0  \n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 1

The Task at Hand: Decoding the ARC Mystery**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this ARC task. The goal, as I understand it, is to figure out the underlying logic governing these visual transformations. The user has presented me with several examples, and my initial approach is to systematically analyze them to find patterns.\n\n**2. A Deep Dive into Example 1: The Building Blocks**\n\nExample 1 is where it all starts. There's this large grid, mostly filled with a teal color (8s in the text), and within it, several smaller, structured regions. These small structures are the key. They usually consist of a border and an inner color. The initial thought is that the goal of this transformation is to move the objects and color them. But after closer inspection, it's not so simple.\n\nThe outputs are, at first glance, a bit perplexing. It's like these inner structures have \"projected\" upwards, but not quite vertically. The color transitions are not as expected and something's clearly going on with the border colors. I note that the *inner* colors seem to be the primary driving force in the output. The inner color of these small structures is always the same as the \"projected\" color.\n\n**3. The Diagonal Projection Hypothesis: A Breakthrough**\n\nThen it hits me: *diagonal* beams! The output isn't about vertical or horizontal movement. Instead, it seems like each inner color \"shoots\" a diagonal beam starting at a certain border position. I trace the output and see if this is true. This theory starts to fall into place. It's not the entire structure moving. It's the inner color that's the starting point for diagonal beams.\n\n**4. The Key: Where Do the Beams Originate? The \"Hole\" Theory**\n\nThis \"beam\" idea is promising, but where exactly do these beams originate? Examining the borders of the small shapes, I notice these are not perfect. There are often missing border pixels (denoted as 8s). These \"missing\" pixels, or holes, are the key!\n\nThe Hypothesis: Beams are emitted from specific locations in the border of the inner shape. I've developed a set of rules for the specific beam positions. Corners create diagonals, and the edges create straight lines. Furthermore, they are based on the non-three color in the shape.\n\n**5. Refining the Physics: Beam Interactions**\n\nNow, things get a bit more complex. What happens when two beams collide? Or when a diagonal beam gets blocked? The answer is simple: they *merge*! Two diagonals become a vertical beam! This explains the output of the first example. They create a vertical track.\n\n**6. Testing and Validation: The Other Examples**\n\nI test my new physics model against the other examples provided. The hole theory and direction is holding up pretty nicely with different colored objects. They also create a similar structure, and by tracing their coordinates, I notice that the pattern is consistent.\n\n**7. Building the Rules: A Summary**\n\nThe summary is this: 1. Identify objects. 2. Identify the holes in borders. 3. Emit beams with the color. 4. Simulate. If two beams interact, combine. If a hole exists at a corner, make it diagonal. If at the edge, cardinal. The theory has been validated using the output examples provided.\n\n**8. Testing: The New Puzzle**\n\nThe task includes new data. It's a new 30x30 test grid. The task is to apply these physics and render them to get an output. Based on the previous rules, I have to draw beams from the relevant holes. This will involve working out:\n* Finding the beam origins (locations).\n* Determining beam directions.\n* Calculating beam paths.\n* Considering collisions and deflections.\n\n**9. Implementation Strategy**\n\nTo implement, I am going to:\n1.  **Analyze the test grid.** Identify each small structure (bounding box).\n2.  **Apply my rules to get a list of beams.** Compute the direction of each.\n3.  **Draw the beam paths.**\n4.  **Simulate and resolve collisions.** Where beams meet, calculate deflection.\n5.  **Output the final grid.** Fill the holes with the beam colors.\n\nI feel confident in my ability to generate a solution for the test grid. Let's start the final step!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid by identifying \"objects\" (boxes with a colored border and a different inner color) and projecting \"beams\" from them based on missing pixels in their borders (\"holes\").\n\n**1. Object and Hole Identification:**\nWe scan the grid for 4x4 structures. Each structure has a border color (usually 3) and an inner color. We identify \"holes\" where the border should be but is missing (value 8). The position of the hole determines the direction of the beam.\n*   **Edge Holes** (Top, Bottom, Left, Right) emit **Cardinal Beams** (North, South, West, East).\n*   **Corner Holes** (TL, TR, BL, BR) emit **Diagonal Beams** (NW, NE, SW, SE).\n*   **Beam Color** matches the **Inner Color** of the object.\n\n**2. Objects in Test Input:**\n*   **Object 1 (Red 2)**: Cols 3-6, Rows 4-7.\n    *   Hole (4,4) [Top Edge] $\\rightarrow$ **North** Beam.\n    *   Hole (5,3) [Left Edge] $\\rightarrow$ **West** Beam.\n    *   Hole (7,6) [BR Corner] $\\rightarrow$ **SE** Beam.\n*   **Object 2 (Yellow 4)**: Cols 15-18, Rows 4-7.\n    *   Hole (4,18) [TR Corner] $\\rightarrow$ **NE** Beam.\n    *   Hole (5,18) [Right Edge] $\\rightarrow$ **East** Beam.\n    *   Hole (7,16) [Bottom Edge] $\\rightarrow$ **South** Beam.\n*   **Object 3 (Magenta 6)**: Cols 22-25, Rows 13-16.\n    *   Hole (13,23) [Top Edge] $\\rightarrow$ **North** Beam.\n    *   Hole (13,25) [TR Corner] $\\rightarrow$ **NE** Beam.\n    *   Hole (16,25) [BR Corner] $\\rightarrow$ **SE** Beam.\n*   **Object 4 (Orange 7)**: Cols 21-24, Rows 19-22.\n    *   Hole (20,24) [Right Edge] $\\rightarrow$ **East** Beam.\n    *   Hole (22,24) [BR Corner] $\\rightarrow$ **SE** Beam.\n*   **Object 5 (Maroon 9)**: Cols 0-3, Rows 24-27.\n    *   Hole (24,2) [Top Edge] $\\rightarrow$ **North** Beam.\n    *   Hole (27,3) [BR Corner] $\\rightarrow$ **SE** Beam.\n\n**3. Interactions (Deflections):**\n*   **Red West + Maroon North**: Red West beam (Row 5) meets Maroon North beam (Col 2) at (5,2). They deflect NW.\n    *   Red turns NW starting (4,2).\n    *   Maroon turns NW starting (4,1).\n*   **Yellow East + Magenta North**: Yellow East beam (Row 5) meets Magenta North beam (Col 23) at (5,23). They deflect NE.\n    *   Yellow turns NE starting (4,23).\n    *   Magenta turns NE starting (4,24).\n*   **Red SE + Yellow South**: Red SE beam meets Yellow South beam (Col 16) at (17,16).\n    *   Red turns South to run parallel at (17,15).\n    *   Yellow continues South at (17,16).\n\n**4. Final Beam Paths:**\n*   **Red (2)**:\n    *   N: (3,4) to (0,4).\n    *   W$\\to$NW: Starts at hole (5,3), deflects at (5,2). Path: (4,2), (3,1), (2,0).\n    *   SE$\\to$S: Starts (7,6). Diagonal to (16,15). Turns South: (17,15) to (29,15).\n*   **Yellow (4)**:\n    *   NE: (3,19) to (0,22).\n    *   E$\\to$NE: Starts (5,18) to (5,22). Turns NE: (4,23) to (0,27).\n    *   S: Starts (7,16). South to (29,16).\n*   **Magenta (6)**:\n    *   N$\\to$NE: Starts (12,23) to (5,23).

Each pattern has a 3-bordered frame around a colored 2x2 interior\n2. Gaps (8s instead of 3s) in the border create lines that extend outward:\n   - Edge gaps (middle of sides) create straight lines perpendicular to that edge\n   - Corner gaps create diagonal lines extending outward\n3. The lines use the interior color and extend until hitting the grid boundary\n\n**Analyzing test input patterns:**\n\n- **Pattern 1 (color 2)** at rows 4-7, cols 3-6: Edge gaps at (4,4) top, (5,3) left; Corner gap at (7,6)\n- **Pattern 2 (color 4)** at rows 4-7, cols 14-17: Corner gap at (4,14); Edge gaps at (5,17) right, (7,15) bottom  \n- **Pattern 3 (color 6)** at rows 13-16, cols 22-25: Edge gap at (13,23) top; Corner gaps at (13,25), (16,25)\n- **Pattern 4 (color 7)** at rows 19-22, cols 21-24: Edge gap at (20,24) right; Corner gap at (22,24)\n- **Pattern 5 (color 9)** at rows 24-27, cols 0-3: Edge gap at (24,2) top;

Analyzing the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task, and my job is to figure out the pattern. The core of the issue seems to be understanding how colored shapes in the input grid translate into the output.\n\n**2. The Initial Observations**\n\nI quickly noticed that a dominant teal color (8) acts as the background. Then I saw shapes made of other colors, usually \"boxes\" or \"containers\" outlined in green (3), enclosing a core color.  I analyzed an example with four distinct objects, looking for a pattern.\n\n**3. The Shape Analysis**\n\nI looked closely at the shapes. It seemed like the shape and position, plus the color of those shapes, influenced the output. The green outlines weren't always neat rectangles, and their form seemed to matter. I focused in, trying to map the input's green outline shape with the direction and nature of output beams.\n\n**4. The Beam Hypothesis**\n\nI formed a hypothesis. The shapes of the green outline have a correlation with the direction and nature of the output \"beams\" of color. I suspected that the \"gaps\" or \"holes\" within the green outlines might be where the color \"leaks\" from the core. I kept digging into the inputs. I started to think of them like walls, and the core color as a light source emitting beams. \n\n**5. Refining the Rules**\n\nThe beams are blocked by green pixels. Then, I had a new, much stronger hypothesis: the green outline forms walls, the inner color is a source, and the color will propagate in straight lines. Beams interact!\n\n**6. Beam Interactions**\n\nI considered a rule. Rays travel until they collide. What happens when rays intersect?  I realized that two rays becoming parallel and turn vertical is likely a condition.\n\n**7. Test Input**\n\nMoving to the test input, I found a few shapes were the same, but the shapes were simpler.\nThe same pattern existed. I analyzed the rays and their properties from each shape.\nThe core of the issue was that I needed a better mechanism.\n\n**8. Putting it All Together**\n\nThe rules boiled down to this. The program:\n*   Identifies a *core* of color in the middle.\n*   The green outlines *walls* which create the *holes*.\n*   The rays *propagate* in all directions from the *core*, until it encounters an obstacle.\n*   If an output encounters other output, and if the path will cross, the paths take their respective directions.\n*   I considered many iterations of collision models, but these interactions became consistent with previous observations.\n\n**9. The Execution Plan**\n\nI formulated a plan. I began with the input, and then built a series of steps to apply the rule. With a plan and my model, I should solve this.\n\n\nThe logic for this task involves identifying \"colored cores\" enclosed within \"green walls\" and projecting \"rays\" of the core color outwards through any \"holes\" (gaps) in the walls.\n\n**1. Object Analysis:**\nWe identify five distinct objects in the test input based on the green (3) outlines and their colored interiors:\n*   **Object 1 (Red 2):** Located top-left (Rows 4-7, Cols 3-6). Core is Red (2).\n*   **Object 2 (Yellow 4):** Located top-middle (Rows 4-7, Cols 14-17). Core is Yellow (4).\n*   **Object 3 (Magenta 6):** Located middle-right (Rows 13-16, Cols 22-25). Core is Magenta (6).\n*   **Object 4 (Orange 7):** Located bottom-right (Rows 19-22, Cols 21-24). Core is Orange (7).\n*   **Object 5 (Maroon 9):** Located bottom-left (Rows 24-27, Cols 0-3). Core is Maroon (9).\n\n**2. Hole Identification & Ray Casting:**\nFor each object, we find gaps in the surrounding 8-neighbor boundary (the \"green wall\") relative to the core pixels. Rays are cast from the hole coordinate in the direction of the gap.\n\n*   **Object 1 (Red 2):**\n    *   **Top Hole:** at `(4,4)` (North). Projects a Vertical Ray upwards: `(3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4)`.\n    *   **Left Hole:** at `(5,3)` (West). Projects a Horizontal Ray leftwards: `(5,3)`. (Stops at `(5,2)` due to collision).\n\n*   **Object 2 (Yellow 4):**\n    *   **Top-Left Hole:** at `(4,14)` (North-West). Projects a Diagonal Ray NW: `(4,14), (3,13), (2,12), (1,11), (0,10)`.\n    *   **Right Hole:** at `(5,17)` (East). Projects a Horizontal Ray rightwards: `(5,17)` to `(5,22)`. (Stops at `(5,23)` due to collision).\n    *   **Bottom Hole:** at `(7,15)` (South). Projects a Vertical Ray downwards: `(7,15)` to `(29,15)`.\n\n*   **Object 3 (Magenta 6):**\n    *   **Top Hole:** at `(13,23)` (North). Projects a Vertical Ray upwards: `(13,23)` to `(0,23)`.\n    *   **Top-Right Hole:** at `(13,25)` (North-East). Projects a Diagonal Ray NE: `(13,25), (12,26), (11,27), (10,28), (9,29)`.\n    *   **Bottom-Right Hole:** at `(16,25)` (South-East). Projects a Diagonal Ray SE: `(16,25), (17,26), (18,27), (19,28), (20,29)`.\n\n*   **Object 4 (Orange 7):**\n    *   **Right Hole:** at `(20,24)` (East). Projects a Horizontal Ray rightwards: `(20,24)` to `(20,28)`. (Blocked at `(20,29)`).\n    *   **Bottom-Right Hole:** at `(22,24)` (South-East). Projects a Diagonal Ray SE: `(22,24), (23,25), (24,26), (25,27), (26,28), (27,29)`.\n\n*   **Object 5 (Maroon 9):**\n    *   **Top Hole:** at `(24,2)` (North). Projects a Vertical Ray upwards: `(24,2)` to `(0,2)`.\n\n**3. Interaction Rules:**\n*   **Vertical Dominance:** Vertical rays act as solid pillars. Horizontal and diagonal rays stop when they hit a vertical ray.\n    *   **Red West vs Maroon North:** Red ray at `(5,3)` stops because `(5,2)` is occupied by the Maroon vertical ray.\n    *   **Yellow East vs Magenta North:** Yellow ray at Row 5 stops at Col 22 because `(5,23)` is occupied by the Magenta vertical ray.\n*   **Time-of-Arrival (Diagonal/Horizontal):** If rays collide, the one arriving first (or covering less distance) claims the cell.\n    *   **Magenta SE vs Orange East:** They converge at `(20,29)`. Magenta arrives at step 4, Orange at step 5. Magenta claims the cell.

For each direction where the adjacent cell is 8, the ray is extended step by step until it meets a non\u20118 in the original input or the grid boundary; original coloured cells are left unchanged, and later blocks may overwrite earlier rays on originally empty cells.\n\nApplying this to the test input, the 2\u00d72 blocks of colours 2, 4, 6, 7 and 9 generate vertical, horizontal and diagonal rays as per the rule, yielding the following output grid:\n\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      2,2,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n      3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n      3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"37\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_5_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nThe transformation finds the 3\u2010walled 2\u00d72 \u201cframes\u201d and lets the interior color flow out through any gaps in the wall along straight lines.

No further redirection is needed here, so the result is the original grid with those straight flow paths added.\n\nOutput grid:\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n      3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n      8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"38\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**My approach to this ARC task is as follows:**\n\nI'm presented with an ARC problem involving grids of numbers representing colored cells, with the goal of producing output grids based on a set of rules derived from examples and hints. My initial thought process involves parsing the task requirements, identifying the input and output formats, and noting that the problem revolves around \"ray emitters\" within the grid. The examples are crucial to understanding the underlying logic.\n\nMy immediate focus is on the given hints, particularly the concept of a \"central colored pixel\" emitting rays, blocked by surrounding green pixels. I'll need to dissect these examples to grasp the specific structures and patterns in these grids. The task's core lies in determining how to interpret a colored blob as a ray emitter. I'll meticulously examine the inputs and outputs of the examples to find how the examples relate. I'm noting that there seems to be a special type of structure, possibly a cluster of pixels with a boundary, that acts as a ray emitter, and I'll carefully analyze the pixel relationships within these structures.\n\nI'm initially considering assuming a simplistic single central pixel that shoots rays, but I'm quickly led to re-evaluate the hints, and it becomes clear that a contiguous colored block likely forms a ray emitter, with an important consideration of the direction. The \"central pixel\" in the hint might be a simplification, so I'm investigating how multiple colored pixels might contribute to a combined ray emission, and I'm carefully analyzing the grid configurations around these colored areas.  I am re-reading the hint on \"not green,\" to see the ray generation is blocked by the wall's color.\n\nI'm considering a hypothesis: a structure of colored pixels surrounded by green pixels that act as walls, where each pixel within the structure examines its neighbors. The goal now is to understand the boundaries of ray emission. I'm testing the 3x3 window around the colored block with several examples to clarify any logical conflicts. This leads me to a hypothesis: Each colored pixel within the colored group checks neighbors outside the group, shooting a ray if there's no green, considering both cardinal and diagonal directions. I'm making several observations about the examples to confirm the hypothesis.\n\nI've tested with several examples, which show good validation of my current understanding, and the core rule has solidified: for a 2x2 block, consider a 3-direction corner, and for a 1x1 block, consider a full 8-direction ray emission.\n\nNow, my focus shifts to the test input. I'll scan the provided grid to find the colored clusters and surrounding wall pixels, carefully noting their positions and sizes. Based on the patterns found in the previous examples, I will be carefully creating the rays to draw. I'm making sure my previous assumptions remain consistent with the new test input.\n\nI am re-examining the hints, and also re-evaluating, by trying to understand how to apply the learned logic to the given test input. I will need to generate the rays for these clusters, keeping in mind the 2x2 and the general rule. The rays are going to be added to the grid.\n\nI've made a final check that the previous assumptions work with the test input and will create my output grid by starting with a copy of the given input grid, and I will place the generated rays in the grid. I'll then generate the final output in the required format. I'm checking to make sure I followed my own logic, which will give the final answer.\n\n\nTo solve this ARC task, we must identify the \"ray emitter\" structures in the grid and determine the rules for ray propagation based on the provided hints and solved examples.\n\n### Reasoning\n\n1.  **Identify Objects (Emitters):**\n    The grids contain distinct multicolor clusters. Analyzing the input data, these clusters are consistently **2x2 blocks of a single color**, surrounded by a \"ring\" of neighbor pixels. The ring consists of Green pixels (3), which act as **walls**, and other pixels (usually Black/8), which act as **openings**.\n\n2.  **Determine Emission Rules:**\n    By observing Example 2 and others, we can deduce a precise rule for how rays are emitted from a 2x2 cluster:\n    *   The 2x2 block has 4 pixels: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), and Bottom-Right (BR).\n    *   Each pixel in the block is responsible for checking the **3 neighbors** in its respective corner direction (Cardinal and Diagonal).\n        *   **TL Pixel:** Checks North, North-West, West.\n        *   **TR Pixel:** Checks North, North-East, East.\n        *   **BL Pixel:** Checks South, South-West, West.\n        *   **BR Pixel:** Checks South, South-East, East.\n    *   **Rule:** If a checked neighbor is **NOT Green (3)** (and not part of the cluster itself), it is considered an \"opening\". The cluster shoots a ray of its color in that direction.\n    *   **Trajectory:** Rays travel in a straight line from the emitter through the opening to the edge of the grid.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Test Input:**\n    The test input is a 30x30 grid. We scan for colored clusters (non-8, non-3) and apply the rules.\n\n    *   **Cluster A (Color 2 - Red):** Located at Rows 5-6, Cols 4-5.\n        *   **TL (5,4):** North (4,4) is 8 (Open) $\\rightarrow$ **Shoot Up**.

I need to figure out how these abstract grids of numbers, representing colors, relate to each other in the input/output pairs. The initial request is to complete the task based on the provided examples, and provide an explanation of my thinking process, in the first person.\n\nFirst, I need to get a handle on the rules. From the problem description, I'm told this is an ARC task involving grids of numbers 0-9. The input is a grid of numbers, and I have to explain how to get the output. I'm given some hints: Multicolor clusters are like \"ray emitters\". Central colored pixel is the source, and a Green pixel boundary acts as a wall. Rays extend until they hit the grid edge. Overlapping is mentioned, but I'm unsure of the impact of the overlap.\n\nLet's begin by scrutinizing the first example.  I notice that the background is a constant color (8), which I'll call Teal. There seem to be three \"objects\" or clusters of other colors, and they appear to be some blocks surrounded by green (3). I need to determine the center of these objects. I'm told to find the \"central colored pixel\". I need to find the colors in the input, and understand the central structure.\n\nI begin by focusing on the first cluster. I'm examining rows and columns, looking for some pattern. The hint is \"The central colored pixel\". This implies the structure must be a 3x3 block, where the central pixel emits some rays. So, I must interpret the color in the cluster. If the center is composed of a 2x2 of the color 9, it is not just a central pixel.\n\nI see that the cluster 1 is composed of a block 2x2 of color 9 surrounded by the green 3s. There are several clusters of different colors in this example. I need to note the size and position of these blocks, and compare these with the output example. The block could be a 3x3, 4x4, 5x5... and surrounded by the Green (3).\n\nOkay, let's examine Cluster 1 in more detail. This could be 9s (Maroon). Surrounded by 3s (Green). Let's trace it row by row. This is not a classic 3x3 grid, but a 4x4. The \"central pixel\" hint isn't quite right, then. Or maybe it's just a simplification. Maybe I should consider the 2x2 center as a single entity, or that the hint is referring to a specific instance.\n\nI observe the pattern in the example. I focus on how the green 3s surrounding a center influence the output. I think the green 3s form walls around the color centers. Let's look at the hints again. \"The central colored pixel *attempts* to shoot rays in all 8 directions\". The 3s act as a barrier to those rays in certain directions. Maybe the central colored pixels are just \"lamps,\" and the green pixels are the \"walls\" of that lamp. The 2x2 blocks of center color and their surroundings of 3s appear to control ray output.\n\nFor example 1, if Green acts like a wall, it blocks the ray's output in those directions. Let's check with my theory. The ray is emitted only if the immediate neighbor isn't green. I'm going to revisit the data. Okay, cluster 1 seems to consist of a 2x2 blocks of 9 (Maroon), and that block has walls (3s) surrounding them. These boundaries are: Green, at the top, bottom, and left and right sides. I trace the output and confirm that this is true.\n\nI reexamine the structure, thinking I may have missed something. The clusters may not always have 2x2 central blocks. I must adjust my thinking. Let's confirm my hypothesis with additional examples.\n\nWith example 4, the test cluster is a different size. The test cluster has a central pixel that is 6 (Magenta). It is composed of a 2x2 of that color. If the Green walls surround this block, it must be the case that a ray is emitted if the neighborhood isn't Green. Let's examine the data again. I can verify that for each 2x2 blocks, there is a direction which is not bounded by a Green, that the ray is emitted.\n\nLet's refine the ray logic. For every pixel 'P' in an inner color (non-8, non-3), I check 8 neighbors. If a neighbor is 3\n\nThe transformation rule is inferred as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify \"Lamps\":** Locate all 2x2 blocks of uniform color (excluding the background `8` and the wall color `3`). These are the light sources.\n2.  **Identify Openings:** For each 2x2 lamp, examine the 12 cells immediately surrounding it (the 8 neighbors adjacent to the sides and the 4 neighbors at the corners).\n    *   Green pixels (`3`) in these positions act as walls/shutters.\n    *   Any other value (typically background `8`) indicates an opening.\n3.  **Cast Rays:** From each opening, cast a ray of the lamp's color in the corresponding direction. The mapping is:\n    *   **Side Neighbors:**\n        *   Top-Left Neighbor -> Up\n        *   Top-Right Neighbor -> Up\n        *   Bottom-Left Neighbor -> Down\n        *   Bottom-Right Neighbor -> Down\n        *   Left-Top Neighbor -> Left\n        *   Left-Bottom Neighbor -> Left\n        *   Right-Top Neighbor -> Right\n        *   Right-Bottom Neighbor -> Right\n    *   **Corner Neighbors:**\n        *   Top-Left Corner -> Diagonal Up-Left (NW)\n        *   Top-Right Corner -> Diagonal Up-Right (NE)\n        *   Bottom-Left Corner -> Diagonal Down-Left (SW)\n        *   Bottom-Right Corner -> Diagonal Down-Right (SE)\n4.  **Ray Propagation:** Rays travel in a straight line to the edge of the grid.\n5.  **Intersections:** Where rays intersect or overlap, the color of the ray from the cluster that appears later in a standard reading order (or has a higher numeric value) typically persists on top (e.g., Maroon `9` overwrites Yellow `4`).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Red Cluster (2)** [Rows 5-6, Cols 4-5]:\n    *   Openings at Top-Left (Up) and Left-Bottom (Left) and Bottom-Right Corner (SE).\n    *   Rays: Up from col 4; Left from row 5; SE diagonal starting (7,6).\n\n*   **Yellow Cluster (4)** [Rows 5-6, Cols 15-16]:\n    *   Openings at Bottom-Left (Down), Right-Top (Right), Top-Left Corner (NW), Top-Right Corner (NE), Bottom-Left Corner (SW).\n    *   Rays: Down from col 15; Right from row 5; NW diagonal from (4,14); NE diagonal from (4,17); SW diagonal from (7,14).\n\n*   **Magenta Cluster (6)** [Rows 14-15, Cols 23-24]:\n    *   Openings at Top-Left (Up), Top-Right Corner (NE), Bottom-Right Corner (SE).\n    *   Rays: Up from col 23; NE diagonal from (13,25); SE diagonal from (16,25).\n\n*   **Orange Cluster (7)** [Rows 20-21, Cols 23-24]:\n    *   Openings at Right-Top (Right), Top-Right Corner (NE), Bottom-Right Corner (SE).\n    *   Rays: Right from row 20; NE diagonal from (19,25); SE diagonal from (22,25).\n\n*   **Maroon Cluster (9)** [Rows 25-26, Cols 2-3]:\n    *   Openings at Top-Left (Up), Top-Right Corner (NE), Bottom-Right Corner (SE).\n    *   Rays: Up from col 2; NE diagonal from (24,4); SE diagonal from (27,4).\n\n**Notable Intersections:**\n*   (11,10): Yellow SW crosses Red SE.

model_id=\"gpt-5.1-high_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**High\u2011level description of the rule**\n\nFrom the examples (and the given hints), the intended transformation can be summarized like this:\n\n1. **Find multicolor \u201cemitter\u201d clusters**  \n   Each cluster consists of:\n   - A ring / frame of **green** pixels (color `3`), and  \n   - A compact inner block of some **non\u2011green color** `K` (e.g., `2`, `4`, `6`, `7`, `9`).\n\n2. **Choose a single central pixel for each cluster**  \n   In all the given examples (and in the test), the inner block is a 2\u00d72 square of color `K`.  \n   For such a 2\u00d72 block located at rows `r..r+1`, cols `c..c+1`, we pick the **bottom\u2011left** cell `(r+1, c)` as the **center**.\n\n3. **Determine \u201copen\u201d directions based on immediate neighbors**  \n   From the center we look at its 8 neighbors (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW).  \n   - If the neighbor in a direction is **green (`3`)**, that direction is **blocked**: no ray is fired there.  \n   - If it is **not green**, the direction is **open** and a ray is fired.\n\n4. **Cast rays in open directions**  \n   For each open direction, starting from the neighbor cell and stepping one cell at a time:\n   - Stop when you step **off the grid** or onto a **green (`3`)** cell.  \n   - Along the way, any cell that is background (`8`) is recolored to the emitter color `K`.  \n   - Cells that are already non\u20118 (including other colors of the cluster) are left as they are and do not stop the ray (only `3` acts as a wall).\n\n5. **Overlay multiple clusters**  \n   Apply the above for each emitter cluster; their rays are overlaid on the original grid.  \n   (In this test, the rays from different clusters do not conflict in color at any cell under this rule.)\n\n---\n\n## Applying the rule to the test grid\n\nIn the test grid there are five multicolor clusters:\n\n1. **Cluster of color 2** (top\u2011left), with inner 2\u00d72 block at rows 5\u20136, cols 4\u20135  \n   - Inner block (2\u00d72 of `2`s):  \n     `(5,4), (5,5), (6,4), (6,5)`  \n   - **Center**: bottom\u2011left = `(6,4)` with color `2`.  \n   - Neighbors of `(6,4)`:\n     - N `(5,4) = 2` \u2192 open\n     - NE `(5,5) = 2` \u2192 open\n     - E `(6,5) = 2` \u2192 open\n     - SE `(7,5) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n     - S `(7,4) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n     - SW `(7,3) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n     - W `(6,3) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n     - NW `(5,3) = 8` \u2192 open\n   - So open directions: **N, NE, E, NW**.\n   - Firing rays and stopping at green `3`s yields:\n     - **N** from `(5,4)` up through `(0,4)`:\n       - New `2`s at `(4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4)` (cells that were `8`).\n     - **NE** from `(5,5)` hits a `3` immediately at `(4,6)`, so no new `2`s beyond existing cluster cells.\n     - **E** from `(6,5)` hits a `3` at `(6,6)`, so no new `2`s.\n     - **NW** from `(5,3)` up\u2011left to edge:\n       - New `2`s at `(5,3), (4,2), (3,1), (2,0)`.\n\n2. **Cluster of color 4** (upper\u2011middle), inner 2\u00d72 at rows 5\u20136, cols 15\u201316  \n   - Inner block: `(5,15), (5,16), (6,15), (6,16)`  \n   - **Center**: `(6,15)` with color `4`.  \n   - Neighbors of `(6,15)`:\n     - N `(5,15) = 4` \u2192 open\n     - NE `(5,16) = 4` \u2192 open\n     - E `(6,16) = 4` \u2192 open\n     - SE `(7,16) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n     - S `(7,15) = 8` \u2192 open\n     - SW `(7,14) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n     - W `(6,14) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n     - NW `(5,14) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n   - Open directions: **N, NE, E, S**.\n   - Rays:\n     - **N, NE, E** all run immediately into either non\u2011background cluster cells or green `3`s without touching background `8`s, so they add no new 4s.\n     - **S** from `(7,15)` straight down to bottom:\n       - Column 15, rows 7\u201329 are background `8` and become `4`.\n\n3. **Cluster of color 6** (middle\u2011right), inner 2\u00d72 at rows 14\u201315, cols 23\u201324  \n   - Inner block: `(14,23), (14,24), (15,23), (15,24)`  \n   - **Center**: `(15,23)` with color `6`.  \n   - Neighbors of `(15,23)`:\n     - N `(14,23) = 6` \u2192 open\n     - NE `(14,24) = 6` \u2192 open\n     - E `(15,24) = 6` \u2192 open\n     - SE `(16,24) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n     - S `(16,23) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n     - SW `(16,22) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n     - W `(15,22) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n     - NW `(14,22) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n   - Open: **N, NE, E**.\n   - Rays:\n     - **N** from `(14,23)` up to the top edge (no `3`s on that column above row 14):\n       - New `6`s at `(13,23), (12,23), \u2026, (0,23)`.\n     - **NE** from `(14,24)` up\u2011right until off\u2011grid, stopping before any green:\n       - New `6`s at `(13,25), (12,26), (11,27), (10,28), (9,29)`.\n     - **E** from `(15,24)` immediately hits a `3` at `(15,25)`, so no new 6s.\n\n4. **Cluster of color 7** (lower\u2011right), inner 2\u00d72 at rows 20\u201321, cols 23\u201324  \n   - Inner block: `(20,23), (20,24), (21,23), (21,24)`  \n   - **Center**: `(21,23)` with color `7`.  \n   - Neighbors of `(21,23)`:\n     - N `(20,23) = 7` \u2192 open\n     - NE `(20,24) = 7` \u2192 open\n     - E `(21,24) = 7` \u2192 open\n     - SE `(22,24) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n     - S `(22,23) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n     - SW `(22,22) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n     - W `(21,22) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n     - NW `(20,22) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n   - All open directions N, NE, E run into existing cluster cells and almost immediately into surrounding `3`s without touching any `8`, so **this cluster produces no extra rays** in the test case.\n\n5. **Cluster of color 9** (lower\u2011left), inner 2\u00d72 at rows 25\u201326, cols 1\u20132  \n   - Inner block: `(25,1), (25,2), (26,1), (26,2)`  \n   - **Center**: `(26,1)` with color `9`.  \n   - Neighbors of `(26,1)`:\n     - N `(25,1) = 9` \u2192 open\n     - NE `(25,2) = 9` \u2192 open\n     - E `(26,2) = 9` \u2192 open\n     - SE `(27,2) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n     - S `(27,1) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n     - SW `(27,0) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n     - W `(26,0) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n     - NW `(25,0) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n   - As with the 7\u2011cluster, the open directions never pass through background `8`s before hitting the frame of `3`s, so **no new 9s** are created.\n\nPutting all of these ray effects together on top of the original grid gives the final output below.\n\n---\n\n## Completed output grid\n\nHere is the final 30\u00d730 output grid as comma\u2011separated rows:\n\nRow 0:\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow

applied it to the test grid, then I\u2019ll give the final output grid.\n\n---\n\n## Transformation I used\n\n1. **Background and walls**\n   - Background color is `8`.\n   - The \u201cgreen\u201d wall color is `3`. These are not overwritten and also block rays.\n\n2. **Emitters**\n   - Every cell whose color is **not** `3` or `8` (i.e. colors `2,4,6,7,9` in this task) acts as a \u201cray emitter\u201d.\n\n3. **Direction gating by neighbors**\n   - For each emitter cell at position `(r,c)` and for each of the 8 directions  \n     `(-1,0), (-1,1), (0,1), (1,1), (1,0), (1,-1), (0,-1), (-1,-1)`:\n     - Look at the **immediate neighbor** in that direction: `(r+dr, c+dc)`.\n     - If this neighbor is color `3` or is outside the grid, **do not** shoot a ray in that direction.\n     - Otherwise, this direction is **open**.\n\n4. **Ray propagation**\n   - For each **open** direction from an emitter:\n     - Start from the neighbor cell `(r+dr, c+dc)` (the first step away from the emitter).\n     - Move step by step in that direction while inside the grid:\n       - If the current cell is color `3`, **stop** and do not recolor that cell.\n       - Otherwise recolor that cell with the emitter\u2019s color.\n       - Continue until you hit a `3` or go out of bounds.\n   - Rays can pass over any colors except `3`. When rays from different emitters meet, the color from the **later-processed** emitter overwrites the previous one.  \n     - I processed emitters in color order: all `2`s, then all `4`s, then `6`s, then `7`s, then `9`s (so `9` overwrites everything else, `7` overwrites `6,4,2`, etc.).\n\n5. **Result**\n   - The final grid is the original grid with all ray-painted cells applied under the above rules.\n\nUsing this rule:\n- The 2\u00d72 blocks of `2`, `4`, `6`, `7`, `9` act as groups of emitters.\n- Each individual cell in those blocks casts rays in every direction whose immediate neighbor is not `3`, until blocked by the next `3` or the border.\n- The union of all those rays (with the precedence order described) gives the final colored pattern below.\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\nHere is the completed transformed grid for the test input:\n\n2,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8  \n8,2,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8  \n2,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,2,9,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,9,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n2,2,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4  \n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,9,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,9,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,4,8,9,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,4,9,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,9,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,9,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,6  \n8,4,9,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n4,8,9,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8  \n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8  \n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8  \n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7  \n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      2,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8\n      8,2,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8\n      2,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,2,9,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,9,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      2,2,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,9,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,9,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,4,8,9,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,4,9,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,9,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,9,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,6\n      8,4,9,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      4,8,9,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n      3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n      8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n      8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"44\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nThe task can be solved by treating every small 2\u00d72 \u201ccore\u201d of a non\u2011green colour that is surrounded by green 3\u2019s as a ray emitter. For each emitter work on the four sides and the two diagonals: look at the border cells immediately adjacent to the 2\u00d72 block. If a border cell on a particular side or corner is not green, that opening allows a ray. Side openings produce horizontal or vertical rays along the row or column of the interior cell adjacent to that opening; corner openings produce diagonal rays along the diagonal through the block in that direction. The ray colour is the emitter colour and it is painted through the background out to the edge, leaving any non\u2011background cell (greens or other colours) unchanged.

                "response": "**Detailed Audit and Ranking of ARC Candidate Solutions**\n\nOkay, I've just finished a deep dive into the provided set of candidate solutions for this ARC task, and I've got a pretty clear picture now. My focus was on thoroughly understanding the core problem, the expected behavior, and how each candidate's logic stacks up against the training examples and test input.\n\nFirst, I established the ground truth: the task involves radiating beams from gaps in a colored frame surrounding a core structure. The direction and length of these rays depend on the gap's location relative to the core, and crucially, they seem to either *intersect* (in a layering-like manner) or *block* each other based on precedence. I scrutinized the training examples, especially the interaction of rays and how they stop. I noticed some candidates were good at the basic ray casting but faltered when beams had to interact.\n\nI started by looking at **Candidate 36**. This one nailed it. I traced the ray logic for each object, checking the generated rays against the expected behavior for *each* object in the Test Input (2, 4, 6, 7, and 9). The rays were all there and in the right directions. Intersections were consistent with a correct understanding of how to make rays interact. This candidate's logic was also the least complex in its description, and it *just worked.*\n\nNext in my ranking is **Candidate 24**. While it got the ray logic correct, I discovered it had a problem with the layering order of the rays. I ranked it slightly lower since this is where the main flaw lies. It failed to draw the 9-ray. This shows a problem with prioritization, and 24 seems to think that the top-most shape should take priority. This is the main difference between Candidate 24 and 36.\n\nI put **Candidate 27** here. This one used a *blocking* mechanism, where rays stopped at other rays. While it seemed to match some of the training data, my assessment, based on the principle of beams passing each other in Training data, and Candidate 27's consistent production of these intersections. The main flaw in this solution is, that it does not pass intersections.\n\n**Candidate 43** had a good foundation: direction-gating and layer/priority-based interactions, but its reliance on an invented \"hallucinated\" ray made its logic flawed and inconsistent, and lower than 24 (which, other than layer-priority, was correct).\n\n**Candidate 18** got most of the ray generation right, and correctly had rays cross over at intersections. I ranked 18 lower since it *failed* to produce the key Orange ray on Row 21.\n\nThis detailed, ray-by-ray audit left me confident in a final ranking of the candidates based on how well they embodied the core principles of ray generation, with a final ranking: **36 > 24 > 27 > 43 > 18**.\n\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 36,\n      \"score\": 10.0,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\",\n          \"4\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"The rule correctly identifies 2x2 cores, uses green borders to determine ray openings (cardinal vs diagonal), and correctly models rays crossing/overwriting rather than blocking.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Identifies colored 2x2 blocks surrounded by green frames.
