Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**Task Decomposition & Pattern Recognition**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got. The user wants me to crack an ARC puzzle. The core is analyzing a 2D grid filled with numbers (0-9), and figuring out the transformation between an input grid and a target output grid, given a few examples. I'm seeing a consistent background '8' in the examples, so that's helpful.\n\nMy initial approach is to observe the examples thoroughly. I need to identify key features. What's changing? What's staying the same?  I'm looking for patterns, especially how the colored shapes move and change relative to each other.\n\nExample 1 is where I started. The way those shapes are organized in the output, it's not a simple copy-paste or a basic geometric transformation. I started tracing the individual shapes, getting their coordinates. There's a big pattern, and the small parts fit into that somehow. I'm focusing on the input-output relationship. Are there specific input shapes that determine the output configuration? There are shapes. Some parts move. Other elements \"stay still,\" so maybe I'm hunting for a transformation of some sort.\n\nI began to hypothesize that there's a specific \"template\" shape that defines the output. I was wrong, since the shapes are transformed, not just placed. I'm now thinking about the \"frame\" idea, since the output shapes are organized around a core. There seems to be a structural framework within the examples that determines how the other shapes are organized.\n\nI'm now onto a second hypothesis. There's a key shape in the input that acts as a map or set of instructions. This map dictates how other shapes are arranged, and maybe rotated or stretched.\n\nI've got a third hypothesis now, building on this \"map\" idea. It seems like the core, central configuration in the input is really a \"frame.\" It defines the positions of specific shapes. The shapes aren't copies; they get moved or rotated based on their location around the frame.\n\nExamining Example 1, I'm noting specific characteristics within that framework. There are distinct shapes in the frame's position. There are large shapes in the grid that may not be present in the output. I am not seeing a one-to-one mapping, instead there is a set of transformations.\n\nI'm starting to think about *rotation* and how input shapes' orientation dictates output form. There might be some sort of rule or symmetry dictating how shapes get turned around the central frame. The examples aren't completely consistent in their arrangements, but there's a definite formula.\n\nI have a fourth hypothesis on the table: The shape's transformation seems to fill the space in between the frame markers. I'm trying to identify connections in shape orientation that are relative to the frame's configuration.\n\nThe fifth idea is symmetry or mirroring, maybe it's just a matter of flipping shapes to match the frame. The mirror idea makes sense, the output shapes have some symmetry in them.\n\nMy mind is now on a sixth hypothesis: there is a correlation between the position of a shape in the central frame (the \"nexus\") to a corresponding larger shape somewhere in the grid. Perhaps there are rules about rotation depending on what side of the frame the shapes are on.\n\nI need to nail down the transformation rules. My new approach is a rule-based algorithm.\n\nMy strategy involves:\n1.  **Frame Identification:** locate the frame in each example input.\n2.  **Large Shape Retrieval:** For each color in the frame, find the corresponding large shape. I will exclude the frame when retrieving shapes.\n3.  **Transformation and Rotation:** Move shapes relative to the center and rotate shapes so they \"fit\" the frame. The goal is the edge of the shape matches the frame's border, so the shape's side \"plugs\" into the frame.\n\nI will formulate my rotation by:\n*   **Top Component**: Find where the bottom of a shape matches the frame's top.\n*   **Bottom Component**: Find where a shape's top matches the frame's bottom.\n*   **Left Component**: Rotate where the right part of a shape matches the frame's left.\n*   **Right Component**: Rotate where a shape's left part matches the frame's right.\n\nNow, I am going to verify the rules against the examples to check for inconsistencies. Now, this rule seems to hold.\n\nNow that I have a well-formed algorithm, I will check the rules using the Test Input. This input has a frame composed of 1,4,2,6. I will find the relative positions of the shapes and construct the grid. After working the calculations, there are no conflicts, and the test input's output seems valid. The test appears to confirm my new rule.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the logic inferred from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Task:**\n\n1.  **Identify the \"Frame\":** In all examples, there is a central cluster of small colored shapes in the input grid (distinct from larger shapes). This cluster forms a \"Frame\" or \"Nexus\" with four cardinal connection points (Top, Bottom, Left, Right).\n    *   **Frame Structure:** The frame consists of four markers. Each marker has a specific color and an \"interface\" side facing outwards.\n    *   **Interface Matching:** The interface is defined by the length of the marker's edge facing outwards (e.g., a width of 2 pixels or a height of 2 pixels).\n\n2.  **Identify \"Large Shapes\":** The grid contains larger shapes of various colors scattered around. These correspond to the colors found in the Frame markers.\n    *   If a large shape of a marker's color exists, it is a component to be attached to the frame.\n    *   If no large shape exists, the marker itself serves as the component (or remains as is).\n\n3.  **Transformation Logic (Assembly):**\n    *   The Frame is reconstructed in the output grid at the same relative location (centered).\n    *   The Large Shapes are moved to connect to the corresponding markers on the Frame (Top marker -> Top shape, etc.).\n    *   **Rotation:** The Large Shapes are **rotated** (0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees) so that their connecting edge matches the dimensions (width or height) of the Frame marker's interface.\n        *   *Top Connection:* Shape's bottom edge must match Frame Top's width.\n        *   *Bottom Connection:* Shape's top edge must match Frame Bottom's width.\n        *   *Left Connection:* Shape's right edge must match Frame Left's height.\n        *   *Right Connection:* Shape's left edge must match Frame Right's height.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Locate Frame (Rows 10-13, Cols ~14-17):**\n    *   **Top (Row 10):** Blue (1). Shape `1 1`. Interface: **Width 2**.\n    *   **Left (Rows 11-12):** Yellow (4). Shape `4` / `4`. Interface: **Height 2**.\n    *   **Right (Rows 11-12):** Red (2). Shape `2` / `2`. Interface: **Height 2**.\n    *   **Bottom (Row 13):** Pink (6). Shape `6 6`. Interface: **Width 2**.\n\n2.  **Locate and Transform Large Shapes:**\n    *   **Blue (1) [Top]:** Found at top-right. Shape is a diamond/plus.\n        *   Original: `1`/`111`/`111`/`1`. Bottom width 1.\n        *   Rotate 90\u00b0: Top/Bottom become width 2 (`1 1`).\n        *   Rotated Shape: `. 1 1 .` / `1 1 1 1` / `. 1 1 .`. (Bottom edge matches Frame Top).\n    *   **Yellow (4) [Left]:** Found at bottom-right. Shape is roughly `4..4`/`4444`/`.44.`.\n        *   Right edge is height 2.\n        *   No rotation needed.\n        *   Shape: `4 . . 4` / `4 4 4 4` / `. 4 4 .`. (Right edge matches Frame Left).\n    *   **Red (2) [Right]:** Found at left. Shape is roughly `22`/`22`/`22`/`2.2`.\n        *   Rotate 270\u00b0 (or 90\u00b0 CCW): Left edge becomes height 2.\n        *   Rotated Shape: `. 2 2 2` / `2 2 2 .` / `2 2 2 2`. (Left edge matches Frame Right).\n    *   **Pink (6) [Bottom]:** Found at bottom-middle. Shape is a cross with a thick horizontal bar.\n        *   Rotate 90\u00b0: The thick horizontal bar becomes a thick vertical bar (width 2).\n        *   Rotated Shape: `. 6 6 .` / `6 6 6 6 6 6` / `. 6 6 .`. (Top edge matches Frame Bottom).\n\n3.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   Place the Frame markers.\n    *   Attach the transformed shapes:\n        *   Blue shape above Frame (Rows 7-9).\n        *   Yellow shape to left of Frame (Rows 11-13).\n        *   Red shape to right of Frame (Rows 10-12).\n        *   Pink shape below Frame (Rows 14-16).\n\n**Output Grid Visualization (Coordinates 0-indexed):**\n*   **Background:** 8.\n*   **Rows 7-9:** Blue (1) shape centered above frame.\n*   **Row 10:** Frame Top (1) and top of Red shape.\n*   **Rows 11-12:** Left Shape (4), Frame Sides (4, 2), Right Shape (2).\n*   **Row 13:** Bottom of Left Shape (4), Frame Bottom (6).\n*   **Rows 14-16:** Pink (6) shape centered below frame.\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Reconstructing Shapes from Fragments: The ARC Puzzle**\n\nMy mind is abuzz with this ARC task! It seems I need to figure out how to transform scattered shapes into organized composite figures. The key, I believe, lies in three solved examples and a test input. I'm seeing patterns emerge, particularly in how the color pixels get grouped and arranged.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n*   **Pixel Counts Matter:** Each color's total pixel count in the input *exactly* matches the pixel count in the output. This suggests that no pixels are created or destroyed, only rearranged.\n*   **Color Aggregation:** I'm noticing that the shapes in the output are made up of connected pixels of the same color. The colors aren't blended; they retain their individual identities.\n*   **\"Row Assembly\" Hypothesis:** I'm leaning toward the \"Row Assembly\" method.  All the pixels of a single color from the input are \"assembled\" into a shape by arranging the colored \"row segments\" vertically.  I must make sure that all of the colored pixels are included in the final shape.\n*   **Shape Symmetry is Key:** These aggregated shapes tend to be horizontally and vertically symmetric, often forming rectangles, diamonds, or hexagons. I'm focusing on trying to create a *vertically* symmetric shape.\n*   **Relative Position (Kinda):** While the input shape positions aren't literally preserved in the output, there's a strong connection to relative locations. If a color is \"leftmost\" in the input, it tends to be \"leftmost\" in the output.\n*   **4 Colors, Not Always:** I'm wondering if a large amount of pixels is deleted. In Example 1, a small block of yellow pixels disappears. So, the output will only be four colors, not always all the ones from the input. Perhaps there's an ordering to selecting the final ones?\n\n**The Plan:**\n\n1.  **Count and Assemble:** For each color, I'll count the pixels and try to create a symmetric shape, using a \"row-by-row\" construction.\n2.  **Relative Position:** I'll note the relative positions of each color's starting location in the input grid.\n3.  **Cross Pattern** With these shapes, I can visualize how the combined shape fits on the output. There will be a vertical line and a horizontal line, and they will all connect at their center.\n4.  **Fit to Test Input:** I'll apply these rules to the test input.\n\n**Challenges:**\n\n*   **Non-standard Shapes:** The \"assembled\" shapes can take on various forms depending on how the pixels from the input are arranged. Is there a defined methodology to constructing the shape?\n*   **Spacing and Gaps:** What is the spacing between the assembled shapes in the output? Are the shapes always packed tightly, or is there always a gap in between some of the shapes?\n\nI need to meticulously examine each example, test the new approach on the test input, and then make a final prediction. This ARC task is all about decoding this specific, spatial-rearrangement rule.\n\n\nThe solution involves identifying the scattered shapes of each color in the input, consolidating them into a single symmetric canonical shape for each color, and then arranging these canonical shapes into a compact cluster in the center of the grid, maintaining their relative positions from the input.\n\n**1. Analyze Colors and Counts:**\n- **Red (2):** Input fragments sum to 10 pixels. Consolidates to a 1-4-4-1 symmetric shape (diamond-like).\n- **Blue (1):** Input fragments sum to 10 pixels. Consolidates to a 2-3-3-2 symmetric shape (hexagon-like).\n- **Yellow (4):** Input fragments sum to 10 pixels. Consolidates to a 1-4-4-1 symmetric shape (diamond-like).\n- **Green (3):** Input fragments sum to 7 pixels. Consolidates to a 2-3-2 symmetric shape.\n- **Magenta (6):** Input fragments sum to 14 pixels. Consolidates to a 3-4-4-3 symmetric shape.\n\n**2. Determine Relative Positions:**\n- **Red:** Top-Left in input -> Top-Left in output cluster.\n- **Blue:** Top-Right in input -> Top-Right in output cluster.\n- **Green:** Middle-Left in input -> Middle-Left in output cluster.\n- **Yellow:** Middle-Right in input -> Middle-Right in output cluster.\n- **Magenta:** Bottom-Middle in input -> Bottom-Middle in output cluster.\n\n**3. Construct Output Layout:**\nThe shapes are packed together in the center of the grid (24x24).\n- **Top Row (Rows 6-9):**\n    - Red (Left) and Blue (Right).\n    - Red (1-4-4-1) occupies columns 9-12.\n    - Blue (2-3-3-2) occupies columns 13-15.\n- **Middle Row (Rows 10-13):**\n    - Green (Left) and Yellow (Right).\n    - Yellow (1-4-4-1) is full height (4 rows), occupying columns 12-15.\n    - Green (2-3-2) is height 3. To minimize gaps with the bottom base, it is bottom-aligned (Rows 11-13), occupying columns 9-11.\n- **Bottom Row (Rows 14-17):**\n    - Magenta (Center).\n    - Magenta (3-4-4-3) occupies columns 11-14 to bridge the seam between the left and right groups above.\n\n**Output Grid generation:**\n- **Rows 0-5:** Background (8).\n- **Row 6:** Red at 10; Blue at 13,14. `...8,2,8,8,1,1,8...`\n- **Row 7:** Red at 9-12; Blue at 13-15. `...2,2,2,2,1,1,1,8...`\n- **Row 8:** Red at 9-12; Blue at 13-15. `...2,2,2,2,1,1,1,8...`\n- **Row 9:** Red at 10; Blue at 13,14. `...8,2,8,8,1,1,8...`\n- **Row 10:** Yellow at 13. `...8,8,8,8,4,8,8...`\n- **Row 11:** Green at 9-10; Yellow at 12-15. `...3,3,8,4,4,4,4,8...`\n- **Row 12:** Green at 9-11; Yellow at 12-15. `...3,3,3,4,4,4,4,8...`\n- **Row 13:** Green at 9-10; Yellow at 13. `...3,3,8,8,4,8,8...`\n- **Row 14:** Magenta at 11-13. `...8,8,6,6,6,8,8...`\n- **Row 15:** Magenta at 11-14. `...8,8,6,6,6,6,8...`\n- **Row 16:** Magenta at 11-14. `...8,8,6,6,6,6,8...`\n- **Row 17:** Magenta at 11-13. `...8,8,6,6,6,8,8...`\n- **Rows 18-23:** Background (8).\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "First, I\u2019ll describe the pattern I inferred from the examples, then show how I applied it to the test input, and finally give the resulting output grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the transformation does in the examples\n\n### 1.1. Core idea\n\nAcross all three examples:\n\n- The background color is 8.\n- There are several non\u20118 colors.\n- Among the non\u20118 colors, **exactly four** are arranged close together in a small \u201ccore\u201d region of the input.\n- Other colors (or far\u2011away clusters of colors not participating in the core) are treated as **irrelevant noise** and removed.\n\nThe transformation:\n\n1. **Find the four \u201ccore colors\u201d**: the ones that occur together in a small bounding box (a few rows/cols) somewhere in the grid.\n2. **Assign each of those four colors** to one of four directions around a center: **left, right, top, bottom**, based on their relative positions inside that core box:\n   - Leftmost color \u2192 \u201cleft\u201d\n   - Rightmost color \u2192 \u201cright\u201d\n   - Topmost color \u2192 \u201ctop\u201d\n   - Bottommost color \u2192 \u201cbottom\u201d\n3. For each of these 4 colors:\n   - Count **all** of that color\u2019s pixels in the entire input (core + remote clusters).\n   - Erase all of its original pixels.\n   - Re\u2011create a **canonical shape** for that side (left/right/top/bottom) near the core region, with exactly that many pixels.\n4. **Erase all other non\u20118 colors** that are not one of the 4 core colors.\n\nIn the outputs, everything except these newly created 4 shapes is 8.\n\n### 1.2. Locating the core and assigning sides in the examples\n\n#### Example 1\n\n- Core region: rows 9\u201312, around columns 6\u20139.\n- Colors appearing there: {1, 2, 3, 6}.\n- Relative positions in the core:\n  - 3 is left of the others \u2192 \u201cleft\u201d\n  - 2 is right \u2192 \u201cright\u201d\n  - 6 is above \u2192 \u201ctop\u201d\n  - 1 is below \u2192 \u201cbottom\u201d\n- Color 4 never appears in that core \u2192 treated as noise, removed.\n\nThe output has:\n- A big \u201cleft arm\u201d of 3s\n- A \u201cright arm\u201d of 2s\n- A small top bar of 6s\n- A small bottom bar of 1s\nAll other non\u20118 cells (including all 4s) are gone.\n\n#### Example 2\n\n- Core region: rows 7\u201310, columns 7\u201310.\n- Colors present: {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n- Relative positions:\n  - 1 at left \u2192 \u201cleft\u201d\n  - 2 at right \u2192 \u201cright\u201d\n  - 3 above \u2192 \u201ctop\u201d\n  - 4 below \u2192 \u201cbottom\u201d.\n\nAgain, the output is four shapes (one per side) and everything else is 8.\n\n#### Example 3\n\n- Core region: rows 8\u201311, columns 12\u201315.\n- Colors: {1, 2, 3, 7}.\n- Relative positions:\n  - 2 at left \u2192 \u201cleft\u201d\n  - 7 at right \u2192 \u201cright\u201d\n  - 1 at top \u2192 \u201ctop\u201d\n  - 3 at bottom \u2192 \u201cbottom\u201d.\n\nOutput: four distinct shapes (left 2s, right 7s, top 1s, bottom 3s) around a central vertical \u201cgap\u201d of 2 columns, everything else 8.\n\n### 1.3. Where the shapes are placed\n\nIn all examples:\n\n- Let the **core bounding box** be rows `[r_min..r_max]`, cols `[c_min..c_max]`.\n- The **horizontal center** is between `c_mid_left` and `c_mid_right`, chosen as the two central columns of that core:\n  - Example 1: core cols ~6\u20139 \u21d2 center gap at cols 7\u20138.\n  - Example 2: core cols 7\u201310 \u21d2 center gap at cols 8\u20139.\n  - Example 3: core cols 12\u201315 \u21d2 center gap at cols 13\u201314.\n- The **vertical \u201cmid band\u201d** for the left/right shapes is exactly the core\u2019s row range `[r_min..r_max]` (4 rows in all training examples).\n  - Left shape occupies 4 rows `[r_min..r_max]` somewhere to the left of the 2\u2011col center.\n  - Right shape also occupies those same 4 rows, to the right of the center.\n  - Top shape ends at row `r_min` and extends upward.\n  - Bottom shape starts at row `r_max` and extends downward.\n\nWithin that framework, the exact pixel pattern of each side is a **canonical side\u2011shape**:\n\n- **Left side shape**:\n  - Always a 4\u00d7(up to 4) pattern, with a fixed priority ordering of cells.\n  - For a given pixel count N, you place N ones in that template in priority order.\n  - This template can be reconstructed from the three left-side shapes:\n    - Example 3 (N=8)\n    - Example 1 (N=10)\n    - Example 2 (N=12)\n  - For N=10, the occupancy pattern in a 4\u00d74 block (rows 1\u20134, cols 1\u20134) is:\n\n    ```\n    1 1 0 0\n    0 1 1 1\n    0 1 1 1\n    1 1 0 0\n    ```\n\n- **Right side shape**:\n  - Horizontal mirror of the left template.\n  - For N=10, the 4\u00d74 occupancy is:\n\n    ```\n    0 0 1 1\n    1 1 1 0\n    1 1 1 0\n    0 0 1 1\n    ```\n\n- **Top and bottom shapes**:\n  - In all training examples, **bottom shapes** are simple solid rectangles 2 columns wide:\n    - Height = `N / 2` (all N even in the examples):\n      - Example 1 bottom (N=2) \u2192 1\u00d72\n      - Example 2 bottom (N=2) \u2192 1\u00d72\n      - Example 3 bottom (N=6) \u2192 3\u00d72\n  - **Top shapes** are sometimes more ornate (example 2), but for:\n    - Example 1 top (N=2) \u2192 1\u00d72 at the center gap.\n    - Example 3 top (N=10) \u2192 5\u00d72 rectangle centered on the gap.\n  - For our test, we see a top color with N=10, and that exactly matches the \u201c5\u00d72 vertical bar\u201d behavior seen for N=10 in example 3, and the simple bar in example 1. So we use that.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying the rule to the test input\n\n### 2.1. Grid size and colors\n\nThe test grid is 24 rows \u00d7 26 columns. Background = 8.\n\nNon\u20118 colors present: {1,2,3,4,6}.\n\nWe must find the 4 \u201ccore colors\u201d.\n\n### 2.2. Finding the core region and core colors\n\nLook at the dense mixed region in the middle of the test input:\n\n- Row 11, cols 15\u201316: 1s\n- Rows 12\u201313, col 14: 4s\n- Rows 12\u201313, col 17: 2s\n- Row 14, cols 15\u201316: 6s\n\nThose lie within a small box:\n\n- Rows 11\u201314\n- Columns 14\u201317\n\nIn that 4\u00d74 \u201ccore box\u201d, the colors present are: **{1,2,4,6}**.\n\nColor 3 does not appear there, so it is treated as noise and will be removed entirely in the output.\n\n### 2.3. Assigning sides (left/right/top/bottom)\n\nCompute the approximate centroids of the core occurrences for each color:\n\n- Color 4:\n  - At (12,14) and (13,14) \u21d2 center \u2248 (12.5, 14)\n- Color 1:\n  - At (11,15\u201316) \u21d2 center \u2248 (11, 15.5)\n- Color 2:\n  - At (12\u201313,17) \u21d2 center \u2248 (12.5, 17)\n- Color 6:\n  - At (14,15\u201316) \u21d2 center \u2248 (14, 15.5)\n\nRelative positions:\n\n- **Leftmost** (smallest column) = color 4 \u2192 **left**\n- **Rightmost** (largest column) = color 2 \u2192 **right**\n- **Topmost** (smallest row) = color 1 \u2192 **top**\n- **Bottommost** (largest row) = color 6 \u2192 **bottom**\n\nSo direction assignment:\n\n- Left  = color 4\n- Right = color 2\n- Top   = color 1\n- Bottom= color 6\n\n### 2.4. Count pixels of each core color\n\nCount all occurrences throughout the grid:\n\n- Color 1:\n  - Row 2: (2,18)            \u2192 1\n  - Row 3: (3,18\u201320)         \u2192 3\n  - Row 4: (4,18\u201320)         \u2192 3\n  - Row 5: (5,18)            \u2192 1\n  - Row 11:(11,15\u201316)        \u2192 2  \n  Total = 1+3+3+1+2 = **10**\n\n- Color 2:\n  - Row 4: (4,4\u20135)           \u2192 2\n  - Row 5: (5,4\u20135)           \u2192 2\n  - Row 6: (6,4\u20135)           \u2192 2\n  - Row 7: (7,3) and (7,6)   \u2192 2\n  - Row 12:(12,17)           \u2192 1\n  - Row 13:(13,17)           \u2192 1  \n  Total = 2+2+2+2+1+1 = **10**\n\n- Color 4:\n  - Row 12:(12,14)           \u2192 1\n  - Row 13:(13,14)           \u2192 1\n  - Row 15:(15,21) and (15,24) \u2192 2\n  - Row 16:(16,21\u201324)        \u2192 4\n  - Row 17:(17,22\u201323)        \u2192 2  \n  Total = 1+1+2+4+2 = **10**\n\n- Color 6:\n  - Row 14:(14,15\u201316)        \u2192 2\n  - Row 18:(18,13)           \u2192 1\n  - Row 19:(19,13)           \u2192 1\n  - Row 20:(20,10\u201313)        \u2192 4\n  - Row 21:(21,10\u201313)        \u2192 4\n  - Row 22:(22,13)           \u2192 1\n  - Row 23:(23,13)           \u2192 1  \n  Total = 2+1+1+4+4+1+1 = **14**\n\nSo side colors & counts:\n\n- Top (1):    N_top = 10\n- Left (4):   N_left = 10\n- Right (2):  N_right = 10\n- Bottom (6): N_bottom = 14\n\nColor 3 will disappear in the output.\n\n### 2.5. Determining the cross center\n\nCore bounding box is rows 11\u201314, cols 14\u201317.\n\nSo, by analogy with the examples:\n\n- **Mid band rows** for left/right arms = rows 11\u201314 (same as core rows).\n- **Center gap columns** (2 central columns of the core):\n  - Core cols = 14..17 \u21d2 mid columns = 15 and 16.  \n  So the center \u201cgap\u201d is at columns 15\u201316.\n\nWe place:\n\n- Top and bottom shapes centered on columns 15\u201316.\n- Left shape in columns 11\u201314 (four columns just left of the gap).\n- Right shape in columns 17\u201320 (four columns just right of the gap).\n\n(That matches how the examples lay out their arms symmetrically around a 2\u2011column center.)\n\n### 2.6. Constructing the shapes\n\n#### 2.6.1. Top shape (color 1, N=10)\n\nFrom examples 1 & 3, for N=2 and N=10, the top shape is a **solid bar 2 columns wide** with height `N/2` ending at the top of the mid band.\n\n- N_top = 10 \u21d2 height = 10/2 = 5.\n- It should **end at row r_min = 11** and extend upward:\n  - Rows for top bar: 11\u2011(5\u20111) = 7 up to 11.\n- Columns for the central gap: 15 and 16.\n\nSo the top 1\u2011shape is a **5\u00d72 rectangle** of 1s at rows 7\u201311, columns 15\u201316.\n\n#### 2.6.2. Bottom shape (color 6, N=14)\n\nBottom shapes in all examples are solid 2\u2011column rectangles with height `N/2`.\n\n- N_bottom = 14 \u21d2 height = 7.\n- Starts at row r_max = 14 and extends downward 7 rows:\n  - Rows: 14..(14+7\u20111) = 14..20.\n- Same center columns 15\u201316.\n\nSo the bottom 6\u2011shape is a **7\u00d72 rectangle** of 6s at rows 14\u201320, columns 15\u201316.\n\n#### 2.6.3. Left shape (color 4, N=10)\n\nUse the **left\u2011side template** for N=10 (4\u00d74) reconstructed from examples (especially example 1 and 3). In local coordinates (row 1\u20134, col 1\u20134), the occupancy (1=filled, 0=empty) is:\n\n```\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0\n```\n\n- Place this over rows 11\u201314 (mid band) and cols 11\u201314 (4 columns just left of the center gap).\n\nMapping local\u2192global:\n\n- Global row = 11 + (local_row\u22121) \u21d2 rows 11..14\n- Global col = 11 + (local_col\u22121) \u21d2 cols 11..14\n\nSo color 4 cells:\n\n- Row 11: cols 11\u201312\n- Row 12: cols 12\u201314\n- Row 13: cols 12\u201314\n- Row 14: cols 11\u201312\n\nAll together = 10 cells (as required).\n\n#### 2.6.4. Right shape (color 2, N=10)\n\nRight template is the **horizontal mirror** of the left template for the same N. For N=10, occupancy:\n\n```\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n```\n\nPlace it over rows 11\u201314 and cols 17\u201320.\n\n- Global row = 11 + (local_row\u22121) \u21d2 rows 11..14\n- Global col = 17 + (local_col\u22121) \u21d2 cols 17..20\n\nSo color 2 cells:\n\n- Row 11: cols 19\u201320\n- Row 12: cols 17\u201319\n- Row 13: cols 17\u201319\n- Row 14: cols 19\u201320\n\nAgain 10 cells.\n\n#### 2.6.5. Overlaps and other colors\n\n- The left/right arms occupy columns 11\u201314 and 17\u201320 in rows 11\u201314.\n- The top bar occupies columns 15\u201316 in rows 7\u201311.\n- The bottom bar occupies columns 15\u201316 in rows 14\u201320.\n- There is **no overlap** in coordinates between different colors (they share some rows but different columns).\n\nEverything else (including all original 1/2/4/6 pixels outside these shapes, and all 3s) is set to background 8.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

Patterns are **transformed**: Left/Right patterns rotate 90\u00b0 clockwise; Top/Bottom patterns flip vertically\n5. Non-matching colored patterns are **removed**\n\n**For the test input:**\n- Cross structure at rows 10-13, cols 13-16:\n  - Top marker (1): row 10, cols 14-15\n  - Bottom marker (6): row 13, cols 14-15  \n  - Left marker (4): rows 11-12, col 13\n  - Right marker (2): rows 11-12, col 16\n\n- Floating patterns to attach:\n  - 1 pattern (rows 1-4, cols 17-19) \u2192 attaches to top\n  - 6 pattern (rows 17-22, cols 9-12) \u2192 attaches to bottom\n  - 4 pattern (rows 14-16, cols 20-23) \u2192 attaches to left\n  - 2 pattern (rows 3-6, cols 2-5) \u2192 attaches to right\n\n- 3 pattern (rows 13-15, cols 3-5) \u2192 removed (doesn't match any cross marker)\n\nAfter applying transformations and placing patterns around the cross:\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,1,1,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,4,8,8,2,8,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,4,8,8,2,8,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,6,6,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "The three given examples all have a small \u201ccross\u201d of different colours that serves as the anchor for the transformation. The colours that participate in that tight cluster are the ones carried over to the output, arranged again in a cross\u2011like layout centred on the same anchor row/column spacing. The left and right arms span four rows from the top anchor row downwards, with tapered patterns aligned towards the centre; the top and bottom arms occupy the two central columns between left and right.\n\nIn the test input the tight cluster of four colours is at rows 11\u201314, columns 14\u201317 with 1s above, 6s below, 4s to the left and 2s to the right. Using that as the anchor, the left arm is patterned 2,3,3,2 over rows 11\u201314 in columns 11\u201314, the right arm 1,4,4,1 over rows 11\u201314 in columns 17\u201320, the top arm fills columns 15\u201316 from row\u202f7 down to row\u202f11, and the bottom arm fills columns 15\u201316 from row\u202f14 down to row\u202f20. Everything else remains 8.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**High\u2011level pattern from the training pairs**\n\n1. In every training input there is a very characteristic 4\u00d74 \u201ccross core\u201d made of four different non\u20118 colors around a 2\u00d72 block of 8s:\n\n   ```\n   [ 8  T  T  8 ]   row r\n   [ L  8  8  R ]   row r+1\n   [ L  8  8  R ]   row r+2\n   [ 8  B  B  8 ]   row r+3\n   ```\n\n   - `T` = top color, `B` = bottom color, `L` = left color, `R` = right color.\n   - The 2\u00d72 center (rows r+1..r+2, cols c+1..c+2) is all 8.\n   - The four 2\u2011cell \u201carms\u201d are orthogonal and of different colors.\n\n   This pattern appears exactly once in each training input.\n\n2. Outside this 4\u00d74 core, the same four colors appear again in one or more separate connected components (\u201cremote clusters\u201d). Other colors (if present) are *not* part of the cross core.\n\n3. The transformation:\n\n   - Leaves the 4\u00d74 cross core **unchanged in place**.\n   - Erases all other occurrences of colors **not** in the cross core (they all become 8).\n   - For each of the four cross colors:\n     1. Take the union of that color\u2019s pixels outside the 4\u00d74 core; this defines a shape `P` (its minimal bounding box pattern).\n     2. Rotate `P` by some multiple of 90\u00b0 (and possibly mirror) so that the side of `P` that will touch its arm has **exactly two contiguous pixels** of that color in a straight segment.\n     3. Translate the rotated pattern so that this side is flush with the corresponding arm of the core (top, bottom, left, right), aligned so that those two pixels exactly continue the 2\u2011cell arm.\n     4. Draw this rotated, translated pattern there.\n   - All original remote pixels are removed; only the new attached patterns + original 4\u00d74 core remain.\n\n   In all three examples, this preserves the color counts for the four cross colors and gives a bigger \u201cdecorated\u201d cross; any extra color that is not one of these four is completely removed.\n\n---\n\n## Applying the rule to the test input\n\n### 1. Find the 4\u00d74 cross core\n\nScanning the test grid, the only 4\u00d74 block matching the structure above is:\n\nRows 10\u201313, columns 14\u201317:\n\n```\nr10: c14..17: [ 8  1  1  8 ]\nr11: c14..17: [ 4  8  8  2 ]\nr12: c14..17: [ 4  8  8  2 ]\nr13: c14..17: [ 8  6  6  8 ]\n```\n\nSo:\n\n- Top color `T = 1`  (row 10, cols 15\u201316)\n- Bottom color `B = 6` (row 13, cols 15\u201316)\n- Left color `L = 4` (col 14, rows 11\u201312)\n- Right color `R = 2` (col 17, rows 11\u201312)\n\nThese four are `{1,2,4,6}`. The additional color in the grid is `3`, which is **not** in the core and will be completely removed.\n\nWe will keep this exact 4\u00d74 block unchanged.\n\n### 2. Extract remote clusters for each core color\n\nWork from the **input**, excluding the 4\u00d74 core.\n\n- **Color 1 (top arm)**  \n  Remote 1\u2019s are at rows 2\u20135, cols 18\u201320:\n\n  ```\n  r2: [ 1 . . ]\n  r3: [ 1 1 1 ]\n  r4: [ 1 1 1 ]\n  r5: [ 1 . . ]\n  ```\n\n  ('.' denotes 8.) This is a 4\u00d73 \u201cT\u2011shaped\u201d pattern with 8 ones.\n\n- **Color 2 (right arm)**  \n  Remote 2\u2019s are the block at rows 4\u20136 plus the two at row 7:\n\n  Bounding box rows 4\u20137, cols 3\u20136:\n\n  ```\n  r4: [ . 2 2 . ]\n  r5: [ . 2 2 . ]\n  r6: [ . 2 2 . ]\n  r7: [ 2 . . 2 ]\n  ```\n\n  That is 8 twos in a 4\u00d74 pattern.\n\n- **Color 4 (left arm)**  \n  Remote 4\u2019s are at bottom right, rows 14\u201317, cols 21\u201324:\n\n  ```\n  r14: [ 4 . . 4 ]\n  r15: [ 4 4 4 4 ]\n  r16: [ . 4 4 . ]\n  r17: [ . 4 4 . ]\n  ```\n\n  Again 10 fours in a 4\u00d74 pattern.\n\n- **Color 6 (bottom arm)**  \n  Remote 6\u2019s are in rows 18\u201323, cols 10\u201313:\n\n  ```\n  r18: [ . . . 6 ]\n  r19: [ . . . 6 ]\n  r20: [ 6 6 6 6 ]\n  r21: [ 6 6 6 6 ]\n  r22: [ . . . 6 ]\n  r23: [ . . . 6 ]\n  ```\n\n  That is a 6\u00d74 pattern with 12 sixes.\n\n### 3. Rotate each remote pattern to make a proper extension\n\nFor each color, we choose a rotation so that the side that will touch the arm has **exactly two contiguous pixels** of that color on that side.\n\n#### Top arm (color 1)\n\nRemote pattern `P\u2081` (4\u00d73):\n\n```\n1 . .\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n1 . .\n```\n\nRotate 90\u00b0 clockwise \u2192 3\u00d74 pattern:\n\n```\nRow1: 1 1 1 1\nRow2: . 1 1 .\nRow3: . 1 1 .\n```\n\nThe **bottom row** `[ . 1 1 . ]` has exactly two contiguous 1s: ideal to touch the 2\u2011cell top arm.\n\nPlace this above the core so that those 1s sit directly over the existing 1\u2011pair at (10,15\u201316):\n\n- Use rows 7\u20139, cols 14\u201317:\n\n  - Row 7 (P\u2081 row1): `[1 1 1 1]` \u2192 (7,14\u201317)\n  - Row 8 (P\u2081 row2): `[. 1 1 .]` \u2192 (8,14\u201317)\n  - Row 9 (P\u2081 row3): `[. 1 1 .]` \u2192 (9,14\u201317)\n\nSo we add:\n\n- r7: c14\u201317 = 1,1,1,1\n- r8: c15\u201316 = 1,1\n- r9: c15\u201316 = 1,1\n\n#### Left arm (color 4)\n\nRemote pattern `P\u2084` (4\u00d74):\n\n```\n. 4 . 4\n4 4 4 4\n. 4 4 .\n. 4 4 .\n```\n\nRotate 90\u00b0 clockwise \u2192 4\u00d74:\n\n```\nRow1: . 4 4 .\nRow2: . 4 4 .\nRow3: 4 4 4 4\nRow4: 4 . . 4\n```\n\nThe **rightmost column** `[ . . 4 4 ]` has exactly two contiguous 4s at rows 3\u20134.\n\nPlace this to the *left* of the core so those two 4s are directly left of the left arm cells (11\u201312,14):\n\n- We place P\u2084(rot) at rows 9\u201312, cols 10\u201313:\n\n  - Row 9:  [ . 4 4 . ] \u2192 (9,11\u201312) = 4,4\n  - Row10: [ . 4 4 . ] \u2192 (10,11\u201312) = 4,4\n  - Row11: [ 4 4 4 4 ] \u2192 (11,10\u201313) = 4,4,4,4\n  - Row12: [ 4 . . 4 ] \u2192 (12,10) = 4, (12,13) = 4\n\nNow col 13 at rows 11\u201312 (4,4) touches the left arm at col 14, rows 11\u201312.\n\n#### Right arm (color 2)\n\nRemote pattern `P\u2082` (4\u00d74):\n\n```\n. 2 2 .\n. 2 2 .\n. 2 2 .\n2 . . 2\n```\n\nWe need a rotation whose side will provide exactly two contiguous 2s.\n\nRotate 270\u00b0 clockwise (or 90\u00b0 counter\u2011clockwise) \u2192 4\u00d74:\n\n```\nRow1: . . . 2\nRow2: 2 2 2 .\nRow3: 2 2 2 .\nRow4: . . . 2\n```\n\nHere the **leftmost column** is `[ . 2 2 . ]`, two contiguous 2s at rows 2\u20133. This will be our contact side.\n\nPlace this pattern to the *right* of the core so those two 2s are just to the right of the right arm at (11\u201312,17):\n\n- Put P\u2082(rot270) at rows 10\u201313, cols 18\u201321:\n\n  - Row10: [ . . . 2 ] \u2192 (10,21) = 2\n  - Row11: [ 2 2 2 . ] \u2192 (11,18\u201320) = 2,2,2\n  - Row12: [ 2 2 2 . ] \u2192 (12,18\u201320) = 2,2,2\n  - Row13: [ . . . 2 ] \u2192 (13,21) = 2\n\nThis makes column 18 at rows 11\u201312 be 2\u2019s, touching the right arm at col 17, rows 11\u201312.\n\n#### Bottom arm (color 6)\n\nRemote pattern `P\u2086` (6\u00d74):\n\n```\n. . . 6\n. . . 6\n6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6\n. . . 6\n. . . 6\n```\n\nRotate 90\u00b0 clockwise \u2192 4\u00d76:\n\n```\nRow1: . . 6 6 . .\nRow2: . . 6 6 . .\nRow3: . . 6 6 . .\nRow4: 6 6 6 6 6 6\n```\n\nThe **top row** `[ . . 6 6 . . ]` has exactly two contiguous 6s.\n\nPlace this *below* the core so those 6s sit directly under the bottom arm cells at (13,15\u201316):\n\n- Place P\u2086(rot90) at rows 14\u201317, cols 13\u201318:\n\n  - Row14: [ . . 6 6 . . ] \u2192 (14,15\u201316) = 6,6\n  - Row15: [ . . 6 6 . . ] \u2192 (15,15\u201316) = 6,6\n  - Row16: [ . . 6 6 . . ] \u2192 (16,15\u201316) = 6,6\n  - Row17: [ 6 6 6 6 6 6 ] \u2192 (17,13\u201318) = 6,6,6,6,6,6\n\nNow col 15\u201316, row 14 are 6s touching the bottom arm at row13, cols15\u201316.\n\n### 4. Erase all other non\u20118 pixels\n\n- All original 1s, 2s, 4s, 6s **outside**:\n  - the 4\u00d74 core,\n  - the added extension patches above/below/left/right\n  are removed (set to 8).\n- All `3`s are removed completely, since color 3 is not in the cross core.\n\nTo implement this cleanly, it\u2019s easiest to start from an all\u20118 grid of the same size, then draw:\n\n- the unchanged 4\u00d74 core (rows 10\u201313, cols 14\u201317),\n- the 1\u2011extension (rows 7\u20139, cols 14\u201317),\n- the 4\u2011extension (rows 9\u201312, cols 10\u201313),\n- the 2\u2011extension (rows 10\u201313, cols 18\u201321),\n- the 6\u2011extension (rows 14\u201317, cols 13\u201318).\n\nEverything else remains 8.\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\nHere is the resulting 24\u00d726 grid:\n\nRow 1\u20136: all 8\nRow 7\u201317: as constructed\nRow 18\u201324: all 8\n\n```text\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "I first looked for a rule that preserved the counts of each colour. In all three examples the output contained the same number of pixels of each colour that was carried over, but the pixels were rearranged into compact blocks. Colours whose first occurrence was entirely in the bottom half of the grid were ignored (as in example\u00a01 with the 4s), so for the test input I kept colours\u202f1,\u202f2 and\u202f4 and dropped the 3s and 6s (their first rows are below row\u202f12).\n\nFor each retained colour I computed the list of per\u2011row counts from the input. The greatest common divisor of these counts distinguishes two regimes: if the gcd is 1, the colour is packed into a four\u2011row shape with lengths \\([a,b,b,a]\\) where \\(a=\\lfloor\\text{total}/n\\rfloor\\) (total is the number of pixels, n the number of non\u2011zero rows) and \\(b=(\\text{total}-2a)/2\\). If the gcd were greater than 1 the shape would be a rectangle of width equal to the gcd, but in this case all three colours have gcd\u202f1, giving shapes \\([1,4,4,1]\\) for colour\u202f2 and \\([2,3,3,2]\\) for colours\u202f1 and\u202f4.\n\nFollowing the examples, all gcd\u202f1 shapes are bottom\u2011aligned to the mid\u2011row of the grid (row\u202f12 here), occupying rows\u202f9\u201312. I ordered the shapes left\u2011to\u2011right by the column of their first occurrence and spaced their starts six columns apart, anchoring the rightmost at its first\u2011occurrence column. To avoid overlap I shifted the top and bottom rows of the leftmost shape one column to the left, left the middle shape unshifted and right\u2011aligned the top and bottom rows of the rightmost shape by one column.\n\nPlacing these shapes on an 8\u2011filled 24\u00d726 grid gives:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",
