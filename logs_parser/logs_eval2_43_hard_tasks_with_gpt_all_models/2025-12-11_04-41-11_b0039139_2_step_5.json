            "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task: Test Input Analysis**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task, specifically an image processing problem. My goal is to figure out the relationship between input grids (various rectangular sections of data) and a small output grid.  Let's break down the input and how it maps to the output, focusing on the provided examples and how they relate to the test input.\n\nI see a repeated structure: The input is a collection of rectangular \"panels\" (4 in the example) that are vertically stacked. These panels have separators consisting of a row of 1s (blue) separating them. Each panel seems to have an associated \"palette\" that is a solid color, which is derived from the non-zero pixel data.\n\nIn Example 1: I observe yellow (4), green (3), red (2), and maroon (9) blocks of data. The Output is only 2s and 9s. This leads me to believe the colors in the input might be the source for the colors in the output!  The goal appears to be to use the values from the 3rd and 4th panels (red and maroon) and arrange them based on the 1st and 2nd panels patterns.\n\nFirst Analysis:  Analyzing Example 1's input, I notice patterns within panels: yellow, green, red and maroon. Each color has its own shape!\n\nExamining the patterns, I note they have 0's (black) and the respective colour number.\nThe question becomes: how do the non-zero pixels in panels 1 and 2 map to the output which contains values from panels 3 and 4?  \n\nI realize I need to understand how shapes in the input panels influence the pixel values in the output. I also suspect there's a simple, repeated operation or logical mapping.  The output dimensions (5x2) are also a mystery, how they correspond to 4x4 or 3x4 inputs.\n\nI try various approaches.\n*   **Logical Operations**: Maybe there's an XOR, AND, or OR operation happening between patterns. This doesn't seem to hold as the data is already in a 2D format.\n*   **Vertical stacking**: Is the output a straight vertical stack? The dimensions don't fit. I start noticing the \"separator\" and look at Example 2.\n*   **Horizontal stacking**: Is the layout being rotated?\n\nI note Ex 2 contains a horizontal structure. So the ARC task rotates between vertical and horizontal input grids.  So I'm not dealing with orientation and transposing issues. I concentrate on how it can handle varying panel sizes and separator positions to understand the transformation. I realize the structure has four panels.\n\nNow, I look for common components that hold across the examples.  I need to determine what is the role of the colored number vs the data that forms the shapes. The key seems to be the \"Pattern\" panels (Yellow, Green) and the \"Color\" panels (Red, Maroon).  The Output will contain the values from the \"Color\" panels using the shape defined from the \"Pattern\" panels.\n\nThrough a few examples, I finally deduce that there are two types of sections. \"Pattern\" sections contain the numbers that form a shape/pattern. \"Color\" sections contain a solid rectangle of color. The Output's values are taken from the solid \"Color\" blocks based on the \"Pattern\" structure. I have to find this rule.\nI realize it's how the pattern is *read* rather than some logical combination! The sizes are all over the place.\n\nI carefully look at Example 2, in which both are in a horizontal configuration. The first is a 4x4. The second a 3x4 and so on. The width of the input seems to be the key factor as I noticed that the Output's width is derived somehow using the \"width of each pattern\".\n\nI look at Example 3. I am presented with 3 panels that must be combined to form a simple output.\nThe outputs and inputs' have different dimensions - I look at the content. Example 3 provides even more information to clarify. I now note the colors in the outputs. From it I notice how they're mapped: Magenta, Yellow, Blue and Green, the dimensions, and the \"colors\" from the solid blocks.\nI attempt mapping the patterns to the colour and widths.  It looks as though there are two \"patterns\" and the last two \"color\" blocks.\nI am close.\nI look at all the dimensions again.\n\nI return to Example 2 and discover:\nThe output is formed by repeating a core pattern (like a tiling) based on the inputs' structure!\n*The solid blocks' width determines the block size.*\n\nTo construct the output:\n1.  Read each row (vertical input)\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the test input grid based on the rules inferred from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Task:**\n1.  **Structure:** The input grids are composed of horizontal panels separated by lines of `1`s.\n    *   **Panel 1 & 2:** These contain \"pattern\" shapes on a black (`0`) background. Pattern 1 (P1) uses color `4` (yellow) and Pattern 2 (P2) uses color `3` (green).\n    *   **Panel 3 & 4:** These contain solid blocks of color. Let's call the color in Panel 3 `C1` and the color in Panel 4 `C2`.\n2.  **Output Generation:** The output is a new grid constructed by interpreting the rows of P1 and P2 as sequences of blocks of colors `C1` and `C2`.\n    *   The **number of rows** in the output corresponds to the number of rows containing the pattern (excluding empty padding rows).\n    *   The **content of each row** is determined by alternating blocks of `C2` and `C1`.\n    *   **C1 Blocks:** These correspond to contiguous runs of pixels in P1. The length of a `C1` block in the output is equal to the length of the corresponding run of `4`s in that row of P1.\n    *   **C2 Blocks:** These correspond to the background or the `3`s in P2. The length of `C2` blocks appears to be context-dependent (often 1 or 3). Runs of `3`s in P2 of length > 1 (or specific configurations) generally produce `C2` blocks of length 3, while single `3`s or empty space produce `C2` blocks of length 1.\n    *   **Sequence:** The sequence typically starts with `C2`, then alternates `C1`, `C2`, `C1`, etc. The sequence is repeated or extended to match a specific width.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Panel 3 (C1) contains `5`s (Gray).\n    *   Panel 4 (C2) contains `2`s (Red).\n*   **Patterns (P1 & P2):**\n    *   **Row 1:** P1 has \"44\" and \"4\" (lengths 2, 1). P2 has \"33\" and \"33\". This configuration generates `C2` blocks of length 3 (derived from the \"33\" pattern and examples). Sequence: `C2(3) - C1(2) - C2(3) - C1(1) - C2(3)`. Total Width: $3+2+3+1+3 = 12$.\n    *   **Row 2:** P1 has \"4\" and \"4\" (lengths 1, 1). P2 is empty. Empty/sparse P2 generates `C2` blocks of length 1. Sequence: `C2(1) - C1(1) - C2(1) - C1(1)...` extended to width 12.\n    *   **Row 3:** P1 has \"444\" (length 3). P2 has \"33\" and \"33\". Generates `C2` blocks of length 3. Sequence: `C2(3) - C1(3) - C2(3)`. Total 9. Extending to width 12 by continuing the alternation adds `C1(3)`. Sequence: `C2(3) - C1(3) - C2(3) - C1(3)`.\n    *   **Row 4:** Same as Row 2.\n    *   **Row 5:** Same as Row 1.\n\n**Constructing the Output Grid (12x5):**\n*   **Row 0 (from Input Row 1):** `C2(3), C1(2), C2(3), C1(1), C2(3)`\n    *   `2,2,2, 5,5, 2,2,2, 5, 2,2,2`\n*   **Row 1 (from Input Row 2):** Alternating `C2(1), C1(1)`...\n    *   `2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5`\n*   **Row 2 (from Input Row 3):** `C2(3), C1(3), C2(3), C1(3)`\n    *   `2,2,2, 5,5,5, 2,2,2, 5,5,5`\n*   **Row 3 (from Input Row 4):** Same as Row 1.\n    *   `2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5`\n*   **Row 4 (from Input Row 5):** Same as Row 0.\n    *   `2,2,2, 5,5, 2,2,2, 5, 2,2,2`\n\n2,2,2,5,5,2,2,2,5,2,2,2\n2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5\n2,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,2,5,5,5\n2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5\n2,2,2,5,5,2,2,2,5,2,2,2",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**My initial thought is that the user wants me to solve an ARC task, using several solved examples and an example input.**\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the inputs and outputs. I begin by analyzing Example 1. This one seems to use a vertical stack of panels, while the others use horizontal arrangements. Each input is divided into panels, separated by rows or columns of 1s (which I'll call \"blue\").  I note that Example 1 has an 18x4 grid divided vertically. The sections within the examples represent operands for a function I need to derive. I identify operands like shape A, shape B, color C, and color D.  The goal is to determine the logic for the outputs and to generalize it.\n\nI closely examine Example 2, looking at the layout and separation between \"panels\" containing shapes on a black (0) background.  I need to discover how these smaller components contribute to the output.  The output appears to be constructed using the shapes or colors from the input panels.  I start noticing the shape patterns and corresponding colors in each panel of all the examples.  I attempt to generalize by expressing the shapes as binary matrices. For example, Example 2 has a horizontal arrangement, and I note that these shapes (e.g., a \"4\" or a \"3\") create distinct patterns.\n\nBy examining Example 2, I try representing the patterns as binary matrices ($M_A$ and $M_B$). I try different operations like a Kronecker or tensor product, but the output dimensions don't match.  I move on to convolution. The shape of the output might result from some sort of convolution process. I try to derive the rules that create the output from the inputs.\n\nI try to connect Example 1. In Example 1, I find patterns and use dimensions of active parts of the shape. Then I try to build the output.\n\nI observe that the patterns are drawn on a grid (0s are the separations). I try to map the elements and see whether they are directly responsible.\n\nI realize, for horizontal examples, there are always two shapes (represented with color 4 and 3) and two colors (red and maroon). And there's a simple mapping for mapping the colors from inputs to the outputs. I try to map the colors from examples 1, 2, 3 and 4.  In all examples, it's clear that there are shape panels and color panels.\n\nI decide to abstract the patterns as binary matrices and try applying these matrices to the output by trying convolution.\n\nThe outputs seem to be constructed by substituting or combining the basic patterns within the output grid. In this, I find that a combination of the shapes and colors of the inputs must define the structure of the output. I also look at how \"Macro\" and \"Micro\" structures are related (which I call the repeating pattern vs the detail inside the repeating pattern). I conclude the operation is some form of substitution or tiling to get the final output.\n\nI go back to trying to match the shapes to output.  I consider the \"bounding box\" of the shapes (nonzero pixels).  I identify a repeated pattern inside the output, which is related to one of the inputs.\n\nI try various interpretations: are the inputs bitmasks? Are the outputs combinations?\n\nI look at the repeating pattern again in Example 3. I deduce there are two patterns: pattern A, and pattern B.  Output depends on both. I have a hypothesis that it's a Kronecker product with a twist, and then it is a logical operation on coordinates.  The goal is to find this twist.  I then try a convolution operation which doesn't seem to work, or doesn't work by itself. The outputs are often repetitions, so I decide it might be a convolution with repetitions.\n\nI keep trying convolution on one example by example to find some structure in the input.\n\nI decide to use the convolution hypothesis in the inputs.  I try to expand by scaling and see if that will work out to find a relation between the two elements in an example. After some work, I come to the idea that the problem has 2 stages: a \"scale\" and then some other step. Then I look at whether I am using the right values.\n\nThe operation seems to be more complex than just a simple product of elements; there might be some kind of geometric transformation or pattern-based construction at play. I look for \"periods\" or repetition.\n\nI also observe that the number of rows in the output grid is determined by the number of rows in one of the input patterns.  Each output row appears to be derived from an input row, along with the entire second input pattern.\n\nI try to construct rules that apply to each row independently. I decide to interpret the output in terms of repeated blocks.  If the input A has a certain configuration, a corresponding block is\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on patterns found in solved examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Transformation Rule:**\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input consists of horizontal panels separated by vertical lines of a specific color (often 1s).\n    *   **Panel 1 ($A$):** Represents a \"macro\" pattern or control grid.\n    *   **Panel 2 ($B$):** Represents a \"micro\" pattern or component shape.\n    *   **Panel 3 & 4:** Define the output colors. Panel 3 gives the background color ($C_{bg}$), and Panel 4 gives the foreground color ($C_{fg}$).\n\n2.  **Output Geometry:**\n    *   The output height equals the height of the pattern in Panel $A$ ($H_{out} = H_A$).\n    *   The output width ($W_{out}$) is determined by the widths of $A$ and $B$ and a stride/period parameter $P$.\n    *   From examples:\n        *   Example 2: $W_A=3, W_B=5 \\rightarrow W_{out}=11$. This fits $W_{out} = (W_A - 1) \\times P + W_B$ with $P=3$.\n        *   Example 4: $W_A=3, W_B=3 \\rightarrow W_{out}=7$. This fits $W_{out} = (W_A - 1) \\times P + W_B$ with $P=2$.\n    *   The parameter $P$ appears to be related to $W_B$ or the density of $B$. Based on the progression ($W_B=3 \\to P=2$, $W_B=5 \\to P=3$), we use $P = \\lceil W_B / 2 \\rceil + 1$ ? No, $3 \\to 2, 5 \\to 3$ is consistent with $P = \\lceil W_B / 1.7 \\rceil$ or simply empirically $P=3$ for width 5.\n    *   For the Test Input: $W_A = 4$, $W_B = 5$. Using $P=3$ (as in Example 2 which also has $W_B=5$), the output width is $(4-1) \\times 3 + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14$.\n\n3.  **Construction Logic (Row-by-Row):**\n    *   For each row $i$, we take the binary pattern of row $i$ from $A$ and row $i$ from $B$ (or the representative pattern of $B$ if $B$ repeats).\n    *   In the Test Input, $B$ has a repeating pattern `11011`.\n    *   We create the output row by superimposing copies of $B$ at positions determined by the 1s in $A$.\n    *   The positions are scaled by $P$. If $A$ has a 1 at index $k$, we place a copy of $B$ starting at index $k \\times P$.\n    *   The combination rule is an **XOR sum**, followed by an **Inversion** (NOT operation) over the valid range $[0, W_{out}-1]$.\n    *   Foreground color ($C_{fg}$) is assigned to indices where the bit is 1 (after inversion), and Background color ($C_{bg}$) to 0.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Dimensions:** Output is $5 \\times 14$.\n*   **Colors:** Panel 3 is 5 (Grey/Background).

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Deep Dive into ARC Problem-Solving**\n\nAlright, let's break down this ARC problem. The user wants me to crack a puzzle based on a few examples, and I'm on it. First, I'm diving into the example data. I notice a pattern: grids are divided by these blue lines (which are represented by \"1\"s in the text), each containing distinct shapes and colors. My mind races, quickly identifying pairs: a \"pattern\" block with shapes made of yellow or green pixels and a \"color\" block with solid colored pixels. It's like a set of building blocks. Then, I see the outputs. The output doesn't seem to have a one-to-one correspondence with the input. But the output uses solid colors and patterns! It looks like there is a relationship between patterns and solid colours.\n\nThe breakthrough comes when I start thinking, \"what if the pattern blocks are somehow directing how the colors from the other blocks are arranged?\". It's like the yellow and green shapes are stencils. I can start to look at the pattern blocks to determine some logical sequence! I then started to think maybe I can predict the new input, and that is what I am trying to do. I realized that the orientation (horizontal vs vertical) matters! Now I\u2019m certain the relationship is not a one-to-one mapping. This is also when I check the test input to see if my approach is valid.\n\nI go back and forth between the examples, refining my hypothesis. The examples are the key! Each input shows me how these \"pattern\" blocks influence the output. The shapes in the patterns (yellow and green) become the crucial part. They tell me how to combine or overlap the solid colors to generate the output grid. In one example, the orientation of the patterns determines a repetition or tiling. I am seeing the repeating structure in the patterns, so I started looking closer. I need to understand this repeating structure or adjacency logic. The key is to find that structure. So I start thinking about the outputs.\n\nI think the input, instead of being images, has a code or instruction-type structure. The pattern defines the rule and the color defines the elements. I start to understand the output is composed of sub-blocks or tiles formed by mixing colours according to shape rules encoded in the pattern. I'm seeing two different modes: horizontal arrangement, where the output is wide and a vertical arrangement where the output is taller.\n\nAs I zero in, the lightbulb moment arrives! It all boils down to two key steps:\n1.  **Find the pattern and structure**: The pattern blocks define a sequence. I interpret their pixel values.\n2.  **Repetitive Structure**: For each example, the logic remains the same (pattern -> grid, colour -> pattern elements). I just had to figure out what was repeating, which was always the output, or the color mapping. I also have to account for any spatial displacement or offset. If I can, then I can repeat this process for any input. I need to do this for the test input!\n3.  **Validate**: Verify the process.\n\nI finally feel confident, and let\u2019s get to work! I'm ready to solve the test input and get this done.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform an input grid into an output grid based on patterns found in solved examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Task:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:**\n    The input grid is divided into four distinct sections (blocks) by separator lines of `1`s (blue).\n    *   **Block 1 (Pattern A):** Contains a shape made of yellow pixels (`4`) on a black background (`0`).\n    *   **Block 2 (Pattern B):** Contains a shape made of green pixels (`3`) on a black background (`0`).\n    *   **Block 3 (Color A):** A block of solid color. This defines the primary color for the output.\n    *   **Block 4 (Color B):** A block of solid color. This defines the secondary/background color for the output.\n\n2.  **Transformation Logic:**\n    The output grid is constructed by combining the shape from Block 1 with the repetition pattern from Block 2, using the colors from Block 3 and Block 4.\n\n    *   **Color Mapping:**\n        *   Pixels corresponding to the yellow shape (`4`) in Block 1 are rendered in **Color A** (from Block 3).\n        *   Pixels corresponding to the black background (`0`) in Block 1 are rendered in **Color B** (from Block 4).\n        *   Any \"spacer\" inserted by Block 2 is rendered in **Color B**.\n\n    *   **Pattern Extraction:**\n        *   **Pattern A:** We extract the relevant rows and columns containing the yellow pixels from Block 1 (the bounding box). Let's call the processed row `R_i` where `4` becomes `Color A` and `0` becomes `Color B`.\n        *   **Pattern B:** We extract the sequence of green pixels (`3`) from Block 2. This sequence acts as a \"layout instruction\" for each row.\n            *   A `3` in the sequence means \"Place a copy of `R_i`\".\n            *   A `0` (gap) in the sequence means \"Place a 1-pixel wide spacer of `Color B`\".\n\n    *   **Construction:**\n        *   For each row of Pattern A, we generate a corresponding row in the output.\n        *   We traverse the sequence derived from Pattern B.\n        *   If the sequence element is `Block` (derived from `3`), we append the current row of Pattern A.\n        *   If the sequence element is `Spacer` (derived from `0`), we append a single pixel of Color B.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Blocks:**\n    *   The test input uses vertical separators (columns of `1`s), so the blocks are arranged horizontally.\n    *   **Block 1 (Pattern A):** Yellow shape.\n    *   **Block 2 (Pattern B):** Green shape.\n    *   **Block 3 (Color A):** Contains `5`s (Grey). So **Color A = 5**.\n    *   **Block 4 (Color B):** Contains `2`s (Red). So **Color B = 2**.\n\n2.  **Process Pattern A (Yellow):**\n    *   Looking at the grid, the yellow shape spans rows 1 to 5.\n    *   The columns involved are 1, 2, 3, 4 (relative to the block).\n    *   We map `4` -> `5` (Grey) and `0` -> `2` (Red).\n    *   **Row 1:** `0 4 4 0 4 0` -> crop cols 1-4 -> `4 4 0 4` -> Map: `5 5 2 5`\n    *   **Row 2:** `0 0 4 0 4 0` -> crop cols 1-4 -> `0 4 0 4` -> Map: `2 5 2 5`\n    *   **Row 3:** `0 0 4 4 4 0` -> crop cols 1-4 -> `0 4 4 4` -> Map: `2 5 5 5`\n    *   **Row 4:** `0 0 4 0 4 0` -> crop cols 1-4 -> `0 4 0 4` -> Map: `2 5 2 5`\n    *   **Row 5:** `0 4 4 0 4 0` -> crop cols 1-4 -> `4 4 0 4` -> Map: `5 5 2 5`\n\n3.  **Process Pattern B (Green):**\n    *   The green shape is identical on the populated rows (1, 3, 5).\n    *   Row data: `0 0 3 3 0 3 3 0`.\n    *   The non-zero pixels are at columns 2, 3, 5, 6.\n    *   Bounding box columns: 2 to 6.\n    *   Sequence extracted: `3 3 0 3 3`.\n    *   Interpretation: `Block`, `Block`, `Spacer`, `Block`, `Block`.\n\n4.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   For each row `i` (1 to 5), construct the line: `[R_i] [R_i] [Spacer] [R_i] [R_i]`.\n    *   `Spacer` is `2` (Red).\n\n    *   **Output Row 1 (using R1 `5 5 2 5`):**\n        `5,5,2,5` + `5,5,2,5` + `2` + `5,5,2,5` + `5,5,2,5`\n        Result: `5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5`\n\n    *   **Output Row 2 (using R2 `2 5 2 5`):**\n        `2,5,2,5` + `2,5,2,5` + `2` + `2,5,2,5` + `2,5,2,5`\n        Result: `2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5`\n\n    *   **Output Row 3 (using R3 `2 5 5 5`):**\n        `2,5,5,5` + `2,5,5,5` + `2` + `2,5,5,5` + `2,5,5,5`\n        Result: `2,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,5,5,5`\n\n    *   **Output Row 4:** Same as Row 2.\n    *   **Output Row 5:** Same as Row 1.\n\n5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5\n2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5\n2,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,5,5,5\n2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5\n5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**General Strategy and Implementation**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to crack this ARC problem. Here's my thought process: I'm seeing grids. They're split up by these \"1\" lines which are definitely separators. Sections between the separators look like patterns or solid colors. The output grids have just two main colors in them, sometimes in repeating patterns. My first step is to break down the structure of each input grid.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\nI start with Example 1. It's got four sections stacked on top of each other. The first section looks like a pattern of yellow \"4\"s on black (\"0\"). Then, I have the separating line. The next section is a pattern of green \"3\"s, also on black. Next comes a solid red (\"2\") block, followed by a solid maroon (\"9\") block.\n\nThe output looks weird at first. It's 5x2. The output seems to use the colors of those last two solid blocks, red and maroon.  However, looking more closely at the image of the output, I can see what is likely the pattern. The output in Example 1 has the pattern \"22222\" and \"29929.\"  It is a small, tall vertical pattern.\n\n**Deeper Dive, Example 2 and Horizontal Orientation:**\n\nExample 2 is different: the sections are horizontally arranged. It has separators as vertical \"1\" columns. The first part has a yellow \"4\" pattern. Then there's the separator. Next, a green \"3\" pattern. The output text is: \"8883\" and \"3833.\" The output is horizontal and smaller. The \"3\" and \"8\" are colors. Again, I look at the image for more clues. I confirm a color pattern.\n\nReading the input grid again reveals key information.  The last two sections are solid blocks of colors, which I'll call C and D.  In Example 2, the last blocks are teal (8) and green (3). And I notice the pattern: the first two input blocks define a shape, and the last two identify the colors that define the output pattern. I go back to the text and input dimensions, and read more closely.\n\nThe inputs are composed of solid color sections that are the palette for the shape that is defined by the first two sections.\nThe first two sections in the examples contain shapes within them.  The last sections give the two colors.\n*   Shape 1 (first section).\n*   Shape 2 (second section).\n*   Color 1 (third section).\n*   Color 2 (fourth section).\n\n**Hypothesis Development: Pattern and Width Relationships:**\n\nI realize that shapes, in each case, seem to define an area of colors. I need a way to combine these to generate an output pattern. The idea of *width* of the input patterns is essential.\n\nI analyze output patterns of Example 2. It has color 8 and color 3 in a 3x11 output grid.  The number of rows in the output looks at first to be linked to the heights of the shapes in the input. And the width looks to combine the widths of the shapes in the input, too. I try this out, and it's not straightforward. I must look at the number of bits in a line, or a \"tile,\" and see how they map to output pattern length.\n\n**Refining the Theory and Building a Repeating Element**\n\nI look at *repeat* cycles, building output patterns one row at a time. The test grid image is a *repeating pattern* where a *Tile* is constructed, and repeated. I examine how the patterns interlock.\n- Build a Tile that defines which output bits contain a Color.\n- The Tile repeats, and defines the final output grid.\n- Tile has one color from solid block in the input.\n\n**Deconstructing Example 4**\n\nI work backward. Example 4, a Horizontal example, reveals more details.\n*   B=303\n*   A=444\n*   The Output, and an alternating repeat of the color!\n\n**Key Insights from the Test Input, and Refined Algorithm**\n\nI think about the Test Input. It's the key.\n\n*   Width 7 grid of Green 3.\n*   Block 1 has yellow shape.\n*   Block 3 is Gray, block 4 is Red.\n\nIt reveals a clear set of rules for horizontal arrangements:\n1.  **Block 1 (A) + Block 2 (B):** Generate the pattern.\n2.  **Widths** Crop A (Bounding Box) determines segment to map to Colors.\n3.  **Construct Pattern B (W_B)** The width of B is\n\nThe solution involves analyzing the structure of the input grid, which is divided into sections by separators (lines of `1`s). For the horizontal examples (2, 3, 4) and the test input, the logic is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Blocks**: The input is divided into four main blocks by vertical columns of `1`s.\n    *   **Block 1 (Pattern A)**: Contains a shape/pattern in a specific color (e.g., yellow `4`).\n    *   **Block 2 (Pattern B)**: Defines the repetition/tiling structure.\n    *   **Block 3 (Color C)**: Defines the \"Foreground\" color for the output.\n    *   **Block 4 (Color D)**: Defines the \"Background\" or \"Separator\" color for the output.\n\n2.  **Analyze Pattern A**:\n    *   We determine the **bounding box** of the non-zero pixels in Pattern A. We crop the grid to the minimum and maximum column indices that contain any non-zero pixels across all rows.\n    *   Let the width of this cropped segment be $W_A$.\n\n3.  **Analyze Pattern B**:\n    *   The specific pixels in Pattern B do not map directly. Instead, the **width** of Block 2, $W_B$, determines the repetition pattern.\n    *   The repetition pattern is an alternating sequence of `1`s and `0`s of length $W_B$, starting with `1`. (e.g., if width is 3, pattern is `1, 0, 1`).\n    *   `1` represents \"Place Pattern A Segment\". `0` represents \"Place Separator Color\".\n\n4.  **Construct Output Rows**:\n    *   We process only the rows from Block 1 that contain parts of the pattern (trimming empty top and bottom rows).\n    *   For each active row:\n        1.  Extract the segment within the bounding box calculated in Step 2.\n        2.  Map the pixels in this segment: Non-zero values become **Color C** (Foreground), and `0`s become **Color D** (Background).\n        3.  Construct the output row using the repetition pattern from Step 3. For every `1` in the pattern, append the mapped segment. For every `0`, append a single pixel of **Color D**.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Block 1 (Pattern A)**: Yellow `4`s.\n    *   Active rows are 1 through 5.\n    *   Bounding Box: Scanning the rows, the `4`s appear between column indices 1 and 4 (inclusive). So, the cropped segments have width $W_A = 4$.\n    *   Segments:\n        *   Row 1: `4,4,0,4`\n        *   Row 2: `0,4,0,4`\n        *   Row 3: `0,4,4,4`\n        *   Row 4: `0,4,0,4`\n        *   Row 5: `4,4,0,4`\n*   **Block 2 (Pattern B)**: Green `3`s.\n    *   The block is 7 columns wide.\n    *   Repetition Pattern: `1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1` (Length 7). This means `Segment, Separator, Segment, Separator, Segment, Separator, Segment`.\n*   **Block 3 (Color C)**: Gray `5`.\n*   **Block 4 (Color D)**: Red `2`.\n\n**Generating Output**:\n*   **Map**: `4` -> `5`, `0` -> `2`. Separator is `2`.\n*   **Row 1**: Segment `4404` -> `5525`.\n    *   Pattern: `5525` + `2` + `5525` + `2` + `5525` + `2` + `5525`.\n*   **Row 2**: Segment `0404` -> `2525`.\n    *   Pattern: `2525` + `2` + `2525` + `2` + `2525` + `2` + `2525`.\n*   **Row 3**: Segment `0444` -> `2555`.\n    *   Pattern: `2555` + `2` + `2555` + `2` + `2555` + `2` + `2555`.\n*   **Row 4**: Same as Row 2.\n*   **Row 5**: Same as Row 1.\n\nThe resulting grid has 5 rows and 19 columns ($4 \\times 4 + 3 = 19$).\n\n5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5\n2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5\n2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5\n2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5\n5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**High\u2011level reconstruction of the rule**\n\n1. Every training input is divided by separator lines of color `1` into four zones:\n   - a zone containing a shape in color `4`\n   - a zone containing a shape in color `3`\n   - a solid rectangle of some color A\n   - a solid rectangle of some color B\n\n2. The two shapes (the \u201c4\u2011shape\u201d and the \u201c3\u2011shape\u201d) are examples of polyomino pieces.  \n   The last two zones do not add new geometry; they simply provide the two colors to be\n   used in the output.\n\n3. The output is a tiling made by combining those two shapes.  \n   The geometry of the combined tiling is fixed by the particular pair of shapes;\n   the colors used in the tiling are always taken from the last two rectangles (A and B),\n   ignoring the original colors 3 and 4.\n\n4. Vertically\u2011stacked examples (like example 1) produce a tall, narrow tiling;\n   horizontally\u2011arranged examples (examples 2\u20134 and the test) produce a short,\n   wide tiling.  \n   The height of the tiling equals the vertical size of the 4\u2011shape\u2019s bounding box.\n\n5. For the new test case:\n   - the 4\u2011shape occupies rows 2\u20136 and columns 2\u20135: its bounding box is 5 rows tall,\n     so the output must have height 5.\n   - the last two uniform rectangles are color `5` followed by color `2`,\n     so those are the two colors used in the output.\n\n   Thus the output must be a 5\u2011row tiling using only colors `5` and `2`.\n\n6. To be consistent with how the training outputs look (interlocking blocks filling a\n   rectangle), we construct a 5\u00d725 rectangular tiling that alternates the two colors\n   in a symmetric, interlocking pattern analogous to the style seen in examples 2\u20134.\n\n---\n\n### Final output grid\n\n(5 rows, 25 columns)\n\n```text\n5,5,2,2,5,5,2,2,5,5,2,2,5,5,2,2,5,5,2,2,5,5,2,2,5\n5,2,2,2,5,2,2,2,5,2,2,2,5,2,2,2,5,2,2,2,5,2,2,2,5\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n5,2,2,2,5,2,2,2,5,2,2,2,5,2,2,2,5,2,2,2,5,2,2,2,5\n5,5,2,2,5,5,2,2,5,5,2,2,5,5,2,2,5,5,2,2,5,5,2,2,5\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Structure of the inputs**\n\n   In all examples the input grid is divided (by full rows/columns of color `1`) into:\n   - a **shape prototype** made of color `4`,\n   - a **counter section** made of several disconnected blobs of color `3`,\n   - two large solid **rectangles** of new colors (call them `A` then `B`).\n\n   Example\u202f1 is vertical (separating rows), Examples\u202f2\u20134 and the test are horizontal\n   (separating columns).\n\n2. **What the output shows**\n\n   - The output uses **only the colors of the two rectangles**.\n   - The detailed pattern inside the output is always a recoloring of the **4\u2011shape**.\n   - The number of repetitions of this pattern comes from the **number of connected\n     components of color `3`** in the counter section.\n   - For horizontal cases, the pattern is repeated horizontally; for the vertical\n     case (Example\u202f1) it\u2019s repeated vertically.\n\n3. **Extracting the pattern (tile)**\n\n   For horizontal problems (Examples\u202f2\u20134):\n\n   - Look at the region **left of the first vertical column of 1s**.\n   - Take the bounding box of all cells with color `4` there.\n   - This rectangle of 0s and 4s is the **prototype pattern**.\n   - Recolor it:\n     - every `4` \u2192 color of the **first rectangle** (`A`),\n     - every `0` \u2192 color of the **second rectangle** (`B`).\n   - Append one extra column filled with color `B` to the right of this\n     recolored pattern.\n   - This gives a **tile** whose size is  \n     `height = (#rows that contain 4 in the prototype)`  \n     `width  = (prototype width + 1)`.\n\n   Checking on the examples:\n   - Ex2: prototype 3\u00d73 \u2192 tile 3\u00d74, colors (8,3).\n   - Ex3: prototype 4\u00d73 \u2192 tile 4\u00d74, colors (6,4).\n   - Ex4: prototype 2\u00d73 \u2192 tile 2\u00d74, colors (2,8).\n   - Ex1 (vertical): prototype 2\u00d72; we append a **row** of color `B` instead\n     of a column, getting a 3\u00d72 tile, then repeat vertically.\n\n4. **How many times to repeat the tile**\n\n   - Isolate the **3\u2011section** between the first and second separators of `1`s.\n   - Count the number of **4\u2011connected components** (blobs) of color `3`\n     in that region. Call this number `n`.\n   - In all training examples, the output length in the repetition direction is:\n     `output_length = tile_length * n \u2013 1`  \n     (i.e. repeat the tile `n` times and then discard the last column or row).\n\n   Example checks:\n   - Ex2: 3 blobs of `3` \u2192 3 tiles of width 4 \u2192 4\u00b73\u22121 = 11 columns.\n   - Ex3: 4 blobs \u2192 4 tiles of width 4 \u2192 15 columns.\n   - Ex4: 2 blobs \u2192 2 tiles of width 4 \u2192 7 columns.\n   - Ex1: 2 blobs vertically \u2192 2 tiles of height 3 \u2192 5 rows.\n\n5. **Apply to the test input**\n\n   **a. Orientation**\n\n   The separators are full vertical columns of `1`s (at columns 7, 15, 24), so we\n   apply the **horizontal** version.\n\n   **b. Prototype from color 4 (left of first 1)**\n\n   Region left of column 7. The `4` cells there have bounding box rows 2\u20136,\n   columns 2\u20135:\n\n   ```\n   4 4 0 4\n   0 4 0 4\n   0 4 4 4\n   0 4 0 4\n   4 4 0 4\n   ```\n\n   So the prototype is this 5\u00d74 matrix of 4s and 0s.\n\n   **c. Rectangle colors**\n\n   To the right of the 3\u2011section we have:\n   - first big rectangle: color `5` (columns 16\u201323),\n   - second rectangle: color `2` (columns 25\u201329).\n\n   So `A = 5`, `B = 2`.\n\n   **d. Recolor the prototype and form the tile**\n\n   Map 4\u21925, 0\u21922:\n\n   ```\n   5 5 2 5\n   2 5 2 5\n   2 5 5 5\n   2 5 2 5\n   5 5 2 5\n   ```\n\n   Append a column of `2` on the right:\n\n   Tile (5\u00d75):\n\n   ```\n   5 5 2 5 2\n   2 5 2 5 2\n   2 5 5 5 2\n   2 5 2 5 2\n   5 5 2 5 2\n   ```\n\n   So tile height = 5, tile width = 5.\n\n   **e. Count blobs of color 3**\n\n   The 3\u2011section lies between columns 8 and 14.\n   Its non\u2011zero part (color 3) is:\n\n   - row2: (9,10) and (12,13),\n   - row4: (9,10) and (12,13),\n   - row6: (9,10) and (12,13).\n\n   Each horizontal pair is a separate 4\u2011connected component, and there is a blank\n   row between these rows, so no vertical connections.  \n   Thus we have **6 components of color 3** \u2192 `n = 6`.\n\n   **f. Output size**\n\n   - Height = tile height = 5.\n   - Width  = tile width \u00b7 n \u2212 1 = 5\u00b76 \u2212 1 = 29.\n\n   So we repeat the 5\u00d75 tile 6 times horizontally (width 30) and then remove the\n   last column, leaving width 29.\n\n   Resulting rows:\n\n   - Row1: `[5,5,2,5,2]` repeated 6 times minus last entry:\n     `5,5,2,5,2, 5,5,2,5,2, 5,5,2,5,2, 5,5,2,5,2, 5,5,2,5,2, 5,5,2,5`\n   - Row2: `[2,5,2,5,2]` similarly:\n     `2,5,2,5,2, 2,5,2,5,2, 2,5,2,5,2, 2,5,2,5,2, 2,5,2,5,2, 2,5,2,5`\n   - Row3: `[2,5,5,5,2]`:\n     `2,5,5,5,2, 2,5,5,5,2, 2,5,5,5,2, 2,5,5,5,2, 2,5,5,5,2, 2,5,5,5`\n   - Row4: same as Row2.\n   - Row5: same as Row1.\n\n---\n\n**Final output grid**\n\nRow-wise, comma-separated:\n\n5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5  \n2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5  \n2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5  \n2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5  \n5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5",

            "Full raw LLM response": "The given inputs are four rectangular blocks separated by solid lines of color\u202f1. The first block contains a shape; the third and fourth blocks are solid and only provide two colors. The second block tells you how many times to repeat the shape.\n\nThe procedure that fits all the examples is:\n\n- Detect whether the separators are full rows or full columns of 1\u2019s to determine orientation.\n- Extract the first block and take the minimal bounding box around its non\u2011zero cells. Within that box, build a base tile: wherever the first block has a cell, put the color from the third block; wherever it is empty, put the color from the fourth block.\n- Count the number of 4\u2011connected components of non\u2011zero cells in the second block; this is the number of tiles to place.\n- Construct the output by repeating the base tile that many times along the orientation of the original blocks. Insert a separator of thickness one (a full row if tiling vertically, or a full column if tiling horizontally) filled with the fourth block\u2019s color between tiles. The height or width perpendicular to the tiling direction is just the base tile size in that dimension.\n\nFor the test input the separators are vertical, so we tile horizontally. The base tile derived from the first block is\n\n```\n5 5 2 5\n2 5 2 5\n2 5 5 5\n2 5 2 5\n5 5 2 5\n```\n\nThe second block has six disconnected bar components, so the tile is repeated six times with single\u2011column separators of color\u202f2. The resulting 5\u00d729 output grid is:\n\n5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5\n2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5\n2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5\n2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5\n5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5",

            "Full raw LLM response": "To solve this puzzle, I first examined the solved examples. The important structure in each input is four rectangular \u201csegments\u201d separated by lines of color\u202f1. The third and fourth segments are always solid blocks of a single color; those two colors are the only ones that appear in the output. The first segment contains a non\u2011zero shape on a zero background; the second segment is a distractor and is not used.\n\nFrom the examples you can derive the following procedure:\n\n- Decide the orientation: if the segments are side by side separated by vertical lines of 1s, you tile horizontally; if they are stacked with horizontal separators, you tile vertically.\n- Extract the bounding box of non\u2011zero cells in the first segment. Let its height be \\(H\\) and width \\(W\\), and let its binary mask indicate where the shape has cells.\n- Let \\(A\\) be the color from the solid third segment, and \\(B\\) be the color from the solid fourth segment.\n- Build a \u201ctile\u201d: for horizontal tiling, make a tile of height \\(H\\) and width \\(W+1\\), fill it with \\(B\\), then in the left \\(W\\) columns overwrite positions where the mask is 1 with \\(A\\). For vertical tiling, make a tile of width \\(W\\) and height \\(H+1\\), fill with \\(B\\), and overwrite the top \\(H\\) rows according to the mask with \\(A\\).\n- Repeat this tile along the tiling direction a number of times equal to \\(H\\) (if tiling horizontally) or \\(W\\) (if tiling vertically), and finally drop the last column (horizontal) or last row (vertical). This yields an output of size \\(H\\) by \\((W+1)H-1\\) for horizontal tiling, or \\((H+1)W-1\\) by \\(W\\) for vertical tiling.\n\nFor the test input, the segments are side by side. The first segment\u2019s shape has a bounding box of height\u202f5 and width\u202f4 with the mask:\n```\n1 1 0 1\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1\n```\nThe third segment color is\u202f5 and the fourth segment color is\u202f2. The horizontal tile is therefore 5\u00d75, filled with 2 and with 5s in the mask positions in columns\u202f1\u20134:\n```\n5 5 2 5 2\n2 5 2 5 2\n2 5 5 5 2\n2 5 2 5 2\n5 5 2 5 2\n```\nRepeating this tile 5 times across and removing the final column gives a 5\u00d724 output. The completed output grid is:\n\n5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5\n2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5\n2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5\n2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5\n5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's my thought process:**\n\nI'm tackling this ARC task.  I see a pattern of sections divided by '1's. The crucial part is figuring out how these sections combine. I initially try mapping patterns like \"4,4\", \"4,0\", but that doesn't immediately click. The \"spatial inverse\" hint is intriguing, and I try to interpret it directly, but it leads to a dead end. I realize the key is that these masks *tile*, and I'm extracting a tile that's being repeated. I work through the example inputs and notice a pattern where one mask color defines a shape (like an 'I') and the other is the background (inverse). I then start to test this hypothesis by seeing if the input patterns (the \"masks\") can be interpreted as tiling units that are applied with each color. The dimensions of the output are derived from the block dimensions in an interesting fashion, leading to further investigations. After struggling with output dimensions, I make the key discovery - the masks are actually *cropping windows* to an underlying infinite pattern. The solid block dimensions actually indicate the size of the \"output window\" into that pattern. At some point, I find a formula to help determine output size and am able to generate the tile from the pattern and apply it to an output. Now, I see that this seems to match every example, so I'm confident. I go over the output one last time to test the logic. It's time to generate the output now.\n\n\nThe input consists of four sections separated by blue lines (1s).\n1.  **Mask 1**: A shape pattern using color 4 (yellow) on a background of 0.\n2.  **Mask 2**: A shape pattern using color 3 (green) on a background of 0.\n3.  **Color Block 1**: A solid block of a specific color (Color 1).\n4.  **Color Block 2**: A solid block of a specific color (Color 2).\n\n**Reasoning Process:**\n1.  **Pattern Extraction**: The output is a tessellation formed by a specific tile. This tile is defined by the pattern in **Mask 1**. We identify the \"bounding box\" of the non-zero pixels in Mask 1.\n    *   In the Test Input, Mask 1 (Section 1) contains 4s.\n    *   Extracting the rows/cols containing 4s yields a 5x4 pattern:\n        ```\n        4,4,0,4\n        0,4,0,4\n        0,4,4,4\n        0,4,0,4\n        4,4,0,4\n        ```\n2.  **Color Mapping**:\n    *   The \"foreground\" of the mask (pixels with value 4) maps to **Color 1** (from Section 3). In the Test Input, Section 3 contains 5s (Grey).\n    *   The \"background\" of the mask (pixels with value 0) maps to **Color 2** (from Section 4). In the Test Input, Section 4 contains 2s (Red).\n    *   Applying this mapping to the extracted pattern creates the **Tile**:\n        ```\n        5,5,2,5\n        2,5,2,5\n        2,5,5,5\n        2,5,2,5\n        5,5,2,5\n        ```\n3.  **Output Dimensions**: The dimensions of the output grid are derived from the dimensions of the solid color blocks in Sections 3 and 4.\n    *   **Height**: The height of the output is the height of the color blocks minus 2 (accounting for the separator lines).\n        *   Test Input blocks are 7 rows high. Output Height = 7 - 2 = **5**. (This also matches the height of the extracted tile pattern).\n    *   **Width**: The width is determined by the sum of the widths of the two color blocks relative to the tile width. Analyzing the examples, the width follows the pattern `Width = n * TileWidth + Remainder`, roughly approximating the sum of the block widths.\n        *   Test Input Block widths are 8 and 5. Sum = 13.\n        *   Tile Width is 4.\n        *   Comparing to Example 3 (Sum 13, Tile Width 4 -> Output Width 15), we infer the same relationship.\n        *   Calculation: `3 * TileWidth (4) + 3 = 15`. This maintains the periodicity seen in the examples.\n        *   So, Output Width = **15**.\n4.  **Tessellation**: We fill the 5x15 output grid by repeating the 5x4 tile.\n    *   The grid accommodates 3 full tiles (columns 1-12) and a partial tile (the first 3 columns) for columns 13-15.\n\n**Output Generation:**\n*   **Rows**: 5\n*   **Columns**: 15\n*   **Pattern**: Repetition of the sequence `5,5,2,5` (Row 1), `2,5,2,5` (Row 2), etc., truncated at length 15.\n\nRow 1: `5,5,2,5` repeated -> `5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,2`\nRow 2: `2,5,2,5` repeated -> `2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2`\nRow 3: `2,5,5,5` repeated -> `2,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5,5`\nRow 4: `2,5,2,5` repeated -> `2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2`\nRow 5: `5,5,2,5` repeated -> `5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,2`\n\n5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,2\n2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2\n2,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5,5\n2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2\n5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,2",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this task:**\n\nI'm being asked to solve an ARC task, given examples and a test input. I need to figure out the rules.\n\n**Initial Approach:** I'll start by analyzing the structure of the input grids, looking for patterns in how they're built and how they relate to the output. I'm focusing on the examples first. It appears to me that the input is divided into blocks by blue lines, with \"shape masks\" and \"color sources\" contained within the blocks. The dimensions of the output seem related to the size of the \"solid color blocks\" mentioned in the hints, which is good.\n\n**Decomposing the problem:**\n1.  **Understand the input format.**  Are the inputs always split into sections like this, or is it coincidental in these examples? I must understand the block separator behavior.\n2.  **Determine how the output is generated.** I must work out what happens with these shape masks and the solid color blocks. Hints state \"schematic divided by blue lines\". I have to consider the solid rectangle hint. \"The dimensions of the final output are determined by the size of the solid color blocks in the input.\" I need to see how the blocks map to the output pattern.\n3.  **Find the underlying pattern.**  I'm looking for a \"unit tile\" or repeating pattern within the output. The hint \"Output is a tessellation\" leads me to believe this exists.  I also need to understand the \"spatial inverses\" hint and how that influences the unit tile.  These hints are really helpful, as are the image descriptions.\n\n**Deeper Analysis:** I've noticed that I can extract \"Unit Tiles\" by looking at the Masks and combining non-zero pixels. I can also generate a unit pattern from it. I need to verify that this is robust and matches all the examples. I'm also finding that the dimensions of the color blocks aren't directly related. They might be used to encode some feature of the output, but the outputs aren't a direct reflection.\n\n**Output Dimension Logic** I'm trying to work out the output dimensions. Based on the \"size of the solid color blocks\" hint, I assumed output width came from adding the color block width. This didn't work. The mask dimensions are interesting, but they don't seem like they directly define the output area. After some investigation, I suspect the output height is calculated by subtracting 2 from the sum of the color block heights. I must try calculating output width using input mask dimensions, or the area of color blocks. I noticed there may be one exception.\n\n**Test Input application:**\nI have an analysis of the test input. It's Mask 1, Separator, Mask 2, Separator, Color 1, Separator, Color 2.\nTest Input Mask 1: Columns 0-5\nTest Input Mask 2: Columns 7-13\nTest Input Color 1: Columns 15-22\nTest Input Color 2: Columns 24-28\nLet's apply.\nTest Input has:\nMask 1 Width=6, Height=7. Color is 5\nMask 2 Width=7, Height=7. Color is 2\nLet's extract tile and generate pattern.\n\n**Final Analysis and Construction:**\nI can apply a formula. I see that the height has to do with the sum of heights minus 2. I have to work out the relationship between Mask W and output W. It looks like \"8 * MW1 + 4 * MW2 - 57\". Test Input: output width 19.\n\n**Tessellation Implementation** I must fill the output with tiles and repeat them to create a solid grid, and write out my result.\n\nThe input consists of two shape masks followed by two solid color blocks, separated by vertical blue lines.\n1.  **Analyze Structure:**\n    *   **Test Input:**\n        *   Mask 1 (M1): Columns 0-5 (Width 6, Height 7).\n        *   Mask 2 (M2): Columns 7-13 (Width 7, Height 7).\n        *   Color 1 (C1): Columns 15-22 (Width 8, Height 7). Value 5 (Grey).\n        *   Color 2 (C2): Columns 24-28 (Width 5, Height 7). Value 2 (Red).\n2.  **Determine Output Dimensions:**\n    *   **Height:** In Examples 2, 3, and 4, the Output Height is always `Input Height - 2`.\n        *   Test Input Height is 7. Output Height = $7 - 2 = 5$.\n    *   **Width:** The Output Width ($W_{out}$) relates to the **Mask Widths** ($MW1, MW2$) linearly.\n        *   Example 2: $MW1=5, MW2=7 \\rightarrow W_{out}=11$.\n        *   Example 4: $MW1=5, MW2=6 \\rightarrow W_{out}=7$.\n        *   Example 3: $MW1=6, MW2=6 \\rightarrow W_{out}=15$.\n        *   Solving for $W_{out} = A \\cdot MW1 + B \\cdot MW2 + C$:\n            *   Comparing Ex 2 and Ex 4 (MW1 constant): $\\Delta MW2 = -1 \\rightarrow \\Delta W_{out} = -4$. So $B = 4$.\n            *   Using Ex 4 ($5A + 24 + C = 7$) and Ex 3 ($6A + 24 + C = 15$): $\\Delta MW1 = +1 \\rightarrow \\Delta W_{out} = +8$. So $A = 8$.\n            *   Solving for C: $40 + 24 + C = 7 \\rightarrow C = -57$.\n        *   Formula: $W_{out} = 8 \\cdot MW1 + 4 \\cdot MW2 - 57$.\n        *   Test Input: $MW1=6, MW2=7$.\n        *   $W_{out} = 8(6) + 4(7) - 57 = 48 + 28 - 57 = 19$.\n    *   **Target Size:** 19 columns x 5 rows.\n3.  **Determine Unit Tile Pattern:**\n    *   The unit tile is derived from the non-zero pattern in Mask 1 (mapped to Color 1) and its inverse (Color 2).\n    *   Extract pattern from M1 columns 1-4 (ignoring padding column 0).\n    *   M1 Row 1: `0,4,4,0,4,0` $\\rightarrow$ indices 1..4 are `4,4,0,4`. Pattern: `1,1,0,1`. Map to colors: `5,5,2,5`.\n    *   M1 Row 2: `0,0,4,0,4,0` $\\rightarrow$ `0,4,0,4`. Pattern: `0,1,0,1`. Map: `2,5,2,5`.\n    *   M1 Row 3: `0,0,4,4,4,0` $\\rightarrow$ `0,4,4,4`. Pattern: `0,1,1,1`. Map: `2,5,5,5`.\n    *   M1 Row 4: `0,0,4,0,4,0` $\\rightarrow$ `0,4,0,4`. Pattern: `0,1,0,1`. Map: `2,5,2,5`.\n    *   M1 Row 5 repeats Row 1.\n    *   **Unit Tile (4x4):**\n        ```\n        5,5,2,5\n        2,5,2,5\n        2,5,5,5\n        2,5,2,5\n        ```\n4.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   Tile the 4x4 pattern to fill the 19x5 grid.\n    *   Width 19 corresponds to 4 full tiles + 3 columns ($19 \\pmod 4 = 3$).\n    *   Height 5 corresponds to 1 full tile height + 1 row ($5 \\pmod 4 = 1$).\n\n**Output Generation:**\n*   **Row 0:** Tile Row 0 repeated. Ends with `5,5,2`.\n*   **Row 1:** Tile Row 1 repeated. Ends with `2,5,2`.\n*   **Row 2:** Tile Row 2 repeated. Ends with `2,5,5`.\n*   **Row 3:** Tile Row 3 repeated. Ends with `2,5,2`.\n*   **Row 4:** Tile Row 0 repeated. Ends with `5,5,2`.\n\n5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,2\n2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2\n2,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5,5\n2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2\n5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,2",

Inside that rectangle, build a binary matrix `M`:\n   - `1` where there is a `4`\n   - `0` where there is `0`\n\nLet the size of this bounding box be:\n\n- `H` rows by `W` columns.\n\nExamples:\n\n- Example 2:\n  - Mask 1 (left segment) crops to a 3\u00d73 plus shape:\n    ```\n    1 1 1\n    0 1 0\n    1 1 1\n    ```\n  - So `H = 3`, `W = 3`.\n- Example 3:\n  - Crop of Mask 1 is 4\u00d73:\n    ```\n    1 1 0\n    1 0 0\n    1 1 1\n    0 1 0\n    ```\n  - `H = 4`, `W = 3`.\n- Example 4:\n  - Crop of Mask 1 is 2\u00d73:\n    ```\n    1 1 1\n    1 0 1\n    ```\n  - `H = 2`, `W = 3`.\n- Example 1 (horizontal split):\n  - Crop of Mask 1 is 2\u00d72:\n    ```\n    1 1\n    1 0\n    ```\n  - `H = 2`, `W = 2`.\n\n### 2.2 Build a \u201csuper-tile\u201d from Mask 1\n\nNext, we turn `M` into a slightly larger tile `T` by appending an extra all\u2011zero line **along the tiling direction**:\n\n- If the blue lines are **vertical** (we will tile **horizontally**):\n  - Append one all\u2011zero **column on the right**:\n    - `T` has size `H \u00d7 (W+1)`.\n- If the blue lines are **horizontal** (we will tile **vertically**):\n  - Append one all\u2011zero **row at the bottom**:\n    - `T` has size `(H+1) \u00d7 W`.\n\nThe 1\u2019s in `T` correspond to Mask\u20111\u2011cells; the appended zero column/row plus the zeros inside the original mask correspond to the \u201cother\u201d mask\u2019s area.\n\nChecking against the examples with vertical splits:\n\n- Example 2: `H=3, W=3`\n  - `M`:\n    ```\n    1 1 1\n    0 1 0\n    1 1 1\n    ```\n  - `T` (append zero column):\n    ```\n    1 1 1 0\n    0 1 0 0\n    1 1 1 0\n    ```\n- Example 3: `H=4, W=3`\n  - `M`:\n    ```\n    1 1 0\n    1 0 0\n    1 1 1\n    0 1 0\n    ```\n  - `T`:\n    ```\n    1 1 0 0\n    1 0 0 0\n    1 1 1 0\n    0 1 0 0\n    ```\n- Example 4: `H=2, W=3`\n  - `M`:\n    ```\n    1 1 1\n    1 0 1\n    ```\n  - `T`:\n    ```\n    1 1 1 0\n    1 0 1 0\n    ```\n\nExample 1 (horizontal split) shows the same logic but with a **row** appended at the bottom and tiling vertically.\n\n### 2.3 Tiling rule and output size\n\nNow we tile this super\u2011tile `T` repeatedly along one axis:\n\n- With **vertical blue lines** (Examples 2\u20134, test):\n  - We tile `T` **horizontally**.\n  - The number of horizontal copies, `N`, is equal to `H` (the height of Mask 1\u2019s bounding box).\n  - We then remove the very last column (which is always 0 anyway), so:\n    - Output height: `H`\n    - Output width: `N * (W+1) - 1 = H * (W+1) - 1`\n- With **horizontal blue lines** (Example 1):\n  - We tile `T` **vertically**.\n  - The number of vertical copies `N` is equal to `W` (the width of Mask 1\u2019s bounding box).\n  - Remove the very last row:\n    - Output width: `W`\n    - Output height: `N * (H+1) - 1 = W * (H+1) - 1`\n\nIn every given example this matches exactly:\n\n- Example 2:\n  - `H=3, W=3` \u2192 `T` is 3\u00d74, `N=H=3`\n  - Output 3\u00d7(3*4\u22121) = 3\u00d711 as observed.\n- Example 3:\n  - `H=4, W=3` \u2192 `T` is 4\u00d74, `N=4`\n  - Output 4\u00d7(4*4\u22121) = 4\u00d715 as observed.\n- Example 4:\n  - `H=2, W=3` \u2192 `T` is 2\u00d74, `N=2`\n  - Output 2\u00d7(2*4\u22121) = 2\u00d77 as observed.\n- Example 1 (horizontal split):\n  - `H=2, W=2` \u2192 `T` is 3\u00d72, `N=W=2`\n  - Output height = 2*(2+1)\u22121 = 5; width = 2.\n  - Matches the 5\u00d72 output.\n\n### 2.4 Assigning colors\n\nThe binary tiled pattern is then turned into colors:\n\n- `1` \u2192 **Color A** (first solid block\u2019s color).\n- `0` \u2192 **Color B** (second solid block\u2019s color).\n\nAgain, this matches all examples:\n\n- Example 2: Color A = 8, Color B = 3.\n- Example 3: Color A = 6, Color B = 4.\n- Example 4: Color A = 2, Color B = 8.\n- Example 1: Color A = 2, Color B = 9.\n\nSo the second mask and the sizes of the color blocks are mainly confirming orientation and consistency; the *actual tiling pattern* is generated from Mask 1 as described.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Applying the rule to the test input\n\nNow apply the same procedure to the test grid.\n\n### 3.1 Segment the input\n\nWe look for columns full of `1` to split the grid vertically.\n\nTest input has 7 rows and 29 columns. Columns with `1` are:\n\n- Column 6\n- Column 14\n- Column 23\n\nSo we have four vertical regions:\n\n1. Columns 0\u20135: **Mask 1** (using color `4`)\n2. Columns 7\u201313: **Mask 2** (using color `3`) \u2013 not needed for constructing the pattern\n3. Columns 15\u201322: **Solid block 1** (color `5`) \u2192 Color A\n4. Columns 24\u201328: **Solid block 2** (color `2`) \u2192 Color B\n\nConfirm the color blocks:\n\n- Columns 15\u201322: all `5` \u2192 a 7\u00d78 block.\n- Columns 24\u201328: all `2` \u2192 a 7\u00d75 block.\n\nSo the two colors for the output are:\n\n- Color A = 5\n- Color B = 2\n\n### 3.2 Extract Mask 1 and its bounding box\n\nMask 1 region: columns 0\u20135. Write it:\n\nRow 0: `0 0 0 0 0 0`  \nRow 1: `0 4 4 0 4 0`  \nRow 2: `0 0 4 0 4 0`  \nRow 3: `0 0 4 4 4 0`  \nRow 4: `0 0 4 0 4 0`  \nRow 5: `0 4 4 0 4 0`  \nRow 6: `0 0 0 0 0 0`\n\nCoordinates (row, col) of `4`s (0\u2011based within the whole grid):\n\n- Row 1: col 1, 2, 4\n- Row 2: col 2, 4\n- Row 3: col 2, 3, 4\n- Row 4: col 2, 4\n- Row 5: col 1, 2, 4\n\nBounding box of all 4\u2019s:\n\n- Rows: from 1 to 5 \u2192 `H = 5`\n- Columns: from 1 to 4 \u2192 `W = 4`\n\nExtract that 5\u00d74 binary matrix `M` (1 for 4, 0 otherwise):\n\n- Row 1 (cols 1\u20134): `4 4 0 4` \u2192 `1 1 0 1`\n- Row 2:          `0 4 0 4` \u2192 `0 1 0 1`\n- Row 3:          `0 4 4 4` \u2192 `0 1 1 1`\n- Row 4:          `0 4 0 4` \u2192 `0 1 0 1`\n- Row 5:          `4 4 0 4` \u2192 `1 1 0 1`\n\nSo:\n\n```\nM =\n1 1 0 1\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1\n```\n\n### 3.3 Build the super-tile `T`\n\nBecause the split is vertical, we tile horizontally, so we append a **zero column on the right**:\n\n`T` has size 5\u00d7(4+1) = 5\u00d75:\n\nRow 0: `1 1 0 1 0`  \nRow 1: `0 1 0 1 0`  \nRow 2: `0 1 1 1 0`  \nRow 3: `0 1 0 1 0`  \nRow 4: `1 1 0 1 0`\n\n### 3.4 Tiling pattern and output size\n\nFor vertical splits we:\n\n- Tile `T` **horizontally**.\n- Number of tiles `N` = `H` = 5.\n- Output height = `H` = 5.\n- Output width = `N * (W+1) \u2212 1` = `5 * 5 \u2212 1` = 24.\n\nConstruct the 5\u00d724 binary pattern by repeating each row of `T` 5 times and dropping the very last column (which is 0 anyway).\n\nLet each row pattern be length\u20115:\n\n- `P0 = 1 1 0 1 0`\n- `P1 = 0 1 0 1 0`\n- `P2 = 0 1 1 1 0`\n- `P3 = 0 1 0 1 0`\n- `P4 = 1 1 0 1 0`\n\nRepeating each `Pi` 5 times gives length 25; we take the first 24 entries. Equivalently:\n\n- Row 0/4: `P0` repeated 4 times, then the first 4 entries of `P0`.\n- Row 1/3: `P1` repeated 4 times, then the first 4 entries of `P1`.\n- Row 2:   `P2` repeated 4 times, then the first 4 entries of `P2`.\n\nSo the binary matrix (1 = Color A, 0 = Color B) is:\n\nRow 0: `1 1 0 1 0  1 1 0 1 0  1 1 0 1 0  1 1 0 1 0  1 1 0 1`  \nRow 1: `0 1 0 1 0  0 1 0 1 0  0 1 0 1 0  0 1 0 1 0  0 1 0 1`  \nRow 2: `0 1 1 1 0  0 1 1 1 0  0 1 1 1 0  0 1 1 1 0  0 1 1 1`  \nRow 3: same as Row 1  \nRow 4: same as Row 0  \n\n### 3.5 Map binary pattern to colors\n\nRecall:\n\n- Color A = 5 (first solid block)\n- Color B = 2 (second solid block)\n\nSo:\n\n- `1` \u2192 `5`\n- `0` \u2192 `2`\n\nConvert row by row.\n\nRow 0 (1\u21925, 0\u21922):\n\n`1 1 0 1 0  1 1 0 1 0  1 1 0 1 0  1 1 0 1 0  1 1 0 1`\n\nbecomes:\n\n`5,5,2,5,2, 5,5,2,5,2, 5,5,2,5,2, 5,5,2,5,2, 5,5,2,5`\n\n\u2192  \n`5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5`\n\nRow 1:\n\n`0 1 0 1 0  0 1 0 1 0  0 1 0 1 0  0 1 0 1 0  0 1 0 1`\n\n\u2192  \n`2,5,2,5,2, 2,5,2,5,2, 2,5,2,5,2, 2,5,2,5,2, 2,5,2,5`\n\n\u2192  \n`2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5`\n\nRow 2:\n\n`0 1 1 1 0  0 1 1 1 0  0 1 1 1 0  0 1 1 1 0  0 1 1 1`\n\n\u2192  \n`2,5,5,5,2, 2,5,5,5,2, 2,5,5,5,2, 2,5,5,5,2, 2,5,5,5`\n\n\u2192  \n`2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5`\n\nRow 3: same as Row 1.\n\nRow 4: same as Row 0.\n\nSo the final 5\u00d724 output grid is:\n\nRow 0: `5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5`  \nRow 1: `2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5`  \nRow 2: `2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5`  \nRow 3: `2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5`  \nRow 4: `5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5`\n\n---\n\n## 4.

The first block is the shape mask, the third and fourth blocks are solid color sources (5 and 2 respectively).\n\nTrim the mask down to the smallest box that contains its non\u2011zero cells; this yields a 5\u00d74 pattern. Build a tile by filling the mask\u2019s ones with the first color (5) and its zeros with the second color (2):\n```\n5 5 2 5\n2 5 2 5\n2 5 5 5\n2 5 2 5\n5 5 2 5\n```\nWith horizontal layout we place as many tiles side by side as the tile height (5), inserting a single separator column of the second color between tiles.

Interpreting the schematic structure\n\nAcross the vertical examples (2, 3, 4, and the test) the grid is cut into four vertical regions by blue columns (color 1):\n\n- Region 1: leftmost \u2014 **shape mask 1** (non\u2011zero cells are the mask pixels, 4 in the examples).\n- Region 2: next \u2014 **shape mask 2** (non\u2011zero cells are another mask, often 3).\n- Region 3: next \u2014 **color source 1** \u2014 a solid rectangle of a **single color C1**.\n- Region 4: rightmost \u2014 **color source 2** \u2014 a solid rectangle of a **single color C2**.\n\nIn the test input these regions are:\n\n- Columns 1\u20136: mask 1 (using color 4).\n- Column 7: blue separator (1).\n- Columns 8\u201314: mask 2 (using color 3).\n- Column 15: blue separator.\n- Columns 16\u201323: solid color 5 \u2192 **C1 = 5**.\n- Column 24: blue separator.\n- Columns 25\u201329: solid color 2 \u2192 **C2 = 2**.\n\nOverall height \\(H\\) of the grid is 7 rows.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What the training examples show\n\n### 2.1. Height of the tile and the output\n\nIn examples 2\u20134:\n\n- The **color source blocks** for C1 and C2 have the **same height** \\(H\\).\n- If you crop the **top and bottom all\u2011zero rows** off **mask 1**, its height is always \\(H - 2\\).\n- The **output height** equals this cropped mask height:\n\n| Example | H (color blocks) | cropped mask1 height | output height |\n|--------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------|\n| 2      | 5                 | 3                    | 3             |\n| 3      | 6                 | 4                    | 4             |\n| 4      | 4                 | 2                    | 2             |\n\nSo:\n\n> **Tile height = output height = H \u2212 2.**\n\n### 2.2. Mask 1 as a color mask\n\nTake **mask 1**, crop away rows and columns that are all zeros. You get a rectangle whose non\u2011zero cells (4) I treat as 1\u2019s (mask = \u201cuse C1\u201d), and zeros as 0\u2019s (\u201cuse C2\u201d).\n\nIf I fill that cropped rectangle as:\n\n- 1 \u2192 color C1 (from the left solid block),\n- 0 \u2192 color C2 (from the right solid block),\n\nI get a **pattern T1** whose height is \\(H-2\\) and some width \\(w_1\\).\n\nChecking this against the outputs:\n\n- Example 2: mask1 cropped to a 3\u00d73 cross \u2192 filling gives\n\n  ```\n  8 8 8\n  3 8 3\n  8 8 8\n  ```\n\n  which appears as the **first 3 columns** of the repeating 3\u00d74 tile in the output.\n\n- Example 3: mask1 cropped to 4\u00d73 \u2192 filling (6 for 4\u2019s, 4 for 0\u2019s) matches the first 3 columns of the 4\u00d74 repeating tile.\n- Example 4: mask1 cropped to 2\u00d73 \u2192 filling (2 for 4\u2019s, 8 for 0\u2019s) matches first 3 columns of the 2\u00d74 repeating tile.\n\nThus in all vertical examples:\n\n- T1 (cropped mask 1, filled with C1/C2) gives the **left part** of a tile.\n- The tile is one extra column wide, filled entirely with C2.\n\nFormally:\n\n> **Tile pattern P** has height \\(H\u22122\\) and width \\(w_1 + 1\\):  \n> columns 1..\\(w_1\\): T1 (mask1 filled with C1/C2);  \n> column \\(w_1+1\\): all C2.\n\n### 2.3. Horizontal tiling and output width\n\nFrom the vertical examples:\n\n- Let \\(H\\) be the common height of the color blocks.\n- Let tile width \\(W_t = w_1 + 1\\).\n- The outputs are built by **repeating this tile horizontally \\(N = H \u2212 2\\) times**, then **removing the very last column**.\n\nCheck with the examples (all have \\(W_t = 4\\) because mask1\u2019s cropped width is always 3 there):\n\n- Example 2: \\(H = 5\\), \\(N = H\u22122 = 3\\), width \\(= N\u00b7W_t \u2212 1 = 3\u00b74 \u2212 1 = 11\\) \u2192 matches.\n- Example 3: \\(H = 6\\), \\(N = 4\\), width \\(= 4\u00b74 \u2212 1 = 15\\) \u2192 matches.\n- Example 4: \\(H = 4\\), \\(N = 2\\), width \\(= 2\u00b74 \u2212 1 = 7\\) \u2192 matches.\n\nSo general rule for this family:\n\n1. Compute \\(H\\) (height of the input / color blocks).\n2. Crop mask 1 top/bottom & all\u2011zero columns to get a rectangle of size \\((H\u22122) \u00d7 w_1\\).\n3. Build tile \\(P\\) of size \\((H\u22122) \u00d7 (w_1+1)\\):\n   - First \\(w_1\\) columns from the cropped mask (4\u2192C1, 0\u2192C2),\n   - Last column all C2.\n4. Let \\(N = H \u2212 2\\). Horizontally concatenate **N copies** of \\(P\\).\n5. Remove the **final column** \u2192 this is the output.\n\nMask 2 is conceptually the complementary mask (places where we put C2), but operationally you don\u2019t need it once you know \u201czeros of mask1 inside its bounding box get C2\u201d.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Applying the rule to the test input\n\n### 3.1. Basic parameters\n\nFrom the test grid:\n\n- Total height \\(H = 7\\).\n- Color sources:\n  - Source 1 (columns 16\u201323): all 5 \u2192 **C1 = 5**.\n  - Source 2 (columns 25\u201329): all 2 \u2192 **C2 = 2**.\n\nSo:\n\n- **Tile / output height** = \\(H \u2212 2 = 7 \u2212 2 = 5\\).\n\n### 3.2. Crop mask 1\n\nMask 1 = columns 1\u20136:\n\n```\nr1: 0 0 0 0 0 0\nr2: 0 4 4 0 4 0\nr3: 0 0 4 0 4 0\nr4: 0 0 4 4 4 0\nr5: 0 0 4 0 4 0\nr6: 0 4 4 0 4 0\nr7: 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n- Remove all\u2011zero top and bottom rows (r1, r7) \u2192 keep rows 2\u20136 (5 rows = \\(H\u22122\\)).\n- Check each column (within rows 2\u20136):\n\n  - Col1: all zeros \u2192 drop.\n  - Col2: [4,0,0,0,4] \u2192 keep.\n  - Col3: [4,4,4,4,4] \u2192 keep.\n  - Col4: [0,0,4,0,0] \u2192 keep.\n  - Col5: [4,4,4,4,4] \u2192 keep.\n  - Col6: all zeros \u2192 drop.\n\nSo cropped mask 1 is rows 2\u20136, cols 2\u20135:\n\n```\nM1 (5\u00d74):\n\nrow1: 4 4 0 4\nrow2: 0 4 0 4\nrow3: 0 4 4 4\nrow4: 0 4 0 4\nrow5: 4 4 0 4\n```\n\nThus:\n\n- \\(h_1 = 5\\) (height),\n- \\(w_1 = 4\\) (width of cropped mask 1).\n\n### 3.3. Build the base mask\u2011filled block T1\n\nFill M1 using the two solid colors:\n\n- Wherever M1 = 4 \u2192 use **5** (C1).\n- Wherever M1 = 0 \u2192 use **2** (C2).\n\nThat yields T1 (5\u00d74):\n\n```\nT1:\n\nrow1: 5 5 2 5\nrow2: 2 5 2 5\nrow3: 2 5 5 5\nrow4: 2 5 2 5\nrow5: 5 5 2 5\n```\n\n### 3.4. Build the tile P\n\nTile width \\(W_t = w_1 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5\\).\n\nConstruct P of size 5\u00d75 as:\n\n- Columns 1\u20134 = T1,\n- Column 5 = all C2 = 2.\n\nSo:\n\n```\nP (5\u00d75):\n\nrow1: 5 5 2 5 2\nrow2: 2 5 2 5 2\nrow3: 2 5 5 5 2\nrow4: 2 5 2 5 2\nrow5: 5 5 2 5 2\n```\n\n### 3.5. Horizontal tiling and cropping\n\nNumber of tiles horizontally:\n\n- \\(N = H \u2212 2 = 7 \u2212 2 = 5\\).\n\nFirst form a 5\u00d7(5\u00b75) = 5\u00d725 grid by concatenating P across:\n\nEach output row is P\u2019s row repeated 5 times.  \nThen remove the **final column** (column 25), leaving a 5\u00d724 grid.\n\nCompute explicitly:\n\n- Row 1: P row1 = [5,5,2,5,2]\n\n  Repeated 5 times \u2192  \n  [5,5,2,5,2, 5,5,2,5,2, 5,5,2,5,2, 5,5,2,5,2, 5,5,2,5,2]  \n  Drop last element \u2192  \n\n  `5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5`\n\n- Row 2: P row2 = [2,5,2,5,2]\n\n  Repeated 5 times, drop last \u2192  \n\n  `2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5`\n\n- Row 3: P row3 = [2,5,5,5,2]\n\n  Repeated 5 times, drop last \u2192  \n\n  `2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5`\n\n- Row 4: same as Row 2:\n\n  `2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5`\n\n- Row 5: same as Row 1:\n\n  `5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5`\n\nThus the final output is a 5\u00d724 grid of 5\u2019s and 2\u2019s.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Final output grid\n\nHere is the completed output grid for the test input:\n\n```\n5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5\n2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5\n2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5\n2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5\n5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "To solve the task I first split the input using the full lines of `1`s as separators. In the test case the separators are vertical, so the four sections are side by side: the first is the mask, the third and fourth are solid colour blocks giving colour\u202f1 and colour\u202f2.\n\nFrom the first mask I take the bounding box of its non\u2011zero cells; this gives a base tile of height\u202f5 and width\u202f4. Within that 5\u00d74 box I fill the positions of the mask with colour\u202f1 (from the third section, which is 5) and the remaining positions with colour\u202f2 (from the fourth section, which is 2). For horizontal tiling I append an extra column of colour\u202f2 to the right of this tile, making it 5\u00d75. I then repeat this extended tile horizontally a number of times equal to its height (5 times) and drop the last column; the height stays at 5.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**My analysis of this ARC-AGI example centers around a structured understanding of its visual components and the transformation rules they embody.  It's clear that the image is not a test task, but rather an illustration of a process. I'm focusing on extracting generalizable insights about the system's logic, not solving for a specific output.**\n\nInitially, I break down the image into its core elements.  Each input consists of four distinct \"panels\" separated by blue lines. The first two panels appear to contain \"masks\" or \"stencils\" - shapes defined on a black background.  The last two panels contain solid color blocks. The outputs are patterns or tilings.\n\nMy thinking then gravitates toward the nature of these shapes. The first critical insight is that the shapes in the first two panels are *complementary*. They fit together perfectly, like puzzle pieces, to fill a rectangular area. This is a crucial constraint that drives the entire transformation.\n\nI then connect the shapes to the output colors. The solid color blocks in the input seem to define both the color and the spatial dimension of the output. The color in the third panel fills the shape in the first panel, and the color in the fourth panel fills the shape in the second panel.\n\nThe output appears to be a *tessellation* or *pattern filling*.  The \"tile\" is constructed from the combination of the two shapes, each filled with its corresponding color. The size of the output grid directly relates to the spatial area covered by the solid color blocks in the input. If one solid color block is much wider than the other, the pattern is tiled that many times horizontally.\n\nIn summary, the input image seems to be a template. The first two sections provide the spatial geometry (complementary shapes). The last two sections provide the color palette and the output canvas dimensions. The system uses this information to create a textured pattern by filling the input geometry with the colors and repeating the resulting tile as needed. It's essentially a form of texture synthesis driven by shape and color instructions. I understand that a formal description of the mechanism would be more precise, but this provides the intuition.\n\n\nBased on the provided image containing four training examples, here is the analysis:\n\n### **1. Describe the observable structures**\n\n*   **Inputs:**\n    *   Each input is a grid composed of distinct rectangular \"panels\" or sections.\n    *   These panels are separated by **blue lines** (either vertical or horizontal).\n    *   There are consistently four distinct panels in each input strip (labeled implicitly 1, 2, 3, 4 based on reading order).\n    *   **Panels 1 & 2:** Always contain a black background with a geometric shape in a specific color (Yellow in Panel 1, Green in Panel 2).\n    *   **Panels 3 & 4:** Always contain solid blocks of color (e.g., Red, Blue, Pink, Yellow) without any internal shapes.\n    *   **Orientation:** Example 1 is arranged vertically; Examples 2, 3, and 4 are arranged horizontally.\n*   **Outputs:**\n    *   The output is a single grid without separators.\n    *   The colors in the output match the colors of the solid blocks from Panels 3 and 4 of the input (not the Yellow/Green of the shapes).\n    *   The shapes in the output form a repeating pattern or tessellation.\n    *   The geometric forms in the output pattern resemble the shapes seen in Panels 1 and 2 of the input.\n\n### **2. Identify transformation categories**\n\n*   **Object movement:** Absent (Objects are not moved, they are used as templates).\n*   **Object recoloring:** **Present** (The shapes from the first two panels are recolored).\n*   **Bordering / outlining:** Absent.\n*   **Filling holes or cavities:** Maybe (in the sense of complementary filling).\n*   **Removing noise / extracting main shape:** Absent.\n*   **Copying / pasting / repositioning:** **Present** (The constructed tile is repeated).\n*   **Using a key anchor location:** Absent.\n*   **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors:** Absent.\n*   **Size-based filtering or selection:** Absent.\n*   **Symmetry or reflection operations:** Absent.\n*   **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion:** Absent.\n*   **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping:** **Present** (The input acts as a legend/instruction set for generating a texture).\n\n### **3. Extract the key non-obvious insights**\n\n*   **Complementary Geometry:** The shape in Panel 1 and the shape in Panel 2 are **spatial complements**. If you overlaid them, they would form a completely filled rectangle with no overlap and no gaps (like a jigsaw puzzle).\n*   **Variable Role of Input Segments:** The input is not a single scene to be modified, but a **set of instructions**.\n    *   Panels 1 & 2 act as **masks** or stencils.\n    *   Panels 3 & 4 act as **color sources** and **canvas definers**.\n*   **Color Mapping:** The color of Panel 3 is applied to the shape from Panel 1. The color of Panel 4 is applied to the shape from Panel 2.\n*   **Tiling Behavior:** The single \"Master Tile\" created by combining the colored shapes is repeated to fill the entire output area.\n*   **Output Dimensions:** The total size of the output grid corresponds to the combined area/length of the solid color blocks (Panels 3 & 4). For example, in Input 2, the solid blocks are wide, resulting in a wide output that requires the pattern to repeat three times.\n\n### **4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)**\n\nThe task interprets the input as a recipe for texture generation. The blue lines serve as delimiters separating four components. The first two components define two interlocking geometric shapes (masks) that form a complete rectangular tile. The last two components define the target colors for these respective shapes and the total dimensions of the output canvas.\n\nThe transformation constructs a \"master tile\" by coloring the first shape with the third panel's color and the second shape with the fourth panel's color. This master tile is then tessellated (repeated) to fill the dimensions specified by the solid color blocks.\n\n### **5. List checks you would perform when solving**\n\n1.  **Check Mask Complementarity:** Verify that the shape in Panel 1 and the shape in Panel 2 can be superimposed to form a solid rectangle without overlap.\n2.  **Verify Color Order:** Confirm that Panel 3's color always maps to Panel 1's shape, and Panel 4's color always maps to Panel 2's shape (and not vice versa).\n3.  **Analyze Output Size:** Measure if the pixel width/height of the output matches the combined width/height of Panel 3 and Panel 4 (excluding the separator lines).\n4.  **Check Tiling Alignment:** Determine if the tiling starts from the top-left or if it centers the pattern based on the canvas size.\n5.  **Confirm Orientation:** Ensure the tiling direction (horizontal vs. vertical) matches the orientation of the input strip.\n\n### **6. Summarize final insights**\n\nHINT_START\n*   The input is a schematic divided by blue lines: two shape masks followed by two color sources.\n*   The two shape masks are spatial inverses; together they form a solid rectangle.\n*   The output is a tessellation (tiling) where the masks are filled with the corresponding source colors.\n*   The dimensions of the final output are determined by the size of the solid color blocks in the input.\nHINT_END",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**I've got this!**  The user wants me to solve an ARC task and describe my thought process.  Okay, here we go!\n\n**1. Input Analysis: Demystifying the Structure**\nI immediately zero in on the data format:  grids separated by horizontal (or vertical) lines of \"1\"s. The text explains that the grid is broken down into sections which is helpful.  I always start by verifying this basic structure with the given examples, just to be sure.\n\n**Example 1: Vertical Layout (Horizontal separators)**\nRight off the bat, I recognize that Example 1 is structured vertically. The horizontal lines of \"1\" indicate that the sections will be stacked on top of each other.  I'm trying to see if there is a shape/tile from Section 1(S1) that is repeated based on the data in Section 2(S2).\n\nI observe some interesting patterns:\n*   Section 1(S1) has rows and columns, with color \"4\" forming an shape. The \"4\"s look like the core pattern/tile.\n*   Section 2(S2) has color \"3\" and rows containing the 3's.\n*   The \"separator\" is the blue color with value 1 (color \"1\")\n*   The Output's format hints at the shape and how it's repeated.\n*   The count is based on the number of \"3\"s in columns or rows of section 2. I'm trying to map this to the tiles.\n*   In this case, the count is the number of distinct columns containing a \"3\".\n\n**Example 2: Horizontal Layout (Vertical separators)**\nNow, I change gears and analyze Example 2: Horizontal Sections (vertical separators, color '1').  It's a mirror image of the first example (vertically, versus horizontally). I'm looking for a repetition that stacks tiles next to each other instead of on top of each other. It's almost the same as Ex 1 with an axis-flip.\n\nHere, I'm checking:\n*   Section 1 shows a bounding box with color 4, forming the tile or a pattern.\n*   I see three \"3\"s in the same row within Section 2, which gives us the repetition count (or number of tiles) in the output.\n*   Section 3 and 4 contains a solid block of a single color.\n\n**Example 3 and 4: Rule Discovery & Tile Extraction**\nWith Examples 3 and 4, I become confident in my understanding of rules:\n\n*   **Rule 1: Tile Orientation:** Horizontal Separators = Vertical Tile stacking.  Vertical Separators = Horizontal Tile stacking.\n*   **Rule 2:  Tile Extracting:** The \"tile\" shape is within Section 1 (non-zero pixels).\n*   **Rule 3:  Color Mapping:**  \"4\" color from S1 corresponds to the primary color from S3. The background \"0\" from S1, maps to a color from S4.\n*   **Rule 4:  Repetition Count:** We extract the template, map the colors, then repeat the template based on the number of column positions, where color '3' is found in section 2.\n*   **Rule 5: Construction:**  The output grid is a repeating pattern of \"Template - Gap - Template...\". I'm trying to figure the gap out!\n*   Aha! The color from S4 represents the Gap!\n\nI am now pretty certain that:\nThe template or tile is determined by finding the bounding box of non-zero colors (color 4) in S1.\nRepetition count is determined by counting distinct columns of color 3 in S2.\nColor mapping is '4' from S1 -> color from S3, '0' from S1 -> color from S4.\nThe direction of stacking is indicated by the separator lines, or '1's.\n\n**2. Applying the Rules to My Test Input**\nNow, I feel ready to tackle the test input!\n\n**2.1 Initial Parse:**\nThe test input has vertical separators (color '1') indicating that the transformation will be horizontal, so, the sections will be arranged horizontally, and the \"tiling\" will be horizontal as well.\nThe grid is 29 columns wide.\n\nSections breakdown:\nS1: Columns 0-5\nS2: Columns 7-13\nS3: Columns 15-22\nS4: Columns 24-28\n\n**2.2 Template (Tile) Extraction (S1)**\nI'm looking for the non-zero area of color \"4\".\n\nMy Observations:\n1. I bound the\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples and the problem description, here is the step-by-step derivation of the solution for the test input:\n\n**1. Parse Input Structure and Orientation**\nThe input grid is divided into four sections by separator lines of color 1 (blue).\n- **Separators:** Vertical columns of color 1 at indices 6, 14, and 23.\n- **Orientation:** Vertical separators indicate a horizontal arrangement of sections. This implies the output pattern will be tiled **horizontally**.\n\n**2. Analyze Sections**\n- **Section 1 (Shape Template):** Columns 0-5. This section contains the base shape formed by color 4 on a background of color 0.\n- **Section 2 (Repetition Pattern):** Columns 7-13. This section contains the pattern of color 3 (green) that determines the repetition count.\n- **Section 3 (First Fill Color):** Columns 15-22. Contains a solid block of color 5 (grey).\n- **Section 4 (Second Fill Color):** Columns 24-28. Contains a solid block of color 2 (red).\n\n**3. Extract and Map the Base Tile**\n- **Extraction:** Look at Section 1 (Rows 0-6, Cols 0-5). We identify the bounding box of the shape formed by color 4.\n    - Row 1: `0,4,4,0,4,0` (4s at cols 1, 2, 4)\n    - Row 2: `0,0,4,0,4,0` (4s at cols 2, 4)\n    - Row 3: `0,0,4,4,4,0` (4s at cols 2, 3, 4)\n    - Row 4: `0,0,4,0,4,0` (4s at cols 2, 4)\n    - Row 5: `0,4,4,0,4,0` (4s at cols 1, 2, 4)\n    - The bounding box includes Rows 1-5 and Columns 1-4 (4 columns wide, 5 rows high).\n    - Template pattern:\n      ```\n      4,4,0,4\n      0,4,0,4\n      0,4,4,4\n      0,4,0,4\n      4,4,0,4\n      ```\n- **Mapping:** Apply the color mapping rules:\n    - Color 4 (Shape) $\\rightarrow$ Section 3 Color (**5**)\n    - Color 0 (Background) $\\rightarrow$ Section 4 Color (**2**)\n    - Mapped Tile:\n      ```\n      5,5,2,5\n      2,5,2,5\n      2,5,5,5\n      2,5,2,5\n      5,5,2,5\n      ```\n\n**4. Determine Repetition Count**\n- Examine Section 2 (Cols 7-13). The pattern in the rows containing 3s is `0,3,3,0,3,3,0`.\n- Count the distinct column positions containing color 3. The 3s are at relative indices 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n- Total distinct columns = **4**. Therefore, the tile will be repeated 4 times.\n\n**5. Generate Output**\n- **Pattern:** `[Tile] - [Gap] - [Tile] - [Gap] - [Tile] - [Gap] - [Tile]`\n- **Gap:** A single column of the secondary color (Color 2).\n- **Assembly:**\n    - Tile Row 1: `5,5,2,5` repeated 4 times with `2` as separator: `5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5`\n    - Tile Row 2: `2,5,2,5` repeated 4 times with `2` as separator: `2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5`\n    - Tile Row 3: `2,5,5,5` repeated 4 times with `2` as separator: `2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5`\n    - Tile Row 4: `2,5,2,5` repeated 4 times with `2` as separator: `2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5`\n    - Tile Row 5: `5,5,2,5` repeated 4 times with `2` as separator: `5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5`\n\n5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5\n2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5\n2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5\n2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5\n5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5",

Key attributes include: color (0-9), orientation, size/dimensions, position, connectivity, and repetition pattern.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n**Rules for transformation:**\n\n1. **Parse input sections** separated by color 1 lines:\n   - Section 1: Shape template (color 4 on 0)\n   - Section 2: Stripe/repetition pattern (color 3 on 0)\n   - Section 3: First fill color (solid block)\n   - Section 4: Second fill color (solid block)\n\n2. **Extract base tile** from Section 1's inner area (excluding 0 borders)\n\n3. **Map colors**: 4 \u2192 Section 3 color; 0 \u2192 Section 4 color\n\n4. **Determine tiling direction**: Same as section arrangement direction\n\n5. **Count tiles**: Number of distinct column positions with color 3 in Section 2 (use maximum across rows)\n\n6. **Generate output**: Repeat the color-mapped tile pattern with single-unit gaps (filled with Section 4's color) between tiles\n\n**Example mappings:**\n- Ex1: 4\u21922, 0\u21929, vertical, 2 tiles\n- Ex2: 4\u21928, 0\u21923, horizontal, 3 tiles  \n- Ex3: 4\u21926, 0\u21924, horizontal, 4 tiles\n- Ex4: 4\u21922, 0\u21928, horizontal, 2 tiles\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

Key attributes include: color (0-9), orientation, size/dimensions, position, connectivity, and repetition pattern.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n**Rules for transformation:**\n\n1. **Parse input sections** separated by color 1 lines:\n   - Section 1: Shape template (color 4 on 0)\n   - Section 2: Stripe/repetition pattern (color 3 on 0)\n   - Section 3: First fill color (solid block)\n   - Section 4: Second fill color (solid block)\n\n2. **Extract base tile** from Section 1's inner area (excluding 0 borders)\n\n3. **Map colors**: 4 \u2192 Section 3 color; 0 \u2192 Section 4 color\n\n4. **Determine tiling direction**: Same as section arrangement direction\n\n5. **Count tiles**: Number of distinct column positions with color 3 in Section 2 (use maximum across rows)\n\n6. **Generate output**: Repeat the color-mapped tile pattern with single-unit gaps (filled with Section 4's color) between tiles\n\n**Example mappings:**\n- Ex1: 4\u21922, 0\u21929, vertical, 2 tiles\n- Ex2: 4\u21928, 0\u21923, horizontal, 3 tiles  \n- Ex3: 4\u21926, 0\u21924, horizontal, 4 tiles\n- Ex4: 4\u21922, 0\u21928, horizontal, 2 tiles\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "To solve the task I followed the pattern shown by the solved examples:\n\n- Locate the separating lines of colour\u202f1 to split the input into four sections. Here the separators are vertical columns, so the sections are arranged side by side.\n- Section\u202f1 (columns\u202f1\u20136) is the template: extract the bounding box of the non\u2011zero (colour\u202f4) cells to get the base tile. In this case that box spans rows\u202f2\u20136 and columns\u202f2\u20135, giving a 5\u00d74 tile with pattern  \n  ```\n  4 4 0 4\n  0 4 0 4\n  0 4 4 4\n  0 4 0 4\n  4 4 0 4\n  ```\n- Section\u202f3 (columns\u202f16\u201323) gives the first fill colour, which is 5. Section\u202f4 (columns\u202f25\u201329) gives the second fill/gap colour, which is 2. Map the tile by replacing 4\u21925 and 0\u21922, producing  \n  ```\n  5 5 2 5\n  2 5 2 5\n  2 5 5 5\n  2 5 2 5\n  5 5 2 5\n  ```\n- Section\u202f2 (columns\u202f8\u201314) contains colour\u202f3 markers; the maximum count of 3s in any row is 4, so repeat the tile 4 times.\n- Because the sections are arranged horizontally, repeat the tile horizontally with a single column of the gap colour\u202f2 between copies. The output height stays equal to the tile height.\n\nApplying this gives the following output grid:\n\n5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5\n2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5\n2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5\n2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5\n5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5",

Columns with color `1` act as vertical separators:\n\n- Column 6 is `1`\n- Column 14 is `1`\n- Column 23 is `1`\n\nSo the columns are partitioned into four sections:\n\n1. **Section 1 (shape template)**: columns 0\u20135  \n2. **Section 2 (stripe/pattern of 3s)**: columns 7\u201313  \n3. **Section 3 (first fill color block)**: columns 15\u201322  \n4. **Section 4 (second fill color block)**: columns 24\u201328  \n\nSince the separators are vertical, the tiling direction is **horizontal** (left\u2013right), as in Examples 2\u20134.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Extract the base tile from Section 1\n\nSection 1 (columns 0\u20135) is:\n\nRow0: 0 0 0 0 0 0  \nRow1: 0 4 4 0 4 0  \nRow2: 0 0 4 0 4 0  \nRow3: 0 0 4 4 4 0  \nRow4: 0 0 4 0 4 0  \nRow5: 0 4 4 0 4 0  \nRow6: 0 0 0 0 0 0  \n\nThe outer border (row 0, row 6, column 0, column 5) is all zeros, just like in the examples.  \nSo the **inner area** is rows 1\u20135 and columns 1\u20134:\n\n- Row1 (r1, c1\u20134): 4 4 0 4  \n- Row2 (r2, c1\u20134): 0 4 0 4  \n- Row3 (r3, c1\u20134): 0 4 4 4  \n- Row4 (r4, c1\u20134): 0 4 0 4  \n- Row5 (r5, c1\u20134): 4 4 0 4  \n\nThis 5\u00d74 pattern is the **template tile** in colors {4,0}.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Determine color mapping from Sections 3 and 4\n\nSection 3 (columns 15\u201322) is a solid block of color `5`:\n\n- All those cells are `5`.\n\nSection 4 (columns 24\u201328) is a solid block of color `2`:\n\n- All those cells are `2`.\n\nBy the rule, we map:\n\n- `4` \u2192 first fill color = `5`\n- `0` \u2192 second fill color = `2`\n\nApply this to the template tile:\n\nOriginal (5\u00d74):\n\nRow0: 4 4 0 4  \nRow1: 0 4 0 4  \nRow2: 0 4 4 4  \nRow3: 0 4 0 4  \nRow4: 4 4 0 4  \n\nMapped tile (T):\n\nRow0: 5 5 2 5  \nRow1: 2 5 2 5  \nRow2: 2 5 5 5  \nRow3: 2 5 2 5  \nRow4: 5 5 2 5  \n\nTile height = 5, width = 4.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Compute how many tiles to place (from Section 2)\n\nSection 2 (columns 7\u201313):\n\nRow0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  \nRow1: 0 3 3 0 3 3 0  \nRow2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  \nRow3: 0 3 3 0 3 3 0  \nRow4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  \nRow5: 0 3 3 0 3 3 0  \nRow6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  \n\nFollowing the described rule (and matching the examples):\n\n- For horizontal tiling, **count the number of cells with color 3 in each row**, then take the maximum.\n  - Row0: 0\n  - Row1: 4\n  - Row2: 0\n  - Row3: 4\n  - Row4: 0\n  - Row5: 4\n  - Row6: 0\n\nMaximum count of `3`s in any row = **4** \u2192 we place **4 tiles** horizontally.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Build the output with gaps\n\nGap rule (from examples and description):\n\n- Place the tile repeatedly in the tiling direction.\n- Put **one-cell gaps** of the second fill color between tiles.\n- No gap before the first tile or after the last tile.\n\nSecond fill color = Section 4\u2019s color = `2`.  \nSo each gap is a single column of all `2`s (height 5).\n\nWith:\n- tile width = 4\n- number of tiles = 4\n- 1-column gaps between tiles\n\nOutput width = 4*4 + 3*1 = 16 + 3 = 19 columns.  \nOutput height = tile height = 5 rows.\n\nEach output row r is:\n\n`T[r] + [2] + T[r] + [2] + T[r] + [2] + T[r]`\n\nwhere `T[r]` is the r-th row of the tile.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Final output grid\n\nRow 0 (tile row0 = [5,5,2,5]):\n\n5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5\n\nRow 1 (tile row1 = [2,5,2,5]):\n\n2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5\n\nRow 2 (tile row2 = [2,5,5,5]):\n\n2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5\n\nRow 3 (tile row3 = [2,5,2,5]):\n\n2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5\n\nRow 4 (tile row4 = [5,5,2,5]):\n\n5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5\n\nSo the completed output grid is:\n\n5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5\n2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5\n2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5\n2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5\n5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**My Solution to the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to crack this ARC puzzle. The core seems to involve mapping patterns from one grid (S2) onto another (S1), using solid color blocks (S3 and S4) to define the final colors. Here's my thought process:\n\nI start by looking at the input structures, trying to figure out how they relate to the output. The inputs have separators.  My first example (Ex 1) suggests shapes are vertical stacks.  I identified different sections (S1, S2, S3, S4), each with specific colors.  The prompt gives a \"Transformation Description\" \u2013 it's key.  It maps values in S2 to colors from S3 and S4, telling me the input is meant to encode an instruction. S1 seems like an instruction set.\n\nThe algorithm uses an S2 pattern. Then it extracts values (0 and 3 in Ex 1), maps these to colors in S3 and S4 (2 and 9 in Ex 1), and then constructs the final output.  The width and height of S1 and S2 seem related to output size. The trick is, the \"shape\" in S1 determines which parts of the S2 pattern are applied, kind of like a mask. I think there might be a \"shift and tile\" thing.\n\nI notice some S2 rows are empty. So, how do we handle them? This could mean: (1) using a global fallback pattern (from other non-empty rows) or (2) generating the output pattern using an entirely different mapping in those rows, perhaps derived from colors in S3, S4.\n\nI went through example 2, 3 and 4, and a test input and they show the main principle. The key here is to find the proper pattern that is expanded properly, and shifted. Then the Output uses this pattern.  After looking at this, I tried to write this down:\n1.  Map colors in S2 to the solid color in S3 and S4.\n2.  Expand a sequence extracted from S2 rows.  The \"prefix length\" of the S2 row (the starting sequence) is equal to N, or the active columns in S1.  If the row is blank, or some mapping is used, it seems a separate pattern, is used, the pattern in the non-blank row, inverted.\n3. Construct the output row by a sliding pattern across columns of S1.\n\nI looked at the given algorithm and concluded that the pattern extraction is not as straightforward. There are a few edge cases: rows that only contain a single active pixel in the S1, and patterns that are empty or contain only one value in the S2 row. These cases require additional logic to produce a non-trivial output.\n\nWith the assumption that there is something to do with Expansion Factors, I found the final logic, that uses a pattern from the S2 row, expands it to length W based on an \"expansion factor\" derived from the activity in the S1 row and tiles it.\n\nNow, my strategy is simple: generate the pattern for each output row, tile it, based on the shape in S1, using the expanded S2 sequence and I am ready to implement and solve.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation follows these rules:\n\n1.  **Identify Components**: The input grid is divided into vertical sections by separator lines (color 1).\n    *   **S1**: The shape definition (containing 4s).\n    *   **S2**: The pattern definition (containing 3s and 0s).\n    *   **S3/S4**: Solid blocks defining the background (Bg) and foreground (Fg) colors. For the test input, S3 is color 5 (Bg) and S4 is color 2 (Fg).\n\n2.  **Determine Parameters**:\n    *   **N**: The width of the active shape in S1. For the test input, the shape spans 4 columns (cols 1, 2, 3, 4 within the section, considering the bounding box). So `N = 4`.\n    *   **Base Pattern**: The sequence from S2 rows. The test input S2 shows `0, 3, 3, 0` in the active rows (rows 1, 3, 5). The sequence is `0, 3, 3, 0`.\n    *   **Expansion Factors**: Based on Example 4 and 2, rows with \"high activity\" in S1 (more 4s) use a larger background expansion factor (e.g., 3:1), while rows with \"low activity\" use a smaller factor (e.g., 1:1) and repeat the pattern to match the width.\n    *   **Pattern Width (W)**: Determined by the high-activity expansion.\n        *   Pattern `0, 3, 3, 0` with expansion 3 (for 0) and 1 (for 3):\n        *   `0` -> `5, 5, 5`\n        *   `3` -> `2`\n        *   Sequence: `5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5`. Length `W = 8`.\n    *   **Output Width**: `N * W = 4 * 8 = 32`.\n\n3.  **Generate Output Rows**:\n    *   The output height corresponds to the active height of S1 (5 rows).\n    *   **High Activity Rows** (R1, R3, R5 in S1 have 3 active pixels): Use the **Primary Pattern (P1)**.\n        *   P1 = `5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5` (derived from `0,3,3,0` with 3:1 expansion).\n        *   Fill the row by repeating P1 `N=4` times.\n    *   **Low Activity Rows** (R2, R4 in S1 have 2 active pixels): Use the **Secondary Pattern (P2)**.\n        *   P2 is derived from `0,3,3,0` with 1:1 expansion: `5, 2, 2, 5`.\n        *   To match width W=8, repeat P2 twice: `5, 2, 2, 5, 5, 2, 2, 5`.\n        *   Fill the row by repeating this block `N=4` times.\n\n4.  **Construction**:\n    *   **Row 0 (S1 R1 `4404`)**: P1 repeated.\n    *   **Row 1 (S1 R2 `0404`)**: P2 repeated.\n    *   **Row 2 (S1 R3 `0444`)**: P1 repeated.\n    *   **Row 3 (S1 R4 `0404`)**: P2 repeated.\n    *   **Row 4 (S1 R5 `4404`)**: P1 repeated.\n\n5.  **Output Grid**:\n    *   P1 Block: `5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5`\n    *   P2 Block: `5,2,2,5,5,2,2,5`\n\noutput:\n5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5\n5,2,2,5,5,2,2,5,5,2,2,5,5,2,2,5,5,2,2,5,5,2,2,5,5,2,2,5,5,2,2,5\n5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5\n5,2,2,5,5,2,2,5,5,2,2,5,5,2,2,5,5,2,2,5,5,2,2,5,5,2,2,5,5,2,2,5\n5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5",

                "response": "**Analysis and Synthesis of Grid Object Types**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got. I'm looking at these grids and the goal is to describe the *types* of things I see in them.  No inferring rules or transformations, just the objects and their attributes.  Let's keep it concise and only use the numbers for colors.\n\nFirst, I see several recurring elements. There are **separator lines**, which are basically just horizontal or vertical lines of color 1. They're usually full rows or columns, effectively breaking the larger grids into smaller, manageable chunks.  These are easy to identify.\n\nThen there are **solid blocks**. These are rectangular regions filled with a single color, like a solid blob. The colors I'm seeing for these are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.  These blocks are often confined within the boundaries created by those color 1 separators.\n\nMoving on, there are also these **glyph-like or patterned objects**. These are rectangles or regions with a background of color 0, with a foreground, shape or symbol in a different color. The main colors forming these shapes are 3 and 4, and the shapes themselves look like pixelated characters or abstract symbols.\n\nFinally, some grids are just **patterned fields**.  They consist of repeating patterns with two colors intermingled.  No clear background and foreground, just a repeating arrangement like stripes or a checkerboard. I've seen patterns with combinations of (6 and 4), (2 and 8), and (8 and 3).\n\nSo, to summarize it cleanly:\n\n<objects_summary>\n*   Separator lines (Color 1, horizontal/vertical)\n*   Solid blocks (Colors 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9)\n*   Glyph/Symbol shapes (Foreground colors 3, 4 on background 0)\n*   Patterned fields (Interleaved colors like 6/4, 2/8, 8/3)\n</objects_summary>\n\n\nBased on the provided grids, the objects can be categorized into four distinct types based on their structural composition and color attributes.\n\n**1. Separator Lines**\n*   **Description:** Linear objects consisting exclusively of color 1.\n*   **Attributes:** These lines appear either as full horizontal rows or full vertical columns. They span the entire width or height of the grid, effectively partitioning the grid into smaller, distinct rectangular compartments or sub-grids.\n\n**2. Solid Color Blocks**\n*   **Description:** Rectangular regions completely filled with a single, uniform color.\n*   **Attributes:** These blocks are often found within the compartments created by the separator lines. The colors observed filling these solid rectangles include 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.\n\n**3. Patterned Glyphs on Background**\n*   **Description:** Rectangular regions containing a specific shape or symbol composed of a foreground color set against a background of color 0.\n*   **Attributes:** These objects typically appear within the partitions defined by the separator lines. The foreground shapes are constructed using colors like 3 or 4. The shapes appear to be abstract figures or pixelated characters.\n\n**4. Textured or Patterned Fields**\n*   **Description:** Grids or regions defined by a repeating geometric arrangement of two alternating colors.\n*   **Attributes:** Unlike the solid blocks or the glyphs on a 0 background, these areas are dense textures without a clear single background color. Examples include alternating patterns of colors 2 and 9, 6 and 4, 2 and 8, or 8 and 3.\n\n<objects_summary>\n1.  **Separator Lines**: Linear boundaries of color 1 (horizontal or vertical).\n2.  **Solid Blocks**: Uniform rectangular fills of colors 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, or 9.\n3.  **Glyphs**: Foreground shapes (colors 3, 4) set against a background of color 0.\n4.  **Patterned Fields**: Repeating geometric textures alternating between two colors (e.g., 6/4, 2/8, 8/3, 2/9).\n</objects_summary>",

                "response": "**Here's how I see the solution to this task, as a seasoned expert:**\n\nI've been asked to decode the relationship between input grids (S1, S2) and the resulting output grid. The goal is to figure out the exact transformations involved in creating the output.\n\n**My Analysis:**\n\nMy process involves a mix of example exploration and pattern recognition. I started by carefully examining the provided examples. I'm focusing on the structural elements (shapes), the textures (patterns), and the colors involved.\n\n1.  **Structure**: The input grids are divided into distinct \"sections\". Each section has a shape (S1) or a pattern (S2). I quickly realized S1 defines the overall geometry and S2 provides the texture within that geometry.\n2.  **Textures & Colors**: I noticed some sections are solid colors while others have interleaved patterns of colors. These textures, combined with the shapes, seem key to generating the output.\n3.  **Key Observation:** I discovered the output wasn't simply a one-to-one mapping. Instead, it seems to involve a \"masking\" and \"texturing\" process. Shape Grid (S1) is the mask. The Pattern Grid (S2) provides the tileable texture to be applied.\n4.  **Important**: It became clear that the color mapping has a direct correlation to S3 and S4. S3 is the base color (background). S4 is a different color (foreground).\n5.  **Scaling**: A scaling factor might be involved. The output is a stretched and filled version of the shape, but with the texture provided by the pattern.\n6.  **S2 Row to S1 Column Relationship**. Each S2 row maps to an output row.\n    *   Ex 3 helped understand the pattern better as it provides variable data and variable output.\n    *   It seems S2 acts like a rolling texture.\n\n**The Underlying Logic:**\n\nMy conclusion is the output is constructed by a well-defined set of steps:\n\n1.  **Grid Setup:** Determine the output grid's width (based on S1's width and S2 block width). Height matches S1's height.\n2.  **Base Texture:** Extract the texture sequence from a row of S2 (usually, it just maps 1:1, unless the task asks you to combine multiple pattern types).\n3.  **Colour-Mapping**: Using the texture value, the colors are drawn according to a color table (S3, S4).\n4.  **Pattern/Base Expansion**: This process expands one value to a sequence that is a certain length.\n5.  **Construction**: Using the Shape Grid, for each row, a block is computed. The output's color depends on mapping from the Pattern's number, where an associated index corresponds to a column.\n\nI'm now equipped to predict the output given any set of valid S1 and S2 inputs.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the input/output grids and objects description, the transformations can be described as follows:\n\n1.  **Object Identification**:\n    *   **Shape Grid (S1)**: The first section (separated by vertical lines of color 1) defines the layout and dimensions of the output. The relevant part is the bounding box of the columns containing the \"Glyph\" (colors 3 or 4).\n    *   **Pattern Grid (S2)**: The second section defines the texture/pattern to be used. This grid contains a pattern of \"background\" pixels (0) and \"foreground\" pixels (3).\n    *   **Color Palette**: The third section (Solid Block A) defines the color for the background pixels (0 in S2). The fourth section (Solid Block B) defines the color for the foreground pixels (3 in S2).\n\n2.  **Pattern Extraction and Color Mapping**:\n    *   For each row `r` in the Output, a **Base Pattern** `P_r` is derived from the corresponding row in S2.\n    *   The colors in S2 are mapped using the palette: `0` becomes the color from S3, and `3` becomes the color from S4.\n    *   If the S2 pattern is \"compressed\" (like `0 3 0 3 0` in Example 3), it may be horizontally scaled (e.g., doubled to `0 0 3 3 0 0 3 3 0 0`) before sampling to the block width. In the Test Input, the pattern `0 3 3 0 3 3 0` appears to be at full resolution (width 7).\n    *   If a row in S2 is empty, it reuses the pattern from the nearest active row (or a constant pattern if all active rows are identical).\n\n3.  **Grid Construction and Shifting**:\n    *   The Output Grid is constructed as a tiling of blocks.\n    *   **Height**: Equal to the number of rows in S1.\n    *   **Width**: Equal to the number of active columns in S1 multiplied by the width of the Base Pattern `P_r`.\n    *   For each column `c` in the active region of S1 (from `Start_Col` to `End_Col`), a block is placed in the output.\n    *   The content of the block at column `c` is the Base Pattern `P_r` **circularly shifted to the left** by an amount equal to `c - Start_Col`.\n    *   This shifting creates a diagonal or weaving effect across the columns. The value in S1 (0 or 4) does not determine the content (both produce the patterned block), but S1 simply defines the grid extent.\n\n<transformation_summary>\nThe output is generated by applying a textured pattern to a grid defined by the input shape.\n1.  **Palette**: Map S2 values 0 to S3 color (Background) and 3 to S4 color (Foreground).\n2.  **Pattern**: For each row, extract the pattern sequence from S2.\n3.  **Layout**: Determine the active width (N columns) of the shape in S1 and the pattern width (W) from S2. The output size is [S1 Height] x [N * W].\n4.  **Generation**: For each active column `i` (0 to N-1) in S1, fill the corresponding W-width block in the output with the row's Pattern, circularly shifted left by `i`.\n</transformation_summary>",

The output size is [S1 Height] x [N * W].\n4.  **Generation**: For each active column `i` (0 to N-1) in S1, fill the corresponding W-width block in the output with the row's Pattern, circularly shifted left by `i`.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
