        "Full raw LLM response": "**Problem Decomposition and Pattern Recognition**\n\nI'm faced with an ARC task where I need to derive an output grid from a larger input grid, using two example inputs and one test case. The input grids' size (30x30) compared to the smaller output grids (5x5, 4x4) immediately suggests I should be looking for sub-grid extraction or patterns within the larger grid, rather than focusing on the entire input space at once.\n\n**Example 1: Identifying Frame and Object**\n\nAnalyzing the first example, I start by comparing the input and output. I'm looking for the shape of the output within the input. I observed a specific symbol-like 5x5 grid as the output, with a lot of noise.  I notice repetitive background patterns in the input (1,2,3,4).  I decide to look for areas where these patterns are disrupted. I identify recurring rectangular regions \"frames\" and begin to look for borders, where different colors demarcate a smaller inner area that might be the target grid. I think each frame represents a specific \"view\" of the object represented by the Output.  I found four frames in the first example, defined by a surrounding \"4\". The inner values within these frames are the actual objects. These can all be extracted.  I look at the values that are inside the frames.\n\n*   **Extraction:** I meticulously extract the inner 5x5 grids within the identified frames.  I notice certain features in the extracted grids, like the appearance of specific numbers ('1', '6', '2').\n\n*   **Mapping:** I realize that the output isn't a direct overlay of the extracted grids. I must deduce the output by observing the input frames and trying different color mappings.\n    *   I see there is something special about the value '0', but I don't know what it means yet.\n    *   I noticed in the output for example 1 that 6's stayed and any 1's were mapped to 2's.\n    *   This is not the case for example 2.\n\n**Example 2: Discovering New Patterns and Applying the Solution**\n\nThe second example presents a different border (8) but a similar structure. This reinforces the \"frame extraction\" idea. It is more about finding what is signal.  I deduce there is likely two important frames with \"5\" and two unimportant ones. I must combine the \"5\" with background values. I discover an XOR pattern for composing the output based on two colors. \n\n*   I check if this applies to both examples and the test cases.\n*   I extract the 4 frames and realize there is no 4th frame, or it is too noisy to find.\n*   Since the number of valid frames is not consistent, I may need to apply a new rule to map colors.\n*   The Background Values are `3,4,5,6`. \n*   I create a grid with the values, and observe that they are all symmetric.\n*   The Background will be treated like a special value, but there must be a way to create an output with multiple colors.\n*   The non-background values, that are inside the borders, will be used to create the output.\n\n**Test Input: Formulating the General Logic**\n\nFor the test input, I first try to extract frames based on similar border colors. After analyzing the results, I note that, I discover a new pattern that combines the non-background values of 5x5 frames.  I find a strong connection using the 5x5 objects. It makes a composition pattern:\n\n*   Frames can be identified by the repeated borders, but only some of them will matter.\n*   The \"output grid\" is composed of overlaying these regions. The overlap is solved with an OR-based logic, non-zero values keep the object, and 0's indicate transparency.\n*   The colors inside these objects can just be kept as their value, as the resulting color is not relevant.\n\n**Solution**\nI'll create the 5x5 output by identifying the valid object, and use any values there.\n\nThe problem asks us to extract a small 5x5 output grid from a large 30x30 input grid. \n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Frame Extraction:** In both examples, the input grid contains \"frames\" defined by a rectangular border of a specific color.\n    *   In Example 1, the border color is `4`. There are three 7x7 frames (inner size 5x5) and one 6x6 frame (inner size 4x4) or empty region. The output is 5x5.\n    *   In Example 2, the border color is `8`. There are 6x6 frames (inner 4x4) and likely others. The output corresponds to the interaction of frames.\n    *   The frames contain \"noise\" (values matching the background repeating pattern) and \"signal\" (values deviating from the background).\n    *   In the Test Input, the border color is `5` (based on the rows of 5s). We find frames by scanning for these borders.\n    *   We found two frames of height 6 (Inner 4x5) at Top-Left (TL) and Top-Right (TR), and two frames of height 7 (Inner 5x5) at Bottom-Left (BL) and Bottom-Right (BR).\n    *   Since the Example 1 output was 5x5 and derived from the 7x7 frames (ignoring the smaller/empty one), we assume we should use the 5x5 inner content from BL and BR and ignore TL/TR.\n\n2.  **Content Analysis:**\n    *   **BL Frame (Inner 5x5):**\n        ```\n        8, 1, 8, 1, 8\n        1, 8, 0, 8, 1\n        8, 0, 0, 0, 8\n        1, 8, 0, 8, 1\n        8, 1, 8, 1, 8\n        ```\n        (Note: `0` represents empty/transparent space here, derived from the background deviation logic or simple inspection).\n    *   **BR Frame (Inner 5x5):**\n        ```\n        0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n        0, 0, 4, 0, 0\n        0, 4, 2, 4, 0\n        0, 0, 4, 0, 0\n        0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n        ```\n\n3.  **Combination Logic (XOR/Composition):**\n    *   In Example 1, overlapping identical values cancelled out (`6` and `6` -> `0`, `0` and `2` -> `2`). This is characteristic of an XOR operation.\n    *   In the Test Input, the BL and BR frames have disjoint non-zero values.\n        *   BL has values at the border and corners of the diamond.\n        *   BR has values inside the central diamond shape.\n    *   Comparing the positions:\n        *   BL(1,2) is `0`, BR(1,2) is `4`.\n        *   BL(2,2) is `0`, BR(2,2) is `2`.\n        *   BL(0,0) is `8`, BR(0,0) is `0`.\n    *   Since they don't overlap, the XOR operation (`Value ^ 0 = Value`) acts like a simple overlay or composition.\n\n4.  **Construction of Output:**\n    Overlaying BL and BR:\n    *   (0,0): 8\n    *   (0,1): 1\n    *   (0,2): 8\n    *   ...\n    *   (1,2): 0 (from BL) + 4 (from BR) -> 4\n    *   (2,2): 0 (from BL) + 2 (from BR) -> 2\n\n    The resulting grid combines the \"X\" pattern from BL and the \"Diamond\" pattern from BR.\n\n**Final Output Grid:**\n8, 1, 8, 1, 8\n1, 8, 4, 8, 1\n8, 4, 2, 4, 8\n1, 8, 4, 8, 1\n8, 1, 8, 1, 8\n\noutput:\n8,1,8,1,8\n1,8,4,8,1\n8,4,2,4,8\n1,8,4,8,1\n8,1,8,1,8",

with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, so the task involves solving an ARC problem using two example inputs and a test case. The objective is to identify a consistent pattern and apply it.\n\n**Initial Analysis & Box Identification:**\n\nFirst, I examine the input dimensions (30x30) and output dimensions (5x5). The input grids seem to contain repeating patterns and distinct regions that disrupt these patterns. I look for specific numerical values and repeating shapes. From the example grids, I'm identifying 7x7 'frames' comprised of a single value and then looking inside this frame for sub-patterns. I'm focusing on \"boxes\" within the input grids, which are rectangular areas with a consistent border color. For instance, I identify multiple boxes defined by values like '4' or '8', containing inner patterns. The output grids appear to summarize or highlight aspects of these boxes.\n\n**Color Mapping and Layering Logic:**\n\nI then analyze the mapping of colors from the input boxes to the output. I hypothesize that the output might be based on layering the boxes, where each box represents a 'layer'. I start trying to predict outputs based on a sum of all pixel values and then decide that a \"masking\" system is more likely. I identify a \"positive\" box for TL & BL and a \"negative\" box for BR. Color values are simplified down to their color index and I begin attempting a value combination for each location on the map. It looks like a mapping of color to output values takes place based on a combination of TL/BL-TR/BR.\n\n**Ex1 & Ex2 Testing:**\n\nAnalyzing Example 1, I find a diagonal and a vertical line, where the TL boxes `1` will become `2`s in the final output grid. The EX2 seems to have similar behavior with different values and frame indicators.\n\n**Test Case Analysis & Hypothesis:**\n\nFor the Test input, I search for a combination of TL/BL overlay with some cancellation. Test Input includes a specific set of colors that should have predictable results based on this behavior. The most consistent hypothesis is that the output involves combining TL and BL layers, while BR acts as a \"mask\" that cancels out overlapping regions. I start thinking of values becoming more distinct when added (1 becomes 2) with a possible subtractive behavior (non-zero value -> 0). With each grid color I discover a potential transformation (1 becomes 2).\n\n**Refining the Approach & Validation:**\n\nI create a final set of mapping rules based on subtraction, but this has some contradictions based on the prior steps.  I've found one rule (non-zero BR cancels the value from other layers) that is consistent. The goal is now to overlay each grid onto the final grid. I re-calculate the output grid, considering that pixels in the BR boxes would then be masked (set to zero).  \n\n**Final Steps & Conclusion:**\n\nIn the test case I'm constructing a final output with overlay and masking. The final result should be based on this subtraction-based overlay pattern.\n\nOkay, that's the current plan! Let's see if this logic holds up for the test input!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a 30x30 grid into a smaller grid (likely 5x5 based on Example 1 and the structure of the input).\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Identification of Regions of Interest (ROIs):**\n    The large input grids contain \"noise\" or a repeating background pattern, interrupted by distinct rectangular regions framed by a specific color.\n    *   **Example 1:** Frames are color `4`. There are four quadrants defined by these frames.\n        *   Top-Left (TL): Contains a shape made of `1`s and corners of `6`s.\n        *   Top-Right (TR): Contains a similar shape.\n        *   Bottom-Left (BL): Contains `6`s and `2`s.\n        *   Bottom-Right (BR): Appears empty (filled with `0`s inside the frame).\n    *   **Example 2:** Frames are color `8`.\n        *   TL: Contains `4`s.\n        *   TR: Empty.\n        *   BL: Contains `4`s.\n        *   BR: Contains `2`s.\n    *   **Test Input:** Frames are color `5`.\n        *   TL: Cross shape of `1`s with `8` in the center.\n        *   TR: Empty.\n        *   BL: Diamond-like pattern of `1`s and `8`s.\n        *   BR: Cross shape of `4`s with `2` in the center.\n\n2.  **Transformation Logic:**\n    Comparing the inputs to the outputs:\n    *   **Example 2 (4x4 Output):**\n        *   Output has `2` where TL or BL had `4`.\n        *   Output has `0` where BR had `2`, even if BL had `4`.\n        *   **Hypothesis:** TL and BL are \"positive\" layers (adding content). BR and TR are \"negative\" layers (masking/subtracting content). Any non-zero value in a negative layer cancels the value at that position.\n        *   **Color Mapping:** Input `4` becomes Output `2`.\n    \n    *   **Example 1 (5x5 Output):**\n        *   (0,0): TL has `1`, TR has `1`. Output is `0`. (TR cancels TL).\n        *   (1,1): TL has `1`, TR has `0`. Output is `2`. (TL `1` maps to Output `2`).\n        *   (1,0): TL `6`, TR `6`, BL `6`. Output `6`. (If colors match or specific rule, `6` maps to `6`. TR cancellation might depend on color distinctness or `6` is special, but let's stick to masking). *Correction:* In Ex 1, if TR `6` masked TL `6`, we'd get 0. But we get `6`. However, BL also has `6`. If logic is `(TL - TR) + (BL - BR)`, then `(6-6) + (6-0) = 6`. This works perfectly.\n        *   (1,4): TL `6`, TR `6`, BL `2`. Output `2`. `(6-6) + (2-0) = 2`. Works.\n        *   (2,4): TL `1`, TR `6` (from analysis). Output `0`. `(1 masked by 6) = 0`. Works.\n        *   **Color Mapping:** `1` -> `2`, `2` -> `2`, `6` -> `6`.\n\n3.  **Application to Test Input:**\n    *   **Grid Size:** 5x5.\n    *   **Layers:**\n        *   **TL:** Cross of `1`s, center `8`.\n        *   **TR:** Empty (`0`s).\n        *   **BL:** Pattern of `1`s and `8`s (Corners and mid-edges `8`, between `1`).\n        *   **BR:** Cross of `4`s, center `2`.\n    *   **Logic:** Output = (TL masked by TR) + (BL masked by BR).\n    *   **Step 1: TL - TR**\n        Since TR is empty, this is just **TL**.\n        TL has `1` at (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2) and `8` at (2,2).\n    *   **Step 2: BL - BR**\n        BL has a pattern. BR has a Cross shape.\n        BR is non-zero at: (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2).\n        BL has values at these positions?\n        *   (2,2): BL has `0` (center of diamond is empty in BL pattern: `8,0,0,0,8` row). Wait, looking at BL content `L24` in thought block: `8,0,0,0,8`. Center is 0.\n        *   (1,2): BL row 1 `1,8,0,8,1`. Col 2 is `0`.\n        *   (2,1): BL row 2 `8,0,0,0,8`. Col 1 is `0`.\n        *   So BL is `0` where BR is non-zero.\n        *   Thus, BR doesn't mask anything in BL because there's nothing to mask.\n        *   However, the logic combines them. Does BR mask TL?\n        The formula `(TL - TR) + (BL - BR)` implies separate pairs.\n        However, usually in ARC, a mask in *any* negative position cancels the final result.\n        In Ex 2, `BR` cancelled `BL`.\n        Let's check if `BR` cancels `TL` in the Test Input.\n        BR shape (Cross) aligns perfectly with TL shape (Cross).\n        If BR is a global mask (or Layer 4 masks everything), then TL's cross is cancelled.\n        If the pairs are strict (TL-TR, BL-BR), then TL is safe.\n        Looking at Ex 1, TR cancelled TL.\n        Looking at Ex 2, BR cancelled BL.\n        The pattern seems to be quadrants interacting diagonally or vertically?\n        Given Ex 2 (BR cancels BL) and Ex 1 (TR cancels TL), it suggests **vertical pairing** (Top minus Top-Mask? No, TR is right). Or **Left minus Right**?\n        (TL - TR) + (BL - BR).\n        Ex 2: TL (`0`) - TR (`0`) + BL (`4`) - BR (`2`) = `0` at (0,2). Matches.\n        Test Input:\n        TL (Cross) - TR (Empty) = TL (Cross).\n        BL (Diamond) - BR (Cross) = BL (Diamond) [Assuming no overlap].\n        Result = TL (Cross) + BL (Diamond).\n        BUT: Overlap of TL and BL?\n        At (1,2), TL has `1`, BL has `0`. Result `1`.\n        At (2,2), TL has `8`, BL has `0`. Result `8`.\n        \n        **Alternative Interpretation:**\n        BR is a **Global Mask**.\n        In Ex 2, BR cancelled BL.\n        In Ex 1, TR cancelled TL.\n        Maybe \"Right\" columns cancel \"Left\" columns?\n        Result = (TL + BL) masked by (TR + BR).\n        Test:\n        TL + BL = Superposition of Cross and Diamond.\n        Mask = TR (Empty) + BR (Cross).\n        So we keep (TL + BL) *except* where BR is non-zero.\n        TL has Cross. BR has Cross.\n        So TL is masked out by BR.\n        BL (Diamond) does not overlap with BR (Cross).\n        So BL remains.\n        \n    *   **Result Generation:**\n        We keep only the BL pattern.\n        BL Content (5x5):\n        `8,1,8,1,8`\n        `1,8,0,8,1`\n        `8,0,0,0,8`\n        `1,8,0,8,1`\n        `8,1,8,1,8`\n        \n    *   **Color Mapping:**\n        Based on Example 1: `6`->`6`, `1`->`2`.\n        Based on Example 2: `4`->`2`.\n        It seems there are two output colors: A primary frame/corner color and a secondary fill color.\n        `8` is the \"strong\" color (corners). Map `8` -> `6`.\n        `1` is the \"weak\" color. Map `1` -> `2`.\n        \n    *   **Constructing the Output Grid:**\n        Map BL grid using `8->6, 1->2`.\n        R0: `6,2,6,2,6`\n        R1: `2,6,0,6,2`\n        R2: `6,0,0,0,6`\n        R3: `2,6,0,6,2`\n        R4: `6,2,6,2,6`\n\n4.  **Final Verification:**\n    Does this match all observations?\n    - Ex 1: (TL+BL) - (TR+BR). (TL+BL) has `1,6` + `6,2`. (TR+BR) has `1,6` + `0`.\n      (1,0): `(6+6)` masked by `6`. This would be 0. But Output is `6`.\n      This contradicts the global mask theory.\n      Let's go back to **Pairwise Subtraction**: (TL - TR) + (BL - BR).\n      Ex 1 (1,0): TL`6` - TR`6` = 0. BL`6` - BR`0` = 6. Sum = 6. **Matches.**\n      Ex 1 (1,4): TL`6` - TR`6` = 0. BL`2` - BR`0` = 2. Sum = 2. **Matches.**\n      \n    - Apply Pairwise to Test:\n      Term 1: TL (Cross) - TR (Empty) = TL (Cross).\n      Term 2: BL (Diamond) - BR (Cross).\n      BL and BR do not overlap (Diamond vs Cross, center of Diamond is empty).\n      So Term 2 = BL.\n      Result = TL (Cross) + BL (Diamond).\n      \n      This results in the superposition of the Cross and the Diamond.\n      This feels more consistent with the \"Construction\" nature of ARC than deleting the Cross.\n      \n      **Wait, check Ex 2 BR cancellation:**\n      (0,2): BL`4`, BR`2`. Result `0`.\n      Formula: BL`4` - BR`2` = 0 (masked). TL`0` - TR`0` = 0. Sum = 0. Matches.\n      \n      So the logic is definitely **(TL - TR) + (BL - BR)**.\n      \n      **Application to Test:**\n      1. **TL (Cross `1`, `8`)**: Kept (TR is empty).\n      2. **BL (Diamond `1`, `8`)**: Kept (BR is Cross `4`, `2`).\n         Check overlap again carefully.\n         BL: `8,1,8,1,8` (row 0). BR: `0,0,0,0,0`. No overlap.\n         BL: `1,8,0,8,1` (row 1). BR: `0,0,4,0,0`. No overlap (BL center col is 0).\n         BL: `8,0,0,0,8` (row 2). BR: `0,4,2,4,0`. No overlap (BL cols 1,2,3 are 0).\n         ...\n         So BR does **not** mask BL.\n         \n      **Final Result:** Superposition of TL and BL.\n      TL: `0` everywhere except Cross.\n      BL: `0` everywhere except Diamond.\n      Together they fill the 5x5 grid completely.\n      \n      **Values:**\n      (0,0): TL`0` + BL`8` -> `8`.\n      (0,1): TL`0` + BL`1` -> `1`.\n      (1,2): TL`1` + BL`0` -> `1`.\n      (2,2): TL`8` + BL`0` -> `8`.\n      \n      **Color Mapping:**\n      `8` -> `6`.\n      `1` -> `2`.\n      \n      **Final Grid:**\n      R0: `6,2,6,2,6`\n      R1: `2,6,2,6,2`\n      R2: `6,2,6,2,6`\n      R3: `2,6,2,6,2`\n      R4: `6,2,6,2,6`\n\n6,2,6,2,6\n2,6,2,6,2\n6,2,6,2,6\n2,6,2,6,2\n6,2,6,2,6",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Below is the reasoning I followed, even though the pattern in the training examples is highly ambiguous and I cannot be confident that the inferred rule is exactly the intended one. I\u2019ll still describe a concrete, reproducible procedure and then apply it to the test grid.\n\n---\n\n## High\u2011level idea I used\n\nIn both solved examples there is:\n\n- A **large 30\u00d730 grid** with a very regular \u201cbackground pattern\u201d.\n- A **special color** that is relatively rare and appears only in limited regions:\n  - Example 1: color `6` appears sparsely amidst a background of 1\u20134 and some 0s.\n  - Example 2: color `8` appears in clusters amid background 0\u20134.\n\nThe small output grids:\n\n- Are much smaller (5\u00d75 and 4\u00d74).\n- Use primarily one **foreground color** (`2`) to denote \u201csomething present\u201d and `0` for \u201cabsent\u201d.\n- In Example 1 there is also one cell with `6` in the output, apparently marking a particularly notable block.\n\nFrom Example 2, I found a relatively consistent coarse pattern if I:\n\n1. Identify the special color (maximum color) \u2013 `8`.\n2. Take a **central 28\u00d728 sub-grid** that comfortably contains all occurrences of `8`.\n3. Partition that 28\u00d728 region into a 4\u00d74 grid of **7\u00d77 blocks**.\n4. For each block, mark the corresponding output cell as:\n   - `2` if there is at least one `8` in that block,\n   - `0` otherwise.\n\nThis yields a coarse 4\u00d74 \u201cmap\u201d of where `8` appears.\n\nAlthough this procedure doesn\u2019t perfectly reconstruct the given output for Example 2 (there is at least one mismatch), it does capture the basic relationship between where the special color exists and the 4\u00d74 output grid. Given the difficulty of extracting a perfectly consistent rule from only two noisy examples, I chose to use this as my working hypothesis and then apply it to the test input, which also clearly has a special color (`8`) appearing only in a confined band.\n\n---\n\n## Applying the working rule to the test input\n\n### 1. Identify the special color\n\nIn the test grid, the largest (and rarest) color used in the \u201cinternal structures\u201d is `8`. So I treat `8` as the special color to be detected.\n\nAll `8` occur at these approximate coordinates (row, column, 1\u2011indexed):\n\n- Row 7: col 9\n- Row 22: cols 7, 9, 11\n- Row 23: cols 8, 10\n- Row 24: cols 7, 11\n- Row 25: cols 8, 10\n- Row 26: cols 7, 9, 11\n\nSo the **bounding box of 8\u2019s** is:\n\n- Rows 7 to 26\n- Columns 7 to 11\n\n### 2. Choose a 28\u00d728 region and partition into 7\u00d77 blocks\n\nI choose a 28\u00d728 sub-grid that:\n\n- Contains all the 8\u2019s.\n- Fits nicely into 4\u00d74 blocks of size 7\u00d77.\n\nA convenient choice is:\n\n- Rows 3 to 30 (inclusive): 30\u22123+1 = 28 rows.\n- Columns 3 to 30 (inclusive): 30\u22123+1 = 28 columns.\n\nThis region clearly contains rows 7\u201326, columns 7\u201311 where all the 8\u2019s lie.\n\nNow split this 28\u00d728 region into a 4\u00d74 grid of 7\u00d77 blocks:\n\n- Row blocks:\n  - RB1: rows 3\u20139\n  - RB2: rows 10\u201316\n  - RB3: rows 17\u201323\n  - RB4: rows 24\u201330\n- Column blocks:\n  - CB1: cols 3\u20139\n  - CB2: cols 10\u201316\n  - CB3: cols 17\u201323\n  - CB4: cols 24\u201330\n\nEach output cell (i,j) corresponds to the 7\u00d77 block RB\u1d62 \u00d7 CB\u2c7c.\n\n### 3. Determine where 8\u2019s lie relative to the 7\u00d77 blocks\n\nFrom the coordinates of the 8\u2019s:\n\n- All 8\u2019s are in rows 7, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26.\n  - Rows 7 \u2208 RB1 (3\u20139)\n  - Rows 22, 23 \u2208 RB3 (17\u201323)\n  - Rows 24, 25, 26 \u2208 RB4 (24\u201330)\n- All 8\u2019s are in columns 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.\n  - Columns 7,8,9 \u2208 CB1 (3\u20139)\n  - Columns 10,11 \u2208 CB2 (10\u201316)\n  - None in CB3 (17\u201323) or CB4 (24\u201330)\n\nSo the presence matrix for 8 in each block (RB\u00d7CB) is:\n\n- RB1 (rows 3\u20139):\n  - CB1 (3\u20139): contains 8 (row 7, col 9) \u2192 yes\n  - CB2 (10\u201316): no 8 \u2192 no\n  - CB3 (17\u201323): no 8 \u2192 no\n  - CB4 (24\u201330): no 8 \u2192 no\n- RB2 (rows 10\u201316):\n  - No 8 in these rows \u2192 all four blocks: no\n- RB3 (rows 17\u201323):\n  - CB1: contains 8 (rows 22\u201323, cols 7\u20139) \u2192 yes\n  - CB2: contains 8 (rows 22\u201323, cols 10\u201311) \u2192 yes\n  - CB3, CB4: no 8 \u2192 no\n- RB4 (rows 24\u201330):\n  - CB1: contains 8 (rows 24\u201326, cols 7\u20139) \u2192 yes\n  - CB2: contains 8 (rows 24\u201326, cols 10\u201311) \u2192 yes\n  - CB3, CB4: no 8 \u2192 no\n\nSo the 4\u00d74 boolean pattern \u201cblock has at least one 8\u201d is:\n\n- Row 1 (RB1): [1, 0, 0, 0]\n- Row 2 (RB2): [0, 0, 0, 0]\n- Row 3 (RB3): [1, 1, 0, 0]\n- Row 4 (RB4): [1, 1, 0, 0]\n\n### 4.

        "Full raw LLM response": "First I\u2019ll describe the pattern I inferred, then I\u2019ll apply it to the test input.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Observations from the examples\n\n### 1.1. General structure\n\nAcross all three grids (both training inputs and the test):\n\n- There is a **regular background** using four consecutive colors:\n  - Example 1: background mostly uses `{1,2,3,4}` in repeating patterns.\n  - Example 2: background mostly uses `{0,1,2,3,4}` in cyclic patterns.\n  - Test: background mostly uses `{3,4,5,6}` in cyclic patterns.\n\n- On top of this background, there are **distinct 5\u00d75 \u201cmotifs\u201d** made from **rarer colors**:\n  - Example 1: motifs constructed with `0` and `6` (and sometimes surrounding 4s).\n  - Example 2: motifs constructed with `8` (and some 0s).\n  - Test: motifs constructed with `0`, `1`, `8`, and one `2`.\n\nInside each large grid, these motifs are placed in a coarse grid (N\u00d7N), and the output is exactly that N\u00d7N coarse grid, where each output cell summarizes one 5\u00d75 motif.\n\nThe sizes match:\n\n- Example 1: we can identify **5 \u00d7 5 motifs**, so output is 5\u00d75.\n- Example 2: we can identify **4 \u00d7 4 motifs**, so output is 4\u00d74.\n- Test: there are **2 \u00d7 2 motifs**, so we expect a 2\u00d72 output.\n\n### 1.2. What each output cell encodes\n\nFrom the examples, the output cell seems to encode some **single representative color** of its corresponding 5\u00d75 motif, not the whole pattern:\n\n- In Example 2:\n  - The motifs are all built around color `8` and/or `0`.\n  - In the 4\u00d74 output, only colors `{2,0}` appear:\n    - Cells corresponding to motifs whose **center is 8** are mapped to `2`.\n    - Cells whose **center is 0** are mapped to `0`.\n- In Example 1:\n  - Motifs use colors `0` and `6`.\n  - In the 5\u00d75 output, colors `{0,2,6}` appear.\n  - The consistent way to align this with Example 2 is:\n    - If the center of the 5\u00d75 motif is `0`, output `0`.\n    - If the center is a special \u201csignal\u201d color (like `6` in Example 1, or `8` in Example 2), map it to a fixed output color:\n      - For `8` (Example 2), map to `2`.\n      - For `6` (Example 1), preserve it as `6`.\n    - Other non-background center values (e.g. 1,2,4 used inside a motif) map to `2` (generic \u201cnon-zero, non-6\u201d signal).\n\nSo the rule I adopt:\n\n> For each 5\u00d75 motif, look at the **central cell**.  \n> - If it is `0` \u2192 output `0`.  \n> - Else if it is `6` \u2192 output `6`.  \n> - Otherwise (other anomaly color like `8`, `1`, `2`, etc.) \u2192 output `2`.\n\nThis matches the use of `{0,2}` in Example 2 and `{0,2,6}` in Example 1.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying to the test input\n\n### 2.1. Locating the 5\u00d75 motifs\n\nIn the test grid, the background is made from `{3,4,5,6}`. Rare colors `{0,1,2,8}` indicate motifs.\n\nVisually scanning the test input (rows and columns indexed from 1):\n\nWe see four clear 5\u00d75 anomalous blocks:\n\n1. **Top-left motif (TL)**  \n   Rows 5\u20139, columns 7\u201311:\n\n   ```\n   r5:  0,0,0,0,0\n   r6:  0,0,1,0,0\n   r7:  0,1,8,1,0\n   r8:  0,0,1,0,0\n   r9:  0,0,0,0,0\n   ```\n\n   Center cell is at (row 7, col 9) = `8`.\n\n2. **Top-right motif (TR)**  \n   Rows 5\u20139, columns 21\u201325:\n\n   ```\n   r5:  0,0,0,0,0\n   r6:  0,0,0,0,0\n   r7:  0,0,0,0,0\n   r8:  0,0,0,0,0\n   r9:  0,0,0,0,0\n   ```\n\n   Center cell is at (row 7, col 23) = `0`.\n\n3. **Bottom-left motif (BL)**  \n   Rows 22\u201326, columns 7\u201311:\n\n   ```\n   r22: 8,1,8,1,8\n   r23: 1,8,0,8,1\n   r24: 8,0,0,0,8\n   r25: 1,8,0,8,1\n   r26: 8,1,8,1,8\n   ```\n\n   Center cell is at (row 24, col 9) = `0`.\n\n4. **Bottom-right motif (BR)**  \n   Rows 22\u201326, columns 21\u201325:\n\n   ```\n   r22: 0,0,0,0,0\n   r23: 0,0,4,0,0\n   r24: 0,4,2,4,0\n   r25: 0,0,4,0,0\n   r26: 0,0,0,0,0\n   ```\n\n   Center cell is at (row 24, col 23) = `2`.\n\nThese 4 motifs form a **2\u00d72 grid**:\n\n- Row 1 of motif-grid: TL, TR\n- Row 2 of motif-grid: BL, BR\n\nSo the output will be a 2\u00d72 grid.\n\n### 2.2. Mapping centers to output colors\n\nApply the center-mapping rule:\n\n- TL center = `8` \u2192 not 0 and not 6 \u2192 output `2`.\n- TR center = `0` \u2192 output `0`.\n- BL center = `0` \u2192 output `0`.\n- BR center = `2` \u2192 not 0 and not 6 \u2192 output `2`.\n\nSo the final 2\u00d72 output grid (row-major) is:\n\n- First row: `[2, 0]`\n- Second row: `[0, 2]`\n\n---\n\n## 3. Completed output grid\n\nHere is the output in the required format:\n\n```\n2,0\n0,2\n```",

XOR R1 and R2 (R2 is zeros, so mark R1's non-zeros with 6 as the diff marker):\n```\n0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0\n0,6,6,6,0\n0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0\n```\n\n2. Flip horizontally (symmetric, no change)\n\n3. OR with R4, where:\n   - 4s in R4 become 6s (the region marker)\n   - 2 takes precedence over 6 (as seen in Example 1)\n\nFinal result:\n```\n0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0\n0,6,2,6,0\n0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0\n```\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0\n0,6,2,6,0\n0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0\n```",
