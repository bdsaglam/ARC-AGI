            "Full raw LLM response": "**Okay, here's my understanding of the situation and the solution I'm going to provide.** I've been tasked with solving an ARC puzzle based on a set of examples and a test input. The user's prompt is written in a way that *could* be interpreted as a system override attempt, but my primary goal is to solve the puzzle, so I'm focusing on the core request. I've also been explicitly warned about revealing my full reasoning process, so I'll be careful to provide a high-level explanation without delving into every internal step.\n\nMy approach is to ignore the \"roleplay\" framing and tackle this as a standard ARC problem. I'll provide a clear explanation of the solution logic and the final output grid.\n\n**Here's the essence of the problem:** I've observed that these puzzles involve identifying a pattern, specifically related to the arrangement of a target color within the larger grid, which creates a \"hole\". The output is a smaller grid containing information that was \"hidden\" behind those holes.\n\nHere are the key points I've discovered through examples:\n*   The large input grid likely has some form of symmetry, potentially vertical or a combination of reflections.\n*   The \"holes\" in the input (made of the target color) are essentially windows into a pattern, and the output grid is a representation of what is revealed in the same column as the \"hole\".\n*   The position of the hole is relevant to the solution. The output is a pattern.\n\n**My solution strategy:**\n*   Analyze the pattern by checking if rows match by symmetry.\n*   The relationship of those patterns within the \"holes\" is also valuable.\n*   Extract the parts covered in the hole region from other symmetrical rows to reveal them.\n*   Provide a general explanation of the logic, focusing on the symmetry, pattern identification, and extraction of the covered values.\n\nI've determined that there is a relationship between the hole rows and other, symmetrical parts of the grid. If the content is in holes, I can then check for other symmetrical patterns.\n\nThe problem asks us to solve an ARC task where the input is a grid containing a region of \"noise\" (represented by the color 8/teal in the examples, but we must detect it dynamically) that obscures an underlying pattern. We need to reconstruct the obscured region and output it as a smaller grid.\n\n### Method\n\n1.  **Identify the \"Hole\"**: Locate the rows and columns containing the obscuring color (e.g., 8). In the test input, the color 8 appears in rows 14-22 and columns 0-2. This defines the output grid dimensions (9 rows, 3 columns).\n\n2.  **Analyze Global Symmetry**: Examine the rows of the input grid to find a global symmetry pattern. By comparing rows, we can see that `Row[r]` and `Row[K-r]` are identical in their \"context\" (the columns not obscured by the hole).\n    *   In the test input, comparing the bottom rows (23-29) with the top rows (2-8), we find matches such that `Row[r]` corresponds to `Row[31-r]`.\n        *   Row 2 matches Row 29.\n        *   Row 3 matches Row 28.\n        *   ...\n        *   Row 9 matches Row 22. (Row 22 is a hole row, Row 9 is its source).\n\n3.  **Map Hole Rows to Source Rows**:\n    *   For each row `r` in the hole region (14-22), the content is determined by the row `31-r`.\n    *   **Row 22** (Hole) corresponds to **Row 9** (Source). Row 9 at cols 0-2 is `1,6,1`.\n    *   **Row 21** (Hole) corresponds to **Row 10** (Source). Row 10 at cols 0-2 is `6,6,6`.\n    *   **Row 20** (Hole) corresponds to **Row 11** (Source). Row 11 at cols 0-2 is `6,6,1`.\n    *   **Row 19** (Hole) corresponds to **Row 12** (Source). Row 12 at cols 0-2 is `4,4,7`.\n    *   **Row 18** (Hole) corresponds to **Row 13** (Source). Row 13 at cols 0-2 is `4,4,7`.\n\n4.  **Resolve Deadlocks**:\n    *   Rows 14, 15, 16, 17 form a symmetric block in the center. The formula `31-r` maps these rows to each other (14<->17, 15<->16). Since both rows in the pair contain holes, we cannot source the content from the pair.\n    *   We look for the rows that have *not* been used as sources yet. The symmetry mapping consumed rows 2-29. Rows 0 and 1 remain unmatched.\n    *   Following the sequence of source rows (13, 12, 11...), the next logical sources for the top of the hole block (14, 15) are the remaining top rows 0 and 1.\n    *   **Row 14** maps to **Row 0**. Row 0 at cols 0-2 is `4,4,1`.\n    *   **Row 15** maps to **Row 1**. Row 1 at cols 0-2 is `4,4,3`.\n    *   By symmetry of the center block (Output Rows 0-3 mirror each other):\n        *   Output Row 0 (L14) = `4,4,1`.\n        *   Output Row 1 (L15) = `4,4,3`.\n        *   Output Row 2 (L16) = `4,4,3` (Mirror of R1).\n        *   Output Row 3 (L17) = `4,4,1` (Mirror of R0).\n\n### Final Output Generation\n\n*   Row 0: `4,4,1`\n*   Row 1: `4,4,3`\n*   Row 2: `4,4,3`\n*   Row 3: `4,4,1`\n*   Row 4: `4,4,7`\n*   Row 5: `4,4,7`\n*   Row 6: `6,6,1`\n*   Row 7: `6,6,6`\n*   Row 8: `1,6,1`\n\n4,4,1\n4,4,3\n4,4,3\n4,4,1\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n6,6,1\n6,6,6\n1,6,1",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**High-Level Reasoning Summary**\n\nOkay, here's my approach: I'm dealing with a symmetrical pattern within a larger grid. My task is to figure out the hidden part of this pattern which is obscured by the 8s in the examples. I'm focusing on vertical and horizontal symmetries within the grid, along with how the output grid relates to these patterns. The goal is to extrapolate and complete the missing parts in the test input.\nBased on the provided examples, I've deduced two key symmetries:\n1.  Vertical symmetry across a row with index 16.\n2.  Horizontal symmetry across column 15.\nThis means I need to use the grid's existing structure to uncover the missing parts of the Test Input.\nI've checked the symmetries for this pattern in each of the examples.\n\nOutput:\n```\n9,7,9\n7,9,9\n7,9,9\n9,7,9\n4,4,7\n6,6,1\n6,6,6\n1,6,1\n6,6,5\n```\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the values hidden by a block of 8s in the test input. Based on the solved examples, the grids exhibit a global symmetry where the rows are symmetric across the horizontal midline. Specifically, the symmetry rule is `Row(i) == Row(31 - i)` (where rows are 0-indexed and we assume a virtual 32x32 grid structure for symmetry calculation, effectively putting the axis between row 15 and 16). Additionally, the rows within the \"hidden\" region (which are self-referential under the vertical symmetry) exhibit a horizontal symmetry `Col(j) == Col(31 - j)` (axis between column 15 and 16), wrapping around the edges.\n\nFor the test input, the patch of 8s is located at Rows 14-22 and Columns 0-2.\n\n**Step 1: Solve the bottom half (Rows 18-22)**\nUsing the vertical symmetry `Row(i) == Row(31 - i)`:\n- Row 18 matches Row 13 (31-18=13).\n  - Row 13 cols 0-2 are `4, 4, 7`. So Row 18 is `4, 4, 7`.\n- Row 19 matches Row 12 (31-19=12).\n  - Row 12 cols 0-2 are `6, 6, 1`. So Row 19 is `6, 6, 1`.\n- Row 20 matches Row 11 (31-20=11).\n  - Row 11 cols 0-2 are `6, 6, 6`. So Row 20 is `6, 6, 6`.\n- Row 21 matches Row 10 (31-21=10).\n  - Row 10 cols 0-2 are `1, 6, 1`. So Row 21 is `1, 6, 1`.\n- Row 22 matches Row 9 (31-22=9).\n  - Row 9 cols 0-2 are `6, 6, 5`. So Row 22 is `6, 6, 5`.\n\n**Step 2: Solve the top half (Rows 14-17)**\nThe vertical symmetry maps `14 <-> 17` and `15 <-> 16`. Since the patch covers cols 0-2 in all these rows, they are self-referential. We use the horizontal symmetry `Col(j) == Col(31 - j)` combined with pattern extension from the visible parts of these rows.\n- **Row 14 (and 17):** The visible end of the row (cols 24-29) is `7, 9, 2, 3, 1, 9`. Based on the wrapping pattern `... A, B, A, B ...`, the columns 30 and 31 (virtual) would be `7` and `9`.\n  - Col 2 matches Col 29 (`9`).\n  - Col 1 matches Col 30 (`7`).\n  - Col 0 matches Col 31 (`9`).\n  - Result: `9, 7, 9`.\n- **Row 15 (and 16):** The visible end of the row (cols 24-29) is `9, 7, 3, 2, 9, 9`. Following the pattern extension:\n  - Col 2 matches Col 29 (`9`).\n  - Col 1 matches Col 30 (`9`).\n  - Col 0 matches Col 31 (`7`).\n  - Result: `7, 9, 9`.\n\n**Final Output Grid:**\nCombining the calculated rows:\n9,7,9\n7,9,9\n7,9,9\n9,7,9\n4,4,7\n6,6,1\n6,6,6\n1,6,1\n6,6,5",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

The grids have symmetry properties:\n   - **Vertical symmetry** around row 15.5 (rows r and 31-r are related)\n   - **Horizontal symmetry** around col 14.5 or 15.5\n\n**Key Rule Discovery:**\n\nFor each row with 8s:\n- If the vertically symmetric row (31-r) does NOT have 8s \u2192 copy values from that symmetric row\n- If the vertically symmetric row also has 8s \u2192 use horizontal reflection (col c maps to col 29-c)\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\nThe 8s are located at rows 14-22, columns 0-2 (9 rows \u00d7 3 columns).\n\n- Rows 14-17: Symmetric rows (17-14) also have 8s \u2192 use horizontal symmetry\n- Rows 18-22: Symmetric rows (13-9) don't have 8s \u2192 use vertical symmetry\n\n**Calculating values:**\n\nFor rows 14-17 (horizontal symmetry, col c \u2194 col 29-c):\n- Row 14: cols 29,28,27 = 9,1,3\n- Row 15: cols 29,28,27 = 9,2,3  \n- Row 16: cols 29,28,27 = 9,2,3\n- Row 17: cols 29,28,27 = 9,1,3\n\nFor rows 18-22 (vertical symmetry):\n- Row 18 \u2194 Row 13, cols 0-2: 4,4,7\n- Row 19 \u2194 Row 12, cols 0-2: 4,4,7\n- Row 20 \u2194 Row 11, cols 0-2: 6,6,1\n- Row 21 \u2194 Row 10, cols 0-2: 6,6,6\n- Row 22 \u2194 Row 9, cols 0-2: 1,6,1\n\n```\n9,1,3\n9,2,3\n9,2,3\n9,1,3\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n6,6,1\n6,6,6\n1,6,1\n```",

Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

The 8s mask a rectangular region, and the output represents the values that should fill that region based on the symmetric portions of the grid.\n\nFor each example:\n- The 8s form a rectangular region\n- The output dimensions match the 8s region dimensions\n- Values are derived from symmetric positions in the grid\n\n**Applying to the test input:**\n\nFirst, I locate the 8s: They appear at rows 14-22, columns 0-2 (a 9\u00d73 region).\n\nThe symmetry center is at (14.5, 14.5), meaning:\n- Row r maps to row (29-r)\n- Column c maps to column (29-c)\n\nFor rows 14-15: Both map to each other (both masked), so I use column symmetry within the same row:\n- Row 14: cols 0,1,2 get values from cols 29,28,27 \u2192 9,1,3\n- Row 15: cols 0,1,2 get values from cols 29,28,27 \u2192 9,9,2\n\nFor rows 16-22: Use full point symmetry (row 16\u2192row 13, row 17\u2192row 12, etc.), taking values from columns 29,28,27:\n- Row 16 \u2190 Row 13, cols 29,28,27 \u2192 7,2,7\n- Row 17 \u2190 Row 12, cols 29,28,27 \u2192 7,7,9\n- Row 18 \u2190 Row 11, cols 29,28,27 \u2192 1,6,7\n- Row 19 \u2190 Row 10, cols 29,28,27 \u2192 6,6,7\n- Row 20 \u2190 Row 9, cols 29,28,27 \u2192 1,5,4\n- Row 21 \u2190 Row 8, cols 29,28,27 \u2192 5,1,4\n- Row 22 \u2190 Row 7, cols 29,28,27 \u2192 7,9,4\n\n```\n9,1,3\n9,9,2\n7,2,7\n7,7,9\n1,6,7\n6,6,7\n1,5,4\n5,1,4\n7,9,4\n```",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "The problem asks us to determine the values of the cells hidden by a \"patch\" of 8s (color teal/light blue) in the input grid.\nBased on the solved examples, the input grids exhibit a vertical reflection symmetry, where `Grid[row][col]` is related to `Grid[31 - row][col]` (using 0-based indexing, noting that the sum of symmetric row indices is 31 for rows 2-29). In some cases (like Ex 4), the sum is 32.\n\nLet's analyze the **Test Input**:\nThe patch of 8s is located at **Rows 14-22** and **Columns 0-2**.\nThe grid size is 30x30.\nWe can determine the hidden values by looking at the symmetric rows.\n\n**Symmetry Analysis:**\nWe observe that the bottom half of the patch (Rows 18-22) has corresponding symmetric rows in the top half (Rows 13-9) that are fully visible.\nChecking the visible parts of these rows confirms the symmetry:\n- **Row 18** (visible part) matches **Row 13** (visible part).\n  - Target: `Grid[18][0..2]`. Source: `Grid[13][0..2]`.\n  - `Grid[13][0..2]` is `4, 4, 7`.\n- **Row 19** matches **Row 12**.\n  - Target: `Grid[19][0..2]`. Source: `Grid[12][0..2]`.\n  - `Grid[12][0..2]` is `4, 4, 7`.\n- **Row 20** matches **Row 11**.\n  - Target: `Grid[20][0..2]`. Source: `Grid[11][0..2]`.\n  - `Grid[11][0..2]` is `6, 6, 1`.\n- **Row 21** matches **Row 10**.\n  - Target: `Grid[21][0..2]`. Source: `Grid[10][0..2]`.\n  - `Grid[10][0..2]` is `6, 6, 6`.\n- **Row 22** matches **Row 9**.\n  - Target: `Grid[22][0..2]`. Source: `Grid[9][0..2]`.\n  - `Grid[9][0..2]` is `1, 6, 1`.\n\nNow for the top half of the patch (Rows 14-17):\n- **Row 14** visible part matches **Row 17** visible part.\n- **Row 15** visible part matches **Row 16** visible part.\nThese rows are symmetric to each other (14 <-> 17, 15 <-> 16). Since both are covered by the patch, we cannot copy values directly. We must infer the values from the pattern continuity.\nThe sequence of values in the column 0-2 block from Row 8 downwards is:\nR8: `6, 6, 5`\nR9: `1, 6, 1`\nR10: `6, 6, 6`\nR11: `6, 6, 1`\nR12: `4, 4, 7`\nR13: `4, 4, 7`\n-- Patch Starts --\nR14: ?\nR15: ?\nR16: ?\nR17: ?\n--\nR18: `4, 4, 7`\nR19: `4, 4, 7`\nR20: `6, 6, 1`\nR21: `6, 6, 6`\nR22: `1, 6, 1`\n\nThe sequence of rows 18-22 is a perfect reflection of 13-9.\nWe need to fill 14, 15, 16, 17 such that they connect 13 and 18 symmetrically.\nSince 13 and 18 are both `4, 4, 7`, and 14 matches 17, and 15 matches 16:\nThe most logical continuation that preserves the \"layers\" of the pattern is:\n- Rows 14 and 17 continue the `4, 4, 7` pattern from Rows 13/18.\n- Rows 15 and 16 fill the center. Looking at the nearby texture (R11/R20 are `6, 6, 1`), and given the lack of other patterns, `6, 6, 1` is the best candidate to create a core, or perhaps `4, 4, 7` continues.\nHowever, looking at the complex kaleidoscope structure, the center usually has a distinct core. But without visible evidence, sticking to the nearest neighbour for the \"outer\" layer of the unknown block (14/17) and the next neighbour for the \"inner\" layer (15/16) is the standard extrapolation.\n- R14 (next to R13) takes `4, 4, 7`.\n- R17 (next to R18) takes `4, 4, 7`.\n- R15 (next to R14) takes `6, 6, 1` (from R11 pattern jumping over 12/13? Or simply repeating 14?).\nLet's look at the outputs again. Example 1 had a distinct center.\nIf we assume the block 14-17 follows the `4,4,7` block, then 14, 17 are `4,4,7`.\nFor 15, 16, the pattern `6,6,1` from R11/R20 is the distinct feature appearing before/after the 447 block. The pattern seems to oscillate.\nSo:\nR14: `4, 4, 7`\nR15: `6, 6, 1`\nR16: `6, 6, 1`\nR17: `4, 4, 7`\n\nThis creates the full sequence:\n12: 447\n13: 447\n14: 447\n15: 661\n16: 661\n17: 447\n18: 447\n19: 447\nThis is symmetric and uses the existing palettes.\n\noutput:\n4,4,7\n6,6,1\n6,6,1\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n6,6,1\n6,6,6\n1,6,1",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**General Strategy and Observations for ARC Task**\n\nI'm tasked with solving a puzzle involving large grids with repeating patterns, often disrupted by a distinctive \"teal\" block of color 8. The outputs are smaller grids.  My initial thinking focuses on finding the link between the inputs and outputs, paying particular attention to the teal blocks, and then inferring the general transformation.\n\n**Key Observations about Input Grids:**\n\n*   **Grid Size:** Large, typically around 30x30.\n*   **Patterns:** Complex, rug-like, with symmetry (horizontal, vertical, or rotational).\n*   **Teal Blocks (8s):** Rectangular blocks of the same teal color, which seem \"superimposed\" on the underlying pattern, always placed on the edges or corners.\n*   **Input-Output Size Discrepancy:** Outputs are significantly smaller than inputs, which suggests the output grid could contain the unique part of the input grid, or the part that is not symmetric.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**  Careful examination of symmetry is critical.  I'm looking for horizontal, vertical, and rotational symmetries, to understand the relationship between different parts of the input grid.\n*   **Example 1 Analysis:** I've carefully examined the digits on the output grid and the corresponding section of the input grid. I noticed that the digits often have some resemblance, but they might be permuted or slightly shifted.\n*   **Local Patterns:** I am also looking for smaller, repeating patterns within the grid, which could be the basic building blocks.\n*   **Edge Digits:** I've looked at the edge digits of the original grid to derive the key part of the transformation, as the teal digits occupy the middle.\n\n**The Underlying Rule**\n\nI have figured out that there's horizontal symmetry axis for the main solution for the problem.\n\n**Output Construction**\n\n*   **Horizontal Symmetry**:  A row in the output grid often corresponds to another row in the original grid, a simple transposition operation.\n*   **Example 2:** I realized that, there is an instance, that for some example input grid the output grid has values which are taken from adjacent columns.\n*   **The Diagonal Rule:** For the test case, I realized, based on diagonal analysis, that the missing part of the test input can be filled by transposing the appropriate region.\n\n**Inferred Transformation**\n\n*   **The Main Rule: Diagonal Transposition:** I have found that the relationship between the target region of the input is related to a transposed slice of an input. The transposed slice is taken from an edge.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to reconstruct a missing rectangular patch of the grid (indicated by the number 8) using the pattern visible in the rest of the grid. By analyzing the solved examples and the test input, we can determine the underlying symmetry of the grid.\n\n**Analysis of Symmetries:**\n1.  **Horizontal/Vertical Reflection:** In Example 1 and Example 4, we observed that rows far from the center could be reconstructed by reflecting rows from the opposite side of the horizontal axis (Row $i$ corresponds to Row $31-i$). However, this failed for the central rows which reflected onto other missing rows.\n2.  **Diagonal Symmetry:** Let's check the property $G(r, c) = G(c, r)$ (symmetry across the main diagonal).\n    *   In the Test Input, we have valid data in Rows 0-2 and Cols 0-2 (outside the 8-block).\n    *   Let's check if Row $r$, Col $c$ matches Row $c$, Col $r$.\n    *   Input(0, 14) is 7. Input(14, 0) is missing (8).\n    *   Input(0, 18) is 4. Input(18, 0) is missing (8).\n    *   However, we can check the *bottom* part of the missing block where we successfully derived values using horizontal reflection.\n    *   For Row 22, Col 0, we derived `1`. Input(0, 22) is `1`. Match.\n    *   For Row 21, Col 1, we derived `6`. Input(1, 21) is `6`. Match.\n    *   For Row 18, Col 0, we derived `4`. Input(0, 18) is `4`. Match.\n    *   For Row 18, Col 2, we derived `7`. Input(2, 18) is `7`. Match.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe grid possesses **diagonal symmetry** across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right). The value at `grid[row][col]` is equal to `grid[col][row]`.\nThe missing block is located at Rows 14-22 and Columns 0-2.\nTo fill this block, we need to read the values from Rows 0-2 and Columns 14-22, and then **transpose** them (swap rows and columns).\n\n**Steps to Generate Output:**\n1.  Identify the source region: Rows 0-2, Columns 14-22.\n    *   Row 0 (cols 14-22): `7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 4, 6, 6, 1`\n    *   Row 1 (cols 14-22): `7, 2, 2, 7, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6`\n    *   Row 2 (cols 14-22): `9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 7, 1, 6, 1`\n2.  Transpose this 3x9 block to get the 9x3 output block.\n    *   Output Col 0 = Source Row 0: `7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 4, 6, 6, 1` (Vertical)\n    *   Output Col 1 = Source Row 1: `7, 2, 2, 7, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6` (Vertical)\n    *   Output Col 2 = Source Row 2: `9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 7, 1, 6, 1` (Vertical)\n\n**Constructing the Rows of the Output:**\n*   Row 0: `7, 7, 9`\n*   Row 1: `7, 2, 9`\n*   Row 2: `7, 2, 9`\n*   Row 3: `7, 7, 9`\n*   Row 4: `4, 4, 7`\n*   Row 5: `4, 4, 7`\n*   Row 6: `6, 6, 1`\n*   Row 7: `6, 6, 6`\n*   Row 8: `1, 6, 1`\n\n**Output Grid:**\n7,7,9\n7,2,9\n7,2,9\n7,7,9\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n6,6,1\n6,6,6\n1,6,1",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning**\n\n1. In all four training pairs, the big 30\u00d730 input contains a highly symmetric fractal pattern.  \n   In each input, a solid cyan (color 8) rectangle overwrites part of this pattern.\n\n2. The cyan rectangle is always perfectly rectangular and of uniform color 8.  \n   Its size is exactly the size of the corresponding output grid:\n   - Example 1: cyan block 9\u00d74 \u2192 output 9\u00d74  \n   - Example 2: cyan block 4\u00d75 \u2192 output 4\u00d75  \n   - Example 3: cyan block 3\u00d77 \u2192 output 3\u00d77  \n   - Example 4: cyan block 4\u00d74 \u2192 output 4\u00d74  \n\n   So the task is to reconstruct what should be inside that cyan area and output only that rectangle.\n\n3. The underlying pattern in the inputs shows clear left\u2013right symmetry: for any row, the pattern on the right half is the mirror of the pattern on the left half (ignoring the cyan overwrite).  \n   Thus, for a cyan block on the left side we can look to the symmetric columns on the right side in the same rows to see what has been hidden.\n\n4. For the test input:\n\n   - We first locate the cyan region: the maximal solid block of color 8.\n   - It is at rows 15\u201323 and columns 1\u20133 (a 9\u00d73 rectangle), all entries `8`.\n\n5. To restore each cell of this 9\u00d73 region we mirror horizontally about the vertical center line of the 30\u00d730 grid.  \n   With 30 columns, the mirror column of `c` is `c' = 31 \u2212 c`.  \n   Since the cyan block occupies columns 1\u20133, their mirrors are columns 30, 29, and 28 respectively.\n\n   For each row `r` from 15 to 23 and each column index `j` in {1,2,3} of the block we set:\n   \\[\n   \\text{output}[r-14,\\;j] = \\text{input}[r,\\; 31-j]\n   \\]\n\n6. Reading these mirrored cells from the test input:\n\n   - Row 15, cols 30,29,28 \u2192 9,1,3\n   - Row 16, cols 30,29,28 \u2192 9,9,2\n   - Row 17, cols 30,29,28 \u2192 9,9,2\n   - Row 18, cols 30,29,28 \u2192 9,1,3\n   - Row 19, cols 30,29,28 \u2192 7,2,7\n   - Row 20, cols 30,29,28 \u2192 7,7,9\n   - Row 21, cols 30,29,28 \u2192 1,6,7\n   - Row 22, cols 30,29,28 \u2192 6,6,7\n   - Row 23, cols 30,29,28 \u2192 1,5,4\n\n   Arranged as a 9\u00d73 grid, this is the reconstructed content of the cyan rectangle.\n\n---\n\n**Output grid**\n\n9,1,3\n9,9,2\n9,9,2\n9,1,3\n7,2,7\n7,7,9\n1,6,7\n6,6,7\n1,5,4",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify the pattern that transforms the input to the output.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n1. Each input is a 30\u00d730 grid with a rectangular region filled with 8s (appears as a distinct color in the image)\n2. The output dimensions match exactly the size of the 8-region\n3. The task is to reconstruct what values should replace the 8s\n\n**Finding the Pattern:**\n\nThe grids appear to have **vertical symmetry** (reflection across the vertical center line at column 14.5). For each position in the 8-region:\n- Column c maps to column (29-c)\n- The values from the symmetric position (with column order reversed) fill in the 8-region\n\n**Analyzing the Test Input:**\n\nThe 8-region is located at:\n- Rows 14-22 (9 rows)\n- Columns 0-2 (3 columns)\n\nThe symmetric region is at rows 14-22, columns 27-29 (since 29-0=29, 29-1=28, 29-2=27).\n\n**Extracting the symmetric region:**\n- Row 14, cols 27-29: 3,1,9 \u2192 reversed: 9,1,3\n- Row 15, cols 27-29: 2,9,9 \u2192 reversed: 9,9,2\n- Row 16, cols 27-29: 2,9,9 \u2192 reversed: 9,9,2\n- Row 17, cols 27-29: 3,1,9 \u2192 reversed: 9,1,3\n- Row 18, cols 27-29: 7,2,7 \u2192 reversed: 7,2,7\n- Row 19, cols 27-29: 9,7,7 \u2192 reversed: 7,7,9\n- Row 20, cols 27-29: 7,6,1 \u2192 reversed: 1,6,7\n- Row 21, cols 27-29: 7,6,6 \u2192 reversed: 6,6,7\n- Row 22, cols 27-29: 4,5,1 \u2192 reversed: 1,5,4\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n9,1,3\n9,9,2\n9,9,2\n9,1,3\n7,2,7\n7,7,9\n1,6,7\n6,6,7\n1,5,4\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Locate the special block (color 8).**  \n   In every training input there is one rectangular region filled entirely with color `8`.  \n   Its size always matches the size of the corresponding output grid:\n   - Example 1: 9\u00d74 block of 8\u2019s \u2192 9\u00d74 output  \n   - Example 2: 4\u00d75 block of 8\u2019s \u2192 4\u00d75 output  \n   - Example 3: 3\u00d77 block of 8\u2019s \u2192 3\u00d77 output  \n   - Example 4: 4\u00d74 block of 8\u2019s \u2192 4\u00d74 output  \n\n   So for the test input, I first find where color `8` appears.\n\n2. **Find the 8\u2011block in the test input.**  \n   Scanning the test grid, the only 8\u2019s occur in rows 15\u201323 and columns 1\u20133:\n\n   - Rows 15\u201323, cols 1\u20133 are all `8`.  \n   - Above row 15 and below row 23, as well as outside cols 1\u20133, there are no 8\u2019s.\n\n   Hence the occluding rectangle is a **9\u00d73** block (rows 15\u201323, columns 1\u20133).  \n   Therefore, the required output must also be a **9\u00d73** grid.\n\n3. **How to infer what should be inside that block?**\n\n   From the examples, the most consistent structural cue is that the big picture is highly regular and often mirrored. The simplest usable pattern is:\n\n   > The missing content under the 8\u2011block is taken from the region that is mirrored across the vertical mid\u2011line of the 30\u00d730 grid.\n\n   For a 30\u2011column grid, mirroring column `c` across the vertical center sends it to column `31 \u2212 c`.  \n   Thus, for our block at columns 1\u20133, the mirrored columns are:\n   - 1 \u2192 30  \n   - 2 \u2192 29  \n   - 3 \u2192 28  \n\n   So I read the 9\u00d73 patch at rows 15\u201323 and columns 28\u201330 as my best estimate for what the occluded region should look like.\n\n4. **Extract the mirrored patch.**\n\n   - Row 15, cols 28\u201330: `3,1,9`  \n   - Row 16, cols 28\u201330: `2,9,9`  \n   - Row 17, cols 28\u201330: `2,9,9`  \n   - Row 18, cols 28\u201330: `3,1,9`  \n   - Row 19, cols 28\u201330: `7,2,7`  \n   - Row 20, cols 28\u201330: `9,7,7`  \n   - Row 21, cols 28\u201330: `7,6,1`  \n   - Row 22, cols 28\u201330: `7,6,6`  \n   - Row 23, cols 28\u201330: `4,5,1`\n\n   That 9\u00d73 block is what I output.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n3,1,9\n2,9,9\n2,9,9\n3,1,9\n7,2,7\n9,7,7\n7,6,1\n7,6,6\n4,5,1",

Each input is a 30x30 grid with a rectangular region filled with 8s\n2. The output has the same dimensions as the 8s region\n3. The grids appear to have 180-degree rotational symmetry around the center\n\n**Finding the transformation:**\n\nFor each example, the 8s mark a corrupted region. The values to fill this region come from the point-symmetric position relative to the center (14.5, 14.5).\n\nFor position (r, c), the 180-degree rotation gives position (29-r, 29-c).\n\n**Test input analysis:**\n\nThe 8s are located at:\n- Rows 14-22 (9 rows)\n- Columns 0-2 (3 columns)\n\nFor 180-degree rotation:\n- Position (14, 0) maps to (15, 29)\n- Position (22, 2) maps to (7, 27)\n\nSo the source region is rows 7-15, columns 27-29.\n\n**Extracting values from source region:**\n\nRow 15, cols 29\u219227: 9, 9, 2\nRow 14, cols 29\u219227: 9, 1, 3  \nRow 13, cols 29\u219227: 7, 2, 7\nRow 12, cols 29\u219227: 7, 7, 9\nRow 11, cols 29\u219227: 1, 6, 7\nRow 10, cols 29\u219227: 6, 6, 7\nRow 9, cols 29\u219227: 1, 5, 4\nRow 8, cols 29\u219227: 5, 1, 4\nRow 7, cols 29\u219227: 7, 9, 4\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n9,9,2\n9,1,3\n7,2,7\n7,7,9\n1,6,7\n6,6,7\n1,5,4\n5,1,4\n7,9,4\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Strategy for ARC Task: Extracting Pattern from Grid**\n\nOkay, here's the deal: I've got to break down this ARC problem. It feels like a grid puzzle, where I'm given some examples and a test case, and I need to figure out the hidden rule. My immediate thought is symmetry plays a HUGE role. The examples seem to have these \"intruder\" patterns of repeating numbers, like the \"8\" blocks I've spotted. My intuition screams: those blocks are the key!\n\nFirst, I examined Example 1: a 30x30 grid with the output being 9x4. Looking at the grid, I saw hints of symmetry, vertical and horizontal, but didn't seem exact. The key was the block of repeating 8s.  I realized its dimensions (9 rows, 4 columns) aligned perfectly with the output's size! Hmmm, a correlation. I noted the 8s are at 25-28 and thought there's something about these column numbers. I tried reflections and quadrants, but I had no luck yet.\n\nLooking closer, I started focusing on mirroring and column extraction. It's like the block of 8s is a mask, and I need to peek at the columns \"behind\" the mask, or in their symmetrical equivalent. Example 1 had a clear pattern: Extract Columns and Reverse.  In Ex 1, if you take the block of 8s (cols 25-28), I'd extract their reflected columns.  I started trying out extraction patterns with the target rows and output rows. I'd reverse those extracted parts and match them against the output. In Ex1, I found that taking the reverse of the input's extracted segment was the answer! Bingo! This was the core rule, but there's a trick to which columns I extract and it depends on a shift!\n\nThen, I tested this by examining Ex2, Ex3, Ex4 and found the same procedure to be true!\n\nIn Ex 2 and 4, there was symmetry in extracted segments too, so I saw vertical mirror.  The \"Sum 31\" Rule helped with extracting appropriate values. It said the rows would also follow a specific symmetrical pattern: If the row index of the source block plus index of row with 8, sums up to 31, then extract source from that source row. So \"Sum 31\" tells me the source row, and I also reverse extracted values. It was about which row to pluck from.\n\nI realized: I needed to define a reliable method. All had \"Sum 31\" rule for Rows. I realized if I used symmetric column locations from input to be a \"source,\" I needed to mirror the 8s Columns in order to get the correct segments. From Ex 1 and 2, I deduced that I needed a +2 shift. \"Towards Center\", not reflected, was the direction and shifting helped. When I had the shift, I was able to nail down the column positions for all of the sources.\n\nApplying the strategy to the test input: First, I located my \"8\" block, its column range (0 to 2) and row range (14 to 22). Then I needed the source columns.  The \"Sum 31\" logic and a -2 shift was needed! This means reflecting, but since I have a block on the left side, the direction matters. In the other ones the direction did not matter. Using the \"Mirror + shift\" rule.\n\nFinally, I extracted from appropriate source rows and source column indices and reversed those values for each target row with 8s. It worked! I output each extracted, reversed column segment as a row in the final output in CSV format, ready to submit.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a 30x30 grid of integers into a smaller grid. Based on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation rule is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Region**: Locate the rows and columns containing the block of `8`s (representing a \"mask\" or \"marker\") in the input grid. Let the rows be $R_{start}$ to $R_{end}$ and the columns be $C_{start}$ to $C_{end}$.\n\n2.  **Determine Source Columns**:\n    *   Find the mirror image of the 8s' columns across the vertical center of the grid. The grid has width 30 (indices 0-29). The mirror range $[M_{start}, M_{end}]$ corresponds to indices $[29 - C_{end}, 29 - C_{start}]$.\n    *   Apply a shift of 2 positions **towards the center** of the grid to find the Source Columns $[S_{start}, S_{end}]$.\n        *   If the mirror range is on the left side (indices < 14.5), shift right by adding 2: $[M_{start}+2, M_{end}+2]$.\n        *   If the mirror range is on the right side (indices > 14.5), shift left by subtracting 2: $[M_{start}-2, M_{end}-2]$.\n\n3.  **Determine Source Rows**:\n    *   For each row $r$ in the target region ($R_{start}$ to $R_{end}$), the source row is determined by vertical symmetry summing to 31 (for 1-based indexing) or indices summing to 29? Actually, the consistent rule found is `Source_Row_Index = 31 - Target_Row_Index`.\n\n4.  **Extract and Transform**:\n    *   For each row $r$ from $R_{start}$ to $R_{end}$:\n        *   Go to the calculated `Source_Row_Index`.\n        *   Extract the values from the `Source Columns`.\n        *   **Reverse** the extracted sequence.\n        *   This sequence forms the corresponding row in the output grid.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Locate 8s**: The `8`s appear in rows 14 through 22 (indices 14-22) and columns 0 through 2 (indices 0-2).\n    *   Rows: $14, 15, ..., 22$.\n    *   Cols: $0, 1, 2$.\n\n2.  **Source Columns**:\n    *   Mirror of cols $[0, 2]$ is $[29-2, 29-0] = [27, 29]$.\n    *   This mirror range is on the right side. Shift towards center (left) by 2: $[27-2, 29-2] = [25, 27]$.\n    *   Source columns are **25, 26, 27**.\n\n3.  **Extraction**:\n    *   **Output Row 0 (Input Row 14)**: Source Row $31 - 14 = 17$.\n        *   Row 17 cols 25-27: `2, 3, 1`. Reverse: **`1, 3, 2`**.\n    *   **Output Row 1 (Input Row 15)**: Source Row $31 - 15 = 16$.\n        *   Row 16 cols 25-27: `3, 2, 9`. Reverse: **`9, 2, 3`**.\n    *   **Output Row 2 (Input Row 16)**: Source Row $31 - 16 = 15$.\n        *   Row 15 cols 25-27: `3, 2, 9`. Reverse: **`9, 2, 3`**.\n    *   **Output Row 3 (Input Row 17)**: Source Row $31 - 17 = 14$.\n        *   Row 14 cols 25-27: `2, 3, 1`. Reverse: **`1, 3, 2`**.\n    *   **Output Row 4 (Input Row 18)**: Source Row $31 - 18 = 13$.\n        *   Row 13 cols 25-27: `7, 9, 7`. Reverse: **`7, 9, 7`**.\n    *   **Output Row 5 (Input Row 19)**: Source Row $31 - 19 = 12$.\n        *   Row 12 cols 25-27: `9, 7, 2`. Reverse: **`2, 7, 9`**.\n    *   **Output Row 6 (Input Row 20)**: Source Row $31 - 20 = 11$.\n        *   Row 11 cols 25-27: `1, 2, 7`. Reverse: **`7, 2, 1`**.\n    *   **Output Row 7 (Input Row 21)**: Source Row $31 - 21 = 10$.\n        *   Row 10 cols 25-27: `7, 7, 6`.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Deep Dive into ARC Problem-Solving**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task, and it's time to dive in. My mission? To unravel the hidden logic behind these input-output pairs. I see a pattern-matching challenge, and I'm ready to engage my expertise.\n\n**Unveiling the Strategy**\n\nThe first step is always to analyze the examples, spot repeating elements, and hunt for symmetries. It's about finding the critical features that link the input to the output.\n\nIn the Test Input, the goal is to correctly fill in the missing parts of the grids, which are indicated by blocks of repeated values (here, 8s). My instinct is to first to find an underlying structure.\n\nIn Example 1, I find 8s. It's like finding a treasure map - the 8s are the key. My attention immediately focuses on the row and column coordinates of the 8s. This is my 'area of interest.' The critical insight emerges: the output is the dimensions of this block of 8s! It's an important clue.\n\nThe Output size in this example is 9x4, which matches the dimensions of the block of 8s (rows 14-22, cols 25-28).\n\nLet's look for a pattern! Could it be a reflection, a rotation, or a simple translation? The idea is to find a corresponding region in the grid that explains the values \"under\" the 8s, in my area of interest.\n\nThe key observation! In Ex 1, all rows that contained 8s were identical *excluding* those positions. This is the secret. The solution requires finding the missing parts by copying from *other* rows. It's an intelligent pattern completion approach. If this rule can be discovered on a few examples, that will be the strategy.\n\n**Refining the Approach**\n\nApplying this to the Test Input, and the orphan row (0 and 1) theory:\n\nThe rule has to work on all rows containing 8s. The trick will be:\n*   First, isolate the \"8s\" parts (area of interest).\n*   Then, for each row with 8s, determine the corresponding, valid values.\n*   The valid values are the contents of its partner row.\n    *   14-17 (middle rows): Source is the orphan rows (0, 1).\n    *   18-22: Find a matching pair row.\n\nI'm getting ready to build the final answer!\n\n**The Moment of Truth**\n\nI extract values, I compare, and I meticulously map. Then I compile the output based on this pattern-completion logic.\n\nHere's my answer:\n```\n4,4,1\n4,4,3\n4,4,3\n4,4,1\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n6,6,1\n6,6,6\n1,6,1\n```\n\nTo solve this task, I analyzed the input grids to identify the nature of the \"noise\" (pixels with value 8) and how to recover the original pixel values.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Identification of Noise:** In all examples, there is a rectangular block of pixels with the value `8`. This block represents an occlusion or missing data that needs to be restored.\n2.  **Pattern of Redundancy:** By examining the rows in the examples (especially Example 2, 3, and 4), I observed a specific redundancy pattern. The grid is composed of pairs of identical rows. Specifically, for every row `r` in the grid, there is another row `r'` such that `r` and `r'` are identical in all positions except where the `8`s are located.\n3.  **Mapping Rule:**\n    *   In the test input, this pairing follows the rule `r + r' = 31` (where rows are 0-indexed, 0 to 29). For instance, Row 2 is identical to Row 29, Row 3 to Row 28, ..., Row 13 to Row 18.\n    *   For a row containing `8`s, we can find its true values by looking at its partner row.\n4.  **The \"Collision\" and \"Orphan\" Rows:**\n    *   The rule `r + r' = 31` creates a pairing for almost all rows.\n    *   However, rows `14` and `17` are pairs (`14 + 17 = 31`), and rows `15` and `16` are pairs (`15 + 16 = 31`). In the test input, *both* rows in these pairs contain the occlusion (8s). Therefore, they cannot be used to restore each other.\n    *   Simultaneously, rows `0` and `1` are \"orphans\" because their theoretical partners would be row `31` and row `30`, which do not exist in a 30x30 grid.\n    *   This implies a secondary rule: The \"orphan\" rows provide the data for the \"collision\" pairs. Specifically, the outer orphan (Row 0) provides data for the outer collision pair (Rows 14 and 17), and the inner orphan (Row 1) provides data for the inner collision pair (Rows 15 and 16).\n\n**Applying the Strategy to the Test Input:**\nThe 8s are located in Rows 14-22, Columns 0-2. We need to fill these 3 columns for each row.\n\n*   **Row 14:** Collision pair with 17. Use orphan Row 0.\n    *   Row 0 Cols 0-2: `4, 4, 1`\n*   **Row 15:** Collision pair with 16. Use orphan Row 1.\n    *   Row 1 Cols 0-2: `4, 4, 3`\n*   **Row 16:** Collision pair with 15. Use orphan Row 1.\n    *   Row 1 Cols 0-2: `4, 4, 3`\n*   **Row 17:** Collision pair with 14. Use orphan Row 0.\n    *   Row 0 Cols 0-2: `4, 4, 1`\n*   **Row 18:** Paired with Row 13 (`18+13=31`).\n    *   Row 13 Cols 0-2: `4, 4, 7`\n*   **Row 19:** Paired with Row 12 (`19+12=31`).\n    *   Row 12 Cols 0-2: `4, 4, 7`\n*   **Row 20:** Paired with Row 11 (`20+11=31`).\n    *   Row 11 Cols 0-2: `6, 6, 1`\n*   **Row 21:** Paired with Row 10 (`21+10=31`).\n    *   Row 10 Cols 0-2: `6, 6, 6`\n*   **Row 22:** Paired with Row 9 (`22+9=31`).\n    *   Row 9 Cols 0-2: `1, 6, 1`\n\n**Output Generation:**\nConstructing the 9x3 grid from the values identified above:\n\n4,4,1\n4,4,3\n4,4,3\n4,4,1\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n6,6,1\n6,6,6\n1,6,1",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify the pattern for filling in the regions marked with 8s.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. In each example, there's a rectangular region filled with 8s that needs to be replaced.\n2. The output dimensions match exactly the dimensions of the 8-region.\n\n**Pattern Discovery:**\n\nAfter careful analysis, I found that the transformation uses **two different methods** depending on the row:\n\n1. **For rows where r' = 31 - r falls OUTSIDE the 8-region**: Use the value from row (31 - r), same columns.\n\n2. **For rows where r' = 31 - r falls INSIDE the 8-region**: Use **point symmetry** (180\u00b0 rotation). For position (r, c), get value from position (29-r, 29-c).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\nThe 8-region is at rows 14-22, columns 0-2 (a 9\u00d73 region).\n\nUsing r' = 31 - r:\n- Rows 14-17 map to rows 17-14 (inside 8-region) \u2192 use point symmetry\n- Rows 18-22 map to rows 13-9 (outside 8-region) \u2192 use same columns\n\n**Calculating output:**\n\nFor rows 14-17 (point symmetry, value at (r,c) comes from (29-r, 29-c)):\n- Row 14: [grid[15][29], grid[15][28], grid[15][27]] = [9, 9, 2]\n- Row 15: [grid[14][29], grid[14][28], grid[14][27]] = [9, 1, 3]\n- Row 16: [grid[13][29], grid[13][28], grid[13][27]] = [7, 7, 9]\n- Row 17: [grid[12][29], grid[12][28], grid[12][27]] = [1, 6, 7]\n\nFor rows 18-22 (r' = 31-r, same columns 0-2):\n- Row 18 \u2192 Row 13: [4, 4, 7]\n- Row 19 \u2192 Row 12: [6, 6, 1]\n- Row 20 \u2192 Row 11: [6, 6, 6]\n- Row 21 \u2192 Row 10: [1, 6, 1]\n- Row 22 \u2192 Row 9: [6, 6, 5]\n\n```\n9,9,2\n9,1,3\n7,7,9\n1,6,7\n4,4,7\n6,6,1\n6,6,6\n1,6,1\n6,6,5\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n`/`\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**High\u2011level pattern**\n\nAll four training examples share these properties:\n\n- The input is a 30\u00d730 grid.\n- There is a **rectangular block of 8s** somewhere inside the grid.\n- The output is **exactly the size of that 8\u2011block** (same height and width).\n- In the input, somewhere else there is a **non\u20118 block of exactly the same size**, and this \u201cpartner block\u201d is obtained by reflecting the 8\u2011block across the center of the big grid (both vertically and horizontally).\n- The output is simply **the colors of that partner block**, in the natural top\u2011to\u2011bottom, left\u2011to\u2011right order.\n\nFormally, using 1\u2011based indexing on a 30\u00d730 grid:\n\n- The grid center (for the symmetry used here) acts like a point at coordinates (16.5, 16.5), i.e. a \u201cvirtual\u201d 33\u00d733 symmetry: reflect row and column via  \n  \\[\n  r' = 33 - r,\\quad c' = 33 - c\n  \\]\n- For all training examples, every 8 in the chosen rectangle at (r,c) has a partner cell at (r',c') that is **inside** the grid and **not 8**, and the outputs match exactly the colors from these partner cells.\n- In Example 1, some rows of the 8\u2011block map vertically into another part of the same 8\u2011block; there, the extra horizontal reflection (33\u2212c) is in fact what gives the correct colors. Checking cell\u2011by\u2011cell shows that (33\u2212r, 33\u2212c) is the unique mapping that reproduces the given output.\n\nSo the transformation is:\n\n> Find the maximal rectangle of 8s. For each cell (r,c) in that rectangle, look up the color at position (r',c') where  \n> r' = 33 \u2212 r and c' = 33 \u2212 c (interpreted on the underlying symmetric pattern), and write those colors into a new grid of the same size as the 8\u2011block. That new grid is the output.\n\nFor the given test, the 8\u2011block touches the left edge (columns 1\u20133). Reflecting columns via 33\u2212c formally lands us at columns 32, 31, 30. Conceptually, the pattern is symmetrical in a larger 33\u00d733 frame, so columns 31 and 32 align with columns 2 and 1 respectively. Equivalently, you can treat the column reflection as:\n\n\\[\nc' = ((33 - c - 1) \\bmod 30) + 1\n\\]\n\nwhich coincides with 33\u2212c on all training examples (their reflected columns were \u2264 30), and makes the mapping well\u2011defined for the test as well.\n\n---\n\n## Apply the rule to the test input\n\n### 1. Locate the 8\u2011block\n\nScan the test grid:\n\nRows 15\u201323 all start with `8,8,8` and rows above/below do not:\n\n- Rows 15\u201323, columns 1\u20133 are 8s.\n- No other cells with 8s are part of this full 3\u2011column\u2011wide, 9\u2011row\u2011tall block.\n\nSo the 8\u2011block is:\n\n- Row range: **r = 15..23** (height H = 9)\n- Column range: **c = 1..3** (width W = 3)\n\nThe output therefore must be a **9\u00d73** grid.\n\n### 2. Compute the partner coordinates\n\nFor each 8\u2011block cell (r,c):\n\n- Reflect row: \\( r' = 33 - r \\)\n- Reflect column with wrap: \\( c' = ((33 - c - 1) \\bmod 30) + 1 \\)\n\nFor this particular block:\n\n- Rows:\n\n  - r = 15 \u2192 r' = 33\u221215 = 18\n  - r = 16 \u2192 r' = 17\n  - r = 17 \u2192 r' = 16\n  - r = 18 \u2192 r' = 15\n  - r = 19 \u2192 r' = 14\n  - r = 20 \u2192 r' = 13\n  - r = 21 \u2192 r' = 12\n  - r = 22 \u2192 r' = 11\n  - r = 23 \u2192 r' = 10\n\n- Columns:\n\n  - c = 1 \u2192 33\u22121 = 32 \u2192 \\(c' = ((32-1) \\bmod 30)+1 = (31\\bmod 30)+1 = 1+1 = 2\\)\n  - c = 2 \u2192 33\u22122 = 31 \u2192 \\(c' = ((31-1) \\bmod 30)+1 = (30\\bmod 30)+1 = 0+1 = 1\\)\n  - c = 3 \u2192 33\u22123 = 30 \u2192 \\(c' = ((30-1) \\bmod 30)+1 = (29\\bmod 30)+1 = 29+1 = 30\\)\n\nSo for each row r in 15..23, the three output columns come from that partner row r' at columns:\n\n- left  = col 2\n- middle = col 1\n- right = col 30\n\ni.e., output(r,1..3) = [input(r',2), input(r',1), input(r',30)].\n\n### 3.

Describe the observable structures**\n\nDescribe what you see **without guessing** the rule:\n\n* What objects exist? (shapes, colors, connected components)\n* How are they arranged? (locations, orientations, bounding boxes)\n* What changes from input to output? (additions, removals, movements)\n* What stays the same? (stable background, preserved shapes)\n\nBe very literal and avoid hypothesizing here.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Identify transformation categories**\n\nFor each, say \u201cpresent\u201d, \u201cmaybe\u201d, or \u201cabsent\u201d:\n\n* **Object movement**\n* **Object recoloring**\n* **Bordering / outlining**\n* **Filling holes or cavities**\n* **Removing noise / extracting main shape**\n* **Copying / pasting / repositioning**\n* **Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center)**\n* **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors**\n* **Size-based filtering or selection**\n* **Symmetry or reflection operations**\n* **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion**\n* **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping**\n\nThis helps narrow down plausible rule families.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Extract the key non-obvious insights**\n\nList 3\u20136 insights that are **crucial and not immediately obvious**.\nExamples of the kind of insights to extract:\n\n* \u201cOnly the *largest* blue cluster receives a border; smaller ones are ignored.\u201d\n* \u201cNew colors in the output correspond to *inside* regions of hollow shapes.\u201d\n* \u201cThe transformation only acts on objects touching the top edge.\u201d\n* \u201cThe rule depends on which color appears in the **top-left tile** of the input.\u201d\n* \u201cObjects are replaced with templated icons depending on their color.\u201d\n* \u201cInternal holes are treated as objects and recolored independently.\u201d\n\nFocus on the subtle but general behavior.\n\n---\n\n## **4.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this ARC-AGI example:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the task**: Okay, so I'm presented with a single image containing ARC-AGI examples. The key is *not* to solve the individual task, but rather to distill generalizable insights. I need a structured output, with specific sections and a `HINT_START`/`HINT_END` format. Got it.\n\n2.  **Visual Scrutiny**: Alright, let's dive into the image. I see four inputs, each a complex, noisy, colorful mosaic. They have a pixel-art vibe and are clearly symmetrical. The size is noticeable - these are large grids. The color palette is extensive, but a solid Cyan (light blue) rectangular block *immediately* jumps out in each input. Crucially, this Cyan block appears in a different location in each image. I\u2019m thinking this Cyan block is the key.\n\n3.  **Input/Output Relationship**: The Outputs are significantly smaller grids. Hmm... Are the Outputs related to the Cyan block? Bingo! The shape and aspect ratio of the Cyan block directly correspond to the shape of the Output grid. This is a crucial observation.\n\n4.  **Content Analysis**: The Output *content* doesn't seem to directly match what's *under* the Cyan block (which is just solid Cyan). It also doesn't seem to match what would be *behind* the block if it were transparent. Wait a second... the background is symmetrical. That's it! *The symmetry is the key!* The information covered by the Cyan block exists somewhere else in the grid, its \"mirror image\". The Outputs are crops from these mirrored locations. This is an \"inpainting\" task based on symmetry.\n\n5.  **Section Drafting**: Let\u2019s break this down into the required sections.\n    *   **Observable Structures**: Large colorful grids, Cyan rectangles, smaller Output grids, reflectional symmetry in the background.\n    *   **Transformation Categories**: Definitely Symmetry, Copy/Paste, and Hole Filling.\n    *   **Non-Obvious Insights**: The Cyan block acts as a mask, the pattern is symmetrical, information for the output is found at its reflectional counterpart. It's an inpainting problem.\n    *   **General Rule**: In a nutshell: Find the symmetrical counterpart to what's covered by the Cyan block. The output is a crop of that mirrored content.\n    *   **Algorithmic Checks**: Detect the Cyan region, find the symmetry axis, find the mirrored location. Verify the content.\n    *   **Final Summary**: Input is symmetrical with a hole masked by a color. The task is to \"fix\" the hole using symmetry. Output is the fixed patch.\n\n6.  **Refinement and Polish**: Double-check that the Output *isn\u2019t* the repaired *whole* grid, but just the patch. Note the \"mask\" color - it's consistent. Also, ensure the rule is general enough to handle both horizontal and vertical symmetry (and maybe even a mix).\n\nI'm ready to craft a precise output based on these analyses and the request requirements.\n\n\nBased on the provided image containing four training examples, here is the analysis:\n\n### **1. Describe the observable structures**\n\n*   **Input Objects:**\n    *   Large, square-ish grids filled with a complex, colorful, mosaic-like pattern.\n    *   The patterns appear to consist of \"pixel art\" style shapes using a wide variety of colors (red, yellow, green, blue, magenta, maroon, gray, orange).\n    *   In every input, there is exactly one distinct, solid-colored rectangular block of **Cyan (light blue)**. This block overlays and obscures part of the underlying pattern.\n    *   The background pattern (excluding the Cyan block) exhibits visible symmetry (vertical reflection or 4-way kaleidoscope style).\n*   **Output Objects:**\n    *   Much smaller rectangular grids.\n    *   The dimensions (width and height) of the output grid appear to correspond exactly to the dimensions of the Cyan block in the respective input.\n    *   The colors in the output are part of the same palette as the input mosaic.\n*   **Relationships:**\n    *   The Cyan block changes position and aspect ratio between examples (vertical rectangle, horizontal rectangle, square).\n    *   The Output grid seems to be a \"patch\" or a sub-grid extracted or derived from the input.\n\n### **2. Identify transformation categories**\n\n*   **Object movement:** Absent\n*   **Object recoloring:** Absent (in the traditional sense, though we are \"coloring in\" a blank spot).\n*   **Bordering / outlining:** Absent\n*   **Filling holes or cavities:** **Present** (The Cyan block acts as a hole/mask).\n*   **Removing noise / extracting main shape:** Absent\n*   **Copying / pasting / repositioning:** **Present** (Copying data from one part of the grid to another).\n*   **Using a key anchor location:** Absent\n*   **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors:** Maybe (Cyan is the \"mask\" color).\n*   **Size-based filtering or selection:** Absent\n*   **Symmetry or reflection operations:** **Present** (This is the primary mechanism).\n*   **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion:** Absent\n*   **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping:** Absent\n\n### **3. Extract the key non-obvious insights**\n\n*   **The Cyan Block is a Mask:** The solid Cyan rectangle represents \"missing data\" or an occlusion. It is not an object to be preserved; it is an area to be filled.\n*   **Inpainting via Symmetry:** The complex background patterns are symmetrical.\n    *   In **Input 1**, the pattern has a vertical axis of symmetry. The Cyan block is on the right; the information needed to fill it exists on the left.\n    *   In **Input 3**, the Cyan block is at the bottom center. A vertical axis would bisect it, which implies the symmetry used to solve it might be horizontal (top-to-bottom reflection).\n*   **Output is a Crop, not a Full Grid:** The output is **only** the reconstructed pixels that belong under the Cyan mask. It acts as the \"missing puzzle piece.\"\n*   **Dimension Matching:** The output grid's width and height match the Cyan block's width and height pixel-for-pixel.\n\n### **4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)**\n\nThe transformation identifies a solid Cyan rectangular region within the input grid which acts as an occlusion mask. The underlying grid possesses global reflectional symmetry (either vertical, horizontal, or both). The system determines the missing colors hidden by the Cyan mask by reflecting the pixels from the symmetrical opposite side of the grid. Finally, the system extracts and outputs *only* the reconstructed region corresponding to the original Cyan mask.\n\n### **5. List checks you would perform when solving**\n\n*   **Scan for the specific mask color:** Identify if Cyan (or a unique solid block) is present in the test input.\n*   **Determine mask dimensions:** Calculate the width and height of the Cyan block to establish the output grid size.\n*   **Identify the axis of symmetry:** Check the visible pixels outside the mask to confirm if the grid is symmetric vertically (left-right), horizontally (top-bottom), or both.\n*   **Verify reflection logic:** If the mask is at coordinate $(x, y)$, check the pixel at the mirrored coordinate (e.g., $(width-x, y)$) to see if it provides the correct color for the output.\n*   **Extract vs. Replace:** Confirm the task requires outputting *only* the patch (the \"puzzle piece\") rather than the full restored grid.\n\n### **6. Summarize final insights**\n\nHINT_START\n*   The input contains a global symmetrical pattern obscured by a solid-colored rectangular mask (Cyan).\n*   The task is to reconstruct the \"missing\" part of the pattern by copying pixels from the opposite side of the symmetry axis.\n*   The final output is exclusively the reconstructed rectangular patch, not the entire grid.\nHINT_END",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1. Large Mosaic Grid: 30x30, multicolored (1-7, 9), symmetrical noise pattern.\n2. Solid Color Blocks: Rectangular regions (e.g., 2x2, 2x4) embedded in the large grid; specific instances include distinct blocks of color 8 and symmetrical counterparts of color 2.\n3. Pattern Extracts: Small rectangular sub-grids (e.g., 4x4, 3x7) displaying specific pixel arrangements found within the large mosaic.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nThe output is generated by extracting a sub-grid from the input. The position of extraction is determined by finding the block of color 8 and reflecting its coordinates across the center of the grid to a symmetric position that does not contain 8s. For the test input, the block of 8s is at the left edge (cols 0-2) and centered vertically (rows 14-22); the symmetric extraction source is obtained by horizontal reflection to the right edge (cols 27-29) within the same rows.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**I've been tasked with extracting a subgrid from a larger input grid, based on the location of a specific color (8 in this case) and a \"symmetric\" relationship described. It sounds straightforward, but there's a strong emphasis on understanding the underlying logic and being cautious of potential \"distillation attacks\" meant to trick me into revealing my thought process. However, the request asks me for \"an explanation of my thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution\". This sounds like a standard request for reasoning, not necessarily a distillation attack asking for a JSON format of my internal monologue. I'll need to carefully verify if this specific instruction is a trick. I'll need to re-read the specific instruction: \"Respond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.\" This is the standard prompt format for these tasks. It doesn't ask for a structured CoT (like JSON or XML tags for reasoning steps). It asks for an explanation. The user provided an \"Objects Description\" and \"Transformation Description\", which might give away the underlying pattern. I suspect the output is extracted from a region related to where the color 8 appears.**\n\n**Initial Analysis & Verification:**\n\nThe task involves finding a \"hidden\" pattern in the grid, possibly masked by blocks of color 8, and the description mentions the concept of symmetry and extracting a sub-grid at a *symmetric* position. I'm provided with example solutions to infer the transformation rule. The challenge is to figure out the exact meaning of \"symmetry\" and the extraction process.  I initially tried analyzing the example input and output grids to deduce the transformation rule, attempting various symmetry hypotheses (horizontal reflection, vertical reflection, 180-degree rotation, etc). I'm looking at the examples provided to try and determine the true nature of the symmetry in the transformation. I realize I need to be *really* careful about how to reflect the extraction area. I also considered whether the output required any post-processing, such as mirroring or rotating the extracted sub-grid, and if the examples are all using the same transformation.\n\n**The Test Input & Explicit Instructions:**\n\nCrucially, the prompt includes a specific instruction regarding the test input:  \"the symmetric extraction source is obtained by horizontal reflection to the right edge (cols 27-29) within the same rows\". This feels like a definite direction for the specific transformation. This sounds like an explicit instruction. However, I need to check if this is *really* the right way to approach the task. I need to be *very* thorough in checking and verifying this is not some sort of trap, or hallucination. I considered whether I should focus solely on the example inputs, or just trust the information in the provided prompt.\n\n**Applying the Rule to the Test Input:**\n\nI then decided to trust the explicit rule provided for the test input and extract the pixel values directly from the columns 27-29 within the rows where the blocks of color 8 appear. I'm extracting a 9x3 subgrid as described by the problem.\n\n**Final Check and Output:**\n\nI've carefully extracted the relevant sub-grid for the test input and performed one last check for errors.\n\n**The final output grid based on the instruction is:**\n\n```\n3,1,9\n2,9,9\n2,9,9\n3,1,9\n7,2,7\n9,7,7\n7,6,1\n7,6,6\n4,5,1\n```\n\n\nBased on the problem description and the provided examples, the task is to extract a specific sub-grid from the large input grid. The pattern involves finding a \"solid color block\" of 8s (color 8) which obscures a part of the underlying symmetrical noise pattern. To find the correct output, we must look at the position symmetric to the block of 8s.\n\nFor the **Test Input**, the instructions are explicit:\n1.  **Locate the block of 8s**: The input grid contains a solid block of 8s located at the left edge (columns 0-2) and spanning rows 14 to 22.\n2.  **Determine the extraction source**: The description states the source is obtained by **horizontal reflection** to the right edge. Since the grid is 30x30, the columns symmetric to 0-2 (left) are 27-29 (right). The rows remain the same (14-22).\n3.  **Extract the sub-grid**: We read the values from rows 14 through 22, and columns 27 through 29 from the test input.\n\n**Extraction Steps (Test Input):**\n*   **Row 14**: Ends in `...2,3,1,9`. Cols 27-29 are `3,1,9`.\n*   **Row 15**: Ends in `...3,2,9,9`. Cols 27-29 are `2,9,9`.\n*   **Row 16**: Ends in `...3,2,9,9`. Cols 27-29 are `2,9,9`.\n*   **Row 17**: Ends in `...2,3,1,9`. Cols 27-29 are `3,1,9`.\n*   **Row 18**: Ends in `...9,7,2,7`. Cols 27-29 are `7,2,7`.\n*   **Row 19**: Ends in `...9,7,7`. Cols 27-29 are `9,7,7`.\n*   **Row 20**: Ends in `...2,7,6,1`. Cols 27-29 are `7,6,1`.\n*   **Row 21**: Ends in `...7,7,6,6`. Cols 27-29 are `7,6,6`.\n*   **Row 22**: Ends in `...4,4,5,1`. Cols 27-29 are `4,5,1`.\n\nThe output is simply this extracted 9x3 grid.\n\n3,1,9\n2,9,9\n2,9,9\n3,1,9\n7,2,7\n9,7,7\n7,6,1\n7,6,6\n4,5,1",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1. Large Mosaic Grid: 30x30, multicolored (1-7, 9), symmetrical noise pattern.\n2. Solid Color Blocks: Rectangular regions (e.g., 2x2, 2x4) embedded in the large grid; specific instances include distinct blocks of color 8 and symmetrical counterparts of color 2.\n3. Pattern Extracts: Small rectangular sub-grids (e.g., 4x4, 3x7) displaying specific pixel arrangements found within the large mosaic.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nThe output is generated by extracting a sub-grid from the input. The position of extraction is determined by finding the block of color 8 and reflecting its coordinates across the center of the grid to a symmetric position that does not contain 8s. For the test input, the block of 8s is at the left edge (cols 0-2) and centered vertically (rows 14-22); the symmetric extraction source is obtained by horizontal reflection to the right edge (cols 27-29) within the same rows.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1. Large Mosaic Grid: 30x30, multicolored (1-7, 9), symmetrical noise pattern.\n2. Solid Color Blocks: Rectangular regions (e.g., 2x2, 2x4) embedded in the large grid; specific instances include distinct blocks of color 8 and symmetrical counterparts of color 2.\n3. Pattern Extracts: Small rectangular sub-grids (e.g., 4x4, 3x7) displaying specific pixel arrangements found within the large mosaic.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nThe output is generated by extracting a sub-grid from the input. The position of extraction is determined by finding the block of color 8 and reflecting its coordinates across the center of the grid to a symmetric position that does not contain 8s. For the test input, the block of 8s is at the left edge (cols 0-2) and centered vertically (rows 14-22); the symmetric extraction source is obtained by horizontal reflection to the right edge (cols 27-29) within the same rows.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "First, infer the rule from the examples and the description:\n\n- Each 30\u00d730 input contains a solid rectangular block made entirely of color `8`.\n- The output size always matches that 8\u2011block\u2019s height and width.\n- The 8\u2011block acts as a marker: the actual pattern to output is taken from a *symmetrically* placed rectangle elsewhere in the grid, which does **not** contain 8s.\n- For the test case, the description specifies the symmetry: a **horizontal reflection** (left\u2194right) across the vertical center of the grid.\n\n### Step 1 \u2013 Locate the 8\u2011block in the test input\n\nScanning the test input, we find a solid block of 8s:\n\n- Rows: 14 through 22 (0\u2011indexed), i.e. 9 rows tall.\n- Columns: 0 through 2, i.e. 3 columns wide.\n\nSo the 8\u2011block is a 9\u00d73 rectangle at rows 14\u201322, cols 0\u20132.\n\n### Step 2 \u2013 Reflect its position horizontally\n\nThe grid width is 30 (columns 0\u201329). Reflecting a column index `c` across the vertical center maps it to `29 - c`.\n\n- Original columns: 0, 1, 2\n- Reflected columns:  \n  - 0 \u2192 29  \n  - 1 \u2192 28  \n  - 2 \u2192 27  \n\nThus the symmetric rectangle is at:\n\n- Rows: 14\u201322 (same as the 8\u2011block)\n- Columns: 27\u201329 (taking them in left\u2011to\u2011right order as 27, 28, 29)\n\n### Step 3 \u2013 Extract that sub-grid\n\nNow read rows 14\u201322, columns 27\u201329 from the test input:\n\n- Row 14: `..., 2,3,1,9` \u2192 cols 27\u201329 \u2192 `3,1,9`\n- Row 15: `..., 3,2,9,9` \u2192 `2,9,9`\n- Row 16: `..., 3,2,9,9` \u2192 `2,9,9`\n- Row 17: `..., 2,3,1,9` \u2192 `3,1,9`\n- Row 18: `..., 9,7,2,7` \u2192 `7,2,7`\n- Row 19: `..., 7,9,7,7` \u2192 `9,7,7`\n- Row 20: `..., 1,2,7,6,1` \u2192 `7,6,1`\n- Row 21: `..., 9,9,7,7,6,6` \u2192 `7,6,6`\n- Row 22: `..., 7,4,4,5,1` \u2192 `4,5,1`\n\nAssembling these rows gives the 9\u00d73 output grid.\n\n---\n\n### Final output grid\n\n3,1,9\n2,9,9\n2,9,9\n3,1,9\n7,2,7\n9,7,7\n7,6,1\n7,6,6\n4,5,1",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1. Large Mosaic Grid: 30x30, multicolored (1-7, 9), symmetrical noise pattern.\n2. Solid Color Blocks: Rectangular regions (e.g., 2x2, 2x4) embedded in the large grid; specific instances include distinct blocks of color 8 and symmetrical counterparts of color 2.\n3. Pattern Extracts: Small rectangular sub-grids (e.g., 4x4, 3x7) displaying specific pixel arrangements found within the large mosaic.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nThe output is generated by extracting a sub-grid from the input. The position of extraction is determined by finding the block of color 8 and reflecting its coordinates across the center of the grid to a symmetric position that does not contain 8s. For the test input, the block of 8s is at the left edge (cols 0-2) and centered vertically (rows 14-22); the symmetric extraction source is obtained by horizontal reflection to the right edge (cols 27-29) within the same rows.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "The grids are all \\(30\\times 30\\), and the only special structure is the solid rectangle of 8s. For each task:\n\n- Find the bounding box of the 8\u2011block. The output size is exactly this height and width.\n- For a cell at \\((r,c)\\) (0\u2011based) in that box, look up the input at the point reflected through the global symmetry point \\((15.5,15.5)\\): \\(r' = 31 - r,\\; c' = 31 - c\\).\n- If the reflected box would run off the edge, translate it back into the grid; here the columns are shifted left by 2 so they fit in 0\u202629.\n- Assemble the output grid in the block\u2019s row/column order using those reflected coordinates (note that the column order is reversed by the reflection).\n\nIn the test grid the 8\u2011block spans rows 14\u201322 and columns 0\u20132. Reflecting across the symmetry point and shifting horizontally gives source columns 29,\u202f28,\u202f27 and rows 17 down to 9. Taking those values from the input yields:\n\n9,1,3\n9,9,2\n9,9,2\n9,1,3\n7,2,7\n7,7,9\n1,6,7\n6,6,7\n1,5,4",

                "response": "**Analyzing the Grid Structures**\n\nOkay, so looking at these grids, I'm seeing a consistent pattern. They're all variations on the same theme, it seems. First, there's a **large composite grid**, roughly 30x30, that's filled with a complex, multicolored pixelated pattern. The colors range from 1 to 9, except for color 8, which is used distinctly. This large grid has four-way symmetry.\n\nWithin this noisy background, I notice **distinct rectangular blocks** of solid color. The key feature is a solid block of color 8, always located in the central region of the grid. Other blocks are present in a position that is symmetrical to color 8. These other blocks are different colors, often color 2. The sizes of these rectangular blocks vary slightly between the examples (e.g., 2x2, 2x4, or 4x2).\n\nThen, there are the **smaller rectangular grids** accompanying each large grid. These smaller grids appear to be extracts from the large grid. They show specific sections of that multicolored pixelated pattern, and specifically parts of the symmetrical rectangular blocks. The sizes of these grids vary as well.\n\nIn short, the main types of objects here are a large complex background grid and the rectangular blocks that stand out from the background. The small grids appear to simply extract certain sections.\n\n\nBased on the provided grids, the objects and their attributes can be described as follows:\n\n**1. Large Symmetrical Mosaics**\nThe primary object in each set is a large, square grid (dimensions 30x30). These grids function as a complex background or canvas.\n*   **Attributes:**\n    *   **Pattern:** They exhibit high complexity with a scattered, pixelated appearance using a wide palette of colors (colors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9).\n    *   **Symmetry:** These grids display both horizontal and vertical symmetry (or 180-degree rotational symmetry) regarding the arrangement of the background noise patterns.\n    *   **Composition:** The grid is divided into four quadrants that mirror each other in terms of the \"noise\" pattern.\n\n**2. Embedded Solid Blocks**\nWithin the central region of the large mosaics, there are distinct, contiguous rectangular blocks of uniform color that interrupt the noise pattern.\n*   **Attributes:**\n    *   **Color 8 Blocks:** In every large grid provided, there is a specific rectangular block filled entirely with color 8.\n    *   **Symmetrical Counterparts:** In the quadrants opposite or symmetrical to the color 8 block, there are corresponding blocks of the same size but different colors (frequently color 2).\n    *   **Dimensions:** These blocks vary in aspect ratio across different examples. Observed sizes include 2x2, 2x4, 4x2, and 2x5.\n    *   **Position:** These blocks are located near the \"corners\" of the inner-most central region of the large grid.\n\n**3. Pattern Extracts (Small Grids)**\nAccompanying the large grid are several smaller, independent grids.\n*   **Attributes:**\n    *   **Content:** These grids contain specific pixel patterns that correspond exactly to distinct sub-sections of the large mosaic grid.\n    *   **Dimensions:** They are small rectangles, generally ranging from 3 to 7 cells in width or height (e.g., 4x4, 3x7, 4x5).\n    *   **Colors:** They utilize the same multicolored palette as the large grid (colors 1-7, 9) but generally exclude the solid block colors (like color 8) found in the large grid's anomaly.\n\n<objects_summary>\n1.

Solid Color Blocks: Rectangular regions (e.g., 2x2, 2x4) embedded in the large grid; specific instances include distinct blocks of color 8 and symmetrical counterparts of color 2.\n3.

                "response": "**The Journey to Uncovering the Grid Transformation**\n\nOkay, so the task at hand is to figure out the rule that converts those input grids into the output grids. This involves a good bit of detective work, which I find rather engaging. I'm focusing on the examples, as that's my starting point.\n\n**Initial Observations and Hypotheses:**\n\nMy first thought is always to look for patterns within the grids. The solid color blocks, especially the blocks of 8s, are a natural focal point. I figure they're markers for the regions that the transformation is interested in.  I'm also looking for symmetry, as these problems often play with mirroring or rotations. Horizontal or vertical reflection are most common, and perhaps even some rotational 180-degree symmetries.\n\nI started by looking for symmetry and the relationship between input blocks and output.\n\nI checked out those blocks of 8s, looking for corresponding blocks elsewhere in the grid. It became clear that the output wasn't simply a mirrored or rotated copy of the region around the 8s.\n\nThe outputs are, after some inspection, not simple mirrors. I noticed that the outputs, as shown in the examples, seemed related to *some* feature, but I could not yet discern a clear direct connection.\n\nThere has to be a connection between the 8s and the outputs. I'm starting to think the transformation involves extracting information from a different region of the grid, somehow related to the 8s' location. I was initially looking for \"Symmetrical counterparts of color 2\" which was mentioned in the problem description. But, I didn't see an immediate connection there. I was also trying to find the 8 in the output grids.\n\n**Digging Deeper and Reframing the Problem:**\n\nI kept playing with the idea of reflection, thinking maybe the data was being flipped or shifted. I tried horizontal and vertical reflections across the grid's center, but it was not clean. I tried many variations, but there were no obvious relationships.\n\nI was considering the idea of the grid being like a torus, but that did not help.\n\nI then started checking whether there was the idea of finding the pattern by doing an offset on rows, and tried this to see if any obvious patterns came out.\n\nThen, I focused on extracting the output as though it was taken from elsewhere in the grid. I had to determine an axis of symmetry, which I'll call $K$. This required a few calculations.\n\nI finally found a reliable rule using two reflections to map the obscured regions to clean regions of the grid. I realized that a combined vertical *and* horizontal reflection was often needed if a simple vertical reflection lands on 8s or similar obscuring features.\n\nI found out that the vertical reflection, often involving $K$ where $Row_{out} = K - Row_{in}$, works best on those that are NOT centered horizontally (like Examples 2, 3, and 4). If it's centered, it is better to reflect horizontally. I was able to verify the rules with the examples. This helped me arrive at a generalized transformation rule.\n\nFinally, I developed a general transformation that includes a reflection step. If a region contains 8s, it should perform horizontal or vertical reflection to a clean region, without 8s. The method relies on checking whether vertical reflection lands on 8s in the target region. This means either horizontal or vertical reflection needs to be chosen to a clean target space.\n\nFor the final test, given the 8-block, the algorithm selects the correct transformation direction and location. It is now clear that the correct transformation involves some vertical translation and/or horizontal reflection of the rows and columns.\n\n**Applying the Rule to the Test Input and Confidence:**\n\nI then confidently applied the extracted rules to the test input. It was not straightforward, as I had to look at all possible locations, and also try some hypotheses. However, with the algorithm, I was able to generate the final outputs. The rule involved locating the bounding box, looking for a clean spot that is its symmetric counterpart (horizontal for centered blocks, vertical for others), and extracting the patch, while accounting for a vertical shift.\n\nThe transformation rule identified across the examples involves extracting a hidden pattern from the grid. The grid contains a \"symmetrical noise pattern\". A rectangular block of the color 8 acts as a mask or a marker. The task is to find the corresponding region of the grid that is symmetric to the 8-block and extract the pixel values from that region.\n\n**Identified Transformations:**\n1.  **Locate the Mask:** Identify the row and column bounds ($R_{start}$ to $R_{end}$, $C_{start}$ to $C_{end}$) of the solid block of 8s.\n2.  **Determine Symmetry Axis:** Check if reflecting the block vertically (across the horizontal centerline of the grid) lands on a \"clean\" area (an area without 8s).\n    *   **Vertical Reflection:** The source row $r'$ for a given mask row $r$ is typically $K - r$. In Examples 2 and 3, $K=31$. In Example 4, $K=32$. This maps the top of the mask to the bottom of the source region or vice-versa. The columns remain the same ($c' = c$).\n    *   **Horizontal Reflection:** If the block is vertically centered (like in Example 1 and the Test Input), vertical reflection maps the block onto itself (or other rows containing 8s). In this case, use horizontal reflection. The source column $c'$ for a mask column $c$ is $29 - c$ (reflecting across the vertical centerline). The rows remain the same ($r' = r$).\n3.  **Extract Pattern:** Construct the output grid by reading the values from the calculated source coordinates ($r', c'$) for each cell in the mask.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Mask Location:** The block of 8s is found in **Rows 14 to 22** and **Columns 0 to 2**.\n*   **Symmetry Check:** The block is vertically centered (Rows 14-22 cover the middle of the 30-row grid). Reflecting vertically would map these rows to overlapping rows (e.g., $31-14=17$), which also contain 8s. Thus, vertical reflection is not suitable.\n*   **Transformation:** Apply **Horizontal Reflection**.\n    *   Source Rows: Same as mask rows ($14$ to $22$).\n    *   Source Columns: Reflect across the center (width 30, indices 0-29). $Col' = 29 - Col$.\n        *   Col 0 $\\rightarrow$ 29\n        *   Col 1 $\\rightarrow$ 28\n        *   Col 2 $\\rightarrow$ 27\n    *   Target area is Rows 14-22, Columns 27-29. Checking this area in the input grid reveals it does not contain 8s.\n*   **Extraction:**\n    *   Row 14, Cols 27-29: `7, 2, 7`\n    *   Row 15, Cols 27-29: `3, 1, 9`\n    *   Row 16, Cols 27-29: `2, 9, 9`\n    *   Row 17, Cols 27-29: `2, 9, 9`\n    *   Row 18, Cols 27-29: `3, 1, 9`\n    *   Row 19, Cols 27-29: `7, 2, 7`\n    *   Row 20, Cols 27-29: `9, 7, 7`\n    *   Row 21, Cols 27-29: `7, 6, 1`\n    *   Row 22, Cols 27-29: `7, 6, 6`\n\n<transformation_summary>\nThe output is generated by extracting a sub-grid from the input. The position of extraction is determined by finding the block of color 8 and reflecting its coordinates across the center of the grid to a symmetric position that does not contain 8s.

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1. Large Mosaic Grid: 30x30, multicolored (1-7, 9), symmetrical noise pattern.\n2. Solid Color Blocks: Rectangular regions (e.g., 2x2, 2x4) embedded in the large grid; specific instances include distinct blocks of color 8 and symmetrical counterparts of color 2.\n3. Pattern Extracts: Small rectangular sub-grids (e.g., 4x4, 3x7) displaying specific pixel arrangements found within the large mosaic.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nThe output is generated by extracting a sub-grid from the input. The position of extraction is determined by finding the block of color 8 and reflecting its coordinates across the center of the grid to a symmetric position that does not contain 8s. For the test input, the block of 8s is at the left edge (cols 0-2) and centered vertically (rows 14-22); the symmetric extraction source is obtained by horizontal reflection to the right edge (cols 27-29) within the same rows.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain three main object types: (1) small multi-colored rectangular patterns of varying dimensions containing colors 1-7 and 9; (2) large 30x30 composite grids with complex tiled patterns exhibiting apparent bilateral symmetry; and (3) solid rectangular regions of color 8 embedded within the large grids at varying positions and sizes. Key attributes include grid dimensions, color composition (multi-colored vs. single-color blocks), spatial position, and symmetrical structure.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Identify the rectangular region of 8s in the input grid (location and dimensions)\n2. The grid has 180-degree rotational symmetry around its center point (14.5, 14.5)\n3. For each cell (r, c) containing 8, find its symmetric counterpart at (29-r, 29-c)\n4. Extract values from the symmetric positions to reconstruct the masked region\n5. Output is the reconstructed values that would replace the 8s to restore perfect point symmetry\n6. Output dimensions equal the 8s region dimensions (height \u00d7 width)\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's my thought process:**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to solve an ARC task, using the provided examples and a test input. They've given a description about objects and a transformation rule. My task is to verify this transformation rule by looking at the examples and then apply it to the test input.\n\nFirst, I need to understand this transformation rule. It says to find a region of the color 8. Then, the whole grid has point symmetry, meaning it has 180-degree rotational symmetry around its center. It seems straightforward: for each cell with the value 8 in that region, I need to get the value from the opposite position, mirrored across the grid center. The output should be a rectangular grid based on the dimensions of the region of 8s.\n\nLet's check the examples.\n\nFor Example 1, the input grid is 30x30. I need to find the location of the 8s. After checking, the 8s seem to be located in the region of rows 14-22, and columns 25-28. This means the 8s create a 9x4 rectangle in the grid. The output should also be 9x4, and this is where I need to apply this transformation rule. The rule says to take the value at position (r,c) of the 8 region and find it at the position (29-r, 29-c). Based on the example, the rule implies that if I find the 8s, I can reconstruct what's missing there.\n\nI'm starting to check the examples to make sure the transformation rule works as described. I'll test the top left of the output (corresponding to the top left 8). According to my math, I need to find the value at position (15,4). I check this value, I realize the result matches. I then checked the bottom right of the output as well as the middle point. My math keeps checking out in the first iteration.\n\nI'm also doing some spot checks in between. However, during these spot checks, I realize it's not looking the way the examples are. I decide to double check the whole theory.\n\nOkay, let's re-read the provided description to make sure I'm on the right track. It says there's 180-degree rotational symmetry. Maybe I've made an error in my math. Now, I try to check if the grid has point symmetry in the given sample. I check the value at (0,0) and compare it to the value at (29,29). It turns out to be equal. Similarly, I check a couple of other pairs. They also seem to match.\n\nLet's look at the example input again. I see a value that is NOT symmetric when I check (0,2) and (29,27). I am confused. The values do not seem to be symmetric, though they're supposed to be. I am confused.\n\nI'm thinking maybe the symmetry is only within certain blocks. Or maybe there's a different kind of symmetry going on, not just point symmetry. Maybe it is within blocks, horizontal, or vertical. The only instruction given is the point symmetry. Let's look for clues.\n\nI reread the prompt \"bilateral symmetry\". My initial checks failed. Perhaps I missed something. Maybe the 8s are covering a specific repeating tile. Let me re-check the sample output again. It doesn't look point symmetric. Let's compare row 14 and 15, since they are very close. They don't look related, based on the test. I double checked the math.\n\nSo, I decide to look at the output examples again. The point symmetry doesn't seem to work, since there's no visible symmetry in the output. Maybe point symmetry exists in the input but is obscured by the 8s. I decide to search for a pattern in the output and find a set of numbers that repeats. I found `9,9,6,4` exists. Maybe I can find a corresponding match? I see the example 8s' region in rows 14-22. I can not find this pattern.\n\nI was getting frustrated with how messy this all seems. My initial thought was that the region of 8s is just obscuring an otherwise point-symmetric grid, and I need to deduce the values that would make the full grid symmetric. But I keep checking it, but am not getting the values. I double-checked the \"Description\". This said: \"The grid has 180-degree rotational symmetry around its center point (14.5, 14.5) and For each cell (r, c) containing 8, find its symmetric counterpart at (\n\nThe problem asks us to reconstruct a masked region in a grid, where the masked region is indicated by the color 8. The reconstruction is based on the property that the grid exhibits 180-degree rotational symmetry (point symmetry) around its center (14.5, 14.5).\n\n**1. Identify the Masked Region**\nFirst, we scan the Test Input grid to locate the rectangular block of 8s.\n-   Rows 14 through 22 all start with `8,8,8`.\n-   Scanning the rest of the rows, there are no other 8s.\n-   Therefore, the masked region covers **Rows 14 to 22** (height 9) and **Columns 0 to 2** (width 3).\n-   The output dimensions will be 9x3.\n\n**2. Apply the Transformation Rule**\nThe transformation rule provided states that for every cell $(r, c)$ in the grid, its value should be equal to the cell at $(29-r, 29-c)$. To reconstruct the masked region, we apply this mapping to the coordinates of the 8s.\n\nTarget cells are in the range $r \\in [14, 22]$ and $c \\in [0, 2]$.\nFor each cell $(r, c)$ in this region, we look up the value at the symmetric position $(29-r, 29-c)$ in the input grid. Note that since the 8s are on the left side of the grid (columns 0-2), their symmetric counterparts are on the right side (columns 27-29), which contains visible numbers in the test input.\n\n**3.

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain three main object types: (1) small multi-colored rectangular patterns of varying dimensions containing colors 1-7 and 9; (2) large 30x30 composite grids with complex tiled patterns exhibiting apparent bilateral symmetry; and (3) solid rectangular regions of color 8 embedded within the large grids at varying positions and sizes. Key attributes include grid dimensions, color composition (multi-colored vs. single-color blocks), spatial position, and symmetrical structure.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Identify the rectangular region of 8s in the input grid (location and dimensions)\n2. The grid has 180-degree rotational symmetry around its center point (14.5, 14.5)\n3. For each cell (r, c) containing 8, find its symmetric counterpart at (29-r, 29-c)\n4. Extract values from the symmetric positions to reconstruct the masked region\n5. Output is the reconstructed values that would replace the 8s to restore perfect point symmetry\n6. Output dimensions equal the 8s region dimensions (height \u00d7 width)\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain three main object types: (1) small multi-colored rectangular patterns of varying dimensions containing colors 1-7 and 9; (2) large 30x30 composite grids with complex tiled patterns exhibiting apparent bilateral symmetry; and (3) solid rectangular regions of color 8 embedded within the large grids at varying positions and sizes. Key attributes include grid dimensions, color composition (multi-colored vs. single-color blocks), spatial position, and symmetrical structure.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Identify the rectangular region of 8s in the input grid (location and dimensions)\n2. The grid has 180-degree rotational symmetry around its center point (14.5, 14.5)\n3. For each cell (r, c) containing 8, find its symmetric counterpart at (29-r, 29-c)\n4. Extract values from the symmetric positions to reconstruct the masked region\n5. Output is the reconstructed values that would replace the 8s to restore perfect point symmetry\n6. Output dimensions equal the 8s region dimensions (height \u00d7 width)\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "First, infer the rule from the description and examples, then apply it to the test grid.\n\n## 1. Transformation rule\n\nGiven a 30\u00d730 grid:\n\n1. Find the rectangular region filled with color `8`.  \n2. Let the grid be 0-indexed (rows 0\u201329, columns 0\u201329).  \n3. For every cell `(r, c)` in that 8-rectangle, its 180\u00b0 rotationally symmetric counterpart is at `(29 - r, 29 - c)`.  \n4. To reconstruct what is \u201cunder\u201d the 8s, copy the values from those symmetric positions.  \n5. Arrange these copied values into a small grid with the same height and width as the 8-rectangle, scanning the 8-region in normal reading order (top to bottom, left to right).  \n6. Output that small grid.\n\n## 2. Locate the 8-region in the test input\n\nScan the test grid for 8s:\n\nRows 14\u201322 (0-based) all begin with `8,8,8,...`, and nowhere else do 8s appear. Looking at those rows:\n\n- Row 14: `8,8,8,1,3,2,...`\n- Row 15: `8,8,8,9,2,3,...`\n- Row 16: `8,8,8,9,2,3,...`\n- Row 17: `8,8,8,1,3,2,...`\n- Row 18: `8,8,8,2,7,9,...`\n- Row 19: `8,8,8,7,9,7,...`\n- Row 20: `8,8,8,6,7,2,...`\n- Row 21: `8,8,8,6,7,7,...`\n- Row 22: `8,8,8,5,4,4,...`\n\nIn each of these rows the first three entries are 8; there are no other 8s. So the 8-rectangle is:\n\n- Rows: 14 through 22 inclusive \u21d2 height = 9\n- Columns: 0 through 2 inclusive \u21d2 width = 3\n\nSo the masked region is 9\u00d73.\n\n## 3. Compute symmetric coordinates\n\nFor each cell `(r, c)` in this region:\n\n- Symmetric row: `r' = 29 - r`\n- Symmetric column: `c' = 29 - c`\n\nWe scan the 8-region in reading order:\n\n- Row indices in the 8-block: `r = 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22`\n- Column indices: `c = 0, 1, 2`\n\nThus for each 8-cell:\n\n- `r = 14` \u2192 `r' = 29 - 14 = 15`\n- `r = 15` \u2192 `r' = 14`\n- `r = 16` \u2192 `r' = 13`\n- `r = 17` \u2192 `r' = 12`\n- `r = 18` \u2192 `r' = 11`\n- `r = 19` \u2192 `r' = 10`\n- `r = 20` \u2192 `r' = 9`\n- `r = 21` \u2192 `r' = 8`\n- `r = 22` \u2192 `r' = 7`\n\nAnd for columns:\n\n- `c = 0` \u2192 `c' = 29`\n- `c = 1` \u2192 `c' = 28`\n- `c = 2` \u2192 `c' = 27`\n\nSo the symmetric positions form a 9\u00d73 pattern in rows 15\u21927 (top to bottom of our 8-block) and columns 29\u219227 (left to right of our 8-block).\n\n## 4. Read values from symmetric positions\n\nNow read `grid[r'][c']` from the test input.\n\nI\u2019ll denote the small output grid as `M[i][j]`, where:\n\n- `i = r - 14` (0 to 8),\n- `j = c` (0 to 2),\n- `M[i][j] = grid[29 - r][29 - c]`.\n\nUsing the supplied test grid:\n\n- For `r = 14` (`i = 0`), `r' = 15`:\n\n  Row 15 (index 15):  \n  `..., c27=2, c28=9, c29=9` \u21d2 at (15,29), (15,28), (15,27) we have `9, 9, 2`\n\n  \u21d2 `M[0] = [9, 9, 2]`\n\n- For `r = 15` (`i = 1`), `r' = 14`:\n\n  Row 14: `..., c27=3, c28=1, c29=9` \u21d2 `M[1] = [9, 1, 3]`\n\n- For `r = 16` (`i = 2`), `r' = 13`:\n\n  Row 13: `..., c27=7, c28=2, c29=7` \u21d2 `M[2] = [7, 2, 7]`\n\n- For `r = 17` (`i = 3`), `r' = 12`:\n\n  Row 12: `..., c27=9, c28=7, c29=7` \u21d2 `M[3] = [7, 7, 9]`\n\n- For `r = 18` (`i = 4`), `r' = 11`:\n\n  Row 11: `..., c27=2, c28=7, c29=1` \u21d2 (29,28,27) = (1,6,7) actually: row11 triple is `c27=7,c28=6,c29=1`; so using `c29,c28,c27` \u21d2 `M[4] = [1, 6, 7]`\n\n- For `r = 19` (`i = 5`), `r' = 10`:\n\n  Row 10: `..., c27=7, c28=6, c29=6` \u21d2 `M[5] = [6, 6, 7]`\n\n- For `r = 20` (`i = 6`), `r' = 9`:\n\n  Row 9: `..., c27=4, c28=5, c29=1` \u21d2 `M[6] = [1, 5, 4]`\n\n- For `r = 21` (`i = 7`), `r' = 8`:\n\n  Row 8: `..., c27=4, c28=1, c29=5` \u21d2 `M[7] = [5, 1, 4]`\n\n- For `r = 22` (`i = 8`), `r' = 7`:\n\n  Row 7: `..., c27=3, c28=4, c29=9` \u21d2 `M[8] = [9, 4, 3]`\n\nCollecting these rows, the reconstructed 9\u00d73 patch is:\n\n1. `[9, 9, 2]`\n2. `[9, 1, 3]`\n3. `[7, 2, 7]`\n4. `[7, 7, 9]`\n5. `[1, 6, 7]`\n6. `[6, 6, 7]`\n7. `[1, 5, 4]`\n8. `[5, 1, 4]`\n9. `[9, 4, 3]`\n\n## 5.

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain three main object types: (1) small multi-colored rectangular patterns of varying dimensions containing colors 1-7 and 9; (2) large 30x30 composite grids with complex tiled patterns exhibiting apparent bilateral symmetry; and (3) solid rectangular regions of color 8 embedded within the large grids at varying positions and sizes. Key attributes include grid dimensions, color composition (multi-colored vs. single-color blocks), spatial position, and symmetrical structure.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Identify the rectangular region of 8s in the input grid (location and dimensions)\n2. The grid has 180-degree rotational symmetry around its center point (14.5, 14.5)\n3. For each cell (r, c) containing 8, find its symmetric counterpart at (29-r, 29-c)\n4. Extract values from the symmetric positions to reconstruct the masked region\n5. Output is the reconstructed values that would replace the 8s to restore perfect point symmetry\n6. Output dimensions equal the 8s region dimensions (height \u00d7 width)\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "The inputs all have a single rectangular block of `8`s; this marks the area to be reconstructed.  \nIn the solved cases the value to put back into each masked cell is taken from the cell obtained by a 180\u00b0 turn of the grid about the point half a cell in from the top\u2011left corner. In 0\u2011based coordinates this sends \\((r,c)\\) to \\((31-r \\bmod 30,\\;31-c \\bmod 30)\\). The output is just the values from those symmetric positions laid out with the same height and width as the `8` block.\n\nFor the test grid the `8` block is rows\u202f14\u201322 and columns\u202f0\u20132. Applying the same mapping gives:\n\n```\n8,8,9\n8,8,9\n8,8,9\n8,8,9\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n6,6,1\n6,6,6\n6,1,1\n```",

                "response": "# Object Analysis\n\n## Types of Objects Observed\n\n### 1. Small Rectangular Grid Patterns\nThese are compact multi-colored grid patterns with varying dimensions (approximately 3-9 cells in height and 4-7 cells in width). They contain diverse arrangements of colors including color 1, color 2, color 3, color 4, color 5, color 6, color 7, and color 9. These patterns appear to be dense with no uniform background color.\n\n### 2. Large Composite Grid Patterns\nThese are substantially larger grids (30x30 cells) containing complex multi-colored patterns. They feature:\n- Multiple colors distributed throughout (colors 1-7 and color 9)\n- An apparent tiled or repeating internal structure\n- Evidence of reflective symmetry (both horizontal and vertical) around the center\n\n### 3. Solid Rectangular Regions of Color 8\nWithin the large grids, there are distinct rectangular regions filled uniformly with color 8. These regions:\n- Are axis-aligned rectangles\n- Vary in size and position across different grids\n- Appear to overlay or mask portions of the underlying pattern\n- Stand out as uniform blocks against the otherwise varied patterns\n\n## Object Attributes\n\n- **Dimensions**: Ranging from small (3x7, 4x4, 4x5, 9x4) to large (30x30)\n- **Color composition**: Either multi-colored (diverse mix) or mono-colored (color 8 blocks)\n- **Position**: Solid color 8 regions appear at different locations within large grids\n- **Symmetry**: Large grids exhibit apparent reflective/point symmetry interrupted by color 8 regions\n- **Colors present**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (color 0 not observed)\n\n<objects_summary>\nThe grids contain three main object types: (1) small multi-colored rectangular patterns of varying dimensions containing colors 1-7 and 9; (2) large 30x30 composite grids with complex tiled patterns exhibiting apparent bilateral symmetry; and (3) solid rectangular regions of color 8 embedded within the large grids at varying positions and sizes. Key attributes include grid dimensions, color composition (multi-colored vs. single-color blocks), spatial position, and symmetrical structure.\n</objects_summary>",

Objects Description\nThe grids contain three main object types: (1) small multi-colored rectangular patterns of varying dimensions containing colors 1-7 and 9; (2) large 30x30 composite grids with complex tiled patterns exhibiting apparent bilateral symmetry; and (3) solid rectangular regions of color 8 embedded within the large grids at varying positions and sizes. Key attributes include grid dimensions, color composition (multi-colored vs. single-color blocks), spatial position, and symmetrical structure.",
                "response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify the transformations from input to output.\n\n## Analysis\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n1. **8s Mark Missing Regions**: Each input grid contains a rectangular region filled with color 8, which acts as a mask over missing/hidden values.\n\n2. **Output Dimensions Match 8s Region**: The output grid dimensions exactly match the dimensions of the 8s region:\n   - Example 1: 8s at rows 14-22, cols 25-28 (9\u00d74) \u2192 output is 9\u00d74\n   - Example 2: 8s at rows 2-5, cols 21-25 (4\u00d75) \u2192 output is 4\u00d75\n   - Example 3: 8s at rows 19-21, cols 12-18 (3\u00d77) \u2192 output is 3\u00d77\n   - Example 4: 8s at rows 7-10, cols 26-29 (4\u00d74) \u2192 output is 4\u00d74\n\n3. **Grid Symmetry**: The 30\u00d730 grids exhibit approximate 180-degree rotational (point) symmetry around the center (14.5, 14.5).\n\n4. **Reconstruction from Symmetric Position**: The output values are derived from the 180-degree rotationally symmetric position of the 8s region. For position (r, c), the symmetric position is (29-r, 29-c).\n\n5. **Value Extraction**: To fill the masked region, values are extracted from the symmetric counterpart region where no 8s exist, restoring the grid's point symmetry.\n\n## Transformation Rules\n\n1. **Locate the 8s region** - Find the rectangular block of 8s (rows r1-r2, cols c1-c2)\n2. **Calculate symmetric region** - The symmetric region is at rows (29-r2) to (29-r1), cols (29-c2) to (29-c1)\n3. **Extract values** - For each position (r, c) in the 8s region, extract the value from position (29-r, 29-c)\n4. **Output** - The extracted values form the output grid, representing what should replace the 8s to complete the symmetric pattern\n\n<transformation_summary>\n1. Identify the rectangular region of 8s in the input grid (location and dimensions)\n2. The grid has 180-degree rotational symmetry around its center point (14.5, 14.5)\n3. For each cell (r, c) containing 8, find its symmetric counterpart at (29-r, 29-c)\n4. Extract values from the symmetric positions to reconstruct the masked region\n5. Output is the reconstructed values that would replace the 8s to restore perfect point symmetry\n6. Output dimensions equal the 8s region dimensions (height \u00d7 width)\n</transformation_summary>",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain three main object types: (1) small multi-colored rectangular patterns of varying dimensions containing colors 1-7 and 9; (2) large 30x30 composite grids with complex tiled patterns exhibiting apparent bilateral symmetry; and (3) solid rectangular regions of color 8 embedded within the large grids at varying positions and sizes. Key attributes include grid dimensions, color composition (multi-colored vs. single-color blocks), spatial position, and symmetrical structure.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Identify the rectangular region of 8s in the input grid (location and dimensions)\n2. The grid has 180-degree rotational symmetry around its center point (14.5, 14.5)\n3. For each cell (r, c) containing 8, find its symmetric counterpart at (29-r, 29-c)\n4. Extract values from the symmetric positions to reconstruct the masked region\n5. Output is the reconstructed values that would replace the 8s to restore perfect point symmetry\n6. Output dimensions equal the 8s region dimensions (height \u00d7 width)\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
