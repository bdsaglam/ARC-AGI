        "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment & Overall Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this ARC problem, and it's basically a pathfinding task. The goal is to get this little \"3\" (our agent, let's call it) from a starting point to somewhere else on the grid, avoiding these \"walls\" made of 1s and 2s. The walls are special because they morph into solid \"2s\" in the output, and that transformation is key to understanding the rules. The background is always \"8\", and it's helpful to remember that.\n\nMy general approach is to first try and understand what's special about this path the agent needs to draw. Are there any special rules for how it draws the path? It looks like the agent is on a \"Manhattan\" path, following horizontal and vertical lines with 90-degree turns only.\n\n**Deconstructing the Pathfinding Logic**\n\nMy initial hypothesis is that the agent moves in a preferred direction and when it hits a wall, it will be forced to make a turn. The problem is, how do I determine the preferred direction and the logic behind how and where the agent turns?\n\nBased on the examples, I can infer that the agent will always make a 90-degree turn when blocked by a wall and the direction of the turn is going to depend on how the wall is situated in relation to the start point.\n\nI start by looking for patterns in the examples to find the rules.\n\nIn all examples, it always begins with one 3, and I look for it.\n\nThe primary direction depends on where the start point is: if it's on the edge of the grid, it'll move inwards perpendicular to the wall.\n\nFor the turn logic, I will first examine the distance from the starting point to each wall.\n\nNext, I need to figure out where the \"target\" is. From the examples, the logic seemed to be:\n\nWhen moving in your preferred direction you need to avoid hitting walls. The method is to turn to the adjacent side. In order to determine the offset I will always calculate: `wall +/- 2`. For walls where I need to move to the other side I will use Start - 2, and in cases where the agent needs to move to an adjacent area, I will use End + 2.\n\n**Test Input Analysis**\n\nWith those rules in mind, I look at the test input.\n\nI first find the start, which is a \"3\" at position (6, 25).\n\nSince the 3 is on the right-hand edge, the agent will move left.\n\nThen I find the walls: 3 vertical walls made of the 1s and 2s.\n\nThen I follow the process:\n1.  From the start at `(6, 25)` it moves left and hits Wall 3, so a turn is needed. The position of `(6, 19)` will be `Wall+2`.\n2.  Then it turns again at `(11, 19)`, which is again a `Wall +2`.\n3.  Next is at Wall 2. The next turn is (3). Again, a `Wall -2`, which means it moves to the other direction.\n4. Then hits wall 1. It turns again: `End + 2`\n5. At the very end the agent is at (7, 0) and the work is complete.\n\nI generate the solution by setting the walls to 2, and the path to 3.\n\nI generate the output in CSV format, just as the examples are given.\n\n\nThe task requires transforming the input grid by simulating a pathfinding agent and consolidating obstacles. Based on the provided examples, here is the inferred logic:\n\n1.  **Identify Elements**:\n    *   **Agent**: The single cell with **color 3** (green) represents the starting point of a path.\n    *   **Walls**: Lines composed of alternating **colors 1 and 2** (blue and red) act as obstacles. In the output, these walls are solidified into a single **color 2** (red).\n    *   **Background**: The background is **color 8** (teal).\n\n2.  **Determine Pathfinding Rules**:\n    *   **Direction**: The path starts at the agent and moves in a primary direction perpendicular to the grid edge where the agent is located. For the test input, the agent is on the right edge, so the primary direction is **Left**.\n    *   **Movement**: The path consists of straight lines of color 3.\n    *   **Obstacle Avoidance**: When the path approaches a wall that blocks its current row/column:\n        *   **Turn Point**: The path turns 90 degrees **2 units** before reaching the wall's coordinate (e.g., if the wall is at column 17 and the agent is moving left, the turn happens at column 19).\n        *   **Bypass Target**: The path moves along the wall to a new row/column that allows it to pass. The target coordinate is **2 units** beyond the end of the wall's span (e.g., if the wall covers rows 0-9, the path moves to row 11). If the wall starts at a higher index (e.g., 5-13), the path moves to 2 units before the start (row 3).\n        *   After reaching the bypass coordinate, the path resumes its primary direction.\n\n3.  **Apply to Test Input**:\n    *   **Preprocessing**: Convert all 1s in the vertical walls to 2s.\n        *   Wall 1: Column 1, Rows 0-5.\n        *   Wall 2: Column 7, Rows 5-13.\n        *   Wall 3: Column 17, Rows 0-9.\n    *   **Path Tracing**:\n        *   **Start**: `(Row 6, Col 25)`. Move Left.\n        *   **Encounter Wall 3** (at Col 17, Rows 0-9):\n            *   Turn at **Col 19** (`17 + 2`).\n            *   Wall ends at Row 9. Target **Row 11** (`9 + 2`).\n            *   Segment: `(6, 25)` to `(6, 19)` to `(11, 19)`.\n        *   **Resume Left** at Row 11:\n        *   **Encounter Wall 2** (at Col 7, Rows 5-13):\n            *   Turn at **Col 9** (`7 + 2`).\n            *   Wall starts at Row 5.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Deep Dive into the ARC Task: Navigating Walls with a Green Pixel**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to solve these ARC puzzles. The key appears to be this lone green pixel and how it interacts with the blue and red lines, which seem to act as walls or barriers. I've broken down my thought process like this:\n\n**Initial Observations:**\n\n*   **Background:** The teal color 8 is always there.\n*   **Objects:** We have blue and red lines which act as walls. The green is our starting point and the pixel we want to find the path for.\n\n**Let's start from the given examples:**\n\n**Example 1:**\nI saw the green pixel was drawn from its initial position downwards, hitting a wall, and then changing direction. It seemed like the path was trying to avoid this blue/red wall. The wall itself, the line segment, goes through a transformation, going from alternating blue/red (input) to solid red (output).\n\n**Example 2:**\nHere it appeared the path tried to stay on the same horizontal line, but was forced to detour around walls. The direction was right. So, the green started on the left and tries to get to the right edge. When blocked, the path just goes around the wall.\n\n*   The green path connects the green to the right edge, going around the vertical blue/red walls.\n\n**The Logic behind the path:**\n\n**1. Determine Primary Direction (Horizontal or Vertical):** Based on the starting position of the green pixel, is it on the top edge (go bottom), or the left edge (go right)?\n\n**2.  Follow the Primary Direction:** The green pixel will keep moving in that direction.\n\n**3. Wall Encounters (Avoidance):** If a wall blocks the straight path:\n*   Stop \"x\" pixels before the wall. (Distance seems to be 2) (padding).\n*   Change direction (horizontal to vertical and back to original) to bypass the wall.\n*   Return back to the original direction and keep going.\n\n**The 1 and 2 colors:**\n\n*   It seems the 1s and 2s make the walls. The \"1\"s appear to mark corners or start/end points of a wall segment.\n*   The path logic works based on the positions of the walls and the green pixel's starting location.\n\n**Test Case Analysis:**\n\n*   I've read the test case input. Let's see if our logic holds.\n*   The green pixel is at (6, 25) which is the right side of the grid. Direction should be left.\n*   There's a bunch of vertical lines (walls) in the grid, but no horizontal walls.\n\n**Path for the Test Case:**\n\nLet's use our steps to find the path, and a margin of 2 pixels (we see this from the examples).\n*   **Start:** (6, 25).\n*   **Left to Col 19.** (Margin 2 from the start of Wall 3).\n*   **Down to Row 11.** (Margin of 2 from Wall 3).\n*   **Left to Col 9.**\n*   **Up to Row 2.**\n*   **Left to Col 3.**\n*   **Down to Row 7.**\n*   **Left to the edge.**\n\nOkay, all should hold, based on my previous examples.\n\n**Code/Process**\n\n1.  Input the grid.\n2.  Change all `1`'s to `2`s in the grid.\n3.  Based on the start of the green pixel, follow the path rules and draw the path.\n\nThis will output the final result. I'm pretty confident now. Let's go!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to infer a transformation rule from the solved examples and apply it to the test input.\n\n**Logic Inferred from Examples:**\n\n1.  **Obstacle Identification**:\n    *   The input grid contains \"walls\" made of alternating colors `1` (blue) and `2` (red).\n    *   In the output, these walls become a solid color `2` (red). This means every `1` in the wall pattern is changed to a `2`.\n\n2.  **Path Generation**:\n    *   There is a single `3` (green) pixel in the input, acting as the starting point.\n    *   The output generates a continuous path of `3`s starting from this point.\n    *   The path moves in a primary direction determined by the start position:\n        *   If the start is on a vertical edge (Top/Bottom), the goal is the opposite vertical edge.\n        *   If the start is on a horizontal edge (Left/Right), the goal is the opposite horizontal edge.\n    *   In the Test Input, the `3` is at `(Row 6, Col 25)` (Right edge), so the path proceeds **Left** towards Column 0.\n\n3.  **Pathfinding Algorithm (Obstacle Avoidance)**:\n    *   The path moves in the primary direction (Left) until it encounters an obstacle (a wall in its row).\n    *   Upon detecting an obstacle ahead, the path turns perpendicular to the primary direction (Up or Down) to bypass the wall.\n    *   **Turning Point**: The path turns roughly **2 pixels** before the obstacle (leaving a 1-pixel gap).\n    *   **Bypass Target**: The path travels vertically to a row that is **2 pixels** beyond the vertical extent of the wall (leaving a 1-pixel gap), ensuring it can cross the obstacle's column safely.\n    *   Once the safe row is reached, the path resumes its primary direction (Left), crossing the obstacle's column.\n    *   This \"Zig-Zag\" pattern repeats for each obstacle until the goal edge is reached.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Grid Size**: 14 rows (0-13) x 26 columns (0-25).\n*   **Start**: `(6, 25)` (Right edge). Direction: **Left**.\n*   **Obstacles (Walls)** identified from input:\n    1.  **Wall 3**: Column 17. Spans **Rows 0 to 9**.\n    2.  **Wall 2**: Column 7. Spans **Rows 4 to 13**.\n    3.  **Wall 1**: Column 1. Spans **Rows 0 to 5**.\n\n**Step-by-Step Path Construction:**\n\n1.  **Start at (6, 25)**.

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Replace all 1s with 2s** in the line patterns (sequences of 1s and 2s)\n2. **Draw 3-paths** that form L-shapes or rectangles around the space between the marker (3) and the patterns\n\nThe 3 acts as a starting point, and paths of 3s extend perpendicular to the patterns, turning at corners that are offset from the pattern positions. The offset is related to the distance from the 3's position to the 1s in the patterns.\n\nFor the test input:\n- 3 is at position (6, 25)\n- Pattern 1: column 1, rows 0-5 (1 at row 0, then 2s)\n- Pattern 2: column 7, rows 5-13 (2s with 1s at rows 11, 13)  \n- Pattern 3: column 17, rows 0-9 (alternating 1s and 2s, then 2s)\n\nThe transformation:\n1. Replace all 1s with 2s in all three vertical patterns\n2. Draw 3-paths that wrap around the area between the 3 and the patterns, with vertical lines at offset positions from each pattern and horizontal connectors\n\n```\n8,2,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**High\u2011level pattern**\n\nLooking at the four training pairs, two consistent things show up:\n\n1. **All color 1 cells become color 2** in every example.\n2. The color 3 is used to draw \u201coffset\u201d lines that are parallel to the existing 1/2 bars:\n   - For **horizontal** 1/2 bars (examples 1 & 3), horizontal 3\u2011lines are drawn a number of rows *above* the bar equal to `(# of 1\u2019s in that bar) + 1`.\n   - For **vertical** 1/2 bars (examples 2 & 4), vertical 3\u2011lines are drawn a number of columns *towards the 3\u2011anchor* equal to `(# of 1\u2019s in that bar) + 1`.\n\nThen, in the vertical cases, the vertical 3\u2011lines are connected together in a very regular way:\n- Their vertical span is from the row of the original 3 (the \u201canchor row\u201d) down to a fixed connection row (row 9 in both vertical examples).\n- On the anchor row, you draw horizontal 3 segments:\n  - from the anchor to the nearest 3\u2011line,\n  - and from the farthest 3\u2011line to the border on the opposite side.\n- On the connection row, you draw a horizontal 3 segment from the leftmost 3\u2011line to the rightmost 3\u2011line, but you do **not** overwrite any non\u20118 cells (so you skip over 2\u2019s if necessary).\n\nThis reproduces examples 2 and 4 exactly, and the row\u2011offset rule for horizontals reproduces the detailed 3\u2011line positions in examples 1 and 3.\n\nFor the **test** input we are clearly in the *vertical* case:\n- The 1/2 structures are vertical bars in columns 2, 8, and 18.\n- There is a single 3 at row 7, column 26 (the \u201canchor\u201d), to the **right** of all bars.\n\nSo I apply the **vertical case algorithm**, mirrored for an anchor on the right.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Recolor 1 \u2192 2\n\nCopy the grid and change every 1 to 2.\n\nThe original 1\u2019s are at:\n- (1,2), (1,18),\n- (3,18),\n- (5,18),\n- (12,8),\n- (14,8).\n\nAfter recoloring, all of these are 2. So the columns with 2\u2011bars are:\n\n- **Column 2**: rows 1\u20136 are 2, then 8\u2019s.\n  - 1\u2019s in this bar originally: just row 1 \u2192 `#1 = 1`.\n- **Column 8**: rows 6\u201314 are 2 (continuous).\n  - Original 1\u2019s in this bar: rows 12 and 14 \u2192 `#1 = 2`.\n- **Column 18**: rows 1\u201310 are 2 (continuous).\n  - Original 1\u2019s in this bar: rows 1, 3, 5 \u2192 `#1 = 3`.\n\nEverything else is 8, except the existing 3 at (7,26).\n\n---\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Compute the offset 3\u2011columns for each bar\n\nAnchor column is `cA = 26`, which is **right** of all bar columns 2, 8, 18.\n\nFor vertical case, the rule is:\n\n> For each vertical bar at column `cBar` with `k` occurrences of color 1, create a new 3\u2011column at  \n> `c3 = cBar + (k + 1)` if the anchor is to the **right**,  \n> `c3 = cBar \u2212 (k + 1)` if the anchor is to the **left**.\n\nHere the anchor is to the right, so we offset **rightwards**:\n\n- Bar at c=2, `#1 = 1` \u2192 3\u2011column at `2 + (1+1) = 4`.\n- Bar at c=8, `#1 = 2` \u2192 3\u2011column at `8 + (2+1) = 11`.\n- Bar at c=18, `#1 = 3` \u2192 3\u2011column at `18 + (3+1) = 22`.\n\nSo our vertical 3\u2011lines will be at columns **4, 11, 22**.\n\nLet\n- `L = min{4,11,22} = 4`,  \n- `R = max{4,11,22} = 22`.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Decide the vertical span of these 3\u2011columns\n\nFrom the training vertical examples, the 3\u2011columns always run from:\n- the **anchor row** `rA` (original 3\u2019s row)\n- down to a single **connection row** (row 9 in both examples), and do not extend further.\n\nIn the test:\n- Anchor row `rA = 7` (3 is at (7,26)).\n- Keep the same connection row: `rB = 9`.\n\nThus each 3\u2011column will have 3\u2019s from rows **7\u20139** in its column.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Draw the 3\u2011columns (vertical segments)\n\nOn the recolored grid, at each of the columns 4, 11, 22, set cells in rows 7, 8, 9 to 3, **only where the cell is currently 8** (never overwrite a 2).\n\nCheck these cells:\n\n- Column 4, rows 7\u20139: all 8 \u2192 become 3.\n- Column 11, rows 7\u20139: all 8 \u2192 become 3.\n- Column 22, rows 7\u20139: all 8 \u2192 become 3.\n\nSo we now have vertical 3 segments at:\n- (7\u20139,4),\n- (7\u20139,11),\n- (7\u20139,22),\nplus the original 3 at (7,26).\n\n---\n\n## Step 5 \u2013 Top horizontal connections on the anchor row\n\nIn the training when the anchor was on the **left** of the bars, the top row (anchor row) had 3\u2019s:\n\n- from the anchor to the nearest 3\u2011column (leftmost),\n- and from the farthest 3\u2011column to the opposite border.\n\nFor an anchor on the **right**, we mirror this:\n\n> On the anchor row `rA`:\n> - fill 3\u2019s from column 1 to `L` (connect left border to leftmost 3\u2011column),\n> - fill 3\u2019s from `R` to `cA` (connect rightmost 3\u2011column to the anchor),\n> not overwriting any non\u20118 cells (here all those are 8 or existing 3).\n\nRow 7 before this step (after recolor and verticals) was:\n\n`8,8,8,3,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,3`\n\nNow:\n\n- Columns 1\u20134:\n  - c1: 8 \u2192 3\n  - c2: 8 \u2192 3\n  - c3: 8 \u2192 3\n  - c4: already 3\n- Columns 22\u201326:\n  - c22: already 3\n  - c23: 8 \u2192 3\n  - c24: 8 \u2192 3\n  - c25: 8 \u2192 3\n  - c26: already 3 (the original anchor)\n\nRow 7 becomes:\n\n`3,3,3,3,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3`\n\n---\n\n## Step 6 \u2013 Bottom horizontal connection row\n\nOn the connection row `rB = 9`, training examples connect between the extreme 3\u2011columns:\n\n> On row `rB`, fill 3\u2019s from `L` to `R` inclusive, but **only on background 8\u2019s**, leaving 2\u2019s intact.\n\nRow 9 before this step (after recolor and verticals):\n\n`8,8,8,3,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8`\n\nNow on columns 4\u201322:\n\n- c4: 3 \u2192 stays 3\n- c5: 8 \u2192 3\n- c6: 8 \u2192 3\n- c7: 8 \u2192 3\n- c8: 2 \u2192 stays 2\n- c9: 8 \u2192 3\n- c10: 8 \u2192 3\n- c11: 3 \u2192 stays 3\n- c12: 8 \u2192 3\n- c13: 8 \u2192 3\n- c14: 8 \u2192 3\n- c15: 8 \u2192 3\n- c16: 8 \u2192 3\n- c17: 8 \u2192 3\n- c18: 2 \u2192 stays 2\n- c19: 8 \u2192 3\n- c20: 8 \u2192 3\n- c21: 8 \u2192 3\n- c22: 3 \u2192 stays 3\n\nSo row 9 becomes:\n\n`8,8,8,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8`\n\nAll 2\u2011cells remain 2;

        "Full raw LLM response": "To tackle this puzzle I first looked for the simplest invariant that held across all the examples: every instance of the colour\u202f1 in the input becomes colour\u202f2 in the output, and existing 2s remain. That is the one rule that is consistently applied.\n\nThe appearance of colour\u202f3 is more complex. Analysing examples 2\u20134 suggested a construction based on the relative positions of the connected components: if you take the centres of the non\u2011background components (the blocks of non\u20118 cells, including the single 3 marker), sort them by row and take the mid\u2011rows between consecutive centres, you get the rows where horizontal 3\u2011lines are drawn; similarly, sorting by column and taking mid\u2011columns between successive centres gives columns where vertical 3\u2011lines are drawn. Those lines are then drawn on previously empty (8) cells to form a rectilinear grid, leaving any existing non\u20118 cells untouched.\n\nFor the test case the non\u20118 components are the vertical lines at columns\u202f2,\u202f8 and\u202f18 and the marker at column\u202f26. Their row centres give mid\u2011rows at approximately 4.5,\u202f6.25,\u202f7.5 and\u202f10.5, which I rounded down for the first three and up for the last, yielding rows\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f7 and\u202f11. Their column centres give mid\u2011columns at 5,\u202f13 and\u202f22. Drawing vertical 3\u2011lines at those columns between rows\u202f4 and\u202f11, and horizontal 3\u2011lines on rows\u202f4,\u202f6,\u202f7 and\u202f11 between columns\u202f5 and\u202f22, while leaving existing 2s and the marker intact, produces the following output:\n\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,3\n8,8,8,8,3,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,3,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,3,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "The given tasks all work the same way. Every input has a single anchor cell of color\u202f3 and one or more straight \u201csticks\u201d of colors\u202f1/2. First all 1s are turned into 2s. Then a single polyline of 3s is drawn that starts at the anchor and snakes across a set of offset lines derived from the sticks.\n\nFor a stick you count how many 1s it contains. The line you draw runs on the anchor side of the stick, offset by `#ones+1`. For horizontal sticks you place horizontal segments at `row = stick_row - (#1s+1)` if the anchor is above, for vertical sticks you place vertical segments at `col = stick_col \u00b1 (#1s+1)` depending on whether the anchor is left or right. To connect multiple sticks you also choose a pair of bounding lines perpendicular to the sticks using the first stick in the direction of travel (top/bottom rows for vertical sticks, left/right columns for horizontal sticks), offset similarly, and then trace a continuous path that alternates between those boundaries and the offset lines, with `2\u00b7k+1` segments for k sticks. The path moves toward the sticks from the anchor side, turns at each offset line, alternates perpendicular movement between the two boundaries, and finally runs to the grid edge.\n\nIn the test grid the non\u20118/3 cells form three vertical sticks at columns\u202f2,\u202f8 and\u202f18. The anchor 3 is at (row\u202f7,col\u202f26), so we work to the left. Ones counts are 1,\u202f2 and\u202f3 respectively, so the offset columns on the anchor side are 4,\u202f11 and\u202f22. Using the rightmost stick as reference gives a top boundary at row\u202f7 (the anchor row) and a bottom boundary at row\u202f14. Starting at the anchor the polyline runs left to col\u202f22, down to row\u202f14, left to col\u202f11, up to row\u202f7, left to col\u202f4, down to row\u202f14 and left to the edge. All 1s have been turned to 2s elsewhere.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3\n8,8,8,3,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8",
