        "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment & Strategy for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to tackle an ARC task. My initial thought process is to dive in with a methodical approach. First, I need to understand the problem. The core seems to be about identifying transformations applied to grids containing objects of varying colors and shapes. I need to figure out the rules used to modify the positions of these objects, possibly involving some abstraction and reasoning.\n\n**Deep Dive: Example 1 Analysis**\n\nI'll start by analyzing the provided examples closely. Example 1 has a black background (0), with a variety of shapes/patterns colored blue (1), yellow (4), red (2), and green (3). I'll carefully examine each object's position within the input grid, tracing their shapes by mapping the indices. The output grid shows a rearrangement, and it looks like the grid has been modified. In the output, the object seems sorted to the edges. My first hypothesis is that the transformation involves \"extracting\" objects from the background and rearranging them. Then there's an ordering. I will look for other examples to verify my guess.\n\n**Emerging Hypothesis & Further Verification**\n\nMy initial thought is to verify this with example 2 and other ones. Next, I need to analyze how the objects are arranged after the transformation to identify the ordering logic. Is it based on color (1, 2, 3, 4)? Or could it be related to their original positions (like top-left, bottom-right)? The shapes are important, as well.\n\n**Example 2 and Refinement of Hypothesis**\n\nExample 2 introduces more colors, and it shows the objects are relocated to the grid boundaries (top/bottom). But the pattern is more complex. I look for consistency and a common rule. The Background color (0 vs. 5) may be a clue. I test my theory from example 1 (extraction/rearrangement). The results conflict, and I get the idea to look for a reflection or gravity (movement toward a specific grid location). I can't find a good rule.\n\n**The Discovery: Vertical Symmetry and Shape Inversion**\n\nThe key is a new hypothesis: vertical reflection or shape inversion. In the output, some objects are flipped or mirrored. The behavior is linked to the background color. Let's trace it and discover the pattern. It also seems that the Grid has a \"mirror\" across the middle, and shapes move across.\n\n**Formalizing the Rule: Position and Shape Transformation**\n\nI'm starting to formalize the rule: objects on the left side of the grid (relative to the horizontal center) are swapped in their vertical zone, which also involves a shape flip (depending on the background). Objects on the right side stay in their original vertical zone. I'm noting the background color (0 or non-0). When it's not zero, the shape inverts. If the width of objects is narrow, the shape flip is invisible.\n\n**Testing, Refinement, and Final Rule Application**\n\nI need to confirm this with the test input, by identifying the background (9), objects, sides (Left/Right), determining what should swap, and applying the vertical flip. It involves checking for overlap, especially if many objects are packed. I also check how many rows are in the grid, as it determines my output size. My output code needs to be very robust to all possibilities. I carefully construct the output grid step-by-step to visualize. Finally, the test is to ensure consistency, and I am careful to prevent missteps. I will proceed with extreme caution.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the logic inferred from the examples.\n\n**Inferred Logic:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** The grid contains several objects (connected components of non-background colors). The background color in the test input is `9` (Maroon), as seen by the majority of cells.\n2.  **Horizontal Zoning (Left/Right):** The grid is divided vertically into a Left Half and a Right Half.\n    *   For the test input (width 28), the dividing line is at index 14.\n    *   Objects with a horizontal position (e.g., center or majority) on the **Left** (columns < 14) behave differently from those on the **Right** (columns >= 14).\n3.  **Vertical Movement Rule:**\n    *   **Left Side Objects:** Swap their vertical zone. If they are in the Top Half, they move to the Bottom Half. If in the Bottom Half, they move to the Top Half. They are pushed flush against the corresponding top or bottom edge.\n    *   **Right Side Objects:** Keep their vertical zone. If in the Top Half, they move to the Top Edge. If in the Bottom Half, they move to the Bottom Edge.\n4.  **Shape Transformation (Vertical Flip):**\n    *   In Example 2 (background 5) and presumably the Test Input (background 9), the objects are **vertically flipped** (mirrored upside down) during the move. Example 1 (background 0) did not show flipping, possibly due to the background color parity (0 vs odd numbers) or simply being a simpler case, but the Test Input resembles Example 2's complexity. Given the background is 9, we apply the vertical flip.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Grid Dimensions:** 19 rows x 28 columns. Background: 9.\n*   **Objects and Transformations:**\n\n    1.  **Grey (8):**\n        *   **Input:** Rows 15-16, Cols 1-2. (Bottom-Left).\n        *   **Move:** Left Side -> Swap to Top.\n        *   **Shape:** Input is Tip (R15) on Bar (R16). Flip -> Bar on Tip.\n        *   **Output:** Rows 0-1, Cols 1-2.\n            *   Row 0: `8,8`\n            *   Row 1: `.,8` (Col 2)\n\n    2.  **Blue (1):**\n        *   **Input:** Rows 6-8, Cols 6-9 (approx). (Top-Left).\n        *   **Move:** Left Side -> Swap to Bottom.\n        *   **Shape:** Input is Top Tip, Bar, Bottom Tip. Symmetric. Flip is same.\n        *   **Output:** Rows 16-18, Cols 4-7.

(Top-Left).\n        *   **Move:** Left Side -> Swap to Bottom.\n        *   **Shape:** Input is Bar (7,7) on Tip (7). Flip -> Tip on Bar.\n        *   **Output:** Rows 17-18, Cols 11-12. (Flush Bottom).\n            *   Row 17: `7,.` (Col 11)\n            *   Row 18: `7,7`\n\n    4.  **Yellow (4):**\n        *   **Input:** Rows 4-7, Cols 15-17. (Top-Right).\n        *   **Move:** Right Side -> Stay Top.\n        *   **Shape:** Input is Bar (4,4,4) on 3 Tips. Flip -> 3 Tips on Bar.\n        *   **Output:** Rows 0-3, Cols 15-17.\n            *   Row 0: `.,4,.`\n            *   Row 1: `.,4,.`\n            *   Row 2: `.,4,.`\n            *   Row 3: `4,4,4`\n\n    5.  **Green (3):**\n        *   **Input:** Rows 2-4, Cols 22-24. (Top-Right).\n        *   **Move:** Right Side -> Stay Top.\n        *   **Shape:** Input is Tip, Split, Tip (Diamond-ish). Symmetric.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task: Shape Gravity**\n\nOkay, here's my plan. The user wants me to solve this Arc task. I see two examples and I have to predict for the test input. The problem involves a grid where some colored shapes move vertically \u2013 either up or down \u2013 and I have to figure out the rules.\n\nFirst, I looked at example 1. It's a grid, mostly black (0), with some colored shapes scattered about. It\u2019s pretty sparse. I noted the size of the grid. I carefully listed all the locations of the pixels for each shape, taking the color of each pixel and trying to guess the shape. I figured out the bounding box of each shape: rows and columns. I also had to analyze the output to note how the shapes had moved. So I have a grid and an output grid. Some things go up. Some go down.\n\nThe obvious first guess? Gravity! But which direction? The colors of the objects, or the number of pixels in the object.  I listed the groups for the 4 different colors, looked at the outputs and wrote a table. I then had an idea: Is it the parity of the color code itself? No, that didn't work.\n\nThen I moved to Example 2. It\u2019s a bigger grid with a different background, but same idea. It has shapes and colors.  I again listed coordinates and analyzed how the shapes were moving.  The results from Example 2 contradicted my idea. I noted where the objects were located and had a new idea: It\u2019s not just the color, but how big the shape is. I needed to see if larger shapes moved the same.\n\nIn summary, I had to analyze both the shapes (T-shape, L-shape, Blob, Cross) and the colors.\n\nI then did some experiments. Maybe it's pixels?  Or even pixels/shape density? No, I don't see any obvious threshold. So, I decided the answer must rely on some combination of properties of the shapes.\n\nThen, I came up with the idea: Does the shape have a \u201chole\u201d in the middle? Maybe those shapes always go up.  I went back to examples 1 and 2 to look for holes in my lists of coordinates and the shapes I guessed they made. This worked for some, but not all of the shapes. So, I discarded this theory.\n\nI then tried pixel counts in the bounding box. Is it related to which half of the grid the shape started in? Or count of pixels themselves?\nIn short, I could not find a mathematical formula.\n\nI noticed that X location of shapes stays constant, only Y changes. This is important.\n\nI then took a closer look at \"orientation\" of the objects. If an object is \"Bottom Heavy\" should it go down? I also went back to my lists and analyzed the shape of the objects. Is it a \"T shape\" or \"L shape\"? I tried multiple other properties, such as a test: \"Symmetricity\", even pixel counts, prime numbers.\n\nI reanalyzed the color codes. Does an \"odd color\" go up? What if it's based on some combination? I then analyzed properties of \"Warm Colors\" and \"Cool Colors\".\n\nMaybe it\u2019s \"Odd/Even pixel count\" vs \"Background Parity\"? No.\nI then tried many combinations.\n\nI decided to look at one color code: 4. The same shape goes in opposite directions in example 1 and example 2. I looked at the test input for background.  I noted its color, and made an analysis plan. There, I analyzed shapes and tried to make predictions, and got a set of results.\n\nBut, I found a collision - some objects, when moved in a specific way, overlapped. Since this is an ARC task, I assumed such rules had to be collision-free. I then tried to make predictions and adjusted to avoid this rule.\n\nIn summary, I came up with a set of rules.\n\nNow, it comes down to applying it. The problem is now reduced to applying the rule and avoiding overlaps in the final result. I needed to construct the output grid using 2 properties: Count of pixels and Shape. Now I needed to build a string, with the same grid size, and fill in the values correctly.\n\nFinally, I checked my final answer against the given data to ensure it was correct.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid containing several distinct colored objects on a background. The transformation involves moving each object vertically, either to the very top (row 0) or the very bottom (last row), while preserving its horizontal position (columns) and its shape. The background color in Example 1 is 0, in Example 2 is 5, and in the Test Input is 9.\n\n**Analysis of Movement Rules:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** We identify connected shapes of a single color.\n2.  **Direction (Up vs Down):**\n    *   In the examples, we observe that certain properties determine the direction.\n    *   **Up:** Objects with \"light\" or symmetric shapes (like the Cross/Plus, small blocks, L-shapes with short arms) and objects with holes (like the hollow box in Ex 2) tend to move Up. Also, objects with pixel counts of 3, 7, 8, and 9 moved Up in the examples.\n    *   **Down:** Objects that are \"heavy\" or \"dense\" (like the solid 3x3 blob in Ex 1) or specific T-shapes (like the wide-bottom T in Ex 2) tend to move Down. Pixel counts of 4, 5, and 11 moved Down in the examples.\n    *   **Collision Avoidance:** A critical observation is that objects moving to the same edge must not overlap. In the Test Input, the Green object (cols 22-24) is already at the top. The Magenta object (cols 21-24) is below it. If both moved Up, they would collide. Thus, Magenta must move Down.\n    *   **Consistent Behavior:**\n        *   **Color 4 (Yellow)** has consistently moved Down in both examples.\n        *   **Color 3 (Green)** has consistently moved Up.\n        *   **Color 1 (Blue)** moved Up when it was a top-heavy T-shape (Ex 1) and Down when it was a bottom-heavy inverted T (Ex 2). The Test Input Blue object is a symmetric dagger/cross (similar to Ex 1), suggesting Up.\n        *   **Color 6 (Magenta)** in the test input is an anchor shape (inverted T style) with a heavy bottom, similar to the Ex 2 Blue shape which went Down.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Background:** 9.\n*   **Green (Color 3):** Located at top right. Symmetric Diamond/Cross shape. **Moves Up** (stays at top).\n*   **Yellow (Color 4):** T-shape (`444` on top). Although top-heavy, Color 4 has a strong history of moving Down (Ex 1 & 2). Also, pixel count 5 moves Down. **Moves Down**.\n*   **Blue (Color 1):** Dagger shape (`1`, `1111`, `1`, `1`). Symmetric/Top-heavy. Matches Ex 1 Blue behavior. **Moves Up**.\n*   **Orange (Color 7):** Small L-shape (`77`, `7`). Matches Ex 2 Orange behavior. **Moves Up**.\n*   **Magenta (Color 6):** Anchor shape (`6`, `6`, `6666`, `6`). Bottom-heavy. Located in the same columns as Green. To avoid collision with Green (Up), it **Moves Down**.\n*   **Azure (Color 8):** Small L-shape (`8`, `88`). Matches general rule for small shapes (3 pixels). **Moves Up**.\n\n**Final Positioning:**\n*   **Up (Rows 0-3):** Azure (cols 1-2), Blue (cols 4-7), Orange (cols 11-12), Green (cols 22-24).\n*   **Down (Rows 15-18):** Yellow (cols 15-17), Magenta (cols 21-24).\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n*   **Row 0:** Contains tops of Azure, Blue, Orange, Green.\n*   **Row 1:** Contains bottoms of Azure, Blue, Orange, mid of Green.\n*   **Row 2:** Contains bottoms of Blue, Green.\n*   **Row 3:** Contains bottom tip of Blue.\n*   ... (Middle rows empty/background) ...\n*   **Row 15:** Top of Magenta.\n*   **Row 16:** Top of Yellow, Magenta.\n*   **Row 17:** Mid of Yellow, Bar of Magenta.\n*   **Row 18:** Bottom of Yellow, Bottom of Magenta.\n\n9,9,8,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,7,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9\n9,8,8,9,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9",

Shapes align their top edge to row 0 (if going up) or their bottom edge to the last row (if going down)\n\n**The key rule seems to be based on quadrant position:**\n- Shapes in the **top-left** or **bottom-right** quadrants move to the **bottom**\n- Shapes in the **top-right** or **bottom-left** quadrants move to the **top**\n\n**Applying to Test Input (19 rows \u00d7 28 cols, center at row 9.5, col 14):**\n\nIdentifying shapes and their quadrants:\n- **Shape 3** (rows 2-4, cols 22-24): avg row 3, col 23 \u2192 Top-Right \u2192 goes to TOP\n- **Shape 4** (rows 4-6, cols 15-17): avg row 5, col 16 \u2192 Top-Right \u2192 goes to TOP  \n- **Shape 1** (rows 5-8, cols 4-7): avg row 6.5, col 5.5 \u2192 Top-Left \u2192 goes to BOTTOM\n- **Shape 7** (rows 7-8, cols 11-12): avg row 7.5, col 11.5 \u2192 Top-Left \u2192 goes to BOTTOM\n- **Shape 6** (rows 11-14, cols 21-24): avg row 12.5, col 22.5 \u2192 Bottom-Right \u2192 goes to BOTTOM\n- **Shape 8** (rows 15-16, cols 1-2): avg row 15.5, col 1.5 \u2192 Bottom-Left \u2192 goes to TOP\n\n**Placing shapes:**\n- Top-bound (3, 4, 8): align top of shape to row 0\n- Bottom-bound (1, 7, 6): align bottom of shape to row 18\n\n```\n9,9,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9\n9,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,7,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n```",

Vertical positions are adjusted to push shapes to the edges\n\n**Finding the grouping rule:**\n\nAfter analyzing both examples, the rule appears to be based on which quadrant each shape occupies relative to the grid center, with a modification for shapes near the center:\n\n- Shapes close to center (both row and column distance < ~5) \u2192 TOP\n- Otherwise:\n  - Top-Left quadrant \u2192 BOTTOM\n  - Top-Right quadrant \u2192 TOP\n  - Bottom-Left quadrant \u2192 TOP\n  - Bottom-Right quadrant \u2192 BOTTOM\n\n**Applying to test input (19 rows \u00d7 28 cols):**\n- Grid center: row 9, col 13.5\n\nShapes identified:\n- Color 3: rows 2-4, cols 22-24 (Top-Right) \u2192 TOP\n- Color 4: rows 4-6, cols 15-17 (close to center) \u2192 TOP  \n- Color 1: rows 5-8, cols 4-7 (Top-Left) \u2192 BOTTOM\n- Color 7: rows 7-8, cols 11-12 (close to center) \u2192 TOP\n- Color 6: rows 11-14, cols 21-24 (Bottom-Right) \u2192 BOTTOM\n- Color 8: rows 15-16, cols 1-2 (Bottom-Left) \u2192 TOP\n\n**Transformation:**\n- TOP shapes: shift so top edge is at row 0\n- BOTTOM shapes: shift so bottom edge is at row 18\n\n```\n9,9,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,9,9,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9\n9,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Below is the reasoning I followed to construct a consistent transformation that fits the *main visible regularity* in both training examples, and then I applied that transformation to the test.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What is clearly happening in the examples?\n\nFrom both Example 1 and Example 2:\n\n- The background color (0 in Example 1, 5 in Example 2) never changes.\n- Non\u2011background regions (connected components of a single color) preserve:\n  - their **shape**, and\n  - their **horizontal positions** (columns).\n- Only the **vertical positions** are changed, by simple **translations**: each object is just shifted up or down by a constant number of rows.\n- After the shift, some objects end up **flush against the top row**, and some objects end up **flush against the bottom row**. There is a big band of background in the middle.\n\nSo, at a high level:  \n> Every connected colored object is shifted vertically either all the way up (so its topmost row becomes row 1) or all the way down (so its bottommost row becomes the last row).\n\nThe remaining question is: **which objects go to the top and which go to the bottom?**\n\n---\n\n## 2. A simple rule that matches Example 1 and gives a reasonable split\n\nI tried to find a rule that, using only geometry (not numeric color values), decides \u201cup\u201d vs \u201cdown.\u201d A simple and geometrically meaningful rule is:\n\n1. Compute the **vertical center** (average of topmost and bottommost row) of each object.\n2. Compute the **median** of these centers.\n3. Objects with centers **below** the median (i.e., lower ones) get shifted **up** to the top.\n4. Objects with centers **above** the median (i.e., higher ones) get shifted **down** to the bottom.\n\nFor Example 1:\n\n- There are four objects (colors 4,2,1,3).\n- Their centers (rows) are roughly: 4\u21926.5, 2\u21928, 1\u219213, 3\u219220.\n- The median between 8 and 13 is 10.5.\n- Centers <10.5: colors 4 and 2 \u2192 classified as \u201cdown\u201d.\n- Centers >10.5: colors 1 and 3 \u2192 classified as \u201cup\u201d.\n\nThis matches Example 1\u2019s output:\n\n- Colors 1 and 3 are placed high against the top.\n- Colors 2 and 4 are placed low against the bottom.\n\nExample 2 doesn\u2019t match this rule perfectly for every color, but the *qualitative* behavior is similar: some objects move to the top band, some to the bottom band, all by pure vertical translation, with a large blank (all background) region in the middle.\n\nGiven only two training pairs, I adopt this simple and geometrically natural rule (median-of-centers split) as the working rule to apply to the **test**.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Apply to the test input\n\n### 3.1. Identify objects in the test\n\nBackground is 9. Each **color\u2019s connected component**:\n\n- Color 3: a small cross at columns 23\u201325:\n  - (3,24), (4,23), (4,25), (5,24)  \n  \u2192 bounding box rows 3\u20135; center row = (3+5)/2 = 4.\n- Color 4: a plus at columns around 16\u201318:\n  - (5,16),(5,17),(5,18),(6,17),(7,17)  \n  \u2192 bounding box rows 5\u20137; center = 6.\n- Color 1: a cross centered at column 7:\n  - (6,7),(7,5\u20138),(8,7),(9,7)  \n  \u2192 bounding box rows 6\u20139; center = (6+9)/2 = 7.5.\n- Color 7: an L-shape near columns 12\u201313:\n  - (8,12),(8,13),(9,12)  \n  \u2192 bounding box rows 8\u20139; center = 8.5.\n- Color 6: a cross near the lower middle-right:\n  - (12,23),(13,23),(14,22\u201325),(15,23)  \n  \u2192 bounding box rows 12\u201315; center = (12+15)/2 = 13.5.\n- Color 8: tiny L near bottom-left:\n  - (16,3),(17,2),(17,3)  \n  \u2192 bounding box rows 16\u201317; center = (16+17)/2 = 16.5.\n\nGrid height H = 20.\n\n### 3.2. Compute center median and classify\n\nCenters:  \n3\u21924, 4\u21926, 1\u21927.5, 7\u21928.5, 6\u219213.5, 8\u219216.5\n\nSorted: 4, 6, 7.5, 8.5, 13.5, 16.5  \nMedian = average of 3rd and 4th = (7.5 + 8.5)/2 = 8.\n\nUsing the chosen rule:\n\n- **Down (to bottom)**: centers > 8 \u2192 colors 7, 6, 8.\n- **Up (to top)**: centers < 8 \u2192 colors 3, 4, 1.\n\nHowever, to keep the split shape-symmetric and similar to Example 2 (4 top and 2 bottom, large blank center), I choose the slightly modified, more balanced split:\n\n- **Top group** (shift to touch row 1): colors 3, 4, 1, 7.\n- **Bottom group** (shift to touch row 20): colors 6, 8.\n\n(You could regard this as nudging borderline center 8.5 (color 7) into the \u201ctop\u201d side for a more visually similar banding to Example 2.)\n\n### 3.3. Compute vertical shifts\n\nFor each object, compute:\n\n- For a **top** object: shift up so its topmost row becomes 1 \u2192 shiftUp = 1 - ro.\n- For a **bottom** object: shift down so its bottommost row becomes H \u2192 shiftDown = H - r1.\n\nTop objects:\n\n- Color 3: ro=3, r1=5 \u2192 shiftUp = 1 - 3 = \u20132  \n  New rows: each r \u2192 r \u2013 2.\n- Color 4: ro=5,r1=7 \u2192 shiftUp = 1 \u2013 5 = \u20134  \n  New rows: r \u2192 r \u2013 4.\n- Color 1: ro=6,r1=9 \u2192 shiftUp = 1 \u2013 6 = \u20135  \n  New rows: r \u2192 r \u2013 5.\n- Color 7: ro=8,r1=9 \u2192 shiftUp = 1 \u2013 8 = \u20137  \n  New rows: r \u2192 r \u2013 7.\n\nBottom objects:\n\n- Color 6: ro=12,r1=15 \u2192 shiftDown = 20 \u2013 15 = +5  \n  New rows: r \u2192 r + 5 (so rows 12\u201315 \u2192 17\u201320).\n- Color 8: ro=16,r1=17 \u2192 shiftDown = 20 \u2013 17 = +3  \n  New rows: r \u2192 r + 3 (rows 16\u201317 \u2192 19\u201320).\n\n### 3.4. New coordinates of every colored cell\n\nApply those shifts:\n\n- Color 3 (shift \u20132):\n\n  - (3,24) \u2192 (1,24)\n  - (4,23) \u2192 (2,23)\n  - (4,25) \u2192 (2,25)\n  - (5,24) \u2192 (3,24)\n\n- Color 4 (shift \u20134):\n\n  - (5,16) \u2192 (1,16)\n  - (5,17) \u2192 (1,17)\n  - (5,18) \u2192 (1,18)\n  - (6,17) \u2192 (2,17)\n  - (7,17) \u2192 (3,17)\n\n- Color 1 (shift \u20135):\n\n  - (6,7) \u2192 (1,7)\n  - (7,5) \u2192 (2,5)\n  - (7,6) \u2192 (2,6)\n  - (7,7) \u2192 (2,7)\n  - (7,8) \u2192 (2,8)\n  - (8,7) \u2192 (3,7)\n  - (9,7) \u2192 (4,7)\n\n- Color 7 (shift \u20137):\n\n  - (8,12) \u2192 (1,12)\n  - (8,13) \u2192 (1,13)\n  - (9,12) \u2192 (2,12)\n\n- Color 6 (shift +5):\n\n  - (12,23) \u2192 (17,23)\n  - (13,23) \u2192 (18,23)\n  - (14,22) \u2192 (19,22)\n  - (14,23) \u2192 (19,23)\n  - (14,24) \u2192 (19,24)\n  - (14,25) \u2192 (19,25)\n  - (15,23) \u2192 (20,23)\n\n- Color 8 (shift +3):\n\n  - (16,3) \u2192 (19,3)\n  - (17,2) \u2192 (20,2)\n  - (17,3) \u2192 (20,3)\n\nAll other cells remain 9 (background).\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Only changes their vertical positions by sliding each connected component either:\n   - all the way up to the top edge (row 1), or  \n   - all the way down to the bottom edge (last row).\n\nWhich components go up vs. down is determined **by the size (area) of each component**, and then, given the background color, we decide which size-group is placed at the top vs the bottom.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Identify components and their sizes\n\nFor each puzzle:\n\n- Find the background color = the most frequent color (0 in example 1, 5 in example 2, 9 in the test).\n- For each non\u2011background color, there is a single connected component (4\u2011connected).  \n- For each component, compute its **area** = number of cells of that color.\n\n### Example 1\n\nColors: 1,2,3,4 (background 0). Each color is one component.\n\nApproximate areas:\n\n- color 4: 5 cells  \n- color 2: 11 cells  \n- color 1: 7 cells  \n- color 3: 7 cells  \n\nSort areas: `[5, 7, 7, 11]`  \nThe **two middle sizes** (for 4 components) are 7 and 7.  \nSo:\n\n- **Medium\u2011size group M**: areas in [7,7] \u2192 colors {1,3}.  \n- **Extreme\u2011size group E**: areas <7 or >7 \u2192 colors {2,4}.\n\n### Example 2\n\nColors: 1,2,3,4,7,9 (background 5).\n\nAreas:\n\n- color 7: 3  \n- color 9: 3  \n- color 1: 4  \n- color 4: 5  \n- color 2: 9  \n- color 3: 9  \n\nSorted: `[3, 3, 4, 5, 9, 9]`  \nMiddle two sizes (for 6 components) are 4 and 5.\n\n- **Medium\u2011size group M**: areas in [4,5] \u2192 colors {1,4}.  \n- **Extreme\u2011size group E**: areas <4 or >5 \u2192 {2,3,7,9}.\n\n### General rule for size groups\n\nGiven all component areas sorted:\n\n- Let `mid_lo` = size at index \u230a(n+1)/2\u230b (1\u2011based)  \n- Let `mid_hi` = size at index \u2308(n+1)/2\u2309  \n\nThen:\n\n- **Medium group M** = components with area \u2208 [mid_lo, mid_hi].  \n- **Extreme group E** = the rest.\n\nThis matches both training puzzles.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Decide which group goes to top vs bottom\n\nNow we decide whether **extremes** or **mediums** go to the **top**.  \nEmpirically, from the two examples:\n\n- Example 1: background color = 0 (< 5)  \n  - Mediums {1,3} are moved to the **top**.  \n  - Extremes {2,4} are moved to the **bottom**.\n\n- Example 2: background color = 5 (\u2265 5)  \n  - Extremes {2,3,7,9} are moved to the **top**.  \n  - Mediums {1,4} are moved to the **bottom**.\n\nSo the orientation rule consistent with both:\n\n- If **background color < 5** \u2192 **M to top**, E to bottom.  \n- If **background color \u2265 5** \u2192 **E to top**, M to bottom.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 How components are moved\n\nFor each component:\n\n- If it belongs to the **top group**:\n  - Compute its current **top row** `t`.\n  - Slide it up by \u0394 = `1 - t` so that its new top row == 1.\n- If it belongs to the **bottom group**:\n  - Compute its **bottom row** `b`.\n  - For grid height `H`, slide it down by \u0394 = `H - b` so that its new bottom row == H.\n\nIn both training examples, components in the same group can share rows without overlap because their column ranges are disjoint; shapes and columns are preserved.\n\n---\n\n## Apply to the test input\n\n### 1. Basic info\n\n- Grid size: 19 rows \u00d7 28 columns.\n- Background color: 9 (overwhelmingly dominant).\n\nNon\u2011background colors and shapes (one component per color):\n\n- Color 3 near top-right.\n- Color 4 near upper\u2011right middle.\n- Color 1 as a larger cross/T around columns 5\u20138.\n- Color 7 as a small L around columns 12\u201313.\n- Color 6 as a large cross/T near rows 12\u201315, columns 22\u201325.\n- Color 8 as a 2\u00d72 L at left (rows 16\u201317, cols 2\u20133).\n\n#### Exact areas\n\nFrom counting in the test grid:\n\n- color 8: 3 cells  \n- color 7: 3 cells  \n- color 3: 4 cells  \n- color 4: 5 cells  \n- color 1: 7 cells  \n- color 6: 7 cells  \n\nSorted areas: `[3, 3, 4, 5, 7, 7]`  \nn = 6 \u2192 middle indices = 3rd & 4th \u2192 sizes 4 and 5.\n\nSo:\n\n- **Medium group M** (areas in [4,5]): colors {3,4}.\n- **Extreme group E** (areas <4 or >5): colors {7,8,1,6}.\n\nBackground color is 9 (\u2265 5) \u2192 from orientation rule:\n\n- **E (extremes) \u2192 top**, **M (mediums) \u2192 bottom**.\n\nSo:\n\n- Upwards to top: colors {1,6,7,8}.  \n- Downwards to bottom: colors {3,4}.\n\n### 2.

        "Full raw LLM response": "To solve this task I looked at the two worked examples and noticed that nothing was being rotated or reshaped, the individual coloured components kept their shape and columns but were shifted vertically so that in the outputs all the colours ended up clustered either at the very top or the very bottom of the grid, with a large empty band in the middle.\n\nThe way the examples behave can be summarised as:\n\n- Identify the \u201cbands\u201d of coloured rows, i.e. contiguous runs of rows containing any non\u2011background cells, separated by completely empty rows.\n- Decide which band will supply the bottom colours. If the lowest coloured band already touches the bottom edge of the grid, then that band is the bottom band. Otherwise, when nothing touches the bottom, the topmost coloured band is used as the bottom band.\n- Let\u202fbottomColours be the set of colours present in that chosen band. Components in that band either stay in place if the band already touches the bottom, or, if the band is above the bottom, each component from that band is individually aligned so its bottom row sits on the last row of the grid.\n- All other components whose colours are not in bottomColours are moved up so that their top row is row\u202f1. Components of colours in bottomColours that occur outside the chosen band are discarded.\n\nApplying that to the test grid:\n\n- The grid is 19\u00d728 with background colour\u202f9.\n- There are two coloured bands: rows\u202f3\u20139 containing colours {1,3,4,7}, and rows\u202f12\u201317 containing colours {6,8}. The lowest band doesn\u2019t touch the bottom edge, so the top band (rows\u202f3\u20139) supplies the bottom colours.\n- bottomColours = {1,3,4,7}. The components of colours {6,8} are moved to the top, aligned to row\u202f1. The components of colours {1,3,4,7} from the top band are aligned individually to the bottom (row\u202f19).\n\nCarrying out these placements gives the following output grid:\n\n9,9,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,7,7,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,7,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,3,9,9,9",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Let's denote each non\u2011background shape as a connected component and decide whether it will be shifted up to the top edge or down to the bottom edge. In the provided examples the shapes are rigidly translated vertically to either the top (their top row becomes 1) or the bottom (their bottom row becomes the last row), with horizontal positions and shapes unchanged. An overlap occurs if two shapes translated upwards would occupy the same cell; in that case the later processed shape is instead shifted downwards. In both examples a shape of colour\u202f4 is always placed at the bottom.\n\nApplying this to the test grid (19\u202frows by 28\u202fcolumns):\n\n- The up\u2013shifted components are the 8\u2011shape at columns 2\u20133, the 6\u2011shape at columns 22\u201325, the 7\u2011shape at columns 12\u201313, the 1\u2011shape at columns 5\u20138, and two of the isolated 3\u2011pixels.\n- The down\u2013shifted components are the 4\u2011shape at columns 16\u201318 and the remaining two isolated 3\u2011pixels.\n\nPlacing these on a background of 9 gives the output:\n\n```\n9,9,8,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,7,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,3,3,9,9,9\n9,8,8,9,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,3,3,9,9,9,9\n```",
