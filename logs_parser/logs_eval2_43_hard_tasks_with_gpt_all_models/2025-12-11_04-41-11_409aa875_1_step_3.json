        "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task: Shape Interaction Simulation**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I'm essentially simulating interactions between shapes within a grid.  It seems the user wants me to derive the rules based on examples, and then apply those rules to a test input. I'm focusing on the geometric features and how they relate to the transformation of the grid.  The core idea I'm latching onto is that different shapes act as \"launchers,\" projecting \"projectiles\" that can interact with the grid and other objects.  Shapes also appear to \"fire\" these projectiles by altering some other part of the grid.\n\nAnalyzing the examples, I can see that the grid initially contains a background color (7), some initial objects (the \"launchers\"), and then the output shows the results of these shapes' actions. The shapes come in various forms - Carets, Flags, L-shapes, and some new variants in the test input. Their positions relative to one another in the output can be attributed to each shapes' action - projecting projectiles. Each shape seems to have a predefined \"firing vector\" or direction that determines where its projectile lands. Based on the examples, and my observations, the firing direction seems related to the shape's orientation or asymmetry.\n\nMy current understanding is that each \"launcher\" launches a projectile in a certain direction, based on its shape's defining geometry. This is the core mechanic.  If the projectile lands on an empty space, it leaves a \"projectile\" pixel (color 9). If it hits another object, the object is changed. And if two projectiles collide in the air, a collision event (color 1) is registered. However, the interactions aren't completely direct. There's a 5-row separation that is involved for the most part. Each launcher projects a pixel that will impact at -5 rows and a specific offset based on the launching shape. \n\nIn Example 1, I identified a core pattern: \"caret\" shapes generate an upward-shooting projectile that turns into an altered pixel (9). These shapes don't shift horizontally (their column remains the same), unless there are overlapping projectiles from other shapes. Example 2 demonstrated the same upward firing projectiles. In Example 3, I dealt with flag shapes, which introduced a horizontal displacement (-5 columns) to the projectile's trajectory, leading to a new \"shooting\" pattern. The test input has given me a lot more shapes that behave in a similar fashion.\n\nThe rules I've deduced are:\n1. **Shape Types** The launchers are detected based on the configuration of their base pixels:\n   - Caret (pointy top): shoot straight upwards.\n   - V-Shape: shoot downwards.\n   - Flag (top-left filled): shoot upward-left.\n   - Mirror L (group 1): Shoot bottom-right.\n   - Reverse Flag. Shoot up to the right.\n   - ZigZag: point to the left and shoot in that direction.\n   - L-Shape (Ex 1): points downwards to the left and shoots there.\n2. **Target Calculation:** Determine the projectile's target coordinate based on the launching shape's properties by adding specific row and column offsets.\n3. **Collision & Transformation:** Simulate the \"projectiles\" landing by adding the pixels at the target. This leads to the generation of 9 pixels on all empty spaces. Projectiles can lead to transformations and collisions:\n   - A hit pixel object will become 9\n   - A mid-air collision between two projectiles will become a pixel 1.\n\nI'm confident I can now analyze the test input to find the shapes, generate their respective targets and construct the output grid based on these interactions and the 5 row difference from the source pixels. Let's see if this plays out.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid based on rules inferred from three solved examples. The grids contain various small shapes (objects) made of colors on a background of orange (7).\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification & Classification**: We identify small connected components (\"shapes\") in the grid. Based on their geometry, we classify them as specific types of \"launchers\" that fire projectiles in a specific direction. The offset for all projectiles is 5 steps in the respective cardinal or diagonal direction.\n    *   **Caret (Up-Shooter)**: Shape `^` (e.g., center top, legs bottom). Fires **Up** (row -5, col 0).\n    *   **V-Shape (Down-Shooter)**: Shape `v` (inverted Caret). Fires **Down** (row +5, col 0).\n    *   **Flag (Diagonal-Shooter)**: A 2x2 block with one corner missing.\n        *   If Top-Left filled (Ex 3): Fires **Up-Left** (row -5, col -5).\n        *   If Top-Right filled (Test Input, Group 7): Fires **Up-Right** (row -5, col +5).\n    *   **L-Shape / J-Shape (Diagonal-Shooter)**: A 2x2 block with one corner filled and its two neighbors.\n        *   If L-shaped (Bottom-Left corner): Fires **Down-Left** (row +5, col -5).\n        *   If J-shaped (Bottom-Right corner, Test Input Group 1): Fires **Down-Right** (row +5, col +5).\n    *   **ZigZag (Lateral-Shooter)**: A vertical zig-zag line.\n        *   If pointing Left (`<`): Fires **Left** (row 0, col -5).\n\n2.  **Projectile Logic**:\n    *   For each shape, determine the \"source\" pixel (usually the tip or corner in the direction of fire) and calculate the \"target\" pixel using the offset.\n    *   **Empty Target**: If the target pixel is empty (background 7), a projectile lands there. The color is **Maroon (9)**.\n    *   **Collision**: If two projectiles land on the same empty target pixel, they collide and form a **Blue (1)** pixel.\n    *   **Object Hit**: If a projectile's target lands on an existing object, that object is \"hit\". The entire object changes its color to **Maroon (9)**.\n\n**Application to Test Input**:\n\n*   **Shape 1 (J-Shape)** at `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)`. Fires Down-Right (+5, +5) from `(3,2)` to target **(8,7)**.\n*   **Shape 2 (V-Shape)** at `(2,8), (2,10), (3,9)`. Fires Down (+5, 0) from `(3,9)` to target **(8,9)**.\n*   **Shape 3 (ZigZag)** at `(3,14), (4,13), (5,14)`. Points Left. Fires Left (0, -5) from `(4,13)` to target **(4,8)**.\n*   **Shape 4 (Caret)** at `(5,9), (6,8), (6,10)`. Fires Up (-5, 0) from `(5,9)` to target **(0,9)**.\n*   **Shape 5 (Caret)** at `(7,2), (8,1), (8,3)`. Fires Up (-5, 0) from `(7,2)` to target **(2,2)**.\n    *   Target `(2,2)` is part of Shape 1. **Hit!** Shape 1 turns Maroon (9).\n*   **Shape 6 (Caret)** at `(13,4), (14,3), (14,5)`. Fires Up (-5, 0) from `(13,4)` to target **(8,4)**.\n*   **Shape 7 (Flag-TR)** at `(14,8), (14,9), (15,9)`. Fires Up-Right (-5, +5) from `(14,9)` to target **(9,14)**.\n*   **Shape 8 (Caret)** at `(14,14), (15,13), (15,15)`. Fires Up (-5, 0) from `(14,14)` to target **(9,14)**.\n    *   Shapes 7 and 8 both target `(9,14)`. **Collision!** The pixel at `(9,14)` becomes Blue (1).\n\n**Final Grid Construction**:\n*   Background: 7.\n*   Original Shapes: 6 (Magenta), except Shape 1 which becomes 9 (Maroon).\n*   New Pixels:\n    *   (0,9): 9\n    *   (4,8): 9\n    *   (8,4): 9\n    *   (8,7): 9\n    *   (8,9): 9\n    *   (9,14): 1\n\noutput:\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Problem Decomposition and Pattern Identification**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this ARC problem. The goal is to predict the output grid based on the input and some solved examples. It looks like it's all about identifying shapes and transforming them somehow.  The background color is pretty consistently orange (7), so that\u2019s my baseline.\n\n**Initial Exploration: Example 1**\n\nFirst, I looked at Example 1. I started by noticing two key non-orange patterns: a small \u201cV\u201d shaped triangle and an \u201cL\u201d shape in the grid.  I spent a good amount of time analyzing the coordinates and structure of these shapes, trying to understand how they related to the output. The output grid was tricky because it seemed to add in an extra color, blue (1), that wasn't in the input. And I was stumped as to *why* a given pixel changed to blue or not. At first, I thought there was a -5 offset, which didn't feel right.\n\n**From Triangle Count to Offsets**\n\nThen, I jumped to Example 2. Here, there are triangles and the output seemed consistent, adding a new color. I went through the coordinate analysis here again. I took special care to record the locations of these triangles. Once I was sure that there were shapes, I looked at the output and started noticing a consistent *distance* between the shape and the added color. A -5 offset (upward) was the key.\n\n**Example 3: A Different Shape**\n\nExample 3 was a curveball. The shapes looked different from Example 1, like L-shapes but inverted. The output didn't follow the pattern I initially thought. I spent a long time retracing the logic and trying to find the correspondence between shapes and generated pixels. The addition and offset were still present. I needed a clear way to encode them.\n\n**Refinement: Triangle vs. L-Shape**\n\nLooking at all the examples, I realized there were different \"shapes\" within the grids. It became clear that there were two types of shapes: triangles, which always led to one kind of transformation. Then the L-shapes, with an offset to the left and a color transformation. I had to distinguish each type of shape. It finally started to click: the key was not just identifying the *type* of shape, but also where it was located within the grid. Different shapes, and their orientations, had different offsets, and the pixel creation was based on offset location.\n\n**Decomposing Transformations and Validating**\n\nThe logic boiled down to this: Identify shapes. Then apply the appropriate offset to each shape. The offset depended on the *type* and orientation of the shape. If the projection overlapped an existing shape, that shape changed color!\n\n**Applying the Rules to the Test Input**\n\nWith my rules in place, I moved to the Test Input. First thing I did was re-index my locations to ensure I am using the proper location. I identified the shapes.  I carefully analyzed the Test Input, finding triangles and L-shapes (of different orientations).  I had to pay attention to coordinates very carefully. I applied the transformation rules I derived. I calculated each projected coordinate and marked the change. The shape at (2,2) got hit. The algorithm generated these new pixels, changing certain values in the grid, and drawing new ones.\n\n**Final Touches**\n\nIn the end, all that was left was applying my transformation rules to generate the output, which was a simple matter of going through the input and changing the appropriate values based on my calculations. The final output became clear and I was satisfied.\n\n\nBased on the solved examples, the transformation involves identifying specific shapes in the grid and projecting a \"shadow\" or marker pixel 5 units away in a direction determined by the shape's orientation. If a projection lands on an existing shape, that shape changes color to Maroon (9). If it lands on an empty space, a Maroon (9) pixel is created.\n\n**Rules:**\n1.  **Triangle (Up)**: A symmetric triangle shape pointing up (Tip at top).\n    *   **Projection**: 5 rows UP from the tip. `(r - 5, c)`.\n2.  **Triangle (Left)**: A triangle shape pointing left (Tip at left).\n    *   **Projection**: 5 columns LEFT from the tip. `(r, c - 5)`.\n3.  **L-Shapes (2x2 with one corner missing)**:\n    *   **Missing Top-Right**: Projects **Down-Left**. `(BottomRow + 5, LeftCol - 5)`. (Seen in Ex 1).\n    *   **Missing Bottom-Right**: Projects **Up-Left**. `(TopRow - 5, LeftCol - 5)`. (Seen in Ex 3).\n    *   **Missing Bottom-Left**: Projects **Up-Right**. `(TopRow - 5, LeftCol + 5)`.\n    *   **Missing Top-Left**: Projects **Down-Right**. `(BottomRow + 5, LeftCol + 5)`.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Triangle Up** at `(5, 9)` (Tip).\n    *   Target: `(5 - 5, 9)` = **`(0, 9)`**.\n2.  **Triangle Up** at `(7, 2)` (Tip).\n    *   Target: `(7 - 5, 2)` = **`(2, 2)`**.\n    *   Note: `(2, 2)` is occupied by the L-shape described below. This collision causes the L-shape to turn Maroon (9).\n3.  **Triangle Up** at `(13, 4)` (Tip).\n    *   Target: `(13 - 5, 4)` = **`(8, 4)`**.\n4.  **Triangle Up** at `(14, 14)` (Tip).\n    *   Target: `(14 - 5, 14)` = **`(9, 14)`**.\n5.  **Triangle Left** at `(4, 13)` (Tip). (Base at `(3,14), (5,14)`).\n    *   Target: `(4, 13 - 5)` = **`(4, 8)`**.\n6.  **L-Shape (Missing Top-Left)** at Rows 2-3, Cols 1-2.\n    *   Occupies `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)`.\n    *   Projects Down-Right. Bottom row is 3. Left col is 1.\n    *   Target: `(3 + 5, 1 + 5)` = **`(8, 6)`**.\n    *   **Effect**: This shape is hit by the projection from the Triangle at `(7,2)`. Its pixels `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)` change to **9**.\n7.  **L-Shape (Missing Bottom-Left)** at Rows 14-15, Cols 8-9.\n    *   Occupies `(14,8), (14,9), (15,9)`.\n    *   Projects Up-Right. Top row is 14. Left col is 8.\n    *   Target: `(14 - 5, 8 + 5)` = **`(9, 13)`**.\n\n**Final Changes to Input Grid:**\n*   Pixels at `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)` become **9**.\n*   New pixel **9** at `(0, 9)`.\n*   New pixel **9** at `(4, 8)`.\n*   New pixel **9** at `(8, 4)`.\n*   New pixel **9** at `(8, 6)`.\n*   New pixel **9** at `(9, 13)`.\n*   New pixel **9** at `(9, 14)`.\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6",

An L-shape at rows 3-4 (different type) causes one marker to be color 1 instead of 9 at column = odd_shape_col - 5.\n\n2. **Example 2**: V-shapes (color 0) scattered in lower rows get markers (color 9) placed 5 rows above each.

A single L at rows 11-12 (the \"odd\" shape) causes the L-shape at column 8 (13-5=8) to change to color 9.\n\n**Key Rules:**\n- Markers are placed 5 rows above each shape at the shape's center/tip column\n- If there's an \"odd\" shape (different type/orientation), the shape at (odd_col - 5) gets marked differently\n- Original color not 9 \u2192 affected shape changes to 9\n- Original color 9 \u2192 affected marker becomes color 1\n- When a marker position overlaps an existing shape, that shape changes to 9\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n- V-shapes pointing up at rows 5-6 (col 9), 7-8 (col 2), 13-14 (col 4), 14-15 (col 14)\n- V-shape pointing DOWN at rows 2-3 (col 9) - this is the \"odd\" shape\n- L-shapes at rows 2-3 (cols 1-2) and 14-15 (cols 8-9)\n\n**Applying transformation:**\n- V at rows 5-6: marker at (0, 9)\n- V at rows 7-8: marker at (2, 2) \u2192 overlaps with L, so L changes to 9\n- V at rows 13-14: affected by odd V at col 9 (9-5=4), changes to 9\n- V at rows 14-15: marker at (9, 14)\n- L at rows 14-15: marker at (9, 9)\n\n```\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n```",

Since the shapes are already color 9, one marker is color 1 instead to distinguish it based on a different/lone shape nearby.\n\n2. **Example 2**: Multiple V-shapes scattered throughout get 9 markers placed 5 rows above each tip.\n\n3. **Example 3**: Repeated L-shapes get markers 5 rows above, and one shape changes from color 2 to 9 based on a lone shape's position.\n\n**For the test input**, I identify these shapes:\n- **Up V** at rows 5-6, cols 8-10 (tip at row 5, col 9)\n- **Up V** at rows 7-8, cols 1-3 (tip at row 7, col 2)  \n- **Up V** at rows 13-14, cols 3-5 (tip at row 13, col 4)\n- **Up V** at rows 14-15, cols 13-15 (tip at row 14, col 14)\n- **Down V** at rows 2-3, cols 8-10 (tip at row 3, col 9)\n- **L-shapes** at rows 2-3 (cols 1-2) and rows 14-15 (cols 8-9)\n\n**Applying the transformation:**\n- Marker 5 rows above (5,9) \u2192 (0,9): valid, place 9\n- Marker 5 rows above (7,2) \u2192 (2,2): **occupied by existing 6** \u2192 the Up V changes to 9\n- Marker 5 rows above (13,4) \u2192 (8,4): valid, place 9\n- Marker 5 rows above (14,14) \u2192 (9,14): valid, place 9\n- Down V marker would be at (-2,9): invalid (outside grid)\n\nThe Up V at rows 7-8 changes from 6 to 9 because its marker position overlaps with another shape.\n\n```\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**High\u2013level pattern**\n\nAcross the three examples, the non\u2011background color (9, 0, or 2) always appears in small connected clusters of exactly three cells:\n\n- Some clusters form an **L\u2011shape** (a right angle, 3 cells in a 2\u00d72 box).\n- Other clusters form a **V\u2011shape / chevron** (one \u201capex\u201d cell and two diagonal neighbors, 3 cells in a 2\u00d73 box).\n\nFor each such 3\u2011cell cluster we:\n\n1. **Find its pivot cell** (the cell that \u201cjoins\u201d the other two).\n2. **Find the direction in which the shape is \u201copen\u201d** \u2013 i.e. the direction from the pivot toward the missing central cell that would complete the shape.\n3. **Shoot a marker 5 steps in the opposite direction** from that opening, and mark that destination cell in the output.\n\nThe marker color is 9 in all examples. Two refinements are needed:\n\n- If two different clusters\u2019 markers land on the **same cell**, that cell is colored **1** instead of 9 (Example 1, center marker).\n- If a cluster\u2019s marker lands exactly on the **pivot of another cluster**, then (as in Example 3) that entire second cluster is recolored to 9 (its three cells). This does not happen in the test input, but shows up with the central pair of L\u2011shapes in Example 3.\n\nBelow is the procedure more concretely.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1 \u2013 Find 3\u2011cell clusters\n\nUse **8\u2011connectivity** (neighbors with |dr| \u2264 1, |dc| \u2264 1, excluding (0,0)) on non\u2011background cells (non\u20117) to find connected components.\n\nIn the test grid (color 6 is the foreground), the 3\u2011cell components are:\n\n- **Cluster A:** {(3,3), (4,2), (4,3)} \u2013 shape is an L.\n- **Cluster B:** {(3,9), (3,11), (4,10)} \u2013 a V with apex pointing **down**.\n- **Cluster D:** {(6,10), (7,9), (7,11)} \u2013 a V with apex pointing **up**.\n- **Cluster E:** {(8,3), (9,2), (9,4)} \u2013 V, apex up.\n- **Cluster F:** {(14,5), (15,4), (15,6)} \u2013 V, apex up.\n- **Cluster G:** {(15,9), (15,10), (16,10)} \u2013 L.\n- **Cluster H2:** {(15,15), (16,14), (16,16)} \u2013 V, apex up.\n\n(Other 6\u2019s are isolated or in 2\u2011cell groups and are ignored because training examples consistently only transform 3\u2011cell clusters.)\n\n---\n\n### Step 2 \u2013 Classify cluster and find pivot and opening direction\n\n#### A. L\u2011shapes\n\nFor an L\u2011shape cluster (3 cells in a 2\u00d72 bounding box with one empty corner):\n\n1. Let the **pivot** be the cell with **two 4\u2011neighbors** within the cluster (the elbow).\n2. In the 2\u00d72 box, find the **missing cell** \\(M\\) (the one corner that is not in the cluster).\n3. Let  \n   \\[\n   d = (\\mathrm{sign}(r_M - r_P),\\ \\mathrm{sign}(c_M - c_P))\n   \\]\n   This is a diagonal unit vector \\((\\pm1,\\pm1)\\) from pivot toward the missing cell (the opening direction).\n4. The marker destination is  \n   \\[\n   D = P - 5\\,d = (r_P - 5d_r,\\ c_P - 5d_c)\n   \\]\n\nApply to the two L\u2011clusters:\n\n- **Cluster A:** {(3,3), (4,2), (4,3)}\n  - Pivot: (4,3) (neighbors: (3,3) and (4,2))\n  - 2\u00d72 box rows 3\u20134, cols 2\u20133. Missing corner: (3,2)\n  - \\(d = (3-4,\\ 2-3) = (-1,-1)\\)\n  - \\(D_A = (4 - 5\u00b7(-1),\\ 3 - 5\u00b7(-1)) = (9,8)\\)\n\n- **Cluster G:** {(15,9), (15,10), (16,10)}\n  - Pivot: (15,10) (neighbors: (15,9) and (16,10))\n  - 2\u00d72 box rows 15\u201316, cols 9\u201310. Missing corner: (16,9)\n  - \\(d = (16-15,\\ 9-10) = (1,-1)\\)\n  - \\(D_G = (15 - 5\u00b71,\\ 10 - 5\u00b7(-1)) = (10,15)\\)\n\n#### B.

Apex (6,10), base (7,9) and (7,11)\n2. Apex (8,3), base (9,2) and (9,4)\n3. Apex (14,5), base (15,4) and (15,6)\n4. Apex (15,15), base (16,14) and (16,16)\n\nFor each apex \\((r,c)\\), place a 9 at \\((r-5,c)\\):\n\n1. (6,10) \u2192 (1,10)\n2. (8,3) \u2192 (3,3)\n3. (14,5) \u2192 (9,5)\n4. (15,15) \u2192 (10,15)\n\nThese target cells are inside the grid.

        "Full raw LLM response": "We look at the training pairs and see that new marks are added a fixed five rows above certain existing coloured cells. To decide which cells to copy we work in \u201cbands\u201d of five rows directly above the bottommost non\u2011background row, then repeat upward.\n\nWithin a band we take 8\u2011connected components of non\u2011background cells. For each component we decide what to copy up by five rows and left by the global minimum column of any non\u2011background cell:\n\n- If the component occupies only one row in the band, copy only its leftmost cell.\n- If the component spans multiple rows in the band, compare the cell counts in its top row and the next row: if the top row has more cells, copy the whole component; otherwise copy only the top row.\n\nWe then look above the band start to find the next bottommost row with colour and process the next band similarly. New cells are coloured 9 and overwrite existing values.\n\nApplying this to the test grid (global min\u2011col\u202f=\u202f1) yields new 9s at (0,8), (2,1), (8,3), (9,7) and (9,13).

        "Full raw LLM response": "From the three provided examples two distinct local patterns emerge that trigger the placement of new 9s:\n\n- In examples 1 and 2, whenever a non\u20117 cell has the same colour diagonally below it to both the left and the right (an inverted \u201cV\u201d of three matching pixels), the output contains a 9 five rows above in the same column.\n- In example 3, whenever a non\u20117 cell has the same colour immediately to its right and immediately below (the top\u2011left corner of a 2\u00d72 block with the bottom\u2011right missing), a 9 is placed five rows above and five columns to the left. If an entire L\u2011shape appears again exactly 5 rows down and 5 columns to the right, the upper instance is recoloured to 9 where it overlaps, but that situation does not occur in the test.\n\nScanning the test grid for these patterns, only inverted\u2011V apices are found at (5,9), (7,2), (13,4) and (14,14). Placing 9s five rows above in the same columns yields new 9s at (0,9), (2,2), (8,4) and (9,14). There are no L\u2011corners of the observed orientation, so no other changes are made. The output is the input grid with those four cells set to 9.\n\nThe completed output grid is:\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6",
