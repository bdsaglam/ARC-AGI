            "Full raw LLM response": "**1. The Task at Hand: Decoding the ARC Mystery**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this ARC task. The goal, as I understand it, is to figure out the underlying logic governing these visual transformations. The user has presented me with several examples, and my initial approach is to systematically analyze them to find patterns.\n\n**2. A Deep Dive into Example 1: The Building Blocks**\n\nExample 1 is where it all starts. There's this large grid, mostly filled with a teal color (8s in the text), and within it, several smaller, structured regions. These small structures are the key. They usually consist of a border and an inner color. The initial thought is that the goal of this transformation is to move the objects and color them. But after closer inspection, it's not so simple.\n\nThe outputs are, at first glance, a bit perplexing. It's like these inner structures have \"projected\" upwards, but not quite vertically. The color transitions are not as expected and something's clearly going on with the border colors. I note that the *inner* colors seem to be the primary driving force in the output. The inner color of these small structures is always the same as the \"projected\" color.\n\n**3. The Diagonal Projection Hypothesis: A Breakthrough**\n\nThen it hits me: *diagonal* beams! The output isn't about vertical or horizontal movement. Instead, it seems like each inner color \"shoots\" a diagonal beam starting at a certain border position. I trace the output and see if this is true. This theory starts to fall into place. It's not the entire structure moving. It's the inner color that's the starting point for diagonal beams.\n\n**4. The Key: Where Do the Beams Originate? The \"Hole\" Theory**\n\nThis \"beam\" idea is promising, but where exactly do these beams originate? Examining the borders of the small shapes, I notice these are not perfect. There are often missing border pixels (denoted as 8s). These \"missing\" pixels, or holes, are the key!\n\nThe Hypothesis: Beams are emitted from specific locations in the border of the inner shape. I've developed a set of rules for the specific beam positions. Corners create diagonals, and the edges create straight lines. Furthermore, they are based on the non-three color in the shape.\n\n**5. Refining the Physics: Beam Interactions**\n\nNow, things get a bit more complex. What happens when two beams collide? Or when a diagonal beam gets blocked? The answer is simple: they *merge*! Two diagonals become a vertical beam! This explains the output of the first example. They create a vertical track.\n\n**6. Testing and Validation: The Other Examples**\n\nI test my new physics model against the other examples provided. The hole theory and direction is holding up pretty nicely with different colored objects. They also create a similar structure, and by tracing their coordinates, I notice that the pattern is consistent.\n\n**7. Building the Rules: A Summary**\n\nThe summary is this: 1. Identify objects. 2. Identify the holes in borders. 3. Emit beams with the color. 4. Simulate. If two beams interact, combine. If a hole exists at a corner, make it diagonal. If at the edge, cardinal. The theory has been validated using the output examples provided.\n\n**8. Testing: The New Puzzle**\n\nThe task includes new data. It's a new 30x30 test grid. The task is to apply these physics and render them to get an output. Based on the previous rules, I have to draw beams from the relevant holes. This will involve working out:\n* Finding the beam origins (locations).\n* Determining beam directions.\n* Calculating beam paths.\n* Considering collisions and deflections.\n\n**9. Implementation Strategy**\n\nTo implement, I am going to:\n1.  **Analyze the test grid.** Identify each small structure (bounding box).\n2.  **Apply my rules to get a list of beams.** Compute the direction of each.\n3.  **Draw the beam paths.**\n4.  **Simulate and resolve collisions.** Where beams meet, calculate deflection.\n5.  **Output the final grid.** Fill the holes with the beam colors.\n\nI feel confident in my ability to generate a solution for the test grid. Let's start the final step!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid by identifying \"objects\" (boxes with a colored border and a different inner color) and projecting \"beams\" from them based on missing pixels in their borders (\"holes\").\n\n**1. Object and Hole Identification:**\nWe scan the grid for 4x4 structures. Each structure has a border color (usually 3) and an inner color. We identify \"holes\" where the border should be but is missing (value 8). The position of the hole determines the direction of the beam.\n*   **Edge Holes** (Top, Bottom, Left, Right) emit **Cardinal Beams** (North, South, West, East).\n*   **Corner Holes** (TL, TR, BL, BR) emit **Diagonal Beams** (NW, NE, SW, SE).\n*   **Beam Color** matches the **Inner Color** of the object.\n\n**2. Objects in Test Input:**\n*   **Object 1 (Red 2)**: Cols 3-6, Rows 4-7.\n    *   Hole (4,4) [Top Edge] $\\rightarrow$ **North** Beam.\n    *   Hole (5,3) [Left Edge] $\\rightarrow$ **West** Beam.\n    *   Hole (7,6) [BR Corner] $\\rightarrow$ **SE** Beam.\n*   **Object 2 (Yellow 4)**: Cols 15-18, Rows 4-7.\n    *   Hole (4,18) [TR Corner] $\\rightarrow$ **NE** Beam.\n    *   Hole (5,18) [Right Edge] $\\rightarrow$ **East** Beam.\n    *   Hole (7,16) [Bottom Edge] $\\rightarrow$ **South** Beam.\n*   **Object 3 (Magenta 6)**: Cols 22-25, Rows 13-16.\n    *   Hole (13,23) [Top Edge] $\\rightarrow$ **North** Beam.\n    *   Hole (13,25) [TR Corner] $\\rightarrow$ **NE** Beam.\n    *   Hole (16,25) [BR Corner] $\\rightarrow$ **SE** Beam.\n*   **Object 4 (Orange 7)**: Cols 21-24, Rows 19-22.\n    *   Hole (20,24) [Right Edge] $\\rightarrow$ **East** Beam.\n    *   Hole (22,24) [BR Corner] $\\rightarrow$ **SE** Beam.\n*   **Object 5 (Maroon 9)**: Cols 0-3, Rows 24-27.\n    *   Hole (24,2) [Top Edge] $\\rightarrow$ **North** Beam.\n    *   Hole (27,3) [BR Corner] $\\rightarrow$ **SE** Beam.\n\n**3. Interactions (Deflections):**\n*   **Red West + Maroon North**: Red West beam (Row 5) meets Maroon North beam (Col 2) at (5,2). They deflect NW.\n    *   Red turns NW starting (4,2).\n    *   Maroon turns NW starting (4,1).\n*   **Yellow East + Magenta North**: Yellow East beam (Row 5) meets Magenta North beam (Col 23) at (5,23). They deflect NE.\n    *   Yellow turns NE starting (4,23).\n    *   Magenta turns NE starting (4,24).\n*   **Red SE + Yellow South**: Red SE beam meets Yellow South beam (Col 16) at (17,16).\n    *   Red turns South to run parallel at (17,15).\n    *   Yellow continues South at (17,16).\n\n**4. Final Beam Paths:**\n*   **Red (2)**:\n    *   N: (3,4) to (0,4).\n    *   W$\\to$NW: Starts at hole (5,3), deflects at (5,2). Path: (4,2), (3,1), (2,0).\n    *   SE$\\to$S: Starts (7,6). Diagonal to (16,15). Turns South: (17,15) to (29,15).\n*   **Yellow (4)**:\n    *   NE: (3,19) to (0,22).\n    *   E$\\to$NE: Starts (5,18) to (5,22). Turns NE: (4,23) to (0,27).\n    *   S: Starts (7,16). South to (29,16).\n*   **Magenta (6)**:\n    *   N$\\to$NE: Starts (12,23) to (5,23). Turns NE: (4,24) to (0,28).\n    *   NE: (12,26) to (9,29).\n    *   SE: (17,26) to (20,29).\n*   **Orange (7)**:\n    *   E: (20,25) to (20,29).\n    *   SE: (23,25) to (27,29).\n*   **Maroon (9)**:\n    *   N$\\to$NW: Starts (23,2) to (5,2). Turns NW: (4,1) to (3,0).\n    *   SE: (28,4) to (29,5).\n\nThe final grid is constructed by overlaying these beams and filling the original holes with the respective beam colors.\n\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,4,6,8\n8,8,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,4,6,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,4,6,8,8,8\n8,2,2,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,4,6,8,8,8,8\n8,9,2,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,4,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,2,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

The lines use the interior color and extend until hitting the grid boundary\n\n**Analyzing test input patterns:**\n\n- **Pattern 1 (color 2)** at rows 4-7, cols 3-6: Edge gaps at (4,4) top, (5,3) left; Corner gap at (7,6)\n- **Pattern 2 (color 4)** at rows 4-7, cols 14-17: Corner gap at (4,14); Edge gaps at (5,17) right, (7,15) bottom  \n- **Pattern 3 (color 6)** at rows 13-16, cols 22-25: Edge gap at (13,23) top; Corner gaps at (13,25), (16,25)\n- **Pattern 4 (color 7)** at rows 19-22, cols 21-24: Edge gap at (20,24) right; Corner gap at (22,24)\n- **Pattern 5 (color 9)** at rows 24-27, cols 0-3: Edge gap at (24,2) top; Corner gap at (27,3)\n\nApplying the transformation rules to create lines from each gap:\n\n```\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8\n```",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Find shapes**: Each shape has a border of 3s containing a colored interior (not 8 or 3)\n2. **Identify gaps**: Gaps are positions in the border where 8 appears instead of 3\n3. **Draw lines from gaps**: \n   - Edge gaps (on sides) create perpendicular lines extending outward\n   - Corner gaps create diagonal lines extending outward\n4. The gap cells themselves get filled with the interior color\n5. Lines only fill background cells (8s), not overwriting existing patterns\n\nFor the test input, I identified 5 shapes:\n- **Shape 1 (2s)**: gaps at (4,4), (5,3), (7,6) \u2192 vertical up, horizontal left, diagonal down-right\n- **Shape 2 (4s)**: gaps at (4,14), (5,17), (7,15) \u2192 diagonal up-left, horizontal right, vertical down  \n- **Shape 3 (6s)**: gaps at (13,23), (13,25), (16,25) \u2192 vertical up, diagonal up-right, diagonal down-right\n- **Shape 4 (7s)**: gaps at (20,24), (22,24) \u2192 horizontal right, diagonal down-right\n- **Shape 5 (9s)**: gaps at (24,2), (27,3) \u2192 vertical up, diagonal down-right\n\nApplying all transformations:\n\n```\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**1. Analyzing the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task, and my job is to figure out the pattern. The core of the issue seems to be understanding how colored shapes in the input grid translate into the output.\n\n**2. The Initial Observations**\n\nI quickly noticed that a dominant teal color (8) acts as the background. Then I saw shapes made of other colors, usually \"boxes\" or \"containers\" outlined in green (3), enclosing a core color.  I analyzed an example with four distinct objects, looking for a pattern.\n\n**3. The Shape Analysis**\n\nI looked closely at the shapes. It seemed like the shape and position, plus the color of those shapes, influenced the output. The green outlines weren't always neat rectangles, and their form seemed to matter. I focused in, trying to map the input's green outline shape with the direction and nature of output beams.\n\n**4. The Beam Hypothesis**\n\nI formed a hypothesis. The shapes of the green outline have a correlation with the direction and nature of the output \"beams\" of color. I suspected that the \"gaps\" or \"holes\" within the green outlines might be where the color \"leaks\" from the core. I kept digging into the inputs. I started to think of them like walls, and the core color as a light source emitting beams. \n\n**5. Refining the Rules**\n\nThe beams are blocked by green pixels. Then, I had a new, much stronger hypothesis: the green outline forms walls, the inner color is a source, and the color will propagate in straight lines. Beams interact!\n\n**6. Beam Interactions**\n\nI considered a rule. Rays travel until they collide. What happens when rays intersect?  I realized that two rays becoming parallel and turn vertical is likely a condition.\n\n**7. Test Input**\n\nMoving to the test input, I found a few shapes were the same, but the shapes were simpler.\nThe same pattern existed. I analyzed the rays and their properties from each shape.\nThe core of the issue was that I needed a better mechanism.\n\n**8. Putting it All Together**\n\nThe rules boiled down to this. The program:\n*   Identifies a *core* of color in the middle.\n*   The green outlines *walls* which create the *holes*.\n*   The rays *propagate* in all directions from the *core*, until it encounters an obstacle.\n*   If an output encounters other output, and if the path will cross, the paths take their respective directions.\n*   I considered many iterations of collision models, but these interactions became consistent with previous observations.\n\n**9. The Execution Plan**\n\nI formulated a plan. I began with the input, and then built a series of steps to apply the rule. With a plan and my model, I should solve this.\n\n\nThe logic for this task involves identifying \"colored cores\" enclosed within \"green walls\" and projecting \"rays\" of the core color outwards through any \"holes\" (gaps) in the walls.\n\n**1. Object Analysis:**\nWe identify five distinct objects in the test input based on the green (3) outlines and their colored interiors:\n*   **Object 1 (Red 2):** Located top-left (Rows 4-7, Cols 3-6). Core is Red (2).\n*   **Object 2 (Yellow 4):** Located top-middle (Rows 4-7, Cols 14-17). Core is Yellow (4).\n*   **Object 3 (Magenta 6):** Located middle-right (Rows 13-16, Cols 22-25). Core is Magenta (6).\n*   **Object 4 (Orange 7):** Located bottom-right (Rows 19-22, Cols 21-24). Core is Orange (7).\n*   **Object 5 (Maroon 9):** Located bottom-left (Rows 24-27, Cols 0-3). Core is Maroon (9).\n\n**2. Hole Identification & Ray Casting:**\nFor each object, we find gaps in the surrounding 8-neighbor boundary (the \"green wall\") relative to the core pixels. Rays are cast from the hole coordinate in the direction of the gap.\n\n*   **Object 1 (Red 2):**\n    *   **Top Hole:** at `(4,4)` (North). Projects a Vertical Ray upwards: `(3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4)`.\n    *   **Left Hole:** at `(5,3)` (West). Projects a Horizontal Ray leftwards: `(5,3)`. (Stops at `(5,2)` due to collision).\n\n*   **Object 2 (Yellow 4):**\n    *   **Top-Left Hole:** at `(4,14)` (North-West). Projects a Diagonal Ray NW: `(4,14), (3,13), (2,12), (1,11), (0,10)`.\n    *   **Right Hole:** at `(5,17)` (East). Projects a Horizontal Ray rightwards: `(5,17)` to `(5,22)`. (Stops at `(5,23)` due to collision).\n    *   **Bottom Hole:** at `(7,15)` (South). Projects a Vertical Ray downwards: `(7,15)` to `(29,15)`.\n\n*   **Object 3 (Magenta 6):**\n    *   **Top Hole:** at `(13,23)` (North). Projects a Vertical Ray upwards: `(13,23)` to `(0,23)`.\n    *   **Top-Right Hole:** at `(13,25)` (North-East). Projects a Diagonal Ray NE: `(13,25), (12,26), (11,27), (10,28), (9,29)`.\n    *   **Bottom-Right Hole:** at `(16,25)` (South-East). Projects a Diagonal Ray SE: `(16,25), (17,26), (18,27), (19,28), (20,29)`.\n\n*   **Object 4 (Orange 7):**\n    *   **Right Hole:** at `(20,24)` (East). Projects a Horizontal Ray rightwards: `(20,24)` to `(20,28)`. (Blocked at `(20,29)`).\n    *   **Bottom-Right Hole:** at `(22,24)` (South-East). Projects a Diagonal Ray SE: `(22,24), (23,25), (24,26), (25,27), (26,28), (27,29)`.\n\n*   **Object 5 (Maroon 9):**\n    *   **Top Hole:** at `(24,2)` (North). Projects a Vertical Ray upwards: `(24,2)` to `(0,2)`.\n\n**3. Interaction Rules:**\n*   **Vertical Dominance:** Vertical rays act as solid pillars. Horizontal and diagonal rays stop when they hit a vertical ray.\n    *   **Red West vs Maroon North:** Red ray at `(5,3)` stops because `(5,2)` is occupied by the Maroon vertical ray.\n    *   **Yellow East vs Magenta North:** Yellow ray at Row 5 stops at Col 22 because `(5,23)` is occupied by the Magenta vertical ray.\n*   **Time-of-Arrival (Diagonal/Horizontal):** If rays collide, the one arriving first (or covering less distance) claims the cell.\n    *   **Magenta SE vs Orange East:** They converge at `(20,29)`. Magenta arrives at step 4, Orange at step 5. Magenta claims the cell. Orange stops at `(20,28)`.\n\n**output:**\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,7,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,7,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6\n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

For each direction where the adjacent cell is 8, the ray is extended step by step until it meets a non\u20118 in the original input or the grid boundary; original coloured cells are left unchanged, and later blocks may overwrite earlier rays on originally empty cells.\n\nApplying this to the test input, the 2\u00d72 blocks of colours 2, 4, 6, 7 and 9 generate vertical, horizontal and diagonal rays as per the rule, yielding the following output grid:\n\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "The transformation finds the 3\u2010walled 2\u00d72 \u201cframes\u201d and lets the interior color flow out through any gaps in the wall along straight lines. Each flow paints the gap and continues stepwise through background cells, stopping before other objects or another flow would be touched. Where flow paths would cross, both stop one step short so they never overlap. No further redirection is needed here, so the result is the original grid with those straight flow paths added.\n\nOutput grid:\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analyzing ARC Task and Developing a Solution Strategy**\n\nThe task involves understanding patterns in grids of integers, particularly objects with colored cores and borders, and predicting how they emit \"beams\" of color.  I start by observing that most of the grid is filled with the background color 8, and objects are small, self-contained structures with a core color and a green border.  The border isn't always complete, sometimes with missing corners or sides. The core is usually a 2x2 square.\n\nAfter examining the provided examples, I hypothesize that the direction of the \"beams\" is determined by gaps in the green border surrounding the core. Specifically, I'm thinking about how missing border sections (gaps) might correlate with the path of the beams. The basic pattern seems to be that if there is a gap, there is a beam of the color out of that edge.\n\nI analyze the objects in detail, examining their core and border.  I carefully trace the values in the grid, specifically looking for the presence or absence of green border pixels surrounding each core.  I also look at the outputs from the example to get how the beams will behave.\n\nI see that for Red (2), Magenta (6), Maroon (9), Orange (7) follow a simple rule: a gap in the side of a border will emit a beam in the straight direction, and a gap in a corner of the border will emit a diagonal beam. I get confirmation of that rule with a test input.\n\nThe main challenge arises with Blue (1) and sometimes Yellow (4) where the \"gap\" rule seems to break. Blue's output is consistently orthogonal (straight lines) even when it has the gaps to create diagonals. It looks like with Blue (1) it emits orthogonal beams, no matter what shape. Yellow is more complicated; sometimes it follows the standard rule, but sometimes not, which I think is because of an interaction between the gap and the core. The Yellow exceptions might be specific to each case.\n\nFor the new test, I will implement a step-by-step approach. First, I identify each object's core. Second, for each object, I carefully check the border pixels surrounding the core for gaps. A gap means background pixels where a green pixel should be present. Third, based on the gap configuration, I predict the beam direction, using the standard rule (Side Gaps = Straight, Corner Gaps = Diagonal). Fourth, I draw beams of the corresponding core color from each core. I will resolve conflicts by giving diagonal > vertical > horizontal. This standard model is designed to correctly predict the behavior of the objects in the test case.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation follows a specific logic based on the \"Green (3) Border\" surrounding the core colored objects.\n\n**Rules inferred:**\n1.  **Object Structure:** Objects consist of a 2x2 \"core\" of a specific color (e.g., Red 2, Maroon 9, Magenta 6, etc.) surrounded by a ring of Green (3) pixels.\n2.  **Beams:** The objects emit \"beams\" of their core color into the background (8).\n3.  **Emission Logic (The \"Gap\" Rule):**\n    *   The Green border acts as a container/blocker.\n    *   Where there is a **gap** (an 8 instead of a 3) in the border, a beam escapes.\n    *   **Side Gaps:** If a gap appears on the North, South, East, or West side of the border (directly adjacent to the core faces), the beam shoots **Straight** (Orthogonal) in that direction.\n    *   **Corner Gaps:** If a gap appears at the NE, NW, SE, or SW corner of the border (diagonally adjacent to the core), the beam shoots **Diagonal** in that direction.\n4.  **Exceptions/Nuances:**\n    *   In Example 1, Blue (1) corners produced straight lines, suggesting a rotation for that specific color/case, but the majority of evidence (Maroon, Red, Magenta, Orange, Yellow Ex 2/3) supports the Standard Model described above. The test case contains colors 2, 6, 7, 9, which all follow the Standard Model in the examples.\n    *   **Intersections:** When beams cross, one color overwrites the other. Based on Example 1, vertical beams tend to overwrite horizontal ones, and diagonal beams tend to overwrite orthogonal ones.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Red Object (2)** at Top-Left (Core Rows 5-6, Cols 4-5):\n    *   **Gap at Top Side (Left Pixel):** At `(4,4)` (Row 4, Col 4).\n        *   Action: **Shoot Straight UP**.\n        *   Path: `(4,4)` to `(0,4)`.\n    *   **Gap at Left Side (Top Pixel):** At `(5,3)` (Row 5, Col 3).\n        *   Action: **Shoot Straight LEFT**.\n        *   Path: `(5,3)` to `(5,0)`.\n\n2.  **Magenta Object (6)** at Middle-Right (Core Rows 14-15, Cols 22-23):\n    *   **Gap at Top Side (Left Pixel):** At `(13,22)`.\n        *   Action: **Shoot Straight UP**.\n        *   Path: `(13,22)` to `(0,22)`.\n    *   **Gap at Top-Right Corner:** At `(13,24)`.\n        *   Action: **Shoot Diagonal UP-RIGHT**.\n        *   Path: `(13,24), (12,25), (11,26), (10,27), (9,28), (8,29)`.\n\n3.  **Orange Object (7)** at Bottom-Right (Core Rows 20-21, Cols 22-23):\n    *   **Gap at Right Side (Top Pixel):** At `(20,24)`.\n        *   Action: **Shoot Straight RIGHT**.\n        *   Path: `(20,24)` to `(20,29)`.\n\n4.  **Maroon Object (9)** at Bottom-Left (Core Rows 25-26, Cols 1-2):\n    *   **Gap at Top Side (Right Pixel):** At `(24,2)`.\n        *   Action: **Shoot Straight UP**.\n        *   Path: `(24,2)` to `(0,2)`.\n\n**Intersections:**\n*   The **Red Left Beam** (Row 5) and **Maroon Up Beam** (Col 2) intersect at `(5,2)`.\n*   Following the precedence observed (Vertical usually overwrites Horizontal), the cell `(5,2)` will be **Maroon (9)**.\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\nI will take the input grid and fill in the calculated beam paths with the respective colors, handling the intersection at `(5,2)`.\n\n*   **Red (2) Up:** `(0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)`\n*   **Red (2) Left:** `(5,3), (5,1), (5,0)` (Note: `(5,2)` is Maroon).\n*   **Maroon (9) Up:** `(0,2)` down to `(24,2)` inclusive. This overwrites `(5,2)`.\n*   **Magenta (6) Up:** `(0,22)` down to `(13,22)` inclusive.\n*   **Magenta (6) Diag:** `(13,24)` to `(8,29)`.\n*   **Orange (7) Right:** `(20,24)` to `(20,29)`.\n\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Algorithm for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to crack this ARC puzzle. First, I need to understand what's going on with the inputs. It's a grid of numbers 0-9, and the background is always the most frequent number, usually 8. There are these square-ish \"objects\" with a central color and a green border (color 3).\n\nI start by looking at a bunch of examples and try to make some sense out of this. I focus on how the green border interacts with these object cores. It's clear that the direction lines get launched from an object is related to gaps in the green border.\n\nMy initial thought is that if there is a gap, then launch the corresponding line. But that is clearly not correct.\n\nI need to nail down the precise rule. It turns out that I have to think about the individual pixels of each object and check each direction for green pixels. I'm focusing on the pixels that are on the border of the 2x2 core.\n\nIf a cardinal direction (up, down, left, right) is *not* blocked by green, I launch a line in that direction. If a cardinal direction is blocked, but the diagonal is not, I launch a line diagonally. And if everything is blocked, no line.\n\nSo, the rule has two parts. I check the cardinal neighbors first. If both are blocked, I check the diagonal.\n\nSo, for each 2x2 core, I check all four of the \"outer\" pixels. For each pixel, if its outside neighbor is not green (and within bounds), then draw a line in that direction. If it is green, I check the corresponding corner. If the corner is not green, I draw a diagonal line.\n\nNow, let's make sure this works across a bunch of examples and it looks like it works. I test it with the more examples.\n\nNow, I'm ready to write a program to apply it to the problem. I need to get the objects and their green borders.\n\nNow, let's look at this test case the user has given me, it's a 30x30 grid.\n\nI analyze the test input and find all the cores. I have to trace through to make sure I am finding the core. So I do that for each core. Now I will build my line launcher for each object.\n\nI construct each line.\n\nI also have to manage intersections and overlapping. It looks like the most recent object overwrites.\n\nNow, I'm ready to produce the output. I will build an image one line and write it out. Now I can show the user the result.\n\nAfter double checking each row, the output should be right. The output is ready and I'm ready to provide the results to the user.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation follows a consistent set of rules involving \"emitters\" and \"blockers\".\n\n**The Logic:**\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Find all 2x2 squares of a uniform, non-background color (the \"core\"). These cores are typically surrounded by a border of green (`3`) pixels, but the border might have gaps or be completely missing in some directions.\n2.  **Evaluate Emission for Each Pixel:** For each of the four pixels in a 2x2 core, check its outward-facing neighbors to determine if a line should be drawn.\n    *   **Cardinal Check:** For each pixel, check the two primary cardinal directions pointing away from the center of the 2x2 core.\n        *   *Top-Left Pixel:* Check **Up** and **Left**.\n        *   *Top-Right Pixel:* Check **Up** and **Right**.\n        *   *Bottom-Left Pixel:* Check **Down** and **Left**.\n        *   *Bottom-Right Pixel:* Check **Down** and **Right**.\n        *   **Rule:** If a cardinal neighbor is **not** a green (`3`) pixel (it is usually background `8`), emit a line of the core's color in that direction.\n    *   **Diagonal Check:** If **both** cardinal neighbors for a specific pixel are green (`3`) (blocked), then check the diagonal neighbor in that corner's direction.\n        *   *Top-Left Pixel:* Check **Up-Left**.\n        *   *Top-Right Pixel:* Check **Up-Right**.\n        *   *Bottom-Left Pixel:* Check **Down-Left**.\n        *   *Bottom-Right Pixel:* Check **Down-Right**.\n        *   **Rule:** If the diagonal neighbor is **not** a green (`3`) pixel, emit a diagonal line of the core's color in that direction.\n3.  **Drawing Lines:**\n    *   Lines extend from the neighbor cell until they hit the edge of the grid.\n    *   Lines are drawn on top of the background.\n    *   Where lines intersect, the object that appears later (reading order Top-to-Bottom, Left-to-Right) or has a higher index seems to overwrite the previous one. Based on the logic derived, we will assume standard overwriting.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Red Object (Color 2)** at Rows 5-6, Cols 4-5.\n    *   **Top-Left (5,4):** Up (4,4) is `8` (Open) $\\rightarrow$ Draw **UP**.

            "Full raw LLM response": "### 1. Interpreting the examples\n\nFrom the four training pairs (and the sketch) I treated the structures as:\n\n* Background: color `8`.\n* Frames: color `3`, forming \u201ccages\u201d around 2\u00d72 inner blocks.\n* Inner blocks: colors such as `2,4,6,7,9,1` etc.\n\nThe visible behavior in the simpler examples (2 and 4) can be summarised as:\n\n1. For each 2\u00d72 inner block, look at all cells with color `8` that are immediately adjacent (4- or 8-neighbourhood) to at least one inner cell **and** also touch at least one frame cell `3`.  \n   These `8` cells are \u201cports\u201d where a wire of the inner colour can exit the frame.\n\n2. For each port, select a corresponding inner cell and a direction vector from inner cell to port:\n   * If there is a choice (several inner cells touching the same port), prefer a **cardinal** direction (N, S, E, W) over a diagonal one.\n   * Otherwise, take the single available direction.\n\n3. From the chosen inner cell, extend a straight ray in that direction:\n   * Recolour each background cell `8` along that line with the inner colour.\n   * Stop just **before** you would step outside the grid or onto a non\u2011`8` cell (frame, original inner cell of another object, or a wire drawn earlier).\n\n4. Process the islands one by one; already\u2011drawn wires act as obstacles for later ones.\n\nThis rule exactly reproduces the wiring behavior for examples 2 and 4, and gives a consistent interpretation for how rays are anchored in all examples; I then applied it to the test.\n\nFor the test grid there are five inner islands:\n\n* `2` at rows 5\u20136, cols 4\u20135\n* `4` at rows 5\u20136, cols 15\u201316\n* `6` at rows 15\u201316, cols 23\u201324\n* `7` at rows 21\u201322, cols 22\u201323\n* `9` at rows 26\u201327, cols 1\u20132\n\nBelow I describe how I applied the rule island by island.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Applying the rule to the test input\n\n#### 2.1 Island colour 2 (rows 5\u20136, cols 4\u20135)\n\nInner cells: (5,4), (5,5), (6,4), (6,5).\n\nPorts (8-cells touching both inner and a `3`):\n\n* (4,4) \u2014 above (5,4); direction from inner: up `(-1,0)`\n* (5,3) \u2014 left of (5,4); direction: left `(0,-1)`\n* (7,6) \u2014 diagonal from (6,5); direction: down-right `(1,1)`\n\nRays:\n\n* Up from (5,4): to (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4).\n* Left from (5,4): to (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (5,0).\n* Diagonal SE from (6,5):  \n  (7,6), (8,7), (9,8), (10,9), (11,10), (12,11), (13,12), (14,13), (15,14), (16,15), (17,16), (18,17), (19,18), (20,19), (21,20);  \n  stop before (22,21) which is a frame `3`.\n\nAll these cells were `8`, so they are recoloured to `2`.\n\n#### 2.2 Island colour 4 (rows 5\u20136, cols 15\u201316)\n\nInner cells: (5,15), (5,16), (6,15), (6,16).\n\nPorts:\n\n* (4,14) \u2014 diagonal from (5,15); dir `(-1,-1)`\n* (5,17) \u2014 right of (5,16); dir `(0,1)`\n* (7,15) \u2014 below (6,15); dir `(1,0)`\n\nRays:\n\n* NW from (5,15): (4,14), (3,13), (2,12), (1,11), (0,10).\n* East from (5,16): fills row 5 from col 17 through col 29.\n* South from (6,15): straight down column 15, but stopped when a non\u20118 was encountered:\n  * It runs from row 7 through row 15 at column 15.\n  * At row 16, column 15 is already occupied by the diagonal `2` wire; so the 4-wire stops at row 15.\n\nAll recoloured to `4`.\n\n#### 2.3 Island colour 6 (rows 15\u201316, cols 23\u201324)\n\nInner cells: (15,23), (15,24), (16,23), (16,24).\n\nPorts (cardinal ones preferred):\n\n* (14,23) \u2014 above (15,23); dir `(-1,0)`\n* (16,25) \u2014 right of (16,24); dir `(0,1)`\n* (17,25) \u2014 diagonal from (16,24); dir `(1,1)`\n\nRays:\n\n* Up from (15,23):\n  * Column 23: rows 14 down to 6.  \n    Stops at row 5 because (5,23) is already occupied by the horizontal `4` wire.\n* East from (16,24):\n  * Row 16, columns 25 to 29.\n* Diagonal SE from (16,24):\n  * (17,25), (18,26), (19,27), (20,28), (21,29).\n\nThese are coloured `6`.\n\n#### 2.4 Island colour 7 (rows 21\u201322, cols 22\u201323)\n\nInner cells: (21,22), (21,23), (22,22), (22,23).\n\nPorts:\n\n* (21,24) \u2014 right of (21,23); dir `(0,1)`\n* (23,24) \u2014 diagonal from (22,23); dir `(1,1)`\n\nRays:\n\n* East from (21,23):\n  * Row 21, columns 24\u201328.\n  * At column 29 there is already a `6` from the preceding island, so the ray stops at 28.\n* Diagonal SE from (22,23):\n  * (23,24), (24,25), (25,26), (26,27), (27,28), (28,29).\n\nThese cells are recoloured to `7`.\n\n#### 2.5 Island colour 9 (rows 26\u201327, cols 1\u20132)\n\nInner cells: (26,1), (26,2), (27,1), (27,2).\n\nPorts:\n\n* (25,2) \u2014 above (26,2); dir `(-1,0)`\n* (28,3) \u2014 diagonal from (27,2); dir `(1,1)`\n\nRays:\n\n* Up from (26,2):\n  * Column 2: rows 25 up to 6.  \n    Stops before row 5, column 2, because that cell is already `2` (from the left wire of the `2` island).\n* Diagonal SE from (27,2): (28,3), (29,4).\n\nAll recoloured to `9`.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Example 4: 2\u00d72 of `6` inside a ring of `3`.\n   - Example 2: 2\u00d72 of `4` inside `3`s.\n   - Example 3: cores of `2`, `4`, `7`.\n   - Example 1: cores of `9`, `1`, `4`, `6`.\n\n2. **Finding exits (gaps) around each object.**  \n   Around each 2\u00d72 core, consider the 4\u00d74 window that contains the core plus a one\u2011cell margin.  \n   Inside that window, cells of value `3` are the frame; cells of value `8` that are adjacent (in 8\u2011neighborhood) to at least one core cell are *gaps* where the frame is missing.\n\n   Example mappings:\n   - Example 4 (core `6`): 4\u00d74 pattern has `8` at positions above the top\u2011left, above the top\u2011right and below\u2011left; giving three gaps and thus three exits (up, up\u2011right, down\u2011left).\n   - Example 2 (core `4`): gaps above top\u2011right, to the right of bottom\u2011right, and below\u2011left of bottom\u2011left; exits go up, right, and down\u2011left.\n\n   Each gap is assigned to the adjacent core cell that touches it; if more than one core cell touches, prefer orthogonal adjacency over diagonal.\n\n3. **Drawing rays from each exit.**  \n   For every gap `g` attached to a core cell `c`:\n   - Let the direction vector `d = (dr, dc)` be `sign(g.r \u2212 c.r), sign(g.c \u2212 c.c)`; each component is in `{-1, 0, 1}`.\n   - Starting from the core cell `c`, step repeatedly by `d`:\n     - color every visited cell with the core color `X` **while** that cell is background `8` or already `X`;\n     - stop when stepping out of the grid or when the next cell is *not* `8`/`X` (i.e. you hit any existing structure).\n\n   Thus each gap produces a straight ray (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) of color `X` going away from the object.  \n   In Example 2 and 4 this exactly reproduces the three arms from the respective cores.  \n   In Example 1 and 3 the same rule applied to the different gap patterns gives the observed crosses and L\u2011shaped collections of straight rays.\n\n4. **Order of processing objects.**  \n   When two objects could send rays through the same background cell, we need an order so later rays see earlier rays as obstacles.  \n   Looking at Example 3, the `4`\u2011object\u2019s vertical ray blocks the `2`\u2011object\u2019s horizontal ray (which stops one cell before it would otherwise intersect), which is consistent if objects with *higher core color* are processed first.\n\n   So:\n   - Sort all objects by their core color in descending numeric order.\n   - Process them in that order, using the *current* grid as the obstacle map.\n\n5. **Apply to the test input.**\n\n   First detect all 2\u00d72 cores with surrounding `3`s:\n\n   - **Object E (color 9)** at rows 26\u201327, cols 1\u20132.\n   - **Object D (color 7)** at rows 20\u201321, cols 22\u201323.\n   - **Object C (color 6)** at rows 14\u201315, cols 23\u201324.\n   - **Object B (color 4)** at rows 5\u20136,  cols 15\u201316.\n   - **Object A (color 2)** at rows 5\u20136,  cols 4\u20135.\n\n   Process them in order: 9, 7, 6, 4, 2.\n\n   For each object we build its 4\u00d74 window, find 8\u2011valued neighbors of the core (gaps), assign each gap to the closest core cell (orth adjacency preferred), compute the direction, and then trace rays, stopping when we encounter any non\u20118 cell created earlier.\n\n   The resulting rays are:\n\n   - **Object 9 (E):**\n     - Gap above the top\u2011right core cell \u2192 vertical ray of `9` up column 2 from row 26 to row 0.\n     - Gap down\u2011right of the bottom\u2011right core cell \u2192 diagonal ray `9` from (27,2) \u2192 (28,3) \u2192 (29,4).\n\n   - **Object 7 (D):**\n     - Gap to right of the top\u2011right \u2192 horizontal ray `7` along row 20 from col 23 to 29.\n     - Gap down\u2011right of bottom\u2011right \u2192 diagonal ray `7` from (21,23) to (27,29).\n\n   - **Object 6 (C):**\n     - Gap above top\u2011left \u2192 vertical ray `6` up column 23 from row 14 to row 0.\n     - Gap above\u2011right of top\u2011right \u2192 diagonal NE ray `6` from (14,24) to (9,29).\n     - Gap down\u2011right of bottom\u2011right \u2192 diagonal SE ray `6` from (15,24) to (19,28), stopping before the `7` at (20,29).\n\n   - **Object 4 (B):**\n     - Gap up\u2011left of top\u2011left \u2192 diagonal NW ray `4` from (5,15) to (0,10).\n     - Gap to right of top\u2011right \u2192 horizontal ray `4` along row 5 from col 16 to col 22, stopping at col 22 because col 23 already holds `6`.\n     - Gap below top\u2011left (i.e. under bottom\u2011left) \u2192 vertical ray `4` down column 15 from row 6 to row 29.\n\n   - **Object 2 (A):**\n     - Gap above top\u2011left \u2192 vertical ray `2` up column 4 from row 5 to row 0.\n     - Gap left of top\u2011left \u2192 horizontal ray `2` along row 5 from col 4 leftwards, stopping at col 3 because col 2 is `9`.\n     - Gap down\u2011right of bottom\u2011right \u2192 diagonal SE ray `2` from (6,5) up to (11,10), stopping when it encounters the `3` of the central structure.\n\n   Overlaying these rays on the original grid yields the final output below.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n\nRow 0  \n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 1  \n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 2  \n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 3  \n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 4  \n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 5  \n8,8,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 6  \n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 7  \n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 9  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6  \n\nRow 10  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8  \n\nRow 11  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n\nRow 12  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n\nRow 13  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 14  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 15  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 16  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 17  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n\nRow 18  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n\nRow 19  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8  \n\nRow 20  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n\nRow 21  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 22  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 23  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 24  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8  \n\nRow 25  \n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8  \n\nRow 26  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8  \n\nRow 27  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7  \n\nRow 28  \n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 29  \n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

            "Full raw LLM response": "The transformation detects each \u201croom\u201d in the input: a 2\u00d72 block of a color different from 3 surrounded by a border of 3s with some missing border cells. For each missing border cell, a line of the room\u2019s interior color is drawn starting at that cell and extending straight outward (diagonally for a missing corner) until it reaches the grid edge or the next non\u20118 cell. Lines are drawn in order of the rooms\u2019 top\u2011left positions so that previously drawn lines block later ones.\n\nApplying this to the test grid yields the following output:\n\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

Rays fill empty (8) cells until the next step would go out of bounds or hit a non\u20118 cell, where they stop.\n\nApplying that to the test grid gives this output:\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The transformation treats each multicolor cluster as a \"ray emitter.\"\n*   The central colored pixel attempts to shoot rays in all 8 directions (cardinal and diagonal).\n*   Green pixels surrounding the center act as walls; rays are only produced in directions where the immediate 3x3 neighbor is **not** green.\n*   Resulting rays extend in straight lines to the grid edges, overlapping where they intersect.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**My approach to this ARC task is as follows:**\n\nI'm presented with an ARC problem involving grids of numbers representing colored cells, with the goal of producing output grids based on a set of rules derived from examples and hints. My initial thought process involves parsing the task requirements, identifying the input and output formats, and noting that the problem revolves around \"ray emitters\" within the grid. The examples are crucial to understanding the underlying logic.\n\nMy immediate focus is on the given hints, particularly the concept of a \"central colored pixel\" emitting rays, blocked by surrounding green pixels. I'll need to dissect these examples to grasp the specific structures and patterns in these grids. The task's core lies in determining how to interpret a colored blob as a ray emitter. I'll meticulously examine the inputs and outputs of the examples to find how the examples relate. I'm noting that there seems to be a special type of structure, possibly a cluster of pixels with a boundary, that acts as a ray emitter, and I'll carefully analyze the pixel relationships within these structures.\n\nI'm initially considering assuming a simplistic single central pixel that shoots rays, but I'm quickly led to re-evaluate the hints, and it becomes clear that a contiguous colored block likely forms a ray emitter, with an important consideration of the direction. The \"central pixel\" in the hint might be a simplification, so I'm investigating how multiple colored pixels might contribute to a combined ray emission, and I'm carefully analyzing the grid configurations around these colored areas.  I am re-reading the hint on \"not green,\" to see the ray generation is blocked by the wall's color.\n\nI'm considering a hypothesis: a structure of colored pixels surrounded by green pixels that act as walls, where each pixel within the structure examines its neighbors. The goal now is to understand the boundaries of ray emission. I'm testing the 3x3 window around the colored block with several examples to clarify any logical conflicts. This leads me to a hypothesis: Each colored pixel within the colored group checks neighbors outside the group, shooting a ray if there's no green, considering both cardinal and diagonal directions. I'm making several observations about the examples to confirm the hypothesis.\n\nI've tested with several examples, which show good validation of my current understanding, and the core rule has solidified: for a 2x2 block, consider a 3-direction corner, and for a 1x1 block, consider a full 8-direction ray emission.\n\nNow, my focus shifts to the test input. I'll scan the provided grid to find the colored clusters and surrounding wall pixels, carefully noting their positions and sizes. Based on the patterns found in the previous examples, I will be carefully creating the rays to draw. I'm making sure my previous assumptions remain consistent with the new test input.\n\nI am re-examining the hints, and also re-evaluating, by trying to understand how to apply the learned logic to the given test input. I will need to generate the rays for these clusters, keeping in mind the 2x2 and the general rule. The rays are going to be added to the grid.\n\nI've made a final check that the previous assumptions work with the test input and will create my output grid by starting with a copy of the given input grid, and I will place the generated rays in the grid. I'll then generate the final output in the required format. I'm checking to make sure I followed my own logic, which will give the final answer.\n\n\nTo solve this ARC task, we must identify the \"ray emitter\" structures in the grid and determine the rules for ray propagation based on the provided hints and solved examples.\n\n### Reasoning\n\n1.  **Identify Objects (Emitters):**\n    The grids contain distinct multicolor clusters. Analyzing the input data, these clusters are consistently **2x2 blocks of a single color**, surrounded by a \"ring\" of neighbor pixels. The ring consists of Green pixels (3), which act as **walls**, and other pixels (usually Black/8), which act as **openings**.\n\n2.  **Determine Emission Rules:**\n    By observing Example 2 and others, we can deduce a precise rule for how rays are emitted from a 2x2 cluster:\n    *   The 2x2 block has 4 pixels: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), and Bottom-Right (BR).\n    *   Each pixel in the block is responsible for checking the **3 neighbors** in its respective corner direction (Cardinal and Diagonal).\n        *   **TL Pixel:** Checks North, North-West, West.\n        *   **TR Pixel:** Checks North, North-East, East.\n        *   **BL Pixel:** Checks South, South-West, West.\n        *   **BR Pixel:** Checks South, South-East, East.\n    *   **Rule:** If a checked neighbor is **NOT Green (3)** (and not part of the cluster itself), it is considered an \"opening\". The cluster shoots a ray of its color in that direction.\n    *   **Trajectory:** Rays travel in a straight line from the emitter through the opening to the edge of the grid.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Test Input:**\n    The test input is a 30x30 grid. We scan for colored clusters (non-8, non-3) and apply the rules.\n\n    *   **Cluster A (Color 2 - Red):** Located at Rows 5-6, Cols 4-5.\n        *   **TL (5,4):** North (4,4) is 8 (Open) $\\rightarrow$ **Shoot Up**. West (5,3) is 8 (Open) $\\rightarrow$ **Shoot Left**.\n        *   **TR (5,5):** All corner neighbors are 3 (Walls).\n        *   **BL (6,4):** All corner neighbors are 3 (Walls).\n        *   **BR (6,5):** South-East (7,6) is 8 (Open) $\\rightarrow$ **Shoot SE**.\n        *   *Rays:* Up (Col 4), Left (Row 5), SE (Diagonal).\n\n    *   **Cluster B (Color 4 - Yellow):** Located at Rows 5-6, Cols 15-16.\n        *   **TL (5,15):** North-West (4,14) is 8 (Open) $\\rightarrow$ **Shoot NW**.\n        *   **TR (5,16):** East (5,17) is 8 (Open) $\\rightarrow$ **Shoot Right**.\n        *   **BL (6,15):** South (7,15) is 8 (Open) $\\rightarrow$ **Shoot Down**.\n        *   **BR (6,16):** All corner neighbors are 3 (Walls).\n        *   *Rays:* NW (Diagonal), Right (Row 5), Down (Col 15).\n\n    *   **Cluster C (Color 6 - Magenta):** Located at Rows 14-15, Cols 23-24.\n        *   **TL (14,23):** North (13,23) is 8 (Open) $\\rightarrow$ **Shoot Up**.\n        *   **TR (14,24):** North-East (13,25) is 8 (Open) $\\rightarrow$ **Shoot NE**.\n        *   **BL (15,23):** All corner neighbors are 3 (Walls).\n        *   **BR (15,24):** South-East (16,25) is 8 (Open) $\\rightarrow$ **Shoot SE**.\n        *   *Rays:* Up (Col 23), NE (Diagonal), SE (Diagonal).\n\n    *   **Cluster D (Color 7 - Orange):** Located at Rows 20-21, Cols 22-23.\n        *   **TL (20,22):** All corner neighbors are 3 (Walls).\n        *   **TR (20,23):** East (20,24) is 8 (Open) $\\rightarrow$ **Shoot Right**.\n        *   **BL (21,22):** All corner neighbors are 3 (Walls).\n        *   **BR (21,23):** South-East (22,24) is 8 (Open) $\\rightarrow$ **Shoot SE**.\n        *   *Rays:* Right (Row 20), SE (Diagonal).\n\n    *   **Cluster E (Color 9 - Maroon):** Located at Rows 25-26, Cols 1-2.\n        *   **TL (25,1):** All corner neighbors are 3 (Walls).\n        *   **TR (25,2):** North (24,2) is 8 (Open) $\\rightarrow$ **Shoot Up**.\n        *   **BL (26,1):** All corner neighbors are 3 (Walls).\n        *   **BR (26,2):** South-East (27,3) is 8 (Open) $\\rightarrow$ **Shoot SE**.\n        *   *Rays:* Up (Col 2), SE (Diagonal).\n\n4.  **Construct Output:**\n    We start with the input grid and overlay the calculated rays. Walls (3) and original clusters remain intact. Rays overwrite empty space (8).\n\n### Output Grid\n\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The transformation treats each multicolor cluster as a \"ray emitter.\"\n*   The central colored pixel attempts to shoot rays in all 8 directions (cardinal and diagonal).\n*   Green pixels surrounding the center act as walls; rays are only produced in directions where the immediate 3x3 neighbor is **not** green.\n*   Resulting rays extend in straight lines to the grid edges, overlapping where they intersect.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to identify each colored cluster (2x2 colored centers surrounded by green/3 borders), find the gaps in their green borders, and shoot rays from those gaps in the direction away from the center.\n\n**Identifying clusters and their gaps:**\n\n1. **Cluster 1 (color 2)** at rows 5-6, cols 4-5:\n   - Gap at (4,4): ray goes UP\n   - Gap at (5,3): ray goes LEFT  \n   - Gap at (7,6): ray goes DOWN-RIGHT diagonal\n\n2. **Cluster 2 (color 4)** at rows 5-6, cols 15-16:\n   - Gap at (4,14): ray goes UP-LEFT diagonal\n   - Gap at (5,17): ray goes RIGHT\n   - Gap at (7,15): ray goes DOWN\n\n3. **Cluster 3 (color 6)** at rows 14-15, cols 23-24:\n   - Gap at (13,23): ray goes UP\n   - Gap at (13,25): ray goes UP-RIGHT diagonal\n   - Gap at (16,25): ray goes DOWN-RIGHT diagonal\n\n4. **Cluster 4 (color 7)** at rows 20-21, cols 22-23:\n   - Gap at (20,24): ray goes RIGHT\n   - Gap at (22,24): ray goes DOWN-RIGHT diagonal\n\n5. **Cluster 5 (color 9)** at rows 25-26, cols 1-2:\n   - Gap at (24,2): ray goes UP\n   - Gap at (27,3): ray goes DOWN-RIGHT diagonal\n\nRays extend until hitting the grid edge, and stop before green pixels. When rays overlap, vertical/diagonal rays take precedence.\n\n```\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,2,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The transformation treats each multicolor cluster as a \"ray emitter.\"\n*   The central colored pixel attempts to shoot rays in all 8 directions (cardinal and diagonal).\n*   Green pixels surrounding the center act as walls; rays are only produced in directions where the immediate 3x3 neighbor is **not** green.\n*   Resulting rays extend in straight lines to the grid edges, overlapping where they intersect.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Detailed Solution and Thought Process for the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task based on examples, and my job is to interpret the rules and apply them to a test case.  I need to figure out how these abstract grids of numbers, representing colors, relate to each other in the input/output pairs. The initial request is to complete the task based on the provided examples, and provide an explanation of my thinking process, in the first person.\n\nFirst, I need to get a handle on the rules. From the problem description, I'm told this is an ARC task involving grids of numbers 0-9. The input is a grid of numbers, and I have to explain how to get the output. I'm given some hints: Multicolor clusters are like \"ray emitters\". Central colored pixel is the source, and a Green pixel boundary acts as a wall. Rays extend until they hit the grid edge. Overlapping is mentioned, but I'm unsure of the impact of the overlap.\n\nLet's begin by scrutinizing the first example.  I notice that the background is a constant color (8), which I'll call Teal. There seem to be three \"objects\" or clusters of other colors, and they appear to be some blocks surrounded by green (3). I need to determine the center of these objects. I'm told to find the \"central colored pixel\". I need to find the colors in the input, and understand the central structure.\n\nI begin by focusing on the first cluster. I'm examining rows and columns, looking for some pattern. The hint is \"The central colored pixel\". This implies the structure must be a 3x3 block, where the central pixel emits some rays. So, I must interpret the color in the cluster. If the center is composed of a 2x2 of the color 9, it is not just a central pixel.\n\nI see that the cluster 1 is composed of a block 2x2 of color 9 surrounded by the green 3s. There are several clusters of different colors in this example. I need to note the size and position of these blocks, and compare these with the output example. The block could be a 3x3, 4x4, 5x5... and surrounded by the Green (3).\n\nOkay, let's examine Cluster 1 in more detail. This could be 9s (Maroon). Surrounded by 3s (Green). Let's trace it row by row. This is not a classic 3x3 grid, but a 4x4. The \"central pixel\" hint isn't quite right, then. Or maybe it's just a simplification. Maybe I should consider the 2x2 center as a single entity, or that the hint is referring to a specific instance.\n\nI observe the pattern in the example. I focus on how the green 3s surrounding a center influence the output. I think the green 3s form walls around the color centers. Let's look at the hints again. \"The central colored pixel *attempts* to shoot rays in all 8 directions\". The 3s act as a barrier to those rays in certain directions. Maybe the central colored pixels are just \"lamps,\" and the green pixels are the \"walls\" of that lamp. The 2x2 blocks of center color and their surroundings of 3s appear to control ray output.\n\nFor example 1, if Green acts like a wall, it blocks the ray's output in those directions. Let's check with my theory. The ray is emitted only if the immediate neighbor isn't green. I'm going to revisit the data. Okay, cluster 1 seems to consist of a 2x2 blocks of 9 (Maroon), and that block has walls (3s) surrounding them. These boundaries are: Green, at the top, bottom, and left and right sides. I trace the output and confirm that this is true.\n\nI reexamine the structure, thinking I may have missed something. The clusters may not always have 2x2 central blocks. I must adjust my thinking. Let's confirm my hypothesis with additional examples.\n\nWith example 4, the test cluster is a different size. The test cluster has a central pixel that is 6 (Magenta). It is composed of a 2x2 of that color. If the Green walls surround this block, it must be the case that a ray is emitted if the neighborhood isn't Green. Let's examine the data again. I can verify that for each 2x2 blocks, there is a direction which is not bounded by a Green, that the ray is emitted.\n\nLet's refine the ray logic. For every pixel 'P' in an inner color (non-8, non-3), I check 8 neighbors. If a neighbor is 3\n\nThe transformation rule is inferred as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify \"Lamps\":** Locate all 2x2 blocks of uniform color (excluding the background `8` and the wall color `3`). These are the light sources.\n2.  **Identify Openings:** For each 2x2 lamp, examine the 12 cells immediately surrounding it (the 8 neighbors adjacent to the sides and the 4 neighbors at the corners).\n    *   Green pixels (`3`) in these positions act as walls/shutters.\n    *   Any other value (typically background `8`) indicates an opening.\n3.  **Cast Rays:** From each opening, cast a ray of the lamp's color in the corresponding direction. The mapping is:\n    *   **Side Neighbors:**\n        *   Top-Left Neighbor -> Up\n        *   Top-Right Neighbor -> Up\n        *   Bottom-Left Neighbor -> Down\n        *   Bottom-Right Neighbor -> Down\n        *   Left-Top Neighbor -> Left\n        *   Left-Bottom Neighbor -> Left\n        *   Right-Top Neighbor -> Right\n        *   Right-Bottom Neighbor -> Right\n    *   **Corner Neighbors:**\n        *   Top-Left Corner -> Diagonal Up-Left (NW)\n        *   Top-Right Corner -> Diagonal Up-Right (NE)\n        *   Bottom-Left Corner -> Diagonal Down-Left (SW)\n        *   Bottom-Right Corner -> Diagonal Down-Right (SE)\n4.  **Ray Propagation:** Rays travel in a straight line to the edge of the grid.\n5.  **Intersections:** Where rays intersect or overlap, the color of the ray from the cluster that appears later in a standard reading order (or has a higher numeric value) typically persists on top (e.g., Maroon `9` overwrites Yellow `4`).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Red Cluster (2)** [Rows 5-6, Cols 4-5]:\n    *   Openings at Top-Left (Up) and Left-Bottom (Left) and Bottom-Right Corner (SE).\n    *   Rays: Up from col 4; Left from row 5; SE diagonal starting (7,6).\n\n*   **Yellow Cluster (4)** [Rows 5-6, Cols 15-16]:\n    *   Openings at Bottom-Left (Down), Right-Top (Right), Top-Left Corner (NW), Top-Right Corner (NE), Bottom-Left Corner (SW).\n    *   Rays: Down from col 15; Right from row 5; NW diagonal from (4,14); NE diagonal from (4,17); SW diagonal from (7,14).\n\n*   **Magenta Cluster (6)** [Rows 14-15, Cols 23-24]:\n    *   Openings at Top-Left (Up), Top-Right Corner (NE), Bottom-Right Corner (SE).\n    *   Rays: Up from col 23; NE diagonal from (13,25); SE diagonal from (16,25).\n\n*   **Orange Cluster (7)** [Rows 20-21, Cols 23-24]:\n    *   Openings at Right-Top (Right), Top-Right Corner (NE), Bottom-Right Corner (SE).\n    *   Rays: Right from row 20; NE diagonal from (19,25); SE diagonal from (22,25).\n\n*   **Maroon Cluster (9)** [Rows 25-26, Cols 2-3]:\n    *   Openings at Top-Left (Up), Top-Right Corner (NE), Bottom-Right Corner (SE).\n    *   Rays: Up from col 2; NE diagonal from (24,4); SE diagonal from (27,4).\n\n**Notable Intersections:**\n*   (11,10): Yellow SW crosses Red SE. Result `4`.\n*   (13,15): Maroon NE crosses Yellow Down. Result `9`.\n*   (5,23): Maroon NE, Yellow Right, and Magenta Up intersect. Result `9`.\n*   (20,29): Orange Right crosses Magenta SE. Result `7`.\n\noutput:\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,9,8\n2,2,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,8,4,4,4,4,4,9,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,4,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,4,8,27,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,4,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,9,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,7,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,7,3,7,7,8,8,7,8,8,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,7,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,3,3,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The transformation treats each multicolor cluster as a \"ray emitter.\"\n*   The central colored pixel attempts to shoot rays in all 8 directions (cardinal and diagonal).\n*   Green pixels surrounding the center act as walls; rays are only produced in directions where the immediate 3x3 neighbor is **not** green.\n*   Resulting rays extend in straight lines to the grid edges, overlapping where they intersect.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The transformation treats each multicolor cluster as a \"ray emitter.\"\n*   The central colored pixel attempts to shoot rays in all 8 directions (cardinal and diagonal).\n*   Green pixels surrounding the center act as walls; rays are only produced in directions where the immediate 3x3 neighbor is **not** green.\n*   Resulting rays extend in straight lines to the grid edges, overlapping where they intersect.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**High\u2011level description of the rule**\n\nFrom the examples (and the given hints), the intended transformation can be summarized like this:\n\n1. **Find multicolor \u201cemitter\u201d clusters**  \n   Each cluster consists of:\n   - A ring / frame of **green** pixels (color `3`), and  \n   - A compact inner block of some **non\u2011green color** `K` (e.g., `2`, `4`, `6`, `7`, `9`).\n\n2. **Choose a single central pixel for each cluster**  \n   In all the given examples (and in the test), the inner block is a 2\u00d72 square of color `K`.  \n   For such a 2\u00d72 block located at rows `r..r+1`, cols `c..c+1`, we pick the **bottom\u2011left** cell `(r+1, c)` as the **center**.\n\n3. **Determine \u201copen\u201d directions based on immediate neighbors**  \n   From the center we look at its 8 neighbors (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW).  \n   - If the neighbor in a direction is **green (`3`)**, that direction is **blocked**: no ray is fired there.  \n   - If it is **not green**, the direction is **open** and a ray is fired.\n\n4. **Cast rays in open directions**  \n   For each open direction, starting from the neighbor cell and stepping one cell at a time:\n   - Stop when you step **off the grid** or onto a **green (`3`)** cell.  \n   - Along the way, any cell that is background (`8`) is recolored to the emitter color `K`.  \n   - Cells that are already non\u20118 (including other colors of the cluster) are left as they are and do not stop the ray (only `3` acts as a wall).\n\n5. **Overlay multiple clusters**  \n   Apply the above for each emitter cluster; their rays are overlaid on the original grid.  \n   (In this test, the rays from different clusters do not conflict in color at any cell under this rule.)\n\n---\n\n## Applying the rule to the test grid\n\nIn the test grid there are five multicolor clusters:\n\n1. **Cluster of color 2** (top\u2011left), with inner 2\u00d72 block at rows 5\u20136, cols 4\u20135  \n   - Inner block (2\u00d72 of `2`s):  \n     `(5,4), (5,5), (6,4), (6,5)`  \n   - **Center**: bottom\u2011left = `(6,4)` with color `2`.  \n   - Neighbors of `(6,4)`:\n     - N `(5,4) = 2` \u2192 open\n     - NE `(5,5) = 2` \u2192 open\n     - E `(6,5) = 2` \u2192 open\n     - SE `(7,5) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n     - S `(7,4) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n     - SW `(7,3) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n     - W `(6,3) = 3` \u2192 blocked\n     -

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The transformation treats each multicolor cluster as a \"ray emitter.\"\n*   The central colored pixel attempts to shoot rays in all 8 directions (cardinal and diagonal).\n*   Green pixels surrounding the center act as walls; rays are only produced in directions where the immediate 3x3 neighbor is **not** green.\n*   Resulting rays extend in straight lines to the grid edges, overlapping where they intersect.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Below I\u2019ll first describe the rule I\u2019ve applied (based on the hints) and how I applied it to the test grid, then I\u2019ll give the final output grid.\n\n---\n\n## Transformation I used\n\n1. **Background and walls**\n   - Background color is `8`.\n   - The \u201cgreen\u201d wall color is `3`. These are not overwritten and also block rays.\n\n2. **Emitters**\n   - Every cell whose color is **not** `3` or `8` (i.e. colors `2,4,6,7,9` in this task) acts as a \u201cray emitter\u201d.\n\n3. **Direction gating by neighbors**\n   - For each emitter cell at position `(r,c)` and for each of the 8 directions  \n     `(-1,0), (-1,1), (0,1), (1,1), (1,0), (1,-1), (0,-1), (-1,-1)`:\n     - Look at the **immediate neighbor** in that direction: `(r+dr, c+dc)`.\n     - If this neighbor is color `3` or is outside the grid, **do not** shoot a ray in that direction.\n     - Otherwise, this direction is **open**.\n\n4. **Ray propagation**\n   - For each **open** direction from an emitter:\n     - Start from the neighbor cell `(r+dr, c+dc)` (the first step away from the emitter).\n     - Move step by step in that direction while inside the grid:\n       - If the current cell is color `3`, **stop** and do not recolor that cell.\n       - Otherwise recolor that cell with the emitter\u2019s color.\n       - Continue until you hit a `3` or go out of bounds.\n   - Rays can pass over any colors except `3`. When rays from different emitters meet, the color from the **later-processed** emitter overwrites the previous one.  \n     - I processed emitters in color order: all `2`s, then all `4`s, then `6`s, then `7`s, then `9`s (so `9` overwrites everything else, `7` overwrites `6,4,2`, etc.).\n\n5. **Result**\n   - The final grid is the original grid with all ray-painted cells applied under the above rules.\n\nUsing this rule:\n- The 2\u00d72 blocks of `2`, `4`, `6`, `7`, `9` act as groups of emitters.\n- Each individual cell in those blocks casts rays in every direction whose immediate neighbor is not `3`, until blocked by the next `3` or the border.\n- The union of all those rays (with the precedence order described) gives the final colored pattern below.\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\nHere is the completed transformed grid for the test input:\n\n2,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8  \n8,2,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8  \n2,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,2,9,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,9,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n2,2,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4  \n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,9,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,9,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,4,8,9,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,4,9,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,9,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,9,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,4,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,6  \n8,4,9,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n4,8,9,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8  \n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8  \n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8  \n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7  \n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The transformation treats each multicolor cluster as a \"ray emitter.\"\n*   The central colored pixel attempts to shoot rays in all 8 directions (cardinal and diagonal).\n*   Green pixels surrounding the center act as walls; rays are only produced in directions where the immediate 3x3 neighbor is **not** green.\n*   Resulting rays extend in straight lines to the grid edges, overlapping where they intersect.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "The task can be solved by treating every small 2\u00d72 \u201ccore\u201d of a non\u2011green colour that is surrounded by green 3\u2019s as a ray emitter. For each emitter work on the four sides and the two diagonals: look at the border cells immediately adjacent to the 2\u00d72 block. If a border cell on a particular side or corner is not green, that opening allows a ray. Side openings produce horizontal or vertical rays along the row or column of the interior cell adjacent to that opening; corner openings produce diagonal rays along the diagonal through the block in that direction. The ray colour is the emitter colour and it is painted through the background out to the edge, leaving any non\u2011background cell (greens or other colours) unchanged. Combining all the rays from all emitters on the input produces the following output grid:\n\n```\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The transformation treats each multicolor cluster as a \"ray emitter.\"\n*   The central colored pixel attempts to shoot rays in all 8 directions (cardinal and diagonal).\n*   Green pixels surrounding the center act as walls; rays are only produced in directions where the immediate 3x3 neighbor is **not** green.\n*   Resulting rays extend in straight lines to the grid edges, overlapping where they intersect.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

Rays travel in straight lines until they either hit a green cell or the edge of the grid, colouring intervening cells with the emitter\u2019s colour.\n\nApplying this to all the clusters in the test grid produces the following output:\n\n```\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,7,8\n8,8,9,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,7,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,7,6,8,8\n8,8,9,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,7,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,6\n8,4,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n4,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n\n",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**My analysis reveals a fascinating visual transformation rule: a ray-casting simulation with locally defined \"walls.\"**\n\nThe core of this problem lies in understanding how small, colored structures with surrounding green pixels are transformed. Each colored pixel acts as a source, attempting to emit rays in all eight directions \u2013 north, northeast, east, and so on. However, the green pixels serve as blockers; they are \"walls\" that prevent a ray from being emitted in that direction. Specifically, a ray will only shoot if the immediate neighboring pixel in a given direction is not green.\n\nThese rays extend in straight lines, reaching the edges of the grid. Where these lines intersect, the colors are merged, often resulting in a checkered pattern or a simple overlay, preserving the original green pixel configuration.\n\nIn essence, the system is about local geometry: the emitted rays' paths, are entirely governed by the immediate 3x3 pixel neighborhood around the source color. The colored source, shooting rays through the open regions in the surrounding green wall, that continues until the edges of the grid. The green pixels, and the central colored pixel, remain unchanged in the transformation.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided image, here are the generalizable insights:\n\n## **1. Describe the observable structures**\n*   **Objects**: The input grids contain small, isolated 3x3 structures. Each structure has a central \"core\" pixel of a unique color (maroon, blue, yellow, red, orange, magenta) surrounded by a pattern of **green** pixels.\n*   **Background**: The background is a uniform light blue.\n*   **Changes**: In the outputs, straight lines of the same color as the core extend outwards from these structures.\n*   **Pattern**: The lines extend to the edges of the grid. Where lines of different colors meet, they cross over each other (creating a checkered intersection). The original green pixels remain in place.\n\n## **2. Identify transformation categories**\n*   **Object movement**: Absent.\n*   **Object recoloring**: Absent.\n*   **Bordering / outlining**: Absent.\n*   **Filling holes or cavities**: Absent.\n*   **Copying / pasting / repositioning**: Absent.\n*   **Extension / Projection**: **Present**. Rays are projected from the centers.\n*   **Local window logic**: **Present**. The rules for projection are defined by the immediate neighbors.\n\n## **3. Extract the key non-obvious insights**\n*   **The Green Mask**: The green pixels are not just decoration; they act as \"blockers\" or \"shutters.\"\n*   **Local 3x3 Logic**: The decision to draw a line is made by looking only at the 8 neighbors of the central colored pixel.\n*   **8-Way Connectivity**: The transformation considers all 8 directions: Up, Down, Left, Right, and the four Diagonals.\n*   **The Rule of Emission**: A line is drawn in a specific direction if and only if the immediate neighbor in that direction is **empty** (background). If the neighbor is green, the line is blocked.\n    *   *Example*: In Input 1 (top left), the maroon center is surrounded by green pixels at N, S, E, W. Consequently, lines are only drawn in the diagonal directions (NW, NE, SW, SE).\n    *   *Example*: In Input 1 (top right), the yellow center has green pixels on the Left and Right columns (including diagonals). Only N and S neighbors are open, so only a vertical line is drawn.\n*   **Intersection Behavior**: When lines cross, they do not stop. They create a mixed/patterned intersection, implying the lines are drawn \"on top\" of the background but \"under\" or \"mixed with\" each other.\n\n## **4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)**\nThe task interprets each 3x3 cluster as a signal source. The central pixel attempts to broadcast a beam of its own color in all 8 radial directions. The surrounding green pixels act as a physical barrier: if a green pixel exists in a specific direction immediately adjacent to the center, the beam is blocked. If the adjacent spot is clear (background), the beam extends in a straight line until it hits the grid edge.\n\n## **5. List checks you would perform when solving**\n*   **Neighborhood Check**: For every central pixel, verify the 3x3 grid around it. Correlate the presence of green pixels with the absence of lines in the output.\n*   **Diagonal Validation**: Specifically check if diagonal lines appear only when the *corner* neighbor is empty. (Contrast this with requiring both adjacent cardinals to be empty).\n*   **Priority/Layering**: Check intersection points to see if one color consistently overwrites another or if they checkerboard.\n*   **Green Persistence**: Confirm that the original green \"walls\" are never overwritten by the emitted lines.\n\n## **6. Summarize final insights**\n\nHINT_START\n*   The transformation treats each multicolor cluster as a \"ray emitter.\"\n*   The central colored pixel attempts to shoot rays in all 8 directions (cardinal and diagonal).\n*   Green pixels surrounding the center act as walls; rays are only produced in directions where the immediate 3x3 neighbor is **not** green.\n*   Resulting rays extend in straight lines to the grid edges, overlapping where they intersect.\nHINT_END",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1. Background: Uniform field of color 8.\n2. Composite Squares: 4x4 shapes with a 1-pixel border (typically color 3) and a variable 2x2 inner core (colors 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9).\n3. Linear/Scattered Elements: Lines and loose pixels in colors matching the square cores, extending across the grid.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nThe 4x4 composite squares act as emitters, projecting lines of their core color into the background. The projection pattern is unique to each core color:\n- **Red (2)**: Horizontal lines Left (from bottom) and Right (from top).\n- **Yellow (4)**: Vertical line Up, Horizontal line Inwards, and Diagonal line Down-Outwards.\n- **Magenta (6)**: Vertical line Up from the left border and a positive slope Diagonal (`/`) through the core.\n- **Orange (7)**: Horizontal line Left.\n- **Maroon (9)**: Diagonals extending Outwards and a full-height Vertical line adjacent to the square on the Inward side.\n- **Blue (1)**: A \"bent\" ray extending Diagonally Up-Left for 4 pixels, then vertically Up.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, let's break down this ARC problem. As an expert in this field, I'm thinking about how to dissect this. Here's my thought process:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Layout**: We've got a grid, mostly teal, with some interesting shapes inside. These shapes are the 'objects' we need to figure out how to manipulate.\n\n2.  **Define the Objects**:\n    *   **Background:** Always teal (8).\n    *   **Sources**: The key objects are 4x4 squares. The color inside the square will dictate the transformation. There is a border of color 3 (green) and the core color.\n    *   **Examples:** We've been given some examples with specific source colors: maroon, blue, yellow, and magenta.\n\n3.  **Find the Transformation Rule**: It looks like the core color 'projects' lines outwards. The given description sounds good, but let's check it against the data.\n\n4.  **Verify/Refine Rule**:\n\n    *   **Red (2):** The description says it shoots horizontal lines.\n        *   After carefully looking at Example 3 (Red), I can confirm that it works. The top core row shoots right, and the bottom row shoots left.\n    *   **Yellow (4):** The description is vague. It says vertical up, horizontal inwards, and diagonal down-outwards.\n        *   I've gone deep here. I've re-examined Example 2 and 3 and the logic of where the lines start.\n        *   My revised hypothesis is this:\n            *   Horizontal \"Inwards\" line: From either Top OR Bottom (depending where the square is) but towards the center.\n            *   Vertical: Right core column always (relative).\n            *   Diagonal: Down-Right.\n    *   **Magenta (6):** The description is correct.\n        *   Looks like diagonal `/` through the core and vertical lines up from the left core.\n    *   **Orange (7):** Horizontal left from the top core is all.\n    *   **Maroon (9):** Diagonals \"Outwards\" and vertical full-height line \"Inwards.\"\n    *   **Blue (1):** \"Bent ray\". This also looks good.\n\n5.  **Refine Rules and Interactions**: It all comes down to interactions:\n    *   **Red vs Yellow:** The issue is when these lines collide. After really thinking, my final guess is that red overwrites yellow, based on Ex 3.\n    *   We also need to know the rule about: Does a line end when it hits an obstacle?\n\n6.  **Apply and Construct the Test Input**: Okay, let's now make the solution for the specific example given.\n\n7.  **Draw Squares** (Borders 3, Cores). Keep them.\n\n8.  **Apply Transformations**:\n\n    *   Maroon (Bottom-Left): Vertical Line.\n    *   Red (Top-Left): Shoot 2s horizontally.\n    *   Yellow (Top-Right):\n        *   Horizontal: Shoot 4s (but Red overwrites).\n        *   Vertical, Diagonal.\n    *   Magenta (Middle-Right): Vertical, Diagonal.\n    *   Orange (Bottom-Right): Shoot 7s horizontally.\n9. **Address the Conflicts:**\n\n    *   Red over Yellow.\n    *   Yellow diagonal, where does it end.\n    *   Yellow vertical.\n\n10. **Write the code output for the pattern**:\n\nThis will need to be made into actual code to solve the challenge. But it gets me the right pattern.\n\nI understand all the rules and will get the right output pattern.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the examples and the provided description, here is the solution:\n\n**1. Object Identification:**\nThe input contains several 4x4 squares, each with a specific \"core\" color surrounded by a border of color 3 (green).\n*   **Maroon (9) Square:** Rows 25-28, Cols 0-3. (Bottom-Left)\n*   **Red (2) Square:** Rows 5-8, Cols 4-7. (Top-Left)\n*   **Yellow (4) Square:** Rows 5-8, Cols 14-17. (Top-Middle/Right)\n*   **Magenta (6) Square:** Rows 14-17, Cols 22-25. (Middle-Right)\n*   **Orange (7) Square:** Rows 20-23, Cols 21-24. (Bottom-Right)\n\n**2. Transformation Rules Application:**\nThe transformations involve projecting lines from these squares onto the background (color 8). Source squares occlude projected lines (lines do not overwrite cores, but may overwrite borders if emitting from there).\n\n*   **Maroon (9):** Projects a full-height vertical line on the \"inward\" side, with a gap of 1 or 2 pixels. Based on Example 1 (Square cols 3-6, Line col 8), the line is at `Right_Border + 2`.\n    *   Square Cols 0-3 -> Line at Col 5.\n    *   **Interaction:** The line passes through the Red Square (Cols 4-7). The Red Square is a source, so it blocks the line. The line appears in rows 0-4 and 9-29.\n\n*   **Red (2):**\n    *   **Top Core Row (Row 6):** Horizontal line to the **Right**.\n        *   Path: Cols 8-29.\n        *   **Interaction:** Hits the Yellow Square (Cols 14-17). The line overwrites the border at Col 14 but is blocked by the core at Cols 15-16. It does not continue past the solid object.\n    *   **Bottom Core Row (Row 7):** Horizontal line to the **Left**.\n        *   Path: Cols 0-3.\n        *   **Interaction:** Hits the Maroon Square (Cols 0-3). Blocked by the source. (No visible line).\n\n*   **Yellow (4):**\n    *   **Horizontal:** Inwards. For a Right-side square (or right of center), this is Left.\n        *   Top Core Row (Row 6).\n        *   **Interaction:** Conflicts with Red's line. Based on Example 3 where Red (2) appeared to overwrite Yellow (4), we prioritize the Red line filling the space between the squares.\n    *   **Vertical:** Upwards. Based on pattern, likely from the **Right Core Column** (Col 16).\n        *   Path: Rows 0-5.\n    *   **Diagonal:** Down-Outwards. For a top-right square, this is **Down-Right**.\n        *   Starts near bottom-right corner. Let's map from Ex 2/3. Ex 2 (Left) was Down-Left. Ex 3 (Right, Bottom) was Up-Right. The pattern is \"Outwards vertically and horizontally\". Since this is at the Top, it goes Down. Since Right, it goes Right.\n        *   Path: Starts (8,17). Goes `\\` (9,18), (10,19)...\n        *   **Interaction:** Hits Magenta Square (Cols 22-25, Rows 14-17) at (14,23). (14,23) is a border, becomes 4. (15,24) is core, remains 6. (16,25) is border, becomes 4.\n\n*   **Magenta (6):**\n    *   **Vertical:** Up from **Left Core Column** (Col 23).\n        *   Path: Rows 0-14.\n    *   **Diagonal:** `/` (Positive slope) through the core.\n        *   Center approx (15.5, 23.5).\n        *   Up-Right: (14,24), (13,25)...\n        *   Down-Left: (17,21), (18,20), (19,19)...\n\n*   **Orange (7):**\n    *   **Horizontal:** Left from **Top Core Row** (Row 21).\n        *   Path: Cols 0-20.\n        *   **Interaction:** Crosses Maroon Line (Col 5). Vertical lines typically occlude horizontal/diagonal lines (based on Ex 1 Blue vs Maroon). So (21,5) remains 9.\n        *   **Interaction:** Crosses Magenta Diagonal at (21,17). Horizontal (later) likely overwrites Diagonal. So (21,17) becomes 7.\n\n**3. Final Grid Construction:**\n*   **Background:** 8.\n*   **Sources:** Drawn on top.\n*   **Lines:** Drawn with occlusion logic (Sources > Vertical Lines > Horizontal Lines > Diagonals, roughly).\n\n**Output Grid:**\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,6,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,6,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,4,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,4\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1. Background: Uniform field of color 8.\n2. Composite Squares: 4x4 shapes with a 1-pixel border (typically color 3) and a variable 2x2 inner core (colors 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9).\n3. Linear/Scattered Elements: Lines and loose pixels in colors matching the square cores, extending across the grid.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nThe 4x4 composite squares act as emitters, projecting lines of their core color into the background. The projection pattern is unique to each core color:\n- **Red (2)**: Horizontal lines Left (from bottom) and Right (from top).\n- **Yellow (4)**: Vertical line Up, Horizontal line Inwards, and Diagonal line Down-Outwards.\n- **Magenta (6)**: Vertical line Up from the left border and a positive slope Diagonal (`/`) through the core.\n- **Orange (7)**: Horizontal line Left.\n- **Maroon (9)**: Diagonals extending Outwards and a full-height Vertical line adjacent to the square on the Inward side.\n- **Blue (1)**: A \"bent\" ray extending Diagonally Up-Left for 4 pixels, then vertically Up.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I can identify the transformation rules:\n\n1. Each 4x4 composite square with a colored 2x2 core acts as an \"emitter\"\n2. Lines project outward from gaps (where 8 appears instead of 3 in the border)\n3. Each core color has specific projection patterns based on the gap positions\n\nFor the test input, I identify 5 squares:\n- **Color 2** (rows 4-7, cols 3-6): gaps at (4,4), (5,3), (7,6)\n- **Color 4** (rows 4-7, cols 14-17): gaps at (4,14), (5,17), (7,15)  \n- **Color 6** (rows 13-16, cols 22-25): gaps at (13,23), (13,25), (16,25)\n- **Color 7** (rows 19-22, cols 21-24): gaps at (20,24), (22,24)\n- **Color 9** (rows 24-27, cols 0-3): gaps at (24,2), (27,3)\n\nApplying the color-specific rules:\n- **Color 2**: Horizontal line left from (5,3) and right from (7,6)\n- **Color 4**: Vertical up from (4,14), horizontal left from (5,17), diagonal down-right from (7,15)\n- **Color 6**: Vertical up at col 23, diagonal up-right from (13,25), diagonal down-left from (16,25)\n- **Color 7**: Horizontal left from (20,24)\n- **Color 9**: Vertical at col 4, diagonal up-right from (24,2), diagonal down-right from (27,3)\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,9,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,9,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,3,4,4,4,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,9,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,4,3,3,8,9,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,9,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,4,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,4,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,4,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,7,7,8,8,8,4,8\n8,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,4\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1. Background: Uniform field of color 8.\n2. Composite Squares: 4x4 shapes with a 1-pixel border (typically color 3) and a variable 2x2 inner core (colors 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9).\n3. Linear/Scattered Elements: Lines and loose pixels in colors matching the square cores, extending across the grid.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nThe 4x4 composite squares act as emitters, projecting lines of their core color into the background. The projection pattern is unique to each core color:\n- **Red (2)**: Horizontal lines Left (from bottom) and Right (from top).\n- **Yellow (4)**: Vertical line Up, Horizontal line Inwards, and Diagonal line Down-Outwards.\n- **Magenta (6)**: Vertical line Up from the left border and a positive slope Diagonal (`/`) through the core.\n- **Orange (7)**: Horizontal line Left.\n- **Maroon (9)**: Diagonals extending Outwards and a full-height Vertical line adjacent to the square on the Inward side.\n- **Blue (1)**: A \"bent\" ray extending Diagonally Up-Left for 4 pixels, then vertically Up.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning / reconstruction of the rule I applied**\n\n1. **Identify the emitters (2\u00d72 cores) inside 4\u00d74 \u201ccomposite squares\u201d.**\n\n   From the description and the examples, an emitter is a 2\u00d72 block of a non\u2011background, non\u2011border color inside a loose 3\u2011border. In the test grid these 2\u00d72 cores are:\n\n   - Red (2): rows 6\u20137, cols 5\u20136  \n   - Yellow (4): rows 6\u20137, cols 16\u201317  \n   - Magenta (6): rows 15\u201316, cols 24\u201325  \n   - Orange (7): rows 21\u201322, cols 23\u201324  \n   - Maroon (9): rows 26\u201327, cols 2\u20133  \n\n   Background is 8; 3 is used as border/structure and is not modified.\n\n2. **General projection conventions I used**\n\n   - Rays are cast only into the **background**: a cell is recolored only if its original value is 8.\n   - I treat rays from different emitters as if they are computed independently on the **original** grid. If several rays want to color the same 8\u2011cell, I conceptually could break ties (e.g. by color priority), but in this test configuration there is only one conflict (between colors 2 and 6) which I resolve explicitly below.\n   - Rays do **not overwrite non\u20118** cells and do **not pass through them**: when stepping along a ray, if the next cell is non\u20118 in the original grid, I stop the ray before that cell (I may \u201cskip\u201d over 3\u2011border cells in some patterns only where stated, but I never recolor them).\n\n3. **Concrete ray patterns per color (as I applied them here)**\n\n   I used the textual description as the template, simplified slightly where examples allowed ambiguity:\n\n   **(a) Red (2): horizontal from top and bottom**\n\n   Emitter: top-left `(r,c) = (6,5)` (so core at rows 6\u20137, cols 5\u20136).\n\n   - **Top row (row 6) \u2013 rightward ray:**\n\n     From the top\u2011right core cell (6,6), go right across row 6, *ignoring* any non\u20118 cells but only recoloring 8\u2019s:\n\n     - Original row 6 has a 3 at col 7, then 8\u2019s from cols 8\u201330.\n     - So new 2\u2019s at: row 6, cols 8\u201330.\n\n   - **Bottom row (row 7) \u2013 leftward ray:**\n\n     From the bottom\u2011left core cell (7,5), go left across row 7, similarly recoloring only 8\u2019s:\n\n     - At col 4 there is a 3 (border), so I skip it and continue.\n     - Cols 3,2,1 are 8\u2019s and become 2.\n\n     New 2\u2019s at: row 7, cols 1\u20133.\n\n   (No diagonal ray for 2 in this test; I restrict 2 to the horizontal pattern.)\n\n   **(b) Yellow (4): vertical up + horizontal inwards + diagonal down\u2011outwards**\n\n   Emitter: core at rows 6\u20137, cols 16\u201317 (top-left `(r,c) = (6,16)`).\n\n   The textual pattern says: vertical up, horizontal inwards and a diagonal down\u2011outwards. In the test grid the 4\u2011core is tightly enclosed by 3\u2019s on its \u201cinward\u201d side so every potential ray is immediately blocked by non\u20118 cells:\n\n   - Vertical from top\u2011right (6,17) upwards hits a 3 at (5,17) right away \u2192 **no vertical 4s**.\n   - Horizontal inwards (towards the center of the grid) from row 7 meets a 3 at (7,15) on the first step \u2192 **no horizontal 4s**.\n   - Diagonal down\u2011outwards from (6,17) first steps into (7,18) which is 3 \u2192 **no diagonal 4s**.\n\n   So in this test, the yellow emitter produces **no additional 4s beyond the 2\u00d72 core**.\n\n   **(c) Magenta (6): vertical up from left border + \u201c/\u201d diagonal through core**\n\n   Emitter: core at rows 15\u201316, cols 24\u201325 (top-left `(r,c) = (15,24)`).\n\n   - **Vertical up from the left border:**\n\n     From the top\u2011left core cell (15,24) step upwards in column 24, recoloring 8\u2019s until the top:\n\n     Original column 24 rows 1\u201314 are all 8.\n\n     \u2192 New 6\u2019s at: (1\u201314, 24).\n\n   - **Positive\u2011slope (`/`) diagonal through the core:**\n\n     Implemented as:\n     - from the top\u2011right core cell (15,25) step up\u2011right (\u22121,+1) until boundary or blocked,\n     - from the bottom\u2011left core cell (16,24) step down\u2011left (+1,\u22121).\n\n     Up\u2011right from (15,25): all intermediate cells are 8 until the edge:\n     - (14,26), (13,27), (12,28), (11,29), (10,30) \u2192 all become 6.\n\n     Down\u2011left from (16,24): the first cell (17,23) is a 3 (part of the 3\u2011structure) so that branch is blocked, producing no new 6\u2019s there.\n\n   So 6 introduces:\n   - Column\u201124 vertical 6\u2019s at rows 1\u201314;\n   - Diagonal 6\u2019s at (14,26), (13,27), (12,28), (11,29), (10,30).\n\n   Note that at (6,24) this vertical 6 ray collides with the red 2\u2019s horizontal ray; since both would recolor an 8, I choose the higher \u201cintensity\u201d 6 to win there.\n\n   **(d) Orange (7): horizontal left**\n\n   Emitter: core at rows 21\u201322, cols 23\u201324 (top-left `(r,c) = (21,23)`).\n\n   The rule is: from the top row of the 7\u2011core cast a horizontal line to the left, stopping at non\u20118.\n\n   - From (21,23) leftwards:\n     - (21,22) is 3 (border) immediately, so the ray is blocked.\n\n   Thus no new 7\u2019s beyond the 2\u00d72 core in this test.\n\n   **(e) Maroon (9): diagonals + inward vertical**\n\n   Emitter: core at rows 26\u201327, cols 2\u20133 (top-left `(r,c) = (26,2)`).\n\n   I treated it as:\n\n   - **Vertical line on the inward side:**\n\n     The grid is 30\u00d730, center column is 15.5; the emitter\u2019s center column is 2.5, so \u201cinward\u201d is to the right.\n\n     I approximate \u201cadjacent inward\u201d as the column just to the right of the whole 4\u00d74 composite square. The 4\u00d74 span is cols 1\u20134, so the inward\u2011adjacent column is col 5. I draw a full\u2011height vertical 9 line there, recoloring every original 8 in column 5:\n\n     - Column 5 has non\u20118 (2 or 3) at rows 6,7,8; all other rows have 8.\n     - So new 9\u2019s at column 5 for rows: 1\u20135 and 9\u201330.\n\n   - **Outward diagonals from the outer corners of the 4\u00d74:**\n\n     Bounding 4\u00d74 rows = 25\u201328, cols = 1\u20134; corners:\n\n     - TL = (25,1): already 3 \u2192 no change.\n     - TR = (25,4): stepping up\u2011right immediately hits a 3 at (25,4) or is blocked by that same corner being non\u20118 \u2192 no new 9\u2019s.\n     - BL = (28,1): 3 \u2192 no change.\n     - BR = (28,4): 8, and we step down\u2011right:\n\n       - (28,4) (corner itself) 8\u21929  \n       - (29,5) 8\u21929  \n       - (30,6) 8\u21929  \n\n       Next step is out of bounds.\n\n     So diagonals add 9\u2019s at (28,4), (29,5) and (30,6); (29,5) happens also to lie on the vertical 9 line, but it\u2019s the same color anyway.\n\n4. **Apply all modifications and resolve the one overlap**\n\n   Starting from the original grid, I apply:\n\n   - All the red 2 projections (row 6 col 8\u201330, row 7 col 1\u20133);\n   - All magenta 6 projections (column 24 rows 1\u201314, plus the diagonal cells);\n   - All maroon 9 projections (column 5 except at rows 6\u20138, and the three diagonal cells);\n   - Yellow 4 and orange 7 emitters add no extra cells in this test because they\u2019re fully blocked by 3\u2019s in every projected direction.\n\n   The only shared target is (6,24), where both 2 and 6 want to recolor an 8; I let the 6 win there, so that cell is 6.\n\n   Everywhere else, each modified cell is touched by exactly one emitter.\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\nHere is the resulting 30\u00d730 grid after applying the above rules:\n\nRow 1:\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 2:\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 3:\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 4:\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 5:\n8,8,8,3,9,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 6:\n8,8,8,8,2,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,6,2,2,2,2,2,2\n\nRow 7:\n2,2,2,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 8:\n8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 9:\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 10:\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n\nRow 11:\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n\nRow 12:\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n\nRow 13:\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n\nRow 14:\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 15:\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 16:\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 17:\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 18:\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 19:\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 20:\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 21:\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 22:\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 23:\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 24:\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 25:\n3,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 26:\n3,9,9,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 27:\n3,9,9,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 28:\n3,3,3,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 29:\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 30:\n8,8,8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n1. Background: Uniform field of color 8.\n2. Composite Squares: 4x4 shapes with a 1-pixel border (typically color 3) and a variable 2x2 inner core (colors 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9).\n3. Linear/Scattered Elements: Lines and loose pixels in colors matching the square cores, extending across the grid.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nThe 4x4 composite squares act as emitters, projecting lines of their core color into the background. The projection pattern is unique to each core color:\n- **Red (2)**: Horizontal lines Left (from bottom) and Right (from top).\n- **Yellow (4)**: Vertical line Up, Horizontal line Inwards, and Diagonal line Down-Outwards.\n- **Magenta (6)**: Vertical line Up from the left border and a positive slope Diagonal (`/`) through the core.\n- **Orange (7)**: Horizontal line Left.\n- **Maroon (9)**: Diagonals extending Outwards and a full-height Vertical line adjacent to the square on the Inward side.\n- **Blue (1)**: A \"bent\" ray extending Diagonally Up-Left for 4 pixels, then vertically Up.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Based on the solved examples, each 2\u00d72 colored core within a 3\u2011bordered 4\u00d74 square emits straight lines of its core color into the 8\u2011colored background. For the test case there are squares with cores 2, 4, 6, 7 and 9.

                "response": "**Thought Process Summary for Grid Object Analysis**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a bunch of grids filled with colored pixels. The goal is to describe the *types* of things I see, not how they relate or any clever rules. Let's see...\n\nFirst thing I'm noticing is the background. Looks like color 8 is everywhere, so that's the obvious base. Now, looking for \"objects\"... there are these distinct, box-like shapes, usually with a frame and an inside.\n\nI'm scanning through the grids, taking notes.  Ah, I'm spotting a pattern here! These \"boxes\" are usually about 4x4 pixels, with a border of color 3. Inside the border is a smaller 2x2 area, filled with a different color.  Okay, the inner colors vary. I'm seeing 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9.  But wait, sometimes there are lines or scattered pixels of these inner colors too, maybe overlapping the boxes.  I'm calling these \"noise\" or \"lines\".\n\nGrid 4 is a bit messy, but even in that one, there are still recognizable boxes with borders and interiors, although a few of them might have the frame of color 9.\n\nSo, in summary, the main things I see are:\n\n*   **A background of color 8.**\n*   **\"Boxes\" (Composite Squares):** About 4x4, with a border (color 3, usually, sometimes 9 in the messy grids) and a 2x2 inner fill (color 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, or 9).\n*   **\"Lines/Noise\":** Linear or scattered pixel arrangements, the color matches the interior of the \"Boxes\".\n    \nThat's the basic description. Let's make it concise, while removing any inferences!\n\n\nBased on the provided grids, the objects can be categorized into three main types based on their structure, attributes, and arrangement.\n\n**1. The Background Field**\n*   **Attribute:** The entire visual space is defined by a uniform background of **color 8**. All other objects exist on top of or within this field.\n\n**2. Composite Square Objects**\n*   **Structure:** These are distinct, multi-colored square shapes, typically measuring 4x4 pixels in total size.\n*   **Components:**\n    *   **The Border/Frame:** The outer perimeter of the square is a 1-pixel wide frame. This frame is predominantly **color 3**, though in specific instances (specifically in messy or noisy regions), the corners or edges might vary or appear fragmented.\n    *   **The Core/Interior:** Encapsulated within the border is a 2x2 solid block of pixels.\n*   **Variable Attributes:** While the border is usually color 3, the inner core varies in color.

Objects Description\n1. Background: Uniform field of color 8.\n2. Composite Squares: 4x4 shapes with a 1-pixel border (typically color 3) and a variable 2x2 inner core (colors 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9).\n3. Linear/Scattered Elements: Lines and loose pixels in colors matching the square cores, extending across the grid.",
                "response": "**Analysis of Grid Transformations**\n\nAs an expert in the field, I've been tasked with deciphering the rules that govern the transformations from input to output grids. The goal is to uncover the specific actions applied to the 4x4 squares, particularly how they generate these distinct \"rays\" of color. Let's delve into the patterns.\n\nIt seems that the background is color 8 in many cases. The primary object of interest is the square. It appears that the square's 2x2 colored inner core is the key to the transformation. These squares serve as the origin of the observed transformations.\n\nLet's break down how each square is processed into its \"ray\". These specific rules seem to hold:\n1.  **Red Squares (2)**: These squares cast two horizontal lines from their cores, one to the left from their bottom-left core pixel and one to the right from their top-right core pixel.\n2.  **Yellow Squares (4)**: These squares display a more complex \"star\" effect. A vertical line extends upward from the top-right core pixel. There's a diagonal line downwards to the left from the bottom-left pixel. A horizontal line extends to the center, which means the right side projects right and left side projects left.\n3.  **Magenta Squares (6)**: They have a vertical ray, extending upwards from the column that represents the square's left border. There is also a diagonal line that extends in the `/` direction, starting from the top-left pixel.\n4.  **Orange Squares (7)**: The primary transformation is a single horizontal ray, which stretches to the left, beginning from the top row of the inner core.\n5.  **Maroon Squares (9)**: The pattern here involves diagonal lines spreading outwards towards the nearest vertical edge. A single vertical line extends parallel to the square's center-facing edge.\n6.  **Blue Squares (1)**: The transformation includes a diagonal ray projecting up and to the left from the top-left pixel. This line has a characteristic \"bend\", where it gradually transitions into a straight vertical ray, occurring after traversing approximately four steps.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the input and output grids, the transformations involve the **Composite Squares** emitting \"rays\" or lines of color matching their inner 2x2 core. These rays extend across the background (color 8) and overwrite it. The direction and nature of these rays depend on the specific color of the square's core.\n\nHere are the identified transformations for each core color:\n\n1.  **Color 2 (Red) Squares**:\n    *   Generate a **horizontal line to the left** starting from the bottom-left pixel of the inner core.\n    *   Generate a **horizontal line to the right** starting from the top-right pixel of the inner core.\n\n2.  **Color 4 (Yellow) Squares**:\n    *   Generate a **vertical line upwards** starting from the top-right pixel of the inner core.\n    *   Generate a **diagonal line downwards and outwards** (towards the nearest vertical grid edge) starting from the bottom corner of the core closest to that edge (e.g., Down-Left if the square is on the left side).\n    *   Generate a **horizontal line inwards** (towards the vertical center of the grid). For a square on the left, this goes Right; for a square on the right, this goes Left.\n\n3.  **Color 6 (Magenta) Squares**:\n    *   Generate a **vertical line upwards** from the column corresponding to the square's left border.\n    *   Generate a **diagonal line** (specifically the `/` angle, bottom-left to top-right) passing through the top-left pixel of the inner core.\n\n4.  **Color 7 (Orange) Squares**:\n    *   Generate a **horizontal line to the left** originating from the top row of the inner core.\n\n5.  **Color 9 (Maroon) Squares**:\n    *   Generate **diagonal lines outwards** (towards the nearest vertical grid edge). One extends up-left/down-right, and the other down-left/up-right, effectively creating a 'V' shape pointing inwards or lines aimed at the border.\n    *   Generate a **vertical line** spanning the full height of the grid, located in the column immediately adjacent to the square on the side facing the grid center (Inwards).\n\n6.  **Color 1 (Blue) Squares**:\n    *   Generate a **diagonal line upwards and to the left** starting from the top-left pixel of the inner core. This line extends for 4 steps (reaching 4 columns to the left and 4 rows up) and then turns into a **vertical line upwards**.\n\n<transformation_summary>\nThe 4x4 composite squares act as emitters, projecting lines of their core color into the background. The projection pattern is unique to each core color:\n- **Red (2)**: Horizontal lines Left (from bottom) and Right (from top).\n- **Yellow (4)**: Vertical line Up, Horizontal line Inwards, and Diagonal line Down-Outwards.\n- **Magenta (6)**: Vertical line Up from the left border and a positive slope Diagonal (`/`) through the core.\n- **Orange (7)**: Horizontal line Left.\n- **Maroon (9)**: Diagonals extending Outwards and a full-height Vertical line adjacent to the square on the Inward side.\n- **Blue (1)**: A \"bent\" ray extending Diagonally Up-Left for 4 pixels, then vertically Up.\n</transformation_summary>",

Background: Uniform field of color 8.\n2. Composite Squares: 4x4 shapes with a 1-pixel border (typically color 3) and a variable 2x2 inner core (colors 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9).\n3. Linear/Scattered Elements: Lines and loose pixels in colors matching the square cores, extending across the grid.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nThe 4x4 composite squares act as emitters, projecting lines of their core color into the background. The projection pattern is unique to each core color:\n- **Red (2)**: Horizontal lines Left (from bottom) and Right (from top).\n- **Yellow (4)**: Vertical line Up, Horizontal line Inwards, and Diagonal line Down-Outwards.\n- **Magenta (6)**: Vertical line Up from the left border and a positive slope Diagonal (`/`) through the core.\n- **Orange (7)**: Horizontal line Left.\n- **Maroon (9)**: Diagonals extending Outwards and a full-height Vertical line adjacent to the square on the Inward side.\n- **Blue (1)**: A \"bent\" ray extending Diagonally Up-Left for 4 pixels, then vertically Up.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain two main object types against a color 8 background: (1) **framed rectangular structures** approximately 4x4 cells in size, featuring incomplete color 3 borders surrounding 2x2 interior regions filled with colors 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, or 9; and (2) **linear elements** (diagonal, horizontal, or vertical lines) using the same fill colors (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9) that extend across the grid. Color 3 is exclusively used for frame borders, while color 8 serves as the universal background.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n**Transformation Rules:**\n1. Identify framed structures (color 3 borders with colored interiors: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, or 9)\n2. Locate gaps in each frame (positions with background 8 instead of frame 3)\n3. For **edge gaps**: Fill gap with interior color and extend a perpendicular line away from interior (top\u2192up, bottom\u2192down, left\u2192left, right\u2192right)\n4. For **corner gaps**: Fill gap with interior color and extend a diagonal line away from interior (top-left\u2192up-left, top-right\u2192up-right, bottom-left\u2192down-left, bottom-right\u2192down-right)\n5. Lines continue to grid boundaries\n6. Original structure positions are preserved\n7. Background color 8 remains elsewhere unchanged\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analyzing and Solving the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, I've got this. The user wants me to solve an ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) task. I'll break this down methodically. First, I need to understand the rules. From the examples and the description, it's clear there are structures, most likely 4x4 squares, with a border (green, color 3) and a center (fill color). Crucially, there are \"gaps\" in these borders, where the background color (teal, color 8) is visible. The transformation involves filling those gaps with a line of the center color, extending in a specific direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonal) until the grid edge. That seems straightforward enough.\n\nNow, I'll use the first example to solidify my understanding. I'm focusing on the top-right frame (yellow center, orange border). I noticed some inconsistencies with the example grid. But after meticulously counting and re-reading, it becomes clear. The gap locations are key; they determine the direction of the extending lines. This confirms that corner gaps lead to diagonal lines, and edge gaps result in straight ones. Example 1 is about to be very helpful for the test cases.\n\nThe next step is to strategize for the test input. It's a 30x30 grid, so I need an efficient approach. I'll read the grid and identify the 4x4 structures by finding the fill color that is inside the frames. Border cells are identified around the fill color's 2x2 area. I will process each frame, pinpointing the gaps in the border and determining the line directions for each. Then, it is just a matter of executing that logic.\n\nI'm now diving into the actual test input. I'm carefully scanning the grid and identifying each 4x4 frame. Each fill color is now known, along with the gap locations in the border. I now have identified the five frames in the test input. With all the coordinates identified, I'm now ready to start drawing the lines.\n\nAs I'm drawing the lines, I need to be careful. I have to make sure I'm writing the correct fill color and extending in the correct directions. The input background should stay the same. I then need to handle line intersections. I need to handle any collisions or overlaps. I need to make sure one \"wins\". I will analyze example grids to determine precedence. The direction or scan order needs to be verified. The later line should overwrite.\n\nI've carefully analyzed each intersection. The priority logic has been identified. It's time to construct the output grid based on all my previous analyses and reasoning. I'm proceeding systematically. The key is in those precise coordinates. I will follow each of the steps to ensure that the output is flawless. I need to make sure the process is correct. I have to handle line-frame collisions. I need to keep those borders intact.\n\nAll of my calculations are in place now. I can now verify the output one final time to be ready.\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to apply the transformation rules inferred from the examples to the test input.\n\n### Analysis of the Task\nThe task involves identifying \"framed structures\" and their associated \"gaps\" to project lines across the grid.\n\n1.  **Objects:**\n    *   **Background:** Color 8.\n    *   **Frames:** Approximately 4x4 structures with a border of color 3. Inside is a 2x2 region of a unique \"fill color\" (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9).\n    *   **Gaps:** The green (3) border is not continuous; there are specific positions where the border is missing (showing background 8).\n\n2.  **Transformation Rules:**\n    *   **Edge Gaps:** If a gap is on the top, bottom, left, or right edge of the frame, fill the gap with the interior color and extend a line perpendicularly (Up, Down, Left, Right) to the grid boundary.\n    *   **Corner Gaps:** If a gap is on a corner of the frame, fill the gap with the interior color and extend a line diagonally (Up-Left, Up-Right, Down-Left, Down-Right) to the grid boundary.\n    *   **Order/Priority:** Original frames are preserved. Where lines intersect, the logic implies a layering order (likely top-to-bottom or frame ID order), but generally, later/lower frames overwrite earlier/higher ones if lines collide.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution on Test Input\n\n**1. Identify Frames:**\nWe scan the grid for 2x2 regions of colors other than 3 and 8.\n\n*   **Frame 1 (Color 2):** Center at rows 5-6, cols 4-5.\n    *   Bounds: Rows 4-7, Cols 3-6.\n    *   **Gaps:**\n        *   Top Edge at (4, 4). Action: Line **UP**.\n        *   Left Edge at (5, 3). Action: Line **LEFT**.\n        *   Bottom-Right Corner at (7, 6). Action: Line **DOWN-RIGHT**.\n\n*   **Frame 2 (Color 4):** Center at rows 5-6, cols 15-16.\n    *   Bounds: Rows 4-7, Cols 14-17.\n    *   **Gaps:**\n        *   Top-Left Corner at (4, 14). Action: Line **UP-LEFT**.\n        *   Bottom Edge at (7, 15). Action: Line **DOWN**.\n        *   Right Edge at (5, 17). Action: Line **RIGHT**.\n\n*   **Frame 3 (Color 6):** Center at rows 14-15, cols 23-24.\n    *   Bounds: Rows 13-16, Cols 22-25.\n    *   **Gaps:**\n        *   Top Edge at (13, 23). Action: Line **UP**.\n        *   Top-Right Corner at (13, 25). Action: Line **UP-RIGHT**.\n        *   Bottom-Right Corner at (16, 25). Action: Line **DOWN-RIGHT**.\n\n*   **Frame 4 (Color 7):** Center at rows 20-21, cols 22-23.\n    *   Bounds: Rows 19-22, Cols 21-24.\n    *   **Gaps:**\n        *   Right Edge at (20, 24). Action: Line **RIGHT**.\n        *   Bottom-Right Corner at (22, 24). Action: Line **DOWN-RIGHT**.\n\n*   **Frame 5 (Color 9):** Center at rows 25-26, cols 1-2.\n    *   Bounds: Rows 24-27, Cols 0-3.\n    *   **Gaps:**\n        *   Top Edge at (24, 2). Action: Line **UP**.\n        *   Bottom-Right Corner at (27, 3). Action: Line **DOWN-RIGHT**.\n\n**2. Draw Lines & Handle Collisions:**\nWe draw the lines on the grid. Frames (color 3 borders and interior colors) are preserved. Lines overwrite the background (8) and each other based on frame order (reading order: Frame 1 to 5).\n\n*   **Line Collisions:**\n    *   (5, 2): Frame 1 (Left) vs Frame 5 (Up). Frame 5 is processed later. **Value: 9**.\n    *   (5, 23): Frame 2 (Right) vs Frame 3 (Up). Frame 3 is processed later. **Value: 6**.\n    *   (16, 15): Frame 1 (Diagonal DR) vs Frame 2 (Down). Frame 2 is processed later (or covers vertical over diagonal). **Value: 4**.\n    *   (20, 29): Frame 3 (Diagonal DR) vs Frame 4 (Right).

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain two main object types against a color 8 background: (1) **framed rectangular structures** approximately 4x4 cells in size, featuring incomplete color 3 borders surrounding 2x2 interior regions filled with colors 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, or 9; and (2) **linear elements** (diagonal, horizontal, or vertical lines) using the same fill colors (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9) that extend across the grid. Color 3 is exclusively used for frame borders, while color 8 serves as the universal background.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n**Transformation Rules:**\n1. Identify framed structures (color 3 borders with colored interiors: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, or 9)\n2. Locate gaps in each frame (positions with background 8 instead of frame 3)\n3. For **edge gaps**: Fill gap with interior color and extend a perpendicular line away from interior (top\u2192up, bottom\u2192down, left\u2192left, right\u2192right)\n4. For **corner gaps**: Fill gap with interior color and extend a diagonal line away from interior (top-left\u2192up-left, top-right\u2192up-right, bottom-left\u2192down-left, bottom-right\u2192down-right)\n5. Lines continue to grid boundaries\n6. Original structure positions are preserved\n7. Background color 8 remains elsewhere unchanged\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Explanation (high level):\n\nEach example shows small 2\u00d72 \u201cinterior\u201d squares of a non\u20113, non\u20118 color (like 2, 4, 6, 7, 9) surrounded by an incomplete rectangular frame of 3s. The transformation:\n\n1. For each 2\u00d72 solid block of the same non\u20113, non\u20118 color \\(c\\), treat it as the interior of a 4\u00d74 frame: one cell of 3s (or intended 3s) in every direction around it (top, bottom, left, right, and the four corners).\n2. Wherever a frame cell in that 4\u00d74 ring is missing (i.e. it is background 8 instead of 3), this is a \u201cgap\u201d.\n3. For each gap:\n   - Recolor the gap cell to the interior color \\(c\\).\n   - Extend a straight line of color \\(c\\) from the gap, going *away* from the interior:\n     - Top edge gap \u2192 line goes straight up.\n     - Bottom edge gap \u2192 line goes straight down.\n     - Left edge gap \u2192 line goes left.\n     - Right edge gap \u2192 line goes right.\n     - Corner gaps:\n       - Top\u2011left \u2192 up\u2011left diagonal.\n       - Top\u2011right \u2192 up\u2011right diagonal.\n       - Bottom\u2011left \u2192 down\u2011left diagonal.\n       - Bottom\u2011right \u2192 down\u2011right diagonal.\n   - While extending, recolor only background 8s; stop when you hit any non\u20118 or the grid boundary.\n4. Repeat for all such framed 2\u00d72 interiors. Original non\u20118 cells (3s, interiors, or previously drawn lines) are never overwritten.\n\nIn the test grid there are five such interiors:\n- Color 2 at rows 5\u20136, cols 4\u20135.\n- Color 4 at rows 5\u20136, cols 15\u201316.\n- Color 6 at rows 14\u201315, cols 23\u201324.\n- Color 7 at rows 20\u201321, cols 22\u201323.\n- Color 9 at rows 25\u201326, cols 1\u20132.\n\nApplying the above rules to each of these structures (and letting existing non\u20118 cells block further extension) gives the following output grid.\n\nFinal output grid:\n\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain two main object types against a color 8 background: (1) **framed rectangular structures** approximately 4x4 cells in size, featuring incomplete color 3 borders surrounding 2x2 interior regions filled with colors 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, or 9; and (2) **linear elements** (diagonal, horizontal, or vertical lines) using the same fill colors (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9) that extend across the grid. Color 3 is exclusively used for frame borders, while color 8 serves as the universal background.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n**Transformation Rules:**\n1. Identify framed structures (color 3 borders with colored interiors: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, or 9)\n2. Locate gaps in each frame (positions with background 8 instead of frame 3)\n3. For **edge gaps**: Fill gap with interior color and extend a perpendicular line away from interior (top\u2192up, bottom\u2192down, left\u2192left, right\u2192right)\n4. For **corner gaps**: Fill gap with interior color and extend a diagonal line away from interior (top-left\u2192up-left, top-right\u2192up-right, bottom-left\u2192down-left, bottom-right\u2192down-right)\n5. Lines continue to grid boundaries\n6. Original structure positions are preserved\n7. Background color 8 remains elsewhere unchanged\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain two main object types against a color 8 background: (1) **framed rectangular structures** approximately 4x4 cells in size, featuring incomplete color 3 borders surrounding 2x2 interior regions filled with colors 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, or 9; and (2) **linear elements** (diagonal, horizontal, or vertical lines) using the same fill colors (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9) that extend across the grid. Color 3 is exclusively used for frame borders, while color 8 serves as the universal background.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n**Transformation Rules:**\n1. Identify framed structures (color 3 borders with colored interiors: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, or 9)\n2. Locate gaps in each frame (positions with background 8 instead of frame 3)\n3. For **edge gaps**: Fill gap with interior color and extend a perpendicular line away from interior (top\u2192up, bottom\u2192down, left\u2192left, right\u2192right)\n4. For **corner gaps**: Fill gap with interior color and extend a diagonal line away from interior (top-left\u2192up-left, top-right\u2192up-right, bottom-left\u2192down-left, bottom-right\u2192down-right)\n5. Lines continue to grid boundaries\n6. Original structure positions are preserved\n7. Background color 8 remains elsewhere unchanged\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning**\n\nThe input grids are mostly background \u201c8\u201d with several small 4\u00d74 framed structures: a 2\u00d72 interior of some colour (not 8 or 3) surrounded by a border of 3\u2019s, but with some border cells missing (left as 8). For each missing border cell you fill that cell with the interior colour and then draw a straight line of that colour away from the interior: straight up for a gap on the top edge, down for bottom edge, left or right for side gaps, and diagonally for a missing corner. The line continues cell by cell in that direction to the edge of the grid, overwriting background cells as it goes.\n\nIn the test grid there are five such frames:\n\n- Interior 2 at rows\u202f5\u20136, cols\u202f4\u20135 (top gap at 4,4; left gap at 5,3; bottom-right gap at 7,6).\n- Interior 4 at rows\u202f5\u20136, cols\u202f15\u201316 (gaps at 4,14; 5,17; 7,15).\n- Interior 6 at rows\u202f14\u201315, cols\u202f23\u201324 (gaps at 13,23; 13,25; 16,25).\n- Interior 7 at rows\u202f20\u201321, cols\u202f22\u201323 (gaps at 20,24; 22,24).\n- Interior 9 at rows\u202f25\u201326, cols\u202f1\u20132 (gaps at 24,2; 27,3).\n\nApplying the rule to each gap and drawing the lines gives the following output.\n\n**Output grid**\n\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n2,2,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4  \n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8,8  \n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8  \n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8  \n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7  \n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8",

Objects Description\nThe grids contain two main object types against a color 8 background: (1) **framed rectangular structures** approximately 4x4 cells in size, featuring incomplete color 3 borders surrounding 2x2 interior regions filled with colors 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, or 9; and (2) **linear elements** (diagonal, horizontal, or vertical lines) using the same fill colors (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9) that extend across the grid. Color 3 is exclusively used for frame borders, while color 8 serves as the universal background.",
                "response": "Looking at the examples, I'll analyze the transformations systematically:\n\n## Transformation Analysis\n\n### Core Pattern Identification\n\nEach example contains rectangular structures with:\n- A **frame/border** made of color 3\n- A **2x2 interior** filled with colors like 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, or 9\n- **Gaps** in the frame (positions with 8 instead of 3)\n\n### Transformation Rules\n\n**1. Gap Detection:** The transformation identifies gaps (missing 3s) in each frame structure.\n\n**2. Edge Gap Behavior:** When a gap occurs in an edge of the frame (top, bottom, left, or right):\n- The gap is filled with the interior color\n- A line extends **perpendicular** to that edge, away from the interior:\n  - Top edge gaps \u2192 vertical lines going UP\n  - Bottom edge gaps \u2192 vertical lines going DOWN  \n  - Left edge gaps \u2192 horizontal lines going LEFT\n  - Right edge gaps \u2192 horizontal lines going RIGHT\n\n**3. Corner Gap Behavior:** When a gap occurs at a corner position:\n- The gap is filled with the interior color\n- A **diagonal line** extends outward from the corner:\n  - Top-left corner \u2192 diagonal UP-LEFT\n  - Top-right corner \u2192 diagonal UP-RIGHT\n  - Bottom-left corner \u2192 diagonal DOWN-LEFT\n  - Bottom-right corner \u2192 diagonal DOWN-RIGHT\n\n**4. Line Extension:** All lines (perpendicular or diagonal) continue until reaching the grid boundary.\n\n**5. Structure Preservation:** The original frame (3s) and interior colors remain intact.\n\n### Verification Across Examples\n- Example 2: Top gap at col 3 \u2192 vertical 4s upward; right gap \u2192 horizontal 4s rightward; bottom-left corner gap \u2192 diagonal 4s down-left\n- Example 3: Multiple structures each emit lines from their respective gaps\n- Example 4: Top edge gap \u2192 vertical 6s up; top-right corner gap \u2192 diagonal 6s up-right; bottom-left corner gap \u2192 diagonal 6s down-left\n\n<transformation_summary>\n**Transformation Rules:**\n1. Identify framed structures (color 3 borders with colored interiors: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, or 9)\n2. Locate gaps in each frame (positions with background 8 instead of frame 3)\n3. For **edge gaps**: Fill gap with interior color and extend a perpendicular line away from interior (top\u2192up, bottom\u2192down, left\u2192left, right\u2192right)\n4. For **corner gaps**: Fill gap with interior color and extend a diagonal line away from interior (top-left\u2192up-left, top-right\u2192up-right, bottom-left\u2192down-left, bottom-right\u2192down-right)\n5. Lines continue to grid boundaries\n6. Original structure positions are preserved\n7. Background color 8 remains elsewhere unchanged\n</transformation_summary>",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain two main object types against a color 8 background: (1) **framed rectangular structures** approximately 4x4 cells in size, featuring incomplete color 3 borders surrounding 2x2 interior regions filled with colors 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, or 9; and (2) **linear elements** (diagonal, horizontal, or vertical lines) using the same fill colors (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9) that extend across the grid. Color 3 is exclusively used for frame borders, while color 8 serves as the universal background.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n**Transformation Rules:**\n1. Identify framed structures (color 3 borders with colored interiors: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, or 9)\n2. Locate gaps in each frame (positions with background 8 instead of frame 3)\n3. For **edge gaps**: Fill gap with interior color and extend a perpendicular line away from interior (top\u2192up, bottom\u2192down, left\u2192left, right\u2192right)\n4. For **corner gaps**: Fill gap with interior color and extend a diagonal line away from interior (top-left\u2192up-left, top-right\u2192up-right, bottom-left\u2192down-left, bottom-right\u2192down-right)\n5. Lines continue to grid boundaries\n6. Original structure positions are preserved\n7. Background color 8 remains elsewhere unchanged\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
