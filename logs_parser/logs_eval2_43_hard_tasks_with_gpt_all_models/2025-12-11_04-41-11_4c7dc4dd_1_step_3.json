        "Full raw LLM response": "**I'm being presented with a challenging ARC task, and my mind is racing as I try to unravel its secrets!** I see I'm given examples and a test input, each consisting of grids. The goal? Transform a large input grid into a tiny output grid. It seems like the core of the problem lies in figuring out the *right* way to summarize the information in that massive input down to its essence.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the basic components: what shapes and patterns emerge? Are there borders or recurring elements? I see \"windows,\" rectangular regions surrounded by a consistent color. I start analyzing their dimensions, internal contents, and spatial relationships. It is obvious that the input grids are very large and have these \"windows.\" The output grids are significantly smaller.\n\nIt looks like the key is to isolate and interpret those \"windows.\" In the first example, I discover distinct square frames. I examine the raw grid values within these frames to grasp their internal configurations. Are there patterns or rules? The colors and their positions seem crucial. Then I compare these interiors with the output and search for the crucial correspondence between elements. It looks like the output isn't a direct copy. It seems that it is some form of transformation on these \"windows.\"\n\nThe second example appears very similar but the dimensions differ. I search for similar \"windows.\" I try to identify a common denominator and use it to check the result on the test input.\n\nThere appear to be a pattern in the examples: Identify the 4 windows defined by a specific border color. Extract the interiors. Map the interior \"foreground\" color to a target color. XOR the grids and if a cell has an odd number of active pixels, it's active.\n\nThrough carefully tracing elements and colors, I am able to verify this XOR logic. The color and shapes and relationships tell a fascinating story. There is a specific color mapping logic at play.\n\nThis rule seems to work, but I need a generalized framework. Then I must apply these findings to the test input. The test input has its own specific features to decode and to create a 5x5 result grid. I start by detecting any \"windows\". After a tedious but calculated inspection, I see 4 key regions! I check their structure to confirm that they match the rule! Using these pieces, I predict the output and move forward with this carefully crafted solution.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to perform a transformation on a 30x30 grid to produce a smaller grid (5x5 based on the test case features).\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Grid Extraction:** The 30x30 input grids contain \"windows\" or \"frames\" \u2013 square regions surrounded by a border of a single color.\n    *   In Example 1, the border color is 4. The windows are 5x5.\n    *   In Example 2, the border color is 8. The windows are 4x4.\n    *   In the Test Input, the border color is 5. The windows are 5x5.\n\n2.  **Window Identification:**\n    *   We identify four potential quadrants for windows: Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), and Bottom-Right (BR).\n    *   **Example 1:** TL, TR, and BL contain patterns. BR is empty (or background).\n    *   **Example 2:** TL, BL, and BR contain patterns. TR is empty.\n    *   **Test Input:** Scanning the grid for the border color 5:\n        *   **TL (T1):** Found at Rows 3-9, Cols 5-11. Interior has a cross of `1`s with an `8` in the center.\n        *   **TR (T2):** Found at Rows 3-9, Cols 20-26. Interior is all `0`s (Empty).\n        *   **BL (T3):** Found at Rows 20-26, Cols 5-11. Interior is a checkerboard-like pattern of `1`s and `8`s.\n        *   **BR (T4):** Found at Rows 20-26, Cols 19-25. Interior has a cross of `4`s with a `2` in the center.\n\n3.  **Transformation Logic (XOR & Color Mapping):**\n    *   The operation combines the windows using an XOR-like logic (cancellation of identical overlapping parts).\n    *   **Palette Selection:** In Example 1, the output colors match the BL window (the sole window in the bottom row). In Example 2, the output colors match the BR window (the sole window in the right column). The rule appears to be: use the color palette of the window that is the \"odd one out\" in terms of row/column occupancy (or simply the one in the sparser half). In the Test Input, the Right side has only one window (BR), while the Left has two. Thus, the **BR window's colors (4 and 2)** are the target palette.\n    *   **Mapping:** The colors of the other windows must be mapped to the target palette based on their structural correspondence.\n        *   Target Palette: 4 (Cross arms), 2 (Center).\n        *   TL Window: 1 (Cross arms), 8 (Center). -> Map 1 to 4, 8 to 2.\n        *   BL Window: 1, 8. -> Map 1 to 4, 8 to 2.\n    *   **Combination:**\n        *   We XOR the mapped windows: `TL_mapped XOR BL_mapped XOR BR`.\n        *   `TL_mapped` (Cross of 4, Center 2) is identical to `BR` (Cross of 4, Center 2).\n        *   Therefore, `TL_mapped` and `BR` cancel each other out completely (XOR = 0).\n        *   The result is simply `BL_mapped`.\n\n4.  **Constructing the Output:**\n    *   We take the BL window (T3) and apply the mapping (1->4, 8->2).\n    *   **BL T3 Original:**\n        ```\n        8 1 8 1 8\n        1 8 0 8 1\n        8 0 0 0 8\n        1 8 0 8 1\n        8 1 8 1 8\n        ```\n    *   **BL T3 Mapped (1->4, 8->2):**\n        ```\n        2 4 2 4 2\n        4 2 0 2 4\n        2 0 0 0 2\n        4 2 0 2 4\n        2 4 2 4 2\n        ```\n\n2,4,2,4,2\n4,2,0,2,4\n2,0,0,0,2\n4,2,0,2,4\n2,4,2,4,2",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Deep Dive into an ARC Problem**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The user wants me to tackle an Abstract Reasoning challenge based on two examples and a test input. My immediate focus is on figuring out how the input data transforms into the output.\n\n**Initial Observations:**\n\nThe input seems to be a grid filled with numbers representing colors. The output is a smaller grid. I'm looking for the underlying pattern or transformation. In Example 1, I see large, noisy grids with \"objects\" interrupting the background.\n\n**Unraveling Example 1:**\n\nIt looks like the background is a repeating pattern of numbers (1, 2, 3, 4). The \"objects\" are regions where this pattern is disrupted. There appear to be four distinct \"objects\" in the Example 1 input: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right. I'm noticing that the output grid size (5x5) might relate to the \"objects\".\n\n**Zooming In on \"Objects\":**\n\nIt becomes evident that the \"objects\" have some structure. They are usually squares or rectangles, with a border of a specific number (4 in Example 1). Within the object, there are internal patterns of numbers, including 0s, 1s, and 6s.\n\n**Discovering the Output's Purpose:**\n\nThe output looks like a condensed version of the input, but the values are transformed and the size reduced. The 5x5 output grid from Example 1 might reflect the internal structure of the objects. It has values like 0, 2, and 6. I'm trying to figure out how these values map back to the input numbers (0, 1, 6, 2, 3, 4).\n\n**Analyzing Example 2 and Test Input:**\n\nIn Example 2, the grid size is 4x4. The objects seem to have an inner core of size 4x4, framed by an 8. The background is a similar pattern. The Test input uses 3,4,5,6.\n\n**Spotting Key Connections:**\n\nIt's clear that the output grid is directly related to the number and placement of these internal objects. The values 0, 2, and 6 in the output are critical. It seems to come from those regions and a mapping or transformation. I'm starting to think the 2 in output corresponds to areas where a background value appears.\nThe goal seems to be to extract from a noisy image, a clean tile.\n\n**Developing a Hypothesis:**\n\nThe \"noise\" seems to be coming from overlapping \"objects,\" potentially shifted or distorted. Let's say that background values are irrelevant and the output reconstructs these \"signals\".\n\n**Identifying a Consistent Approach:**\n\nIt starts to resemble a voting system, where the output pixel is the majority signal.\n\n**The Test Input and Finding the \"Right\" Answer:**\n\nIn Test, there are four \"objects\" again. Each object now has shapes that contain values 1, 8, 2, and 4. What becomes the key is the central pixel, which might be a dominant value in a tile.\n\n**Cracking the Code: The Final Answer:**\nAfter deep analysis and pattern matching, it comes down to these mappings:\n*   Background = 0\n*   The \"Key/Unique\" pixels from each input are preserved.\n*   All other \"content\" values are transformed to a single standard color (ink).\n*   The result is a diamond shape, of ink around a key point.\n\nFinal test to be sure and I got it!\n\nOutput grid is:\n\n0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0\n0,2,8,2,0\n0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0\n\n\nThe problem asks us to extract a \"true\" image from a noisy grid containing multiple distorted instances of the image.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Objects:**\n    *   In Example 1, the input contains four 5x5 regions (with frames) that disrupt the background pattern. The background is a repeating noise of `1, 2, 3, 4`. The \"signal\" inside the frames consists of `0`s and `6`s.\n    *   In Example 2, the input contains four 4x4 regions. The background is `0, 1, 2, 3`. The signal inside consists of `4`s and `8`s.\n    *   In the Test Input, the background is a noisy pattern of `3, 4, 5, 6`. The frames are made of `5`s. There are four 5x5 instances inside the frames.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Instances in Test Input:**\n    *   The frames are 5 pixels wide (inner area 5x5).\n    *   **Instance 1 (Top-Left):** Contains a diamond shape made of `1`s with an `8` in the center. The surrounding pixels are `0`. Since `0`, `1`, and `8` are not part of the background (`3,4,5,6`), they are signal. However, `0` appears to be the \"canvas\" or empty space (similar to `1` in Ex 1 being background noise). The \"ink\" is `1` and `8`.\n        *   Pattern: `1` at (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2). `8` at (2,2).\n    *   **Instance 2 (Top-Right):** Contains `0`s. This is an empty canvas.\n    *   **Instance 3 (Bottom-Left):** Contains a pattern of `1`s and `8`s.\n    *   **Instance 4 (Bottom-Right):** Contains `4`s and a `2` in the center. Since `4` is part of the background set (`3,4,5,6`), it is likely noise/transparent. The `2` is unique and is signal.\n        *   Pattern: `2` at (2,2).\n\n3.  **Determine the Transformation/Combination Rule:**\n    *   We need to reconstruct the \"ideal\" 5x5 image.\n    *   **Geometry:** The shapes in Instance 1 (Diamond) and Instance 4 (Center dot) suggest a Diamond shape.\n    *   **Color Mapping:**\n        *   In Example 1, the \"ink\" `0` mapped to `2` in the output, while the special \"highlight\" `6` mapped to `6`.\n        *   In Example 2, the \"ink\" colors `4` and `8` both mapped to `2`.\n        *   In the Test Input, we have \"ink\" pixels `1` (rim) and `2` (center of Inst 4), and a \"highlight\" pixel `8` (center of Inst 1).\n        *   Following Example 1's logic: The standard ink color becomes `2`. The special highlight color is preserved.\n        *   The `1`s forming the rim become `2`s.\n        *   The `8` in the center is preserved as `8` (similar to `6` in Ex 1).\n        *   The `0` canvas remains `0` (or maps to background `0`).\n\n4.  **Construct the Output Grid:**\n    *   Background: `0`.\n    *   Diamond Rim (pixels at (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2)): Map `1` -> `2`.\n    *   Diamond Center (pixel at (2,2)): Map `8` -> `8`.\n\n    The resulting grid is:\n    Row 0: `0, 0, 0, 0, 0`\n    Row 1: `0, 0, 2, 0, 0`\n    Row 2: `0, 2, 8, 2, 0`\n    Row 3: `0, 0, 2, 0, 0`\n    Row 4: `0, 0, 0, 0, 0`\n\noutput:\n0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0\n0,2,8,2,0\n0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to identify the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\nIn both examples, I can identify:\n1. Large rectangular regions bounded by specific values (1s/2s forming frames)\n2. Smaller rectangular regions inside, bounded by other values (4s in Ex1, 8s in Ex2)\n3. These smaller regions contain patterns with 0s and special markers (6 in Ex1, 8 in Ex2)\n\nThe key insight is finding an \"answer region\" that defines what the output should be:\n- In Example 1: One region has a marker (6) and directional indicators (2s). The 2s at row/column ends get \"extended\" along their row/column from the 6 marker.\n- In Example 2: The answer region contains 0s and 2s. The output is simply the complement (swap 0\u21942).\n\n**Analyzing the Test Input:**\n\nI identify 5-bounded rectangular regions. The key regions are:\n- Region 1 (rows 4-8, cols 6-10): Has 8 at center with 1s forming a plus pattern\n- Region 4 (rows 21-25, cols 20-24): The \"answer\" region\n\nRegion 4 content:\n```\n0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0\n0,4,2,4,0\n0,0,4,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0\n```\n\nThis has:\n- A special marker (2) at the center (2,2)\n- Directional markers (4s) adjacent to the center at (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2)\n\n**Applying the Transformation:**\n\nFollowing the pattern from Example 1, the directional markers (4s) should extend along their row/column from the center marker:\n- 4 at (1,2) \u2192 fills column 2 upward to row 0\n- 4 at (3,2) \u2192 fills column 2 downward to row 4  \n- 4 at (2,1) \u2192 fills row 2 leftward to col 0\n- 4 at (2,3) \u2192 fills row 2 rightward to col 4\n\nThe special marker (2) stays in place.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n0,0,4,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0\n4,4,2,4,4\n0,0,4,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### Reasoning\n\nI\u2019ll describe the transformation I inferred from the two training examples, then apply it to the test grid.\n\n---\n\n#### 1. What stands out in the training inputs?\n\nIn both examples, the large 30\u00d730 grids consist mostly of a repetitive \u201cbackground\u201d pattern, plus a few clearly *non\u2011background* regions:\n\n- In **Example 1**, the background is mostly made from colors {1,2,3,4} laid out in structured sequences. On top of that, there are small rectangular areas dominated by **0** and **6**.\n- In **Example 2**, the background is a structured pattern using {0,1,2,3,4}. On top of it, there are distinct rectangular \u201cwindows\u201d bordered by **8** and containing mostly 0 and some other colors.\n\nIn both cases the output is a **small square grid** (5\u00d75 or 4\u00d74) made only of **0** and **one or two non\u2011zero colors** (mostly color 2, sometimes also another color like 6).\n\nThis strongly suggests the task is:\n\n> Find a special small symbol embedded in the big patterned grid (usually inside a 0\u2011dominated or special\u2011border rectangle), crop it out, simplify its colors, and output it as its own small grid.\n\nConcretely:\n\n- Identify the **distinctive interior pattern** inside a special rectangle (a region dominated by 0 or bounded by a rare color like 6 or 8).\n- **Crop** to that interior symbol.\n- **Recolor** all non\u2011background cells to:\n  - Usually color **2**, and\n  - In Example 1, preserve a single special cell as color **6**.\n\nThat produces the small output grids.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Locating the special symbol in the test input\n\nNow inspect the **test input**. The bulk of the grid is made from repetitive uses of {3,4,5,6} in structured cycles (similar \u201cbackground\u201d behavior).\n\nIn contrast, there is a clearly isolated special structure near the **lower middle**:\n\nRows 22\u201326, columns 21\u201325:\n\n- Row 22: `0,0,0,0,0`\n- Row 23: `0,0,4,0,0`\n- Row 24: `0,4,2,4,0`\n- Row 25: `0,0,4,0,0`\n- Row 26: `0,0,0,0,0`\n\nSo that 5\u00d75 patch is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{matrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 4 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 4 & 2 & 4 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 4 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{matrix}\n\\]\n\nProperties:\n\n- It\u2019s a **5\u00d75 rectangle** embedded in otherwise regular background.\n- It\u2019s mostly **0**, with a **cross** of non\u2011zero cells:\n  - Color **4** on the arms.\n  - A single **2** at the center.\n- It\u2019s exactly the kind of \u201csymbol inside a zero\u2011dominated box\u201d we saw in the training inputs, and its **interior size is 5\u00d75**, matching the **5\u00d75 output size of Example 1** (and consistent with \u201coutput size = symbol\u2019s bounding box\u201d).\n\nSo we take this 5\u00d75 interior as the symbol to be extracted.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Recoloring rule\n\nFrom the examples:\n\n- The outputs simplify the symbol\u2019s colors:\n  - **Background 0** stays 0.\n  - The \u201cshape\u201d cells are recolored to **2**.\n  - If there is a special standout color in the symbol\u2019s interior (e.g. a single 6 in Example 1), that single cell can be preserved as 6.  \n    In the test symbol, the center **2** is already a \u201cdata color,\u201d and there is no interior 6\u2013like special marker, so we don\u2019t introduce a new color.\n\nSo for the test symbol:\n\n- Treat colors **4** and **2** as \u201cshape\u201d pixels \u2192 map them to **2**.\n- Keep **0** as **0**.\n\nApplying that recoloring to the 5\u00d75 patch:\n\nOriginal:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{matrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 4 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 4 & 2 & 4 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 4 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{matrix}\n\\]\n\nMap {4,2} \u2192 2, 0 \u2192 0:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{matrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{matrix}\n\\]\n\nThis is the extracted and normalized symbol.\n\n---\n\n### Final output grid\n\nSo the output for the test input is:\n\n0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,2,0,0  \n0,2,2,2,0  \n0,0,2,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Below is a clear description of the pattern I inferred and how I applied it, followed by the resulting output grid. Because the task is inherently ambiguous from only two examples, this is necessarily a *hypothesized* rule, not something I can rigorously prove from the data alone.\n\n---\n\n## Inferred transformation (hypothesis)\n\n1. **Look for framed \u201cspecial blocks\u201d in the large grid**\n\n   In both solved examples and in the test input, the big 30\u00d730 grid contains several rectangular blocks that:\n   - Have a **constant \u201cframe color\u201d** around them (a solid border).\n   - Have a **different pattern of digits inside** the frame (zeros and other digits like 1, 2, 4, 8, etc.).\n\n   Roughly:\n   - Example 1: frame color \u2248 4, interiors with 0 and sometimes 6.\n   - Example 2: frame color = 8, interiors with 0 and sometimes 4 or 2.\n   - Test: frame color = 5, interiors with 0, 1, 8, 4, 2, etc.\n\n   In the test input, these framed blocks are 6\u00d76 and appear in four quadrants:\n   - Top\u2011left: rows 4\u20139, cols 7\u201312\n   - Top\u2011right: rows 4\u20139, cols 21\u201326\n   - Bottom\u2011left: rows 21\u201326, cols 7\u201312\n   - Bottom\u2011right: rows 21\u201326, cols 21\u201326\n\n2. **Focus on the interior of a framed block**\n\n   For each 6\u00d76 framed block, we ignore the border (the outer ring of the frame color) and look at the inner 4\u00d74 area. For the **bottom\u2011right** framed block in the test input:\n\n   - It occupies rows 21\u201326, cols 21\u201326.\n   - Its interior is rows 22\u201325, cols 22\u201325.\n\n   Extracting that interior:\n\n   - Row 22 (c22\u201325): `0,0,0,0`\n   - Row 23 (c22\u201325): `0,4,0,0`\n   - Row 24 (c22\u201325): `4,2,4,0`\n   - Row 25 (c22\u201325): `0,4,0,0`\n\n   So the 4\u00d74 interior is:\n   ```\n   0 0 0 0\n   0 4 0 0\n   4 2 4 0\n   0 4 0 0\n   ```\n\n3. **Collapse interior to a binary shape**\n\n   We then turn that 4\u00d74 interior into a binary \u201cshape\u201d by:\n   - Treating **0 as background**.\n   - Treating **any non\u2011zero digit as foreground**.\n\n   That gives a 0/1 matrix:\n   ```\n   0 0 0 0\n   0 1 0 0\n   1 1 1 0\n   0 1 0 0\n   ```\n\n4. **Map foreground to color 2**\n\n   In the outputs of the solved examples, the \u201cforeground\u201d is represented consistently by color `2`. So we map:\n   - 1 \u2192 2\n   - 0 \u2192 0\n\n   This yields the final 4\u00d74 output pattern:\n   ```\n   0 0 0 0\n   0 2 0 0\n   2 2 2 0\n   0 2 0 0\n   ```\n\n   This is the pattern I will output for the test input.\n\n---\n\n## Completed output grid\n\nAs a comma-separated grid:\n\n0,0,0,0  \n0,2,0,0  \n2,2,2,0  \n0,2,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "To get from the large patterned inputs to the small outputs a single colour was picked out and its connected components were analysed.\n\nIn both worked examples the \u201canomaly\u201d colour was simply the highest valued colour present in the grid (6 in the first example, 8 in the second). The number of 4\u2011connected components of this colour determined the size of the output grid: 5 components of 6 gave a 5\u00d75 output, 4 components of 8 gave a 4\u00d74 output.\n\nThe positions of all pixels of the anomaly colour were then scaled down to this output grid using the ratio of input size to output size. A horizontal bar of colour\u202f2 is placed on the row corresponding to the scaled mean input row of the anomaly pixels. A main vertical bar is placed at the scaled column of the extreme (min/max) anomaly column closest to the mean anomaly column; if the anomalies are symmetrically placed (equal distance to both extremes), the right\u2011hand extreme is used and a secondary bar is drawn on the other extreme below the horizontal bar. The intersection in the asymmetric case is coloured with the anomaly colour; otherwise all bars are coloured 2. For symmetric cases, a top\u2013row neighbour of any filled top cell is also filled to mirror the second example.\n\nFor the test grid the maximum colour is 8. There are 13 isolated 8s, so the output is 13\u00d713. The mean row of the 8s scales to output row\u202f10, the extreme columns scale to output columns\u202f5 (main) and\u202f3 (secondary). Applying the same bar\u2011drawing rules as above gives:\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",
