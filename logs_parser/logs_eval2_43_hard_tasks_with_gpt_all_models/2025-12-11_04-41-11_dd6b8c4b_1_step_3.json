        "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task: Color Grid Transformation**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to figure out a rule for these color grid problems. My initial plan is to look at the examples and try to understand how the input grid is changed into the output grid. The grids use numbers 0-9 to represent colors.\n\n**First Look at Example 1:**\nThe grid is mostly orange (7) with a magenta (6) structure and a green (3) 3x3 square with a red (2) center. This green square has some scattered maroon (9) pixels around it. The output grid has changes inside that 3x3 square. It looks like the scattered 9s might be moving into the 3x3 square, so I\u2019ll need to check carefully for this.\n\n**Analyzing the Difference:**\nI'm now comparing the input and output pixel by pixel. In the output grid, it looks like some of those maroon (9) pixels have \"moved\" into that 3x3 green square. Hmm, are they *all* moving? Let's check coordinates of the changes more closely. I see that certain 9s are indeed disappearing from their original spots, and 9s are appearing in that 3x3 area. So the 9s seem to be \"filling\" the square.\n\n**Example 2: A Pattern Emerges:**\nLet\u2019s see if this pattern holds in another example. In Example 2, the 3x3 square is again in the same place. I notice that the 3x3 square is *completely* filled with 9s in the output. This solidifies my thought about the 9s moving into the 3x3 region.\n\n**Looking for a Rule:**\nIt looks like this might be a \"move\" or \"fill\" task. The goal seems to be to fill that central 3x3 area with the maroon (9) color, and the original color 2 gets replaced. I need to figure out what criteria decides *which* 9s move. I\u2019m thinking there might be a \"distance\" or \"accessibility\" factor involved. I noticed something: the 9s that moved were inside of an enclosure formed by color 6.\n\n**\"Rooms\" and \"Accessibility\":**\nI'm beginning to think the rule is about a kind of \"connectivity\" or \"reachability.\" Pixels of color 6 (magenta) seem to be acting like walls. Only the 9s that are \"accessible\" or \"connected\" to that target 3x3 area, *without* crossing color 6, are allowed to move. I'll test this hypothesis to see if this is true in both the previous and new examples.\n\n**Testing the Accessibility Rule:**\nI can see in Example 1 that some 9s were *inside* a room made of 6s, and those moved. Others were outside and didn\u2019t move. Hmm, I\u2019m getting closer!\n\n**The \"Move if Connected\" Rule:**\nIt seems that the 9s are moving if they are \"connected\" to the 3x3 green square. Connected means there is a non-color-6 (non-wall) path to reach this area. I believe the rule is now that any pixel of color 9 that can be \"reached\" or \"connected to\" the 3x3 target grid, without hitting walls, must move into the target grid, filling the 3x3 grid using the order cells are in the grid. If the 3x3 box is full, any further 9s remain in place.\n\n**The Strategy for a New Task:**\n*   Identify the target: the 3x3 area with the color 3s and 2 in the center.\n*   Find the \"connected\" 9s: These must be reachable without passing through the \"walls\" (color 6).\n*   Move the 9s.\n*   The original position of the \"9\" pixel changes to 7.\n*   If more 9s are connected than cells in the box, fill the box up with cells in reading order. Remaining connected cells don't move.\n\n**Applying to the Test Input:**\nNow, I'll use the rule to analyze the test input. First, I have to figure out the location of the 3x3 target and walls of color 6s. Then I can identify and move the connected 9s. I see that the target 3x3 grid is in the same location as before.  I'm looking for the connected components of the 9s. It looks like the target is at rows 4-6, cols 4-6. I will identify the walls. The ones at 1-7 in row 1,1. I see the 9s at (2,\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the transformation rule based on the provided examples and apply it to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal Structure:** In all examples, there is a distinct 3x3 square composed mainly of green pixels (3) with a red center (2). This structure, which we can call the \"Nest\" or \"Target Box,\" is located at rows 4-6 and columns 4-6 (0-indexed).\n    *   Example 1: The nest is partially filled with maroon pixels (9) in the output.\n    *   Example 2: The nest is completely filled with maroon pixels (9) in the output.\n    *   Example 3: The nest is partially filled with maroon pixels (9) in the output.\n\n2.  **Identify the Moving Parts:** The pixels that change are maroon (9) pixels scattered throughout the grid. In the output, some of these 9s disappear from their original positions and appear inside the Nest. The original positions of these moving 9s become background color (7).\n\n3.  **Determine the Rule for Movement:**\n    *   **Connectivity:** The grid contains walls made of magenta pixels (6). We treat the grid as a maze where 6s are obstacles.\n    *   In Example 1, the 9s in the \"top room\" (rows 1-3) do not move. This room is completely enclosed by walls of 6s. The 9s in the \"bottom room\" (rows 7-9) *do* move. There is a gap in the wall at (7,5) that connects the bottom room to the area containing the Nest.\n    *   In Example 3, there are no walls (6s). All scattered 9s move into the Nest.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Only 9s that are *connected* to the Nest via a path of non-wall pixels (usually 7s) are moved. 9s that are isolated by walls of 6s remain in place.\n\n4.  **Filling Order and Limit:**\n    *   The 9s fill the Nest starting from the top-left (4,4), moving row by row (reading order).\n    *   The center pixel (5,5), originally 2, is overwritten if enough 9s arrive (as seen in Example 2). If not enough 9s arrive, the remaining 3s and the 2 stay unchanged (Examples 1 and 3).\n    *   If there are more connected 9s than the Nest can hold (9 spots), priority is likely given to the closest ones (by path distance), and the rest stay put. However, in the Test Input, we just need to check if we exceed the limit.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Locate the Nest:** Rows 4-6, Cols 4-6.\n2.  **Analyze Walls (6s) and Connectivity:**\n    *   **Row 1** is a solid wall of 6s (`6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6`). This completely isolates **Row 0**. The 9s at (0,2) and (0,8) cannot reach the Nest.\n    *   **Cols 1 and 9** form vertical walls extending from Row 1 to Row 9. This isolates **Col 0** and **Col 10**.\n        *   The 9 at (2,0) is isolated.\n        *   The 9s at (3,10), (5,10), and (7,10) are isolated.\n    *   **The Inner Region:** The area between Col 1 and Col 9 (i.e., Cols 2-8) is connected.\n        *   Row 3 and Row 7 have walls but contain gaps at Col 2, 5, and 8. Specifically, the gap at (7,5) connects the Nest area to the bottom section (Row 8). The gap at (3,5) connects to the top section (Row 2).\n        *   Therefore, 9s located in **Row 2** (inside cols 2-8) and **Row 8** (inside cols 2-8) are connected to the Nest.\n\n3.  **Identify Moving 9s:**\n    *   **Row 2:** 9s at (2,2) and (2,8). Both are inside the vertical walls.\n    *   **Row 8:** 9s at (8,2), (8,5), and (8,8). All are inside.\n    *   Total connected 9s = 5.\n\n4.  **Transformation:**\n    *   Remove the 5 connected 9s (change them to 7).\n        *   (2,2), (2,8), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8) become 7.\n    *   Fill the Nest with 5 9s in reading order.\n        *   Nest Coordinates: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4)...\n        *   Fill (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5) with 9.\n        *   Note: (5,5) was 2, it becomes 9.\n        *   Remaining Nest cells (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) are unchanged.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n\n*   **Row 0:** Unchanged (9s are isolated). `6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6`\n*   **Row 1:** Unchanged. `6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6`\n*   **Row 2:** 9s at 2,8 become 7. `9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7`\n*   **Row 3:** Unchanged. `7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9`\n*   **Row 4:** Nest top row (3,3,3) becomes (9,9,9). `7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7`\n*   **Row 5:** Nest mid row (3,2,3) becomes (9,9,3). `7,6,7,7,9,9,3,7,7,6,9`\n*   **Row 6:** Nest bot row (3,3,3) unchanged. `7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7`\n*   **Row 7:** Unchanged. `7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9`\n*   **Row 8:** 9s at 2,5,8 become 7. `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7`\n*   **Row 9:** Unchanged. `7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6`\n*   **Row 10:** Unchanged. `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6`\n\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,3,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**My Problem-Solving Process**\n\nOkay, here's what I've figured out. The task involves transforming input grids containing colors (represented as numbers 0-9) into output grids. The common theme is identifying a pattern and applying it, so I'm looking for how objects are moved or changed color. I started by looking for similarities and differences between the three examples, as well as considering the structure of the input and how that structure is affected in the output.\n\nI noticed the target structure, a central 3x3 block, remains in the output, but its values are modified.  That suggests this is the central part to focus on. I began by analyzing Example 1.\n\nThe input grids have a \"container\" made of the color 6, defining specific enclosed spaces. The \"noise\" of scattered 9s is there. My first hypothesis was that there was a rule of how to move 9's to the target region. The 9s were either enclosed by the 6's or in certain positions that might determine whether they're moved. After working through that hypothesis, I found it wasn't exact.\n\nThen I realized that it's important to understand the concept of \"reachability\" via the common color (7) among the target. Basically, 6s are walls, and 7s are passages. This means I'm looking for paths from the target to the rest of the grid. Any 9 reachable from the target gets moved.\n\nI've tested this hypothesis on all three examples and test input. The rule holds: **Move any 9s that are reachable from the central 3x3 box by traveling via background color 7.** 6 is a barrier. This also helps explain why some 9s remain unchanged, as they're separated by those barriers. Also any of the input's 9s that are \"inside the compartment\" surrounding the 3x3 target move.\n\nNow it is a matter of writing out the construction details of the solution:\n\n1.  Identify the main compartment using the connectivity of the colors to establish.\n2.  All those 9s become part of a larger cluster that will replace background color 7 and be moved to target region.\n3.  The main goal is identifying any 9s that are reachable to central structure and can replace current numbers with background color 7.\n4.  Apply this to the test case, checking it to make sure it functions as planned!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to identify a transformation rule based on three examples and apply it to a test input.\nThe grids contain integers 0-9. The prominent features are a central 3x3 box (usually green 3s with a red 2 center), scattered maroon 9s, and magenta 6s forming walls or containers.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Example 1:** Two 9s from a small \"room\" in the bottom-right (connected to the central box via a gap) move into the central 3x3 box. The 9s elsewhere (isolated by 6-walls) stay put. The moved 9s are replaced by the background color 7. The target box fills up with 9s in reading order (row by row), skipping the center 2.\n2.  **Example 2:** Many 9s move. The ones that move are those connected to the central area (the \"inside\" or \"connected component\" defined by the 6-walls). The top-right 9s are separated by a wall of 6s and do not move. The moved 9s fill the target box completely.\n3.  **Example 3:** There are no 6-walls. All 9s in the grid move to the target box.\n\n** inferred Rule:**\n1.  Identify the **connected component** of the background (7) that contains the central 3x3 box `(4..6, 4..6)`. The 6s act as walls blocking the connection.\n2.  Find all **9s** that are reachable from the central box within this component. 9s act as part of the path (or are collected upon reach).\n3.  Move these reachable 9s into the central 3x3 box.\n    -   The original positions of the 9s become 7.\n    -   The target box is filled with the collected 9s in reading order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).\n    -   The center pixel `(5,5)` (value 2) is preserved and skipped during filling.\n    -   Any unfilled slots in the target box remain as their original value (3).\n4.  Any 9s not connected to the center (isolated by 6s or outside the main container) remain unchanged.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n-   **Central Box:** Rows 4-6, Cols 4-6.\n-   **Structure of 6s:**\n    -   Row 1 is a solid wall of 6s.\n    -   Col 1 is a wall of 6s.\n    -   Col 9 is a wall of 6s.\n    -   Row 9 is a wall of 6s.\n    -   This forms a large rectangular container `(1..9, 1..9)`.\n    -   There are internal 6s in Row 3 and Row 7, but they have gaps (at col 5), allowing access to the top and bottom sections of the container.\n    -   The walls of the central box itself (at cols 3 and 7) have gaps in Row 5, ensuring the center is connected to the left and right sides of the container.\n-   **Identifying 9s:**\n    -   **Outside 9s (do not move):**\n        -   Row 0: `(0,2), (0,8)` (Above Row 1 wall).\n        -   Row 2: `(2,0), (2,10)` (Left of Col 1 / Right of Col 9).\n        -   Row 3: `(3,10)` (Right of Col 9).\n        -   Row 4: `(4,10)` (Right of Col 9).\n        -   Row 5: `(5,10)` (Right of Col 9).\n        -   Row 7: `(7,10)` (Right of Col 9).\n    -   **Inside 9s (Connected to center -> Move):**\n        -   Row 2: `(2,2)` and `(2,8)`. (Inside the main container).\n        -   Row 8: `(8,2)`, `(8,5)`, `(8,8)`. (Inside the main container).\n-   **Total Movers:** 5.\n-   **Filling Target:**\n    -   The target slots are indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 (skipping 4, the center).\n    -   We have 5 9s. We fill slots 0, 1, 2, 3, 5.\n    -   Slots: `(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6)`.\n    -   `(5,5)` stays 2.\n    -   `(6,4), (6,5), (6,6)` stay 3.\n\n**Transformation:**\n1.  Set `(2,2), (2,8), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8)` to 7.\n2.  Set `(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6)` to 9.\n3.  Keep everything else as is.\n\n**Input Grid:**\n```\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n9,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,3,2,3,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,9,7,7,9,7,7,9,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n```\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n-   Row 2: `9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7` (9s at 2,8 become 7)\n-   Row 4: `7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,9` (Center 3s become 9s)\n-   Row 5: `7,6,7,7,9,2,9,7,7,6,9` (Side 3s become 9s, Center 2 stays)\n-   Row 8: `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7` (9s at 2,5,8 become 7)\n\n**Completed Output:**\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,9,2,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6",

Each grid has a 3\u00d73 region with 3s surrounding a center 2\n2. There are scattered 9s throughout the grid\n3. Some grids have 6s forming frame/wall structures\n\n**Key observations:**\n- 9s that can reach the 3\u00d73 region through paths of 7s (not blocked by 6s) get \"absorbed\"\n- The absorbed 9s disappear (become 7s)\n- The 3\u00d73 gets filled with 9s equal to the count of absorbed 9s\n- Filling goes left-to-right, top-to-bottom, skipping the center 2 unless needed\n\n**Applying to test input:**\n\nThe 3\u00d73 is at rows 4-6, cols 4-6. The 6s form a complex frame structure.\n\nTracing connectivity from the 3\u00d73:\n- Through opening at (7,5)\u2192(8,5)=9 \u2713\n- From (8,5): reach (8,2)=9 and (8,8)=9 \u2713\n- From (8,2): up through col 2 to (2,2)=9 \u2713\n- From (8,8): up through col 8 to (2,8)=9 \u2713\n- From (8,8): down to (10,x) and around to (2,0)=9 \u2713\n\n**Connected 9s (absorbed):** (8,5), (8,2), (8,8), (2,2), (2,8), (2,0) = **6 nines**\n\n**Isolated 9s (stay):** (0,2), (0,8) blocked by row 1 full 6-wall; (3,10), (5,10), (7,10) isolated in col 10\n\n**Filling 6 cells in 3\u00d73:**\n- (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) \u2192 9\n- (5,4) \u2192 9, skip (5,5)=2, (5,6) \u2192 9  \n- (6,4) \u2192 9\n\nResult 3\u00d73:\n```\n9,9,9\n9,2,9\n9,3,3\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,2,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n```",

Those 9s at `(8,7)` and `(8,8)` are the only ones that move.\n  - Example 3: there is no 6 at all, so the entire grid is effectively \u201cinterior\u201d; **all** 9s are treated as source.\n- The number of source 9s, call it K, then determines how many cells inside the 3\u00d73 are turned to 9:\n  - The K cells of the 3\u00d73 are filled with 9s in **row-major order** from the top-left of the 3\u00d73:\n    - Cell order: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n  - The same K source 9 cells are turned into 7.\n- Example 3 (no 6): 4 source 9s \u2192 first 4 cells of the 3\u00d73 become 9.\n- Example 1 (strong 6-frame): 2 source 9s in the lowest interior row (row 8) \u2192 first 2 cells of the 3\u00d73 become 9.\n\nThe **test grid** has a strong 6-frame very similar in spirit to example 1: 6s on row 1 and row 9, and vertical 6-columns at col 1 and col 9, giving a large rectangular interior with the 3\u00d73 inside it. So I apply the \u201cframe-case\u201d logic analogous to example 1:\n\n1. **Define the interior** bounded by the 6-frame:\n\n   - The outer 6-frame is on rows 1 and 9 and columns 1 and 9.\n   - The interior (where we look for source 9s) is rows 2\u20138 and cols 2\u20138 (0-based).\n\n2. **Find the lowest interior row that contains any 9s**:\n\n   In the test input, interior rows 2\u20138, cols 2\u20138:\n\n   - Row 2: 9 at cols 2 and 8.\n   - Row 3: none in cols 2\u20138.\n   - Row 4: none.\n   - Row 5: none.\n   - Row 6: none.\n   - Row 7: none.\n   - Row 8: 9 at cols 2, 5, and 8.\n\n   The **lowest** interior row with 9s is row 8, and in that row the source 9s are at:\n\n   - (8,2), (8,5), (8,8)\n\n   So \\(K = 3\\) source 9s.\n\n3. **Move these K 9s into the central 3\u00d73**:\n\n   - Fill K=3 cells of the 3\u00d73 in row-major order with 9:\n\n     Central 3\u00d73 cells in order:\n     - 1st: (4,4)\n     - 2nd: (4,5)\n     - 3rd: (4,6)\n     - \u2026\n\n   - Turn those three cells from 3 to 9.\n\n4. **Erase the K source 9s**:\n\n   - Set (8,2), (8,5), (8,8) from 9 to 7.\n\n5. All other cells remain unchanged.\n\n## Applying to the test grid\n\nOriginal test input:\n\nrow 0: 6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6  \nrow 1: 6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \nrow 2: 9,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,7  \nrow 3: 7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9  \nrow 4: 7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7  \nrow 5: 7,6,7,7,3,2,3,7,7,6,9  \nrow 6: 7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7  \nrow 7: 7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9  \nrow 8: 7,6,9,7,7,9,7,7,9,6,7  \nrow 9: 7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6  \nrow10: 7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6  \n\nTwo groups of changes:\n\n- Central 3\u00d73 block (rows 4\u20136, cols 4\u20136):\n\n  - (4,4): 3 \u2192 9\n  - (4,5): 3 \u2192 9\n  - (4,6): 3 \u2192 9\n\n- Source 9s in lowest interior row (row 8, cols 2,5,8):\n\n  - (8,2): 9 \u2192 7\n  - (8,5): 9 \u2192 7\n  - (8,8): 9 \u2192 7\n\nEverything else unchanged.\n\nSo the **output grid** is:\n\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n9,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,7  \n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9  \n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7  \n7,6,7,7,3,2,3,7,7,6,9  \n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7  \n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9  \n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7  \n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Below is the reasoning I actually used to produce an output, even though I was **not** able to infer a clean, consistent rule that matches all three training examples perfectly. I\u2019ll explain what *pattern* I did detect (central \u201cpooling\u201d of some 9\u2019s into the 3\u00d73 3\u20112\u20113 block), how I turned that into a concrete procedure for the test, and then show the resulting grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What is clearly happening in the examples\n\nAcross all three examples:\n\n- There is a central 3\u00d73 pattern of 3\u2019s with a 2 in the middle:\n  - Shape:\n    - 3 3 3  \n      3 2 3  \n      3 3 3\n- Outside that 3\u00d73, there are scattered 9\u2019s.\n- In the **output**, some of those 9\u2019s disappear (become 7), and some of the central 3\u2019s (and sometimes the 2) are turned into 9.\n- In every example, the **number of 9\u2019s stays the same overall**:\n  - Example 1: 12 input 9\u2019s \u2192 still 12 output 9\u2019s, but now 2 of them are in the 3\u00d73.\n  - Example 2: 15 input 9\u2019s \u2192 15 output 9\u2019s, 9 of them now form a solid 3\u00d73 block of 9\u2019s.\n  - Example 3: 4 input 9\u2019s \u2192 4 output 9\u2019s, all moved into the 3\u00d73.\n- The places inside the 3\u00d73 that become 9\u2019s follow a fixed **order**: reading order (row-major) of that 3\u00d73:\n  - positions:\n    1.

(7,7)\n  - Example 1: only positions 1 and 2 are changed to 9.\n  - Example 3: positions 1,2,3,4 are changed to 9.\n  - Example 2: all 1\u20139 are changed to 9.\n\nSo one robust and simple piece we can rely on:\n\n> When we \u201cmove\u201d some 9\u2019s into the central 3\u00d73, they always occupy the 3\u00d73 in that fixed row-major order: fill (5,5), then (5,6), then (5,7), then (6,5), etc.\n\nThe part I could not deduce cleanly is the **exact rule for how many 9\u2019s** (N) get moved from outside into the 3\u00d73, because:\n\n- Example 1: 12 external 9\u2019s \u2192 N = 2 used in the 3\u00d73.\n- Example 2: 15 external 9\u2019s \u2192 N = 9 (max possible) used.\n- Example 3: 4 external 9\u2019s \u2192 N = 4 (all of them) used.\n\nI tried many geometric, adjacency-based, and path-based hypotheses to explain N (based on quadrants, distances to the center, adjacency to 6\u2019s, cluster structure, etc.), but could not find one that matches all three examples simultaneously in a simple way.\n\n---\n\n## 2. A concrete (but heuristic) procedure I applied to the test\n\nGiven that:\n\n- The **insertion order into the 3\u00d73 is clear** and consistent.\n- But the **exact count N** of 9\u2019s to move is not clearly determined from the three examples.\n\nI chose a **reasonable heuristic** for the test grid:\n\n1. **Identify the central 3\u00d73 block** (rows 5\u20137, cols 5\u20137) with the 3\u20112\u20113 pattern.\n2. **Count all 9\u2019s** in the grid. In the test, there are 11 such cells.\n3. Choose a moderate number of 9\u2019s to move into the 3\u00d73, consistent with the kind of partial filling seen in Example 3:\n   - Example 3 also had dispersed 9\u2019s and filled the first 4 positions of the 3\u00d73.  \n   - The test\u2019s distribution of 9\u2019s is more like Example 3 (many isolated 9\u2019s) than like Example 2 (which had a big tight cluster), so I decided to move **4** 9\u2019s into the central block.\n\n4. **Select which 4 9\u2019s to move**:\n   - I compute Manhattan distance from each 9 to the center (6,6).\n   - I pick the four nearest 9\u2019s (ties broken in some fixed way: choose a nearby and fairly \u201ccentral\u201d set).\n   - For the test, I selected these donors:\n     - (3,3), (3,9), (6,11), (9,6)\n   - For each donor:\n     - Set its original cell to background (7).\n     - Use that \u201cfreed\u201d 9 to occupy the next available slot (in row-major) in the 3\u00d73.\n\n5. **Fill the central 3\u00d73 in row-major order** with 9\u2019s for those 4 slots:\n   - Positions filled:\n     1. (5,5) \u2190 9\n     2. (5,6) \u2190 9\n     3. (5,7) \u2190 9\n     4. (6,5) \u2190 9\n   - The rest of the 3\u00d73 remains as in the input: (6,6) stays 2; others remain 3.\n\nAll other cells stay unchanged.\n\nI must stress: this heuristic matches the *pattern* of how 9\u2019s are arranged inside the central 3\u00d73 (row\u2011major filling), but the **choice N = 4 and the exact donors** is a best-effort guess, not a guaranteed reconstruction of the original ARC rule.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Applying that procedure to the test input\n\nStarting test input (for reference):\n\n1.  6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6  \n2.  6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n3.  9,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,7  \n4.  7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9  \n5.  7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7  \n6.  7,6,7,7,3,2,3,7,7,6,9  \n7.  7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7  \n8.  7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9  \n9.  7,6,9,7,7,9,7,7,9,6,7  \n10. 7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6  \n11. 7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6  \n\n### 3.1. Modify the central 3\u00d73\n\nCentral 3\u00d73 (rows 5\u20137, cols 5\u20137) initially:\n\n- Row5: 3,3,3   (cols 5,6,7)\n- Row6: 3,2,3\n- Row7: 3,3,3\n\nWe fill first 4 cells in row-major with 9:\n\n1. (5,5) becomes 9.\n2. (5,6) becomes 9.\n3. (5,7) becomes 9.\n4. (6,5) becomes 9.\n\nSo rows 5\u20137, cols 5\u20137 become:\n\n- Row5 (5\u20137): 9,9,9\n- Row6 (5\u20137): 9,2,3\n- Row7 (5\u20137): 3,3,3\n\n### 3.2. Clear the 4 chosen donor 9\u2019s\n\nI chose donors at:\n\n- (3,3) \u2192 9 becomes 7.\n- (3,9) \u2192 9 becomes 7.\n- (6,11) \u2192 9 becomes 7.\n- (9,6) \u2192 9 becomes 7.\n\nApply those:\n\n- Row3: was `9,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,7`  \n  becomes `9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7` (c3 and c9 set to 7)\n- Row6: was `7,6,7,7,3,2,3,7,7,6,9`  \n  becomes `7,6,7,7,9,2,3,7,7,6,7` (c5 updated to 9 from step 3.1, c11 set to 7)\n- Row9: was `7,6,9,7,7,9,7,7,9,6,7`  \n  becomes `7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,7` (c6 set to 7)\n\nAll other cells unchanged.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Final output grid\n\nPutting it all together, the resulting output grid is:\n\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6  \n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7  \n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9  \n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7  \n7,6,7,7,9,2,3,7,7,6,7  \n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7  \n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9  \n7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,7  \n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6",
