I see a pattern-based transformation here.  First, I'm identifying \"markers\" in the input grid.  These markers, each with a specific color, seem to trigger the output of a pre-defined \"pattern\" or \"sprite\".  Each pattern is 4x4, and is defined by blocks of color in the input.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n*   **Mapping:** The key is figuring out the mapping between input marker color and output pattern. I found that different input colors trigger specific output patterns. The mappings are as follows:\n    *   `2` (Red) triggers a Yellow (4) Hollow Square.\n    *   `3` (Green) triggers a Blue (1) Hollow Circle/Diamond.\n    *   `5` triggers a Magenta (6) Steps pattern.\n    *   `8` (from Example 4 and the Test Input) triggers an Orange (7) \"X\" or Hourglass pattern.\n*   **Pattern Definition:** Importantly, the input grid seems to *define* these patterns through blocks of color. Each input block with a unique pattern (like the \"Steps\" pattern) is tied to a specific marker (like 5 or 8). Where there's a marker and pattern in the input, the output replaces the marker with the pattern. The original pattern, if present in the input *without* a marker, is removed (replaced with zeros).\n*   **Test Input Strategy:** The Test Input grid has specific locations where a pattern is defined, and where the markers are located.  For this specific test case, the problem is about replacing markers and keeping the same definition throughout the grid.\n\n**Applying the Rules:**\n\nThe solution strategy is:\n\n1.  **Identify Marker Locations:** I'll locate the instances of marker `8` in the Test Input (at rows 1, 5, 9, 13, and 17).\n2.  **Locate Pattern definition:** I found the \"hourglass\" pattern in the Test Input, at Rows 5-8, Cols 4-7.\n3.  **Draw Patterns:** For each marker `8`, I will place the Orange \"X\" pattern at that location. Note: if the boundary of the grid would be exceeded, I have to *clip* to the boundary, as is the ARC way. Where the pattern definition itself is, if there is no corresponding marker, fill the region with 0s.\n4.  **No Overlap:** The way the markers are placed guarantees that there will be no overlap, so each pattern is in its own space.\n\nThis should give me the correct output, which is the Orange \"X\" pattern repeated across the grid at the marker locations, with the pattern defined area replaced with zeros.  I have double-checked the logic and the calculations, and I'm ready to produce the solution!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid containing \"markers\" and a \"pattern definition\" into a completed grid where the markers are replaced by the pattern.\n\n**Analysis of the Transformation Rule:**\n1.  **Identify Markers:** In the input grid, single non-zero pixels act as markers. Their color indicates which pattern they should be replaced with. In the solved examples:\n    *   Marker `2` (Red) $\\rightarrow$ Yellow (`4`) Hollow Square pattern.\n    *   Marker `3` (Green) $\\rightarrow$ Blue (`1`) Diamond/Circle pattern.\n    *   Marker `5` (Gray) $\\rightarrow$ Magenta (`6`) Steps pattern.\n    *   Marker `8` (Azure) $\\rightarrow$ Orange (`7`) X/Hourglass pattern.\n2.  **Identify Pattern Definitions:** The input grid may contain a fully drawn example of a pattern. In the output, this definition is removed (replaced by `0`s) unless a marker is present at its top-left corner.\n    *   In the Test Input, we see a pattern made of color `7` (Orange) located at rows 5-8, columns 4-7.\n    *   The shape of this pattern is:\n        ```\n        7,0,0,7\n        0,7,7,0\n        0,7,7,0\n        7,0,0,7\n        ```\n    *   The markers in the Test Input are color `8` (Azure). Based on Example 4 and the presence of the `7` pattern, we infer that marker `8` triggers the Orange X pattern.\n3.  **Apply Transformation:**\n    *   Locate every `8` in the input grid.\n    *   Replace each `8` with the 4x4 Orange X pattern, anchored with the top-left of the pattern at the position of the `8`.\n    *   Any area not covered by a pattern expansion (including the original definition area if it lacks a marker) becomes `0` (Black).\n    *   If a pattern extends beyond the grid boundaries, it is clipped.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Grid Size:** 20x20.\n*   **Pattern:** Orange X (color 7).\n*   **Marker Locations (Color 8):**\n    *   Row 1: Columns 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n    *   Row 5: Columns 0, 16. (Note: The definition at col 4 is removed).\n    *   Row 9: Columns 0, 8, 16.\n    *   Row 13: Columns 0, 12, 16.\n    *   Row 17: Columns 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n*   **Clipping:** The markers on Row 17 will generate a 4-high pattern at rows 17, 18, 19, 20. Since the grid ends at row 19, the last row of the pattern is clipped.\n\n**Step-by-Step Construction:**\n\n*   **Row 0:** No markers. Output is all `0`s.\n*   **Rows 1-4:** Markers at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. The pattern repeats 5 times across the width.\n    *   Row 1: `7,0,0,7` repeated 5 times.\n    *   Row 2: `0,7,7,0` repeated 5 times.\n    *   Row 3: `0,7,7,0` repeated 5 times.\n    *   Row 4: `7,0,0,7` repeated 5 times.\n*   **Rows 5-8:** Markers at 0, 16.\n    *   Cols 0-3: Pattern.\n    *   Cols 4-15: Empty (`0`s).\n    *   Cols 16-19: Pattern.\n*   **Rows 9-12:** Markers at 0, 8, 16.\n    *   Cols 0-3: Pattern.\n    *   Cols 4-7: Empty.\n    *   Cols 8-11: Pattern.\n    *   Cols 12-15: Empty.\n    *   Cols 16-19: Pattern.\n*   **Rows 13-16:** Markers at 0, 12, 16.\n    *   Cols 0-3: Pattern.\n    *   Cols 4-11: Empty.\n    *   Cols 12-15: Pattern.\n    *   Cols 16-19: Pattern.\n*   **Rows 17-19:** Markers at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.

The core challenge is deciphering how the input grids (made of numbers 0-9) are mapped to output grids, which also contain numbers. I suspect a key is to identify specific \"markers\" in the input that trigger the generation of particular patterns or shapes in the output. Based on this, it's a pattern recognition plus execution task.\n\n**Deconstructing the Example Transformations:**\n\nLet's begin by deconstructing each example step by step, focusing on mapping input values to output patterns. The initial goal is to find a recurring relationship. Looking at the examples, the outputs seem to consist of distinct shapes or \"glyphs\" composed of specific numbers. A quick scan of the first few rows shows 2D grids as input and output. The task is to infer the transformation.\n\n*   **Example 1**:\n    *   Looking at example 1, it's 20x20 in both input and output. It appears the rule is not row-based processing. The output features distinct shapes or \"glyphs\", such as a hollow 4x4 squares (value 4), and another pattern that is hard to determine initially. But also the diamond/circle shape with 1s.\n    *   I've noticed something. I need to index 0-indexed as opposed to 1-indexed. The input's numbers form a grid. Specifically, it's obvious to me that the shapes or glyphs in output are related to numbers in the input. For instance, input has a 6x6, and in the output, you can find diagonal lines, with 6 values. 2 input seems to correspond to the rectangular shapes on output.\n    *   Let's check the relation of input-output. Top-Left: a block of 6 in input maps to a diagonal line-looking glyph.\n    *   Hypothesis: A particular input number (e.g., 6) maps to a distinct shape in the output. I should check which input number generates which output shape. This is likely how the task has been solved.\n    *   I'll refer to specific input-output pairs as the pairs of number and their respective shapes.\n*   **Example 2**:\n    *   Going to Example 2 (smaller 10x10 grids).\n    *   The 3 in the top left in input generates a distinct pattern (circle of 1s) in output.\n    *   Input 2, at another location, also generates another shape.\n    *   It seems each input number corresponds to a unique output shape.\n    *   In the input, there are some patterns, for example, the pattern \"0, 0, 3, 0\" in a row. It is related to shape 1 in the output.\n\n**Establishing the Marker-to-Shape Mapping:**\n\n*   Based on these preliminary observations from Example 1 and Example 2, I form a hypothesis: specific input numbers (\"markers\") define what and where to draw shapes in the output. The shape themselves will be predetermined. So now, my goal is to figure out each specific input-output map, and the relationship of the numbers, input numbers with locations on output.\n*   **Example 1 Again**:\n    *   Input: A 6 maps to some Checkers, and 2 to 4.\n    *   Input: 3 is producing an output that looks like the \"circle of 1s\".\n*   **Example 2**:\n    *   I see a '3' generating the circle and '2' generating a 'box'.\n*   I can state my current hypothesis:\n    *   **2 -> 4** (\"Box\")\n    *   **3 -> 1** (\"Circle\")\n    *   **5 -> 6** (\"Checkers\" / diagonal).\n*   **Example 4**:\n    *   Example 4 uses all values. The Input has an 8 mapped to what looks like a pattern of 7's at the output.\n    *   **8 -> 7** (\"X\" / Orange pattern).\n*   In summary, these are the current mappings:\n\n    *   **2 -> 4 (Box)**\n    *   **3 -> 1 (Circle)**\n    *   **5 -> 6 (Checkers)**\n    *   **8 -> 7 (X)**\n*   From observation, input looks like a grid. I suspect the markers are at the corners of a grid.\n*   Ex 4 tells me they are at positions r%4==0, c%4==0, where r,c is index.\n\n**Identifying the Grid and Marker\n\nThe problem asks us to infer a transformation rule from examples and apply it to a test input. The input and output grids represent colors using integers 0-9.\n\n### Analysis of Examples\n\n1.  **Markers and Shapes**:\n    By comparing the inputs and outputs, we can observe that specific single pixels in the input act as \"markers\" or \"seeds\" that generate 4x4 patterns in the output. The color of the marker determines the color and shape of the output pattern.\n    \n    *   **Marker 2** generates a yellow (4) **Hollow Box**:\n        ```\n        4 4 4 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 4 4 4\n        ```\n    *   **Marker 3** generates a blue (1) **Hollow Circle/Diamond**:\n        ```\n        0 1 1 0\n        1 0 0 1\n        1 0 0 1\n        0 1 1 0\n        ```\n    *   **Marker 5** generates a pink (6) **Checkers** pattern:\n        ```\n        6 6 0 0\n        6 6 0 0\n        0 0 6 6\n        0 0 6 6\n        ```\n    *   **Marker 8** generates an orange (7) **X** pattern (deduced from Example 4):\n        ```\n        7 0 0 7\n        0 7 7 0\n        0 7 7 0\n        7 0 0 7\n        ```\n\n2.  **Positioning**:\n    The position of the marker in the input grid corresponds exactly to the **top-left corner** (row, column) of the 4x4 shape in the output grid.\n    *   In Example 4, markers are at indices like (0,0), (0,4), etc., and the shapes perfectly fill the 4x4 blocks starting at those coordinates.\n    *   In Example 3, a marker 2 at (6,0) produces a shape starting at row 6, col 0.\n\n3.  **Noise and Cleanup**:\n    *   The input grids often contain \"debris\" or pre-existing shapes (e.g., solid blocks of 6s in Example 1, a partial shape of 1s in Example 2, or a shape of 4s in Example 3).\n    *   The transformation **clears the grid** to 0 (black) and only draws the shapes generated by valid markers.\n    *   Valid markers are isolated pixels of values 2, 3, 5, or 8. If a shape is present in the input but its corresponding marker is missing (like the box of 4s in Example 3 which lacks a marker 2), it is removed.\n\n### Application to Test Input\n\n1.  **Identify Markers**:\n    We scan the test input (20x20 grid) for markers. The only valid markers present are **8s**.\n    The positions of the 8s are:\n    *   **Row 1**: Cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n    *   **Row 5**: Cols 0, 16.\n    *   **Row 9**: Cols 0, 8, 16.\n    *   **Row 13**: Cols 0, 12, 16.\n    *   **Row 17**: Cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n\n    *Note: There is a pre-existing orange (7) \"X\" shape at Row 5, Col 4. However, there is no marker '8' at (5,4) to generate it. Based on the rules (specifically Example 3), this pre-existing shape is treated as debris and removed.*\n\n2.  **Generate Output**:\n    We create a blank 20x20 grid and draw the 4x4 \"X\" shape (color 7) at each marker location.\n    \n    *   **Row 1 markers**: Generate a continuous strip of patterns from row 1 to 4.\n    *   **Row 5 markers**: Generate patterns at the left and right edges (cols 0-3 and 16-19).\n    *   **Row 9 markers**: Generate patterns at edges and the center (cols 8-11).\n    *   **Row 13 markers**: Generate patterns at edges and col 12-15.\n    *   **Row 17 markers**: Generate a continuous strip starting at row 17. Since the grid ends at row 19, the 4th row of these shapes (which would be at row 20) is clipped.\n\n### Completed Output Grid Construction\n\n*   **Row 0**: All 0s.\n*   **Rows 1-4**: Five shapes side-by-side.\n*   **Rows 5-8**: Shapes at far left and far right. Center area is 0s.\n*   **Rows 9-12**: Shapes at left, middle, right.\n*   **Rows 13-16**: Shapes at left, (gap), right-middle, right.\n*   **Rows 17-19**: Five shapes side-by-side, bottom row clipped.\n\nHere is the final output grid:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n</REASONING_MODEL_B>\n<REASONING_MODEL_C model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_2_step_1\">\nLooking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation:\n\n1. **Grid Structure**: The input has a grid defined by marker positions (single colored pixels) at regular intervals\n2. **Shape Template**: There's a 4x4 pattern defined somewhere in the input\n3. **Marker-to-Pattern Mapping**: Each marker color maps to a specific output color and pattern:\n   - 2 \u2192 4 (hollow square pattern)\n   - 3 \u2192 1 (edge outline pattern)\n   - 5 \u2192 6 (diagonal 2x2 blocks pattern)\n   - 8 \u2192 7 (X/cross pattern)\n\n4. **Drawing Rule**: For each grid cell with a marker, draw the corresponding pattern.

My brain immediately jumps into analyze-the-examples mode. My first thought is to understand the rules by looking for patterns in a few provided examples.  I know I'm dealing with a grid and a set of instructions, and the goal is likely to transform the input grid into a different output grid.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis: Pinpointing Potential Rules**\n\nExample 1 is a 20x20 grid, so I start there. I start by observing what's contained in the grid, seeing clusters of 6s, some isolated pixels. I see a pattern to the layout, I check if the output grid is also the same size. I think that the size of the input and output is the same, and I start wondering how the input relates to the output. My mind quickly goes to 4x4 blocks because the number 20 is divisible by 4.\n\nI try to break down Example 1 and check the arrangement of the numbers, looking for alignment between the input numbers and what that generates in the output. I start thinking: are these values in the input coordinates?\n\nMy focus shifts towards seeing those 2x2 blocks of 6s and what those map to in the output. I get confused with indices and coordinates, and I re-read the input text carefully. I start analyzing the layout of the 6s in the input, but then I remember I need to connect them with the layout of the output. I keep going deeper and try to understand how an \"input block\" maps to an \"output block.\"\n\n**Hypothesis: Mapping and Pattern Generation**\n\nIt's clear the example is a map, so I quickly form a hypothesis: the non-zero pixels in the input are markers that *trigger* pre-defined patterns in the output. I want to test if that hypothesis works out. I'm focusing now on the mapping aspect.\n\nI start testing this by looking at Example 2. I compare the input and output positions, and I now need to determine what pattern each non-zero pixel in the input corresponds to in the output. I realize the output grids appear to have simple \"shapes\" made of numbers, in this case, 1 and 4, and I want to determine how the input values select them.\n\n**Testing the Hypothesis with Coordinates and Patterns**\n\nI meticulously check coordinates. Example 2 now. The input shows a pixel with the number 3, and I see what that generated in the output. I check the output, row by row and coordinate by coordinate. I notice a pattern emerging, I can draw the \"shape\" that the number 3 forms. I call this the \"shape 3.\"\n\nI then repeat this for other pixels, like the 2 in the input grid. I quickly see this as the \"hollow square of 4s\". I try to connect the dots and think: Is there a general rule where each input value produces a unique shape in the output?\n\nI observe the pixels and the shapes, and I start relating how the values of the pixels correlate with the outputs. I want to know if the value of the pixel determines the shape.  I look at a different set of 1's and test if the input values are linked to the layout in the output. I start thinking there may be other information to consider that is not explicitly written.\n\n**Seeds and Overlapping Patterns**\n\nI then hit a stumbling block with Example 2. I have a cluster of 1s in the input, which *resembles* the shape already, but it doesn't quite work. I notice the shapes are drawn at the position of specific *trigger* pixels, not by patterns present in the input.\n\nThis is a turning point.  I have the idea of a \"seed\" pixel, and I can start understanding what makes a seed \"valid.\" I begin to question what those 1s mean. Are they just noise? Are they part of the output shape? Or something else? I also start to question what defines the output's pixel layout.\n\nI re-examine the Examples. I look at Example 3: I have a full \"hollow square of 4s,\" so I want to know what this pre-existing pattern does.  I now have a hunch about *overlapping*. What happens when an input pixel value would generate a pattern which overlaps with a pre-existing pattern? I start seeing a clearer rule: Replace the seeds and remove everything else!\n\nI examine Example 3. I see a connection between the seeds with the number 2, and I realize a very important rule: I've to remove everything else, which means the initial pattern disappears! I test what happens if two patterns may overlap.\n\n**Grid Alignment and Valid Seeds**\n\nI then check Example 1 to see how to define the coordinates of\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid of integers based on rules inferred from examples.\n\n**Inferred Rules:**\n1.  **Seeds and Patterns:** The input grid contains \"seed\" pixels (single non-zero integers) that trigger the creation of a specific 4x4 pattern in the output grid.\n    *   **Seed `2`** creates a **Hollow Square of `4`s**:\n        ```\n        4 4 4 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 4 4 4\n        ```\n    *   **Seed `3`** creates a **Circle of `1`s**:\n        ```\n        0 1 1 0\n        1 0 0 1\n        1 0 0 1\n        0 1 1 0\n        ```\n    *   **Seed `5`** creates a **Checkerboard of `6`s**:\n        ```\n        6 6 0 0\n        6 6 0 0\n        0 0 6 6\n        0 0 6 6\n        ```\n    *   **Seed `8`** creates an **X-shape of `7`s**:\n        ```\n        7 0 0 7\n        0 7 7 0\n        0 7 7 0\n        7 0 0 7\n        ```\n\n2.  **Placement:** The top-left corner of the 4x4 pattern is placed exactly at the coordinate `(row, col)` of the seed pixel.\n3.  **Conflict/Validation:** A seed at `(r, c)` generates a pattern *only if* the 4x4 area anchored at `(r, c)` (i.e., rows `r` to `r+3` and columns `c` to `c+3`) contains no **other** seed pixels. If another seed falls within this area, the seed at `(r, c)` is considered \"blocked\" or invalid and produces nothing (or is suppressed by the other seed).\n    *   Existing patterns in the input (blocks of color corresponding to output patterns) are treated as noise/background and are removed unless regenerated by a valid seed. They do not act as seeds.\n4.  **Canvas:** The output grid starts as all zeros (black). Only the patterns from valid seeds are drawn. Patterns are clipped if they extend beyond the grid boundaries.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Grid Size:** 20x20.\n*   **Seeds Identification:** The input contains seeds of value `8`. There are also pixels of value `7`, but `7` is the pattern color for seed `8`, not a seed itself (analogous to `4`s in Example 3 not being seeds). The `7`s form a pre-existing shape at rows 5-8, cols 4-7.\n*   **Valid Seeds (Value 8):**\n    *   **Row 1:** Seeds at columns 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. None overlap or contain other seeds. All valid.\n    *   **Row 5:** Seeds at columns 0, 16. (Pixel at (5,4) is `7`, not a seed). All valid.\n    *   **Row 9:** Seeds at columns 0, 8, 16. All valid.\n    *   **Row 13:** Seeds at columns 0, 12, 16. All valid.\n    *   **Row 17:** Seeds at columns 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. All valid.\n*   **Pattern Generation:** We draw the \"X-shape of `7`s\" at each valid seed location.\n    *   The pattern at row 17 will be clipped at the bottom (rows 17, 18, 19 drawn; row 20 is out of bounds).\n    *   The pre-existing shape of `7`s at (5,4) is removed because there is no seed `8` at (5,4) to regenerate it.\n\n**Constructed Output:**\n*   **Row 0:** All 0.\n*   **Rows 1-4:** Pattern repeated at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n*   **Rows 5-8:** Pattern at 0, 16. Middle is 0.\n*   **Rows 9-12:** Pattern at 0, 8, 16.\n*   **Rows 13-16:** Pattern at 0, 12, 16.\n*   **Rows 17-19:** Pattern at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 (bottom row clipped).\n\noutput:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n</REASONING_MODEL_D>\n<REASONING_MODEL_E model_id=\"gemini-3-high_11_step_5_gemini_gen_sol\">\n**Alright, here's the breakdown of my thought process for tackling this ARC task.  It's all about pattern recognition and applying the provided rules!**\n\nFirst things first: I'm given an input grid of numbers (0-9) and I need to produce an output grid with a similar format. The key is to figure out the transformation.  I'm also told to infer the logic from a set of solved examples.  I need to use this information to determine how input grid values are mapped to output shapes.\n\nMy initial thought is to figure out the connection between the input grids and their descriptions.  The problem description gives me a mapping: `2->4`, `3->1`, `5->6`, `8->7`. So I know the value `2` should correspond to a shape with color `4` in the output, `3` corresponds to `1`, `5` maps to `6` and `8` to `7`. This seems important so I keep it in mind.\n\nI started examining **Example 1**: I'm hunting for patterns, trying to verify the initial mapping. I carefully look at the input and output grids, looking at the location of specific input values and the corresponding shapes in the output. I also made sure to confirm the grid sizes.  I realize that input values '2', '3', '5', '8' create shapes in the output.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing Example 1, I find out that the output shapes come from the *markers* which are values \"2\", \"3\", \"5\", \"8\"  In other words, the location of '2' gives the location of a 4x4 shape. I also notice existing input shapes (blocks of 6 in this example) completely disappear in the output.\n\nI confirm the initial assumption the description gives the correct mapping: `2->4`, `3->1`, `5->6`, `8->7` based on the coordinates. Example 1 also has a marker at (5,5). However, no shape is there!\n\nSo, I study **Example 2**: I look at where the values 2, 3, 5, or 8 are. The provided description says \"Any existing non-marker shapes on the grid are cleared/removed.\"  I see that values '1' form a shape. They disappear! I also see that existing shapes are removed in Example 2.\n\nI carefully examine the coordinates of these markers and corresponding shape color. I'm focusing to confirm my understanding of that transformation:\n*   Find markers: '2', '3', '5', '8'.\n*   The pixel becomes the upper-left corner of a 4x4 shape.\n\nDuring Example 2, I notice the location of an existing diamond shape made of '1's. When the markers are placed, the output has a shape made of '1's as the same color. It seems the pre-existing shapes are ignored or removed and only shapes based on input markers are present.\n\nNow for **Example 3**: I pay special attention to overlaps here, given the description. Example 3 has many '2' markers, all giving shapes. I also confirm the output here. However, I notice that one marker did not produce a shape, even though the description says markers produce a shape.\n\nI realize that shapes overlap in Example 3. I hypothesize the reason for this missing shape is the overlap: maybe there's a priority order when shapes overlap in the output grid (I'm leaning towards 'later one wins'). However, I don't know the full rule. I focus to find the rule behind this conflict.  I know that one shape is completely gone.\n\nI then study **Example 4**:  I carefully notice the input and the output.  It appears to be a much easier example.  All shapes are non-overlapping here.  I can verify here, all mappings appear correct in this example.  This reinforces my previous thinking: the conflict-free construction means all shapes are there. It looks like my assumption about overlaps is correct here.\n\nI go back to Example 3's issue.  The rule must be related to how to deal with conflicts and how the order of shapes matters.  I hypothesize:  If shape A and shape B overlap and shape B is 'later' in a specific sense (e.g. at the bottom-right of the overlapping area), B \"wins\" and overwrites A or cancels it out entirely.  I confirm it: it seems \"later one wins\", meaning, right and bottom coordinates have preference.\n\nNow, with this understanding, I can finally attack the main task!  I know the mapping from values to shape colors, the size of shapes and how to resolve overlaps (the \"later shape wins\" rule). I start from the new 20x20 grid now\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples and the object descriptions provided:\n\n1.  **Identify Transformation Rules**:\n    *   **Markers**: The input contains single pixels (values 2, 3, 5, 8) that act as \"markers\".\n    *   **Mapping**: Each marker value corresponds to a specific 4x4 pattern:\n        *   `2` $\\rightarrow$ Box (Color 4)\n        *   `3` $\\rightarrow$ Diamond (Color 1)\n        *   `5` $\\rightarrow$ Checkerboard (Color 6)\n        *   `8` $\\rightarrow$ X-shape (Color 7)\n    *   **Placement**: The marker's position $(r, c)$ becomes the top-left corner of the 4x4 pattern in the output.\n    *   **Cleanup**: Any non-marker non-zero pixels in the input (like the '7's forming a shape in the test input) are treated as background noise or existing shapes to be removed. The background is initialized to 0.\n    *   **Overlap/Clipping**: Based on the examples, patterns define the output. If a pattern extends beyond the grid boundaries (as seen in the analysis of the test input size), it is clipped.\n\n2.  **Analyze Test Input**:\n    *   **Grid Size**: 20x20.\n    *   **Markers Found**: The input contains markers with value `8`.\n        *   **Row 1** (Index 1): Cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n        *   **Row 5** (Index 5): Cols 0, 16. (Note: The shape made of 7s at (5,4) is ignored).\n        *   **Row 9** (Index 9): Cols 0, 8, 16.\n        *   **Row 13** (Index 13): Cols 0, 12, 16.\n        *   **Row 17** (Index 17): Cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n    *   **Pattern**: All markers are `8`, which maps to the **X-shape** (Color 7).\n        *   Row 0: `7, 0, 0, 7`\n        *   Row 1: `0, 7, 7, 0`\n        *   Row 2: `0, 7, 7, 0`\n        *   Row 3: `7, 0, 0, 7`\n\n3.  **Construct Output**:\n    *   **Row 0**: Empty (0s).\n    *   **Rows 1-4**: Markers at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 generate a full row of 5 X-shapes.\n    *   **Rows 5-8**: Markers at 0, 16 generate X-shapes at the far left and right. The center is empty.\n    *   **Rows 9-12**: Markers at 0, 8, 16 generate X-shapes at Left, Middle, Right.\n    *   **Rows 13-16**: Markers at 0, 12, 16 generate X-shapes at Left, and two on the Right side.\n    *   **Rows 17-19**: Markers at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 start a full row of X-shapes. However, since the grid ends at Row 19, only the first 3 rows of the pattern (Rows 17, 18, 19) are rendered. The 4th row of the pattern is clipped.\n\noutput:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n</REASONING_MODEL_E>\n<REASONING_MODEL_F model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_11_step_5_gemini_gen_sol\">\nLooking at this problem, I need to understand how single-pixel markers transform into 4x4 patterns.\n\n## Analysis\n\nFrom the examples, I can see that:\n1.

The objective is to decipher the transformation rules between input and output grids in these ARC tasks. I'm focusing on identifying consistent patterns and mappings. It seems like the core idea here is a tile-based grid, where the input defines the layout and content of these tiles, and the output reflects these definitions. Let's start with Example 1: a 20x20 input to a 20x20 output.\n\n**Example 1 Deciphering and Rule Finding**\n\nInitial thoughts: the input seems sparse, single pixels are \"anchors\" of the pattern. Examining the structure, it appears the grid is divided into 4x4 tiles, that make up a 5x5 meta grid in the 20x20 example.\nThe initial thoughts about diagonal checkerboard-like patterns were close but the data is cleaner than first thought. Specifically, there is color assignment in the tiles. These small colored shapes are repeated. I'm seeing patterns here.\nThe output seems composed of these repeating 4x4 tiles.\nInput features appear to define the content, maybe via these anchors or \"seeds\" of the tile patterns. Example 1 shows us that the `6,6` in the anchor define what output the final 4x4 block will look like. The output shows pattern `6` is a color. Let's keep this in mind.\nNow, the 20x20 means a 5x5 layout of 4x4 tiles. Let's look at the meta layout of the Input for where the patterns \"start\".\nIf we look at example 2, in a 10x10. If we split this into 4x4 tiles. The input row 1 column 1 has a `3`. The output is the color for the `3`. Input row 1 column 5 has a `2`. and the corresponding output tile is the color of the `2`.\nAlso, in example 2, it is noted that the last two columns and last two rows are all `0`. Therefore, the 10x10 example, the grid is 8x8 with 0 borders. So `3` and `2` correspond to the colors of what pattern they will be. We're on the right track here!\n\n**Hypothesis Refinement: Mapping and Definitions**\n\nIt's becoming clear: the input uses single-pixel markers to \"point\" to a specific output pattern. These single pixels are acting as \"keys\" and the 4x4 tiles are the blocks to make the output. Further analysis of examples 1 and 2, and 3: the Input marker \"seeds\" act as an \"Instruction\". So if the input is:\n`3,0,0,0`\n`0,0,0,0`\n...\nthe output is Pattern 3 (or the appropriate color) to the 4x4 pattern.\n\n**Expanding the Analysis with Example 2**\n\nGoing back to Example 2: a 10x10 grid with non-zero pixels at (1,1), (1,5), (5,1), and (5,5) that are marker pixels. The marker pixel defines the block, and also, the pixel can be mapped to another location via an \"Instruction\". So we're looking at what is the instruction, and, where is it. The example shows there is a \"map\" that allows you to figure out what color each marker has, and where it must be mapped. Here's what's going on: (1,1)=3, (1,5)=2, (5,1)=2, (5,5)=3\n(1,1)=3 should map to the instruction of the `3` pixel, but the `2` pixel has an `0`. So the single pixels instruct.\nExample 3: the non-zero pixels are at (0,0), (0,6), (4,4), and (6,0) that are marker pixels, or blocks.\nThe 0 and 10 and 6 rows of pixels create the colored structure of each instruction.\nThe pixel values are the \"Key\". For Example 3:\nPixel 4 is the instruction and key.\n`2` is the pixel and key.\nIn Example 1:\n`6` is the pixel and key.\nThe key here is that the values act as \"Keys\" for the colors in the blocks in the output. And can map to their appropriate positions.\n\n**The Marker System and Universal Mapping**\n\nThe crucial insight: markers serve as references to pattern definitions, with the color of the marker being the associated color of the pattern. The key here is not the *color*, but the relationship\n\nThe problem involves identifying a grid of 4x4 tiles where each tile's content is determined by a \"marker\" pixel at its top-left corner in the input grid.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Grid Structure**: The input and output grids are divided into 4x4 regions (tiles), often aligned to specific rows and columns.\n2.  **Markers & Patterns**:\n    *   Single non-zero pixels (markers) in the input indicate which pattern should be filled into that 4x4 tile in the output.\n    *   There is a consistent mapping from Marker Value $\\rightarrow$ Pattern Color & Shape.\n    *   **Mapping found from examples:**\n        *   Marker `2` $\\rightarrow$ Pattern `4` (Yellow hollow square).\n        *   Marker `3` $\\rightarrow$ Pattern `1` (Blue diamond).\n        *   Marker `5` $\\rightarrow$ Pattern `6` (Magenta checkerboard).\n        *   Marker `8` $\\rightarrow$ Pattern `7` (Orange X-shape).\n3.  **Pattern Definitions**:\n    *   The specific shape of a pattern is sometimes explicitly defined in the input grid itself. A tile will contain the marker at the top-left, and the rest of the 4x4 area shows the pattern pixels.\n    *   In the output, \"definition tiles\" are cleared to 0 (unless the marker is also a pointer to itself, which is not the case for `6`, `4`, `7`).\n    *   \"Pointer tiles\" (tiles with just the marker) are filled with the corresponding pattern.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Scan for Markers**:\n    *   Row 0: All 0s.\n    *   Row 1: Markers `8` at columns 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n    *   Row 5: Marker `8` at col 0, `7` at col 4, `8` at col 16. Columns 8 and 12 are 0.\n        *   Note: The tile at (5,4) contains the full pattern for color 7: `7,0,0,7` / `0,7,7,0` ... This confirms the pattern for `7`. Since `7` is the definition marker and `8` is the pointer, this tile will be cleared in the output.\n    *   Row 9: Markers `8` at columns 0, 8, 16.\n    *   Row 13: Markers `8` at columns 0, 12, 16.\n    *   Row 17: Markers `8` at columns 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n\n2.  **Determine Pattern**:\n    *   Marker `8` maps to Pattern `7`.\n    *   Pattern `7` (from the definition at Row 5, Col 4) is:\n        ```\n        7, 0, 0, 7\n        0, 7, 7, 0\n        0, 7, 7, 0\n        7, 0, 0, 7\n        ```\n\n3.  **Construct Output**:\n    *   **Row 0**: Empty (0s).\n    *   **Rows 1-4**: Fill Pattern `7` at cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n    *   **Rows 5-8**: Fill Pattern `7` at cols 0 and 16. Clear col 4 (definition). Cols 8, 12 are empty.\n    *   **Rows 9-12**: Fill Pattern `7` at cols 0, 8, 16.\n    *   **Rows 13-16**: Fill Pattern `7` at cols 0, 12, 16.\n    *   **Rows 17-19**: Fill Pattern `7` at cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. Note: The grid ends at row 19, so the last row of the 4x4 pattern is truncated.\n\n**Final Output Grid Generation**:\n\n*   **Row 1**: `7,0,0,7` repeated.\n*   **Row 2, 3**: `0,7,7,0` repeated.\n*   **Row 4**: `7,0,0,7` repeated.\n*   **Row 5**: `7,0,0,7` at start/end. Middle 0s.\n*   ...and so on following the marker layout.\n\noutput:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n</REASONING_MODEL_H>\n<REASONING_MODEL_I model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_6_step_5_deep_thinking\">\nThe transformation stamps a specific 4\u00d74 pattern for each input cell with value 2, 3, 5 or 8, using a fixed color mapping; other input values are ignored.

I've got a few examples to work with, which is great.  Looking at them, I'm noticing a few things right off the bat: the inputs are usually sparse, just a few colored pixels, while the outputs are denser with recognizable patterns, often looking like repeated tiles. The grid dimensions are all the same, 20x20.\n\nMy immediate thought is that these 4x4 blocks are key, that the whole grid is somehow broken down into those units. I analyze the examples, focusing on how input pixels map to output patterns, always keeping in mind the 4x4 blocks.  I start noticing there's a relationship between the color of a pixel in the input and the pattern it generates in the output. For example, a red pixel in the input generates a yellow square in the output. I start taking notes on the color mappings I observe.\n\nThe patterns are all 4x4, and there's usually a 1 pixel gap between each of the blocks. The question that has me is about how these blocks are arranged: it's not a direct pixel-to-pixel mapping, that much is clear, instead it seems the input is used as a type of key or seed, and the colors are a type of pattern library.\n\nSo, I figure that I need to find the \"seed\" pixels, then apply the correct pattern in the corresponding position in the output.  The output is a 20x20 grid of 4x4 blocks separated by 1-pixel spacing.  The seed is defined as a non-zero pixel in the input which drives the color of a 4x4 block in the output.  This is proven by analyzing all the examples, finding cases where seeds are at 1 row off, 1 column off and still defining the 4x4 block pattern.\n\nIt turns out that some blocks are empty, which means the seed in input grid needs a color, so if it's the right color, it drives a particular output pattern. The rule is simple: Each seed color maps to a unique 4x4 pattern, like a red pixel always results in yellow blocks, a green pixel blue ring and so on. If the input contains a pattern which \"should be the output,\" it's ignored. I need to handle cases where there are overlapping seed locations, so the pattern should be overwritten in that case.  The color 6, for instance, produces an empty black block in output. The Test input requires me to convert color 8 into an orange pattern.\n\nSo, I need to look at each seed position in the input and replace the appropriate area of the output grid with the corresponding pattern.\n\nI construct a strategy, and work the test input, by starting with a zero grid. Then I identify each seed pixel in the test input, and use their coordinates to construct the final output. The main problem is building and identifying the pattern and color mappings. All examples are considered by following the coordinate position in each of them.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a sparse input grid into a patterned output grid based on observed rules from examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:**\n    *   The grids are conceptually divided into 4x4 blocks.\n    *   The \"seeds\" in the input determine where these 4x4 patterns appear in the output.\n    *   The top-left corner of the seed pixel in the input corresponds to the top-left corner of the 4x4 pattern in the output.\n\n2.  **Color Mapping and Patterns:**\n    *   Input **Red (2)** $\\rightarrow$ Output **Yellow (4)** Hollow Square.\n        Pattern:\n        ```\n        4 4 4 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 4 4 4\n        ```\n    *   Input **Green (3)** $\\rightarrow$ Output **Blue (1)** Ring.\n        Pattern:\n        ```\n        0 1 1 0\n        1 0 0 1\n        1 0 0 1\n        0 1 1 0\n        ```\n    *   Input **Gray (5)** $\\rightarrow$ Output **Magenta (6)** Checkerboard.\n        Pattern:\n        ```\n        6 6 0 0\n        6 6 0 0\n        0 0 6 6\n        0 0 6 6\n        ```\n    *   Input **Teal (8)** $\\rightarrow$ Output **Orange (7)** Pattern.\n        Pattern:\n        ```\n        7 0 0 7\n        0 7 7 0\n        0 7 7 0\n        7 0 0 7\n        ```\n\n3.  **Behavior of Other Inputs:**\n    *   Input pixels that are part of a pre-drawn pattern (e.g., the magenta blocks in Ex 1, the yellow square in Ex 3, the partial orange pattern in the test input) are ignored and result in empty (0) output cells.

The only seed color present is **8**, so:\n\n   - All 8\u2019s will generate the pink 7\u2011glyph.\n   - The existing 7\u2011shaped pattern in the middle of the input is **ignored as an input object** (it is a leftover pink glyph with no grey seed at its top\u2011left, just like the unused 4\u2011ring in Example 3).\n\n   **Locations of 8 seeds** (1\u2011based row, column):\n\n   - Row 2:  (2,1), (2,5), (2,9), (2,13), (2,17)\n   - Row 6:  (6,1), (6,17)\n   - Row 10: (10,1), (10,9), (10,17)\n   - Row 14: (14,1), (14,13), (14,17)\n   - Row 18: (18,1), (18,5), (18,9), (18,13), (18,17)\n\n   For each such (r,c), we stamp:\n\n   ```\n   at (r+0,c+0) = 7, (r+0,c+3) = 7\n   at (r+1,c+1) = 7, (r+1,c+2) = 7\n   at (r+2,c+1) = 7, (r+2,c+2) = 7\n   at (r+3,c+0) = 7, (r+3,c+3) = 7\n   ```\n   where those coordinates lie inside the 20\u00d720 grid. For seeds on row 18, the row `r+3 = 21` lies outside, so the bottom row of the pattern is cropped.\n\n   Because all seeds are spaced at least 4 cells apart in both directions, their \\(4\\times4\\) patterns do not overlap; we simply OR them into the zero grid.\n\n---\n\n### Final output grid\n\nPutting all of these stamped glyphs together gives the following 20\u00d720 output:\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_K>\n<REASONING_MODEL_L model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\nTo solve this puzzle, I first looked at the four provided examples to spot a consistent rule. Every non\u2011zero pixel in the input that is an isolated singleton of a \u201cglyph\u201d colour is replaced by a fixed \\(4\\times 4\\) motif anchored with its top\u2011left corner at the original pixel location; all other input cells are ignored. The glyph colours and their output motifs are:\n\n- 2 (red) \u2192 colour\u202f4 motif: a full border ring `[[4,4,4,4],[4,0,0,4],[4,0,0,4],[4,4,4,4]]`\n- 3 (green) \u2192 colour\u202f1 motif: `[[0,1,1,0],[1,0,0,1],[1,0,0,1],[0,1,1,0]]`\n- 5 (grey) \u2192 colour\u202f6 motif: `[[6,6,0,0],[6,6,0,0],[0,0,6,6],[0,0,6,6]]`\n- 8 (light blue) \u2192 colour\u202f7 motif: `[[7,0,0,7],[0,7,7,0],[0,7,7,0],[7,0,0,7]]`\n\nOnly single\u2011pixel components of these colours are expanded; other colours and larger components are dropped. Patterns are clipped at the grid boundary, and because the seeds in the test are spaced by 4 both horizontally and vertically, none of the motifs overlap.\n\nIn the test input, the only glyph colour present is 8.

Further examination reveals that the inputs can be split into 4x4 blocks, and that the positions of pixels relative to these cells determine output placement.\n\n**Hypothesis Formation: Pixel-to-Pattern Mapping & Initial Rule**\n\nI hypothesize that a non-zero pixel at a coordinate (r, c) with a color 'C' triggers a specific 4x4 pattern, the top-left corner of which is placed at (r, c). I now begin to map color codes to unique patterns. For example, a red '2' generates a Yellow Hollow Square, green '3' generates a blue diamond and grey '5' creates a magenta 2x2. The pixel at (5,5) seems to break the rule, producing nothing. The top-left corner placement seems to be consistent across examples, including the 10x10 ones. I note that even in those cases where '5' does produce an output, like (11,8), it's a 2x2.\n\n**Rule Refinement & \"Solo Pixel\" Filtering**\n\nI examine why (5,5) input generates no output: (5,5) is alone on its row. I test this \"solo pixel\" rule against other examples. I find that pixels that form a group, i.e. are not alone in a row, cause output. I refine my rules with the trigger colors {2,3,5,8} and add a filter that discards trigger pixels that are alone in their row.\n\n**Pattern Preservation & Output Construction: The \"Orange X\"**\n\nAnalyzing the test input, I observe that some pixels form recognizable 7-based orange 'X' patterns. This leads me to believe I need to incorporate existing patterns. Any existing \"7\" blocks are to be kept and not overwritten.\n\n**Final Rule Set & Code Generation**\n\nIn summary, the rule is to generate the appropriate 4x4 pattern for all input colors {2,3,5,8}, discarding those that have no other non-zero pixels in their respective rows, and adding the existing 7s to the output.\n\nApplying the rule to the test input: I generate the appropriate output Orange X shape for colors that have valid input points, following the color code's specific patterns. These outputs are created by copying an existing orange 7 pattern to create the output, ensuring a final 20x20 grid that represents the test answer.\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the rules inferred from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Rules:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**: The output grids are composed of $4 \\times 4$ patterns. The position of these patterns corresponds to the position of \"trigger\" pixels in the input grid. Specifically, a non-zero pixel at $(r, c)$ in the input triggers the drawing of a $4 \\times 4$ pattern with its top-left corner at $(r, c)$ in the output.\n\n2.  **Color Mapping**: Each input color maps to a specific output pattern and color scheme.\n    *   **Input 2 (Red)** $\\rightarrow$ **Output 4 (Yellow)**: A hollow $4 \\times 4$ square.\n        ```\n        4 4 4 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 4 4 4\n        ```\n    *   **Input 3 (Green)** $\\rightarrow$ **Output 1 (Blue)**: A diamond/circle shape.\n        ```\n        0 1 1 0\n        1 0 0 1\n        1 0 0 1\n        0 1 1 0\n        ```\n    *   **Input 5 (Grey)** $\\rightarrow$ **Output 6 (Magenta)**: Two diagonal $2 \\times 2$ blocks.\n        ```\n        6 6 0 0\n        6 6 0 0\n        0 0 6 6\n        0 0 6 6\n        ```\n    *   **Input 8 (Azure)** (From Test Input/Example 4) $\\rightarrow$ **Output 7 (Orange)**: An \"X\" or hourglass shape.\n        ```\n        7 0 0 7\n        0 7 7 0\n        0 7 7 0\n        7 0 0 7\n        ```\n\n3.  **Filtering/Noise**:\n    *   Pixels of colors not in the trigger list (like 6 in Example 1) are ignored (noise).\n    *   **Isolation Rule**: A trigger pixel is only valid if it is **not** the only non-zero pixel in its row. In Example 1 and 3, isolated pixels (5 at (5,5), 2 at (4,4)) produced no output. In the test input, all trigger rows contain multiple elements, satisfying this condition.\n\n4.  **Preservation**: If the input already contains a partial or complete pattern (like the Orange X formed by 7s in the test input), it is preserved or treated as a trigger for that pattern.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Row 1**: Contains 8s at indices 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. These are valid triggers. We draw the Orange X pattern at each location.\n*   **Row 5**: Contains 8s at 0, 16. It also contains 7s at cols 4-7 forming an Orange X. This counts as a valid pattern at index 4. Indices 8 and 12 are empty gaps.\n    *   Pattern sequence: Pattern, Pattern, Gap, Gap, Pattern.\n*   **Row 9**: Contains 8s at 0, 8, 16. Gaps at 4, 12.\n    *   Pattern sequence: Pattern, Gap, Pattern, Gap, Pattern.\n*   **Row 13**: Contains 8s at 0, 12, 16. Gaps at 4, 8.\n    *   Pattern sequence: Pattern, Gap, Gap, Pattern, Pattern.\n*   **Row 17**: Contains 8s at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. All filled.\n    *   Pattern sequence: Pattern, Pattern, Pattern, Pattern, Pattern.\n    *   Note: The pattern starts at row 17. It occupies rows 17, 18, 19, 20. Since the grid is $20 \\times 20$ (rows 0-19), the last row of the pattern is clipped.\n\n**Constructing the Output Grid:**\n\n*   **Row 0**: All 0s.\n*   **Rows 1-4**: Filled by patterns from Row 1 input.\n*   **Rows 5-8**: Filled by patterns/preservation from Row 5 input.\n*   **Rows 9-12**: Filled by patterns from Row 9 input.\n*   **Rows 13-16**: Filled by patterns from Row 13 input.\n*   **Rows 17-19**: Filled by patterns from Row 17 input (clipped).\n\n**Pattern Logic (P = Orange X, _ = Empty):**\nRow 1: P P P P P\nRow 5: P P _ _ P\nRow 9: P _ P _ P\nRow 13: P _ _ P P\nRow 17: P P P P P\n\noutput:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n</REASONING_MODEL_G>\n<REASONING_MODEL_H model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_7_step_5_image\">\nLooking at the examples, I can identify the following transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Template identification**: Each input contains a template shape (like a hollow square or diagonal pattern) made of a specific color.\n\n2. **Marker system**: Single pixels of various colors act as markers that define a grid.

The user wants me to tackle an ARC problem, and the goal is to transform a grid based on some examples. It's an ARC task, so it's about finding the underlying logic and generalizing it.\n\n1.  **Understanding the Request**: The core task is clear: I have input grids, and I need to transform them to get output grids. I've got examples, which are super important because they hold the clues to the transformation. I also have some hints, but I know better than to just blindly trust them. They're often slightly off, or they only hint at part of the process.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Data**: My first step is to analyze the data. I've got examples to examine, a key aspect of these problems. I've to decode the transformation rules and see how the inputs turn into the outputs. Dimensions are constant. This is good to know, and the hints \"Glyph Expansion\", \"Rigid color mapping\", and \"Existing objects preserved\" are like breadcrumbs. I am very much checking those hints, but I know there may be a lot of nuances in the details!\n\n3.  **Digging into the examples**: The specific hint says \"Single pixels are 3x3 pattern.\" Oh, but the given examples looks like 4x4 patterns! Maybe the hint is misleading, or it's a simplification, or I'm missing something. That's a classic ARC thing, I think. I'm going to look very closely at the pixel expansions and build my understanding. The sizes seem to be: `2 -> 4-ring pattern`, `3-> 1(octagon) pattern`, `5 -> 6 pattern` etc.\n\n    *   **The Grid Size:** The input and output grids are of the same size across all examples. This offers clarity.\n\n    *   **Pattern Mapping:** The pattern is very important here. For example, if I see input `3`, the pattern that matches it seems to be centered around it. I have to align indices to the pattern grid. My intuition tells me that the top-left coordinate, (r,c), where an input value exists corresponds to the location of the top-left coordinate of the 4x4 output block.\n\n    *   **Expansion:** Input `3` at (1,1) becomes the center of a block. Input `2` at (1,5) expands to a 4x4 block. Input color, locations and the output shapes, and the pixel values of shapes within output are all related, and that's the key.\n\n    *   **Mapping Rules:** I create mapping rules: Input `3` becomes 1 Octagon. Input `2` becomes a 4-ring. Input `5` becomes 6 pattern, etc.\n\n    *   **Overlapping and Objects:** The hint states that \"Existing objects ... are preserved.\" But, is it? Example 1 seems to imply that objects that are not \"valid shapes\" will be removed. Does that mean the input objects (blocks of colors) have to conform to a specific list of *patterns*, and *colors*? Example 2 has some patterns being overwritten. I'm building a clearer view of this.\n\n4.  **Verifying Assumptions**: In example 1, I find the 2x2 blocks of `6` (magenta). They just *disappear* in the output. The hint \"existing objects...\" also doesn't apply? Is 6 a dead color? The same thing happens with example 3: the 4x4 block of yellow is just gone. My theory is that, while blocks are \"existing\" they need to be of known pattern. Or it's a matter of the \"Expansion\" overwriting the old objects.\n\n    *   I've got the rules for the patterns down to sizes and coordinates. The hint says \"expansion is centered\", but really, it's about the top-left coordinate.\n\n5.  **Let's check the test input**: The test input has a pre-existing Orange block of 7s that will, I think, be preserved.\n\n    *   I see a 4x4 `7` pattern, and a grid of `8`'s.\n    *   This is an existing object. It won't be modified in the output.\n    *   I think I need to expand the `8`s to create the pattern, but not to overwrite the original block.\n\n6.  **Forming a construction rule**: So here's the construction plan for each element in the final output grid:\n\n    *   Initialize the output grid (20x20).\n    *   Copy \"Existing Objects.\"\n    *   Find the single pixels with known colors (`\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid based on rules inferred from examples. Here is the step-by-step logical derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Transformation:**\n    The task is a \"Glyph Expansion\". Single pixels in the input (\"seeds\") are replaced by $4 \\times 4$ patterns in the output. The top-left corner of the $4 \\times 4$ output pattern corresponds to the coordinates of the input seed pixel.\n\n2.  **Determine Color Mappings and Patterns:**\n    By observing the examples, we can map specific input colors to output patterns (size $4 \\times 4$):\n    *   **Red (2) $\\to$ Yellow (4) Ring:** (Example 1 & 3)\n        ```\n        4 4 4 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 4 4 4\n        ```\n    *   **Green (3) $\\to$ Blue (1) Octagon:** (Example 2)\n        ```\n        0 1 1 0\n        1 0 0 1\n        1 0 0 1\n        0 1 1 0\n        ```\n    *   **Grey (5) $\\to$ Magenta (6) Pattern:** (Example 1)\n        ```\n        6 6 0 0\n        6 6 0 0\n        0 0 6 6\n        0 0 6 6\n        ```\n    *   **Light Blue (8) $\\to$ Orange (7) Hourglass:** (Example 4)\n        ```\n        7 0 0 7\n        0 7 7 0\n        0 7 7 0\n        7 0 0 7\n        ```\n\n3.  **Handle Existing Objects and Deletions:**\n    *   **Existing Objects:** Any pre-existing patterns that match the output format are preserved. The prompt notes that objects larger than a single pixel are copied. In the Test Input, there is a pre-formed Orange (7) pattern at rows 5-8, columns 4-7. This matches the result of an expansion, so it stays.\n    *   **Deletions:** Unrecognized single pixels or areas without seeds/objects become empty (0).\n\n4.  **Apply to Test Input:**\n    *   **Input Analysis:** The input contains seeds of color **8** (Light Blue) and one existing **7** (Orange) object.\n    *   **Grid Layout:** The seeds are positioned at intervals. They appear at rows 1, 5, 9, 13, and 17. Horizontally, they are at columns 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16.\n    *   **Expansion:** We replace every `8` with the $4 \\times 4$ Orange `7` pattern. We leave empty spaces (0) where seeds are missing. The existing object at (Row 5, Col 4) is preserved (which looks identical to an expanded seed).\n    *   **Boundary:** The grid is $20 \\times 20$.\n        *   Row 0 is empty.\n        *   Rows 1-4 contain the first row of patterns.\n        *   Rows 5-8 contain the second row of patterns.\n        *   Rows 9-12 contain the third row of patterns.\n        *   Rows 13-16 contain the fourth row of patterns.\n        *   Rows 17-19 contain the fifth row of patterns, but since the pattern is 4 pixels high and the grid ends at row 19, the last row of the pattern is truncated.\n\n    **Row-by-Row Construction Plan:**\n    *   **Row 0:** All `0`.\n    *   **Rows 1-4:** Seeds are present at cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. Full row of 5 patterns.\n    *   **Rows 5-8:** Seeds at 0, 16. Existing object at 4. Missing seeds at 8, 12. Result: Pattern, Pattern, Empty, Empty, Pattern.\n    *   **Rows 9-12:** Seeds at 0, 8, 16. Missing at 4, 12. Result: Pattern, Empty, Pattern, Empty, Pattern.\n    *   **Rows 13-16:** Seeds at 0, 12, 16. Missing at 4, 8. Result: Pattern, Empty, Empty, Pattern, Pattern.\n    *   **Rows 17-19:** Seeds at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. Full row of patterns (truncated to height 3).\n\noutput:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n</REASONING_MODEL_J>\n<REASONING_MODEL_K model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\nLooking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n## Analysis\n\n1. **Color Mapping for Single Pixels**: Single pixels expand into 4\u00d74 patterns:\n   -

Effectively we start from an all\u20110 grid and stamp patterns.\n\n4. **Apply to the test input**\n\nThe test grid is 20\u00d720.\n\n**Non-zero colors in test input:**\n\n- Color **7**: forms a 4\u00d74 block at rows 5\u20138, cols 4\u20137:\n\n  ```\n  rows 5\u20138, cols 4\u20137:\n  7 0 0 7\n  0 7 7 0\n  0 7 7 0\n  7 0 0 7\n  ```\n\n  This is exactly pattern **P4**, in color 7. This serves as an in\u2011input example of P4 but, by the global rule, **it is not copied unless its color\u2019s marker (8) appears there**. It will be removed in the output if no stamp lands there.\n\n- Color **8**: appears at the following coordinates (row, col) (0\u2011based indices):\n\n  - Row 1: (1,0), (1,4), (1,8), (1,12), (1,16)\n  - Row 5: (5,0), (5,16)\n  - Row 9: (9,0), (9,8), (9,16)\n  - Row 13: (13,0), (13,12), (13,16)\n  - Row 17: (17,0), (17,4), (17,8), (17,12), (17,16)\n\nAccording to the learned mapping, each 8 should generate a **P4** stamp (pattern of 7s) with its top\u2011left at that cell, **if** the 4\u00d74 fits.\n\n- The grid size is 20\u00d720, so valid top\u2011left anchors satisfy row \u2264 16, col \u2264 16.\n- Thus, **all 8s in row 17 are invalid** as anchors (17+3=20, off the bottom), so those markers are ignored.\n- All 8s in rows 1,5,9,13 are valid (rows 1,5,9,13 \u226416; cols 0,4,8,12,16 \u226416).\n\nSo we will stamp P4 at these anchors:\n\n- A: (1,0)\n- B: (1,4)\n- C: (1,8)\n- D: (1,12)\n- E: (1,16)\n- F: (5,0)\n- G: (5,16)\n- H: (9,0)\n- I: (9,8)\n- J: (9,16)\n- K: (13,0)\n- L: (13,12)\n- M: (13,16)\n\n**Pattern P4 coordinates relative to anchor (r,c):**\n\nWe place 7 at:\n- (r+0, c+0), (r+0, c+3)\n- (r+1, c+1), (r+1, c+2)\n- (r+2, c+1), (r+2, c+2)\n- (r+3, c+0), (r+3, c+3)\n\nStamping each of the valid anchors, and knowing there is no overlap (the anchors are spaced so each 4\u00d74 region is disjoint), we get the following 7\u2011positions by row:\n\n- Row 0: none\n- Row 1: from A\u2013E \u2192 cols 0,3,4,7,8,11,12,15,16,19\n- Row 2: from A\u2013E \u2192 cols 1,2,5,6,9,10,13,14,17,18\n- Row 3: same as row 2\n- Row 4: same as row 1\n- Row 5: from F,G \u2192 cols 0,3,16,19\n- Row 6: from F,G \u2192 cols 1,2,17,18\n- Row 7: same as row 6\n- Row 8: same as row 5\n- Row 9: from H,I,J \u2192 cols 0,3,8,11,16,19\n- Row 10: from H,I,J \u2192 cols 1,2,9,10,17,18\n- Row 11: same as row 10\n- Row 12: same as row 9\n- Row 13: from K,L,M \u2192 cols 0,3,12,15,16,19\n- Row 14: from K,L,M \u2192 cols 1,2,13,14,17,18\n- Row 15: same as row 14\n- Row 16: same as row 13\n- Rows 17\u201319: none, because row\u201117 markers are invalid and we start from 0.\n\nThe original P4 of 7s at rows 5\u20138, cols 4\u20137 is **not** tied to any 8 marker, so under the learned rule it is removed (just like the original hollow square in Example 3).\n\n5. **Final output grid**\n\nNow write each row as 20 comma\u2011separated integers (0 or 7):\n\nRow 0:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 1:\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 2:\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 3:\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 4:\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 5:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 6:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 7:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 8:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 9:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 10:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 11:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 12:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 13:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 14:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 15:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 16:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 17:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 18:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 19:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n<REASONING_MODEL_B model_id=\"gpt-5.1-high_1_step_1\">\nFirst I\u2019ll describe the pattern that\u2019s common to the training examples, then apply it to the test input.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the training examples are doing\n\nAcross the examples you can see that the outputs are built from a small set of **fixed 4\u00d74 patterns (\u201ctiles\u201d)**, always in the same colors and shapes:\n\n### The four 4\u00d74 tiles\n\nI\u2019ll write `x` for a colored cell and `.` for 0.\n\n1. **Tile A (border square, color 4)**  \n\n   ```\n   xxxx\n   x..x\n   x..x\n   xxxx\n   ```\n\n2. **Tile B (ring without corners, color 1)**  \n\n   ```\n   .xx.\n   x..x\n   x..x\n   .xx.\n   ```\n\n3. **Tile C (two 2\u00d72 blocks on the main diagonal, color 6)**  \n\n   ```\n   xx..\n   xx..\n   ..xx\n   ..xx\n   ```\n\n4. **Tile D (corners + central 2\u00d72 block, color 7)**  \n\n   ```\n   x..x\n   .xx.\n   .xx.\n   x..x\n   ```\n\nYou see these clearly in Example 4\u2019s output: it is a 5\u00d75 grid of 4\u00d74 tiles; each input number from {2,3,5,8} selects one of the four tiles:\n\n- Input 2 \u2192 Tile A (color 4)\n- Input 3 \u2192 Tile B (color 1)\n- Input 5 \u2192 Tile C (color 6)\n- Input 8 \u2192 Tile D (color 7)\n\nExample 2 and Example 1 show only some of these tiles (because their inputs use only some of the codes), but the mapping is consistent:\n\n- In Example 2:\n  - Input cells with value 2 generate Tile A (4s) at that location.\n  - Input cells with value 3 generate Tile B (1s) at that location.\n- In Example 3:\n  - We see Tile A (4s) replicated at each input 2-cell, except for the one 2-cell that is used as the \u201ctraining\u201d association with the prototype 4\u00d74 square in the input.\n- In Example 1:\n  - Input 2s produce Tile A (4s).\n  - Input 3s produce Tile B (1s).\n  - Input 5s produce Tile C (6s), again except for a single 5 which is used adjacent to a prototype pattern of 6s to \u201cdefine\u201d the mapping 5\u2192Tile C.\n\nThose \u201cprototype shapes\u201d (clusters of 4s, 1s, 6s etc. in the inputs) are just there to show what each tile looks like; the outputs themselves are constructed only from the code colors {2,3,5,8}, using the dictionary above. Where a code is too close to the bottom or right border so that a full 4\u00d74 tile would not fit, it is simply ignored (as in Example 2 for the 3 at the bottom-right).\n\nSo the operational rule is:\n\n> Start with an all\u2011zero grid.  \n> For every cell whose value is 2, 3, 5, or 8, if a 4\u00d74 tile placed with its top-left corner at that cell fits entirely inside the grid, draw the corresponding 4\u00d74 tile there using colors 4,1,6,7 as per the mapping.  \n> Ignore all other input cells (including the \u201cprototype\u201d shapes).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Understand the test input\n\nTest input (20\u00d720) uses values 8 and 7:\n\n- Many **8s** laid out in a 5\u00d75 grid (rows 1,5,9,13,17; columns 0,4,8,12,16).\n- A cluster of **7s** forming exactly Tile D (4\u00d74 \u201ccorner+center\u201d pattern) at rows 5\u20138, columns 4\u20137.\n\nGiven the training, we interpret:\n\n- 8 is a **code** value, which should generate **Tile D** (color 7).\n- 7s here are **a prototype shape** for Tile D and are not themselves codes, so they should not directly appear in the output unless overlapped by a tile.\n\nWe also must apply the border rule: a 4\u00d74 tile with top-left at (r,c) fits only if `r+3 \u2264 19` and `c+3 \u2264 19`. That is, valid anchors must satisfy `r \u2264 16` and `c \u2264 16`.\n\n### 8-cells in the test input\n\nList all 8s and check whether their tile would fit:\n\n- Row 1: (1,0), (1,4), (1,8), (1,12), (1,16) \u2014 all valid (1 \u2264 16, columns \u2264 16).\n- Row 5: (5,0), (5,16) \u2014 valid.\n- Row 9: (9,0), (9,8), (9,16) \u2014 valid.\n- Row 13: (13,0), (13,12), (13,16) \u2014 valid.\n- Row 17: (17,0), (17,4), (17,8), (17,12), (17,16) \u2014 **invalid** (17+3 = 20 > 19), so we ignore these.\n\nNo other nonzero codes 2,3,5 appear, so we only need to draw Tile D at these 13 valid 8-cells.\n\nThe prototype 7-shape at rows 5\u20138, cols 4\u20137 is not at a code location, so under the rule we do **not** copy it; those 7s disappear in the output (unless some tile happens to overwrite that region, which in this case they do not).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Constructing the output\n\nWe start with a 20\u00d720 grid of 0s.\n\nFor each valid 8 at (r,c), we draw Tile D (color 7) with its top-left at (r,c):\n\nTile D pattern:\n\n- Row r:     7,0,0,7\n- Row r + 1: 0,7,7,0\n- Row r + 2: 0,7,7,0\n- Row r + 3: 7,0,0,7\n\nBecause the 8s are spaced every 4 cells both horizontally and vertically, these 4\u00d74 tiles **abut but do not overlap**, so we can just place them all; between them and at top/bottom there remain all-0 rows/segments.\n\nDoing this for all valid 8s yields:\n\n- Row 0: no tile covers it \u2192 all 0.\n- Rows 1\u20134: a full row of tiles across columns 0\u201319.\n- Rows 5\u20138: tiles only at columns 0\u20133 and 16\u201319.\n- Rows 9\u201312: tiles at columns 0\u20133, 8\u201311, 16\u201319.\n- Rows 13\u201316: tiles at columns 0\u20133, 12\u201315, 16\u201319.\n- Rows 17\u201319: no tiles \u2192 all 0.\n\nWriting the resulting grid explicitly:\n\nRow 0:\n`0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 1 (dr0 repeated 5\u00d7):\n`7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7`\n\nRow 2 (dr1 repeated 5\u00d7):\n`0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0`\n\nRow 3 (same as row 2):\n`0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0`\n\nRow 4 (same as row 1):\n`7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7`\n\nRow 5 (tiles at c=0 and c=16):\n`7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7`\n\nRow 6:\n`0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0`\n\nRow 7 (same as row 6):\n`0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0`\n\nRow 8 (same as row 5):\n`7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7`\n\nRow 9 (tiles at c=0,8,16):\n`7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7`\n\nRow 10:\n`0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0`\n\nRow 11 (same as row 10):\n`0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0`\n\nRow 12 (same as row 9):\n`7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7`\n\nRow 13 (tiles at c=0,12,16):\n`7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7`\n\nRow 14:\n`0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0`\n\nRow 15 (same as row 14):\n`0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0`\n\nRow 16 (same as row 13):\n`7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7`\n\nRow 17:\n`0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 18:\n`0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 19:\n`0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\nHere is the completed output grid in the required format:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n</REASONING_MODEL_B>\n<REASONING_MODEL_C model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_2_step_1\">\nFrom the four solved pairs you can see that the output is built from standard 4\u00d74 \u201cstamps\u201d. Only the input colours 2,\u202f3,\u202f5 and\u202f8 are used; other input values are ignored. Each of those four input values maps to a fixed stamp and output colour:\n\n- 2 \u2192 colour\u202f4, full hollow square  \n  ```\n  4 4 4 4\n  4 0 0 4\n  4 0 0 4\n  4 4 4 4\n  ```\n- 3 \u2192 colour\u202f1, border without the corners  \n  ```\n  0 1 1 0\n  1 0 0 1\n  1 0 0 1\n  0 1 1 0\n  ```\n- 5 \u2192 colour\u202f6, two filled 2\u00d72 blocks on the main diagonal  \n  ```\n  6 6 0 0\n  6 6 0 0\n  0 0 6 6\n  0 0 6 6\n  ```\n- 8 \u2192 colour\u202f7, corners and centre filled  \n  ```\n  7 0 0 7\n  0 7 7 0\n  0 7 7 0\n  7 0 0 7\n  ```\n\nStamps are placed with their top\u2011left corner at the coordinate of the triggering input cell. Processing is done from bottom rows to top so that earlier stamps can block later ones: before placing a stamp you check that the 4\u00d74 area lies wholly inside the grid and that none of its cells in the output are already non\u2011zero. If either condition fails the stamp is skipped. The output starts as all zeros and only these stamps are drawn.\n\nIn the test grid only value\u202f8 is relevant.

In the output, there is no partial pattern at the bottom-right: that `3` is simply ignored.\n\n   - Overlaps between patterns are rare and not essential here; conceptually we can think of drawing on a blank canvas with these tiles.\n\n   Therefore, the abstract rule:\n\n   > Start from an all-zero grid. For every cell:\n   > - If it is `2`, place the 4\u00d74 `4`-square at that position (if fully inside).\n   > - If it is `3`, place the 4\u00d74 `1`-cross at that position (if fully inside).\n   > - If it is `5`, place the 4\u00d74 `6`-diagonal pattern at that position (if fully inside).\n   > - If it is `8`, place the 4\u00d74 `7`-ring at that position (if fully inside).\n   > Ignore all other colors in the input as *non-commands*.\n   > If a command\u2019s 4\u00d74 tile would go out of bounds, skip it.\n\n   Example 4 shows all four commands (`2,3,5,8`) producing their respective patterns (`4,1,6,7`).  \n   Example 3 shows that pre-existing shapes can appear in the input but the output is *still* generated by applying the above commands (there, only `2` is a command; the pre-existing `4`-shape is effectively replaced by copies determined by `2`\u2019s positions).\n\n2. **Analyze the test input**\n\n   Test input uses only colors `8` and `7` (plus `0`):\n\n   - `8` occurs at:\n     - Row 2: c1, c5, c9, c13, c17\n     - Row 6: c1, c17\n     - Row 10: c1, c9, c17\n     - Row 14: c1, c13, c17\n     - Row 18: c1, c5, c9, c13, c17\n   - `7` forms a 4\u00d74 ring in rows 6\u20139, cols 5\u20138, which is exactly the `7`-ring pattern we saw as **output** from `8` in training. Here it appears in the **input**, but no training example ever uses `7` as a command color, so by the rule above, `7` is not a command and is ignored.\n\n   We only treat `8` as a command.\n\n3. **Decide which `8` cells are valid commands**\n\n   The tile for `8` is a 4\u00d74 block. A command at (r,c) is valid only if\n   - r+3 \u2264 20 and c+3 \u2264 20 (grid is 20\u00d720).\n\n   Check each row of `8`s:\n\n   - r = 2: 2+3 = 5 \u2264 20 \u2192 all `8`s in row 2 valid.\n   - r = 6: 6+3 = 9 \u2264 20 \u2192 both `8`s in row 6 valid.\n   - r = 10: 10+3 = 13 \u2264 20 \u2192 all row-10 `8`s valid.\n   - r = 14: 14+3 = 17 \u2264 20 \u2192 all row-14 `8`s valid.\n   - r = 18: 18+3 = 21 > 20 \u2192 all row-18 `8`s are **invalid** and must be ignored.\n\n   So we place `7`-ring tiles at:\n\n   - (2,1), (2,5), (2,9), (2,13), (2,17)\n   - (6,1), (6,17)\n   - (10,1), (10,9), (10,17)\n   - (14,1), (14,13), (14,17)\n\n4. **Compute the positions of `7` for each tile**\n\n   The 4\u00d74 pattern for an `8` at (r,c) is:\n\n   ```\n   (r,  c)   = 7   (r,  c+1) = 0   (r,  c+2) = 0   (r,  c+3) = 7\n   (r+1,c)   = 0   (r+1,c+1) = 7   (r+1,c+2) = 7   (r+1,c+3) = 0\n   (r+2,c)   = 0   (r+2,c+1) = 7   (r+2,c+2) = 7   (r+2,c+3) = 0\n   (r+3,c)   = 7   (r+3,c+1) = 0   (r+3,c+2) = 0   (r+3,c+3) = 7\n   ```\n\n   Doing this for each valid command and taking the union (no overlaps here), we get all 7-positions row by row:\n\n   - Row 1: none\n   - Row 2: from tiles at (2,1),(2,5),(2,9),(2,13),(2,17):  \n     7 at c1,4,5,8,9,12,13,16,17,20\n   - Row 3: from the same tiles (their second row):  \n     7 at c2,3,6,7,10,11,14,15,18,19\n   - Row 4: identical to Row 3 (third row of those tiles)\n   - Row 5: identical to Row 2 (fourth row of those tiles)\n\n   - Row 6: from tiles at (6,1),(6,17):  \n     7 at c1,4,17,20\n   - Row 7: from those tiles (row+1):  \n     7 at c2,3,18,19\n   - Row 8: same as Row 7\n   - Row 9: same as Row 6\n\n   - Row 10: from tiles at (10,1),(10,9),(10,17):  \n     7 at c1,4,9,12,17,20\n   - Row 11: from those tiles (row+1):  \n     7 at c2,3,10,11,18,19\n   - Row 12: same as Row 11\n   - Row 13: same as Row 10\n\n   - Row 14: from tiles at (14,1),(14,13),(14,17):  \n     7 at c1,4,13,16,17,20\n   - Row 15: from those tiles (row+1):  \n     7 at c2,3,14,15,18,19\n   - Row 16: same as Row 15\n   - Row 17: same as Row 14\n\n   - Rows 18, 19, 20: no valid tiles reach here \u2192 all 0.\n\n   We start from an all-zero grid and put 7s at exactly those coordinates. The original central 7-ring in rows 6\u20139, cols 5\u20138 is **ignored** (it is not regenerated), since color `7` is not a command color in the learned rule.\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\nHere is the completed 20\u00d720 output grid:\n\nRow 1:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 2:\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 3:\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 4:\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 5:\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 6:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 7:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 8:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 9:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n\nRow10:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n\nRow11:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow12:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow13:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n\nRow14:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n\nRow15:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow16:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow17:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n\nRow18:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow19:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow20:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n</REASONING_MODEL_D>\n<REASONING_MODEL_E model_id=\"gpt-5.1-high_3_step_3\">\nBelow is how I inferred the rule and applied it.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Understanding the transformation from the examples\n\n### 1.1. Marker colors and their templates\n\nAcross the examples, only the colors `{2,3,5,8}` in the **input** cause visible structured patterns in the **output**. Other input colors (1,4,6,7, etc.) serve only as *template colors* for these patterns or are just removed.\n\nFor each marker color we consistently get a 4\u00d74 pattern in a *different* output color:\n\n- **Input 2 \u2192 Output color 4**, pattern: a hollow 4\u00d74 square.\n\n  Seen in:\n  - Example 1,2,3,4 outputs.\n  - Explicit prototype: Example 3 input top-left 4\u00d74 block of 4\u2019s.\n\n- **Input 3 \u2192 Output color 1**, pattern: 4\u00d74 \u201cX\u201d (or diamond) of 1\u2019s:\n  ```\n  0 1 1 0\n  1 0 0 1\n  1 0 0 1\n  0 1 1 0\n  ```\n  Seen in:\n  - Example 1,2,4 outputs.\n  - Prototype in Example 2 input around the central 3 at (row6,col6).\n\n- **Input 5 \u2192 Output color 6**, pattern: 4\u00d74 with two 2\u00d72 diagonal blocks of 6\u2019s:\n  ```\n  6 6 0 0\n  6 6 0 0\n  0 0 6 6\n  0 0 6 6\n  ```\n  Seen in:\n  - Example 1 & 4 outputs.\n  - Prototype hinted in Example 1 by 6-cluster + a 5.\n\n- **Input 8 \u2192 Output color 7**, pattern: 4\u00d74 with a 2\u00d72 block in the middle plus all four corners:\n  ```\n  7 0 0 7\n  0 7 7 0\n  0 7 7 0\n  7 0 0 7\n  ```\n  Seen clearly in Example 4: each 8 in the input becomes this 4\u00d74 7-pattern in the output.\n\nAll these 4\u00d74 patterns are anchored so that the **top\u2011left of the 4\u00d74 pattern sits exactly on the cell that had the marker color**.\n\n### 1.2. Which colors are markers vs. ignored\n\nFrom the examples:\n\n- Only inputs of **colors 2, 3, 5, 8** ever spawn new patterns.\n- Input colors **1,4,6,7** (and anything else) are not markers:\n  - Example 3: input 4\u2019s form a 4\u00d74 hollow square prototype, but in the output that block is removed and only 2-markers generate new 4\u00d74 blocks of 4\u2019s.\n  - Example 2: input 1\u2019s are part of the 3-template prototype, but the transformation is governed by 3\u2019s, not by 1\u2019s.\n  - Example 1: input 6\u2019s form the prototype for the 5\u21926 diagonal pattern, but 6\u2019s themselves do not spawn patterns.\n\nSo the algorithm treats only `{2,3,5,8}` as pattern anchors. Other colors are effectively ignored (the output starts from an empty grid and is filled by the patterns).\n\n### 1.3. Boundary and overlap rules\n\nFrom Example 2 and 3:\n\n- **Boundary rule**: if a 4\u00d74 pattern would go out of bounds, that marker is ignored.\n  - Example 2: a 3 at bottom-right would require rows 10\u201313 in a 10\u00d710 grid, so no pattern is drawn for it.\n  - This is the only clear way such a marker \u201cdisappears\u201d.\n\n- **Overlap rule** (key to Example 1 & 3):\n  - Example 3 has 2\u2019s at (0,6), (4,4), (6,0), (6,6). If all spawned 4\u00d74 hollow squares, the one at (4,4) would overlap the one at (6,6), but in the output we see only three squares, missing the one from (4,4).\n  - This is explained by scanning the grid **from bottom-right to top-left** and placing patterns only into empty cells:\n    - process 2\u2019s in order: (6,6) \u2192 (6,0) \u2192 (4,4) \u2192 (0,6).\n    - place pattern at (6,6) and (6,0) (no conflict yet).\n    - when reaching (4,4), its proposed 4\u00d74 area overlaps the existing square at (6,6), so skip it.\n    - finally, (0,6) is free, so place it.\n  - Example 1: the \u201cprototype\u201d 5 at (row6,col6) would generate a diagonal 6-pattern overlapping with the later 2-pattern at (row7,col9). When processed bottom-up/right-to-left, that 5 is considered after the lower 2, thus its pattern overlaps existing non-zeros and is skipped. The other 5\u2019s (later in the scan) are free and do create patterns.\n\nThus the generic procedure for each pair is:\n\n1. Start with an all-zero output grid.\n2. Scan input cells from **bottom row to top row**, and within each row from **right to left**.\n3. If the cell has color C in `{2,3,5,8}`:\n   - Let P(C) be the corresponding 4\u00d74 template.\n   - Check the 4\u00d74 block starting at that cell:\n     - If part of it would lie outside the grid, skip this marker.\n     - Else if any cell in that 4\u00d74 region is already non-zero in the output, skip (avoid overlapping).\n     - Otherwise, copy the template\u2019s non-zero cells into that 4\u00d74 region of the output.\n4. Ignore all other input colors.\n\nThis rule reproduces all training outputs.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying the rule to the test input\n\nThe test input is 20\u00d720 and contains only colors **7** and **8** (besides 0).\n\n### 2.1. Determine which cells are markers\n\nOnly markers are `{2,3,5,8}` \u2192 here **only 8\u2019s** are markers.\n\nThe 7\u2019s are not markers; they serve as a **prototype** (indeed, they form exactly the 8\u21927 template pattern once in the input), but prototypes don\u2019t directly survive\u2014they are only there to let us see the template.\n\nPositions of 8\u2019s (1-based row, col):\n\n- Row 2: (2,1), (2,5), (2,9), (2,13), (2,17)\n- Row 6: (6,1), (6,17)\n- Row 10: (10,1), (10,9), (10,17)\n- Row 14: (14,1), (14,13), (14,17)\n- Row 18: (18,1), (18,5), (18,9), (18,13), (18,17)\n\n### 2.2. Apply boundary rule\n\nFor a 4\u00d74 pattern anchored at (r,c) to fit in a 20\u00d720 grid, we need:\n\n- `r \u2264 17` and `c \u2264 17`.\n\nAll our c\u2019s (1,5,9,13,17) are \u2264 17, so fine horizontally.\n\nBut for rows:\n\n- Anchors at row 18 would need rows 18\u201321 \u2192 out of bounds \u2192 **ignore all 8\u2019s on row 18**.\n\nSo valid anchors are:\n\n- (2,1), (2,5), (2,9), (2,13), (2,17)\n- (6,1), (6,17)\n- (10,1), (10,9), (10,17)\n- (14,1), (14,13), (14,17)\n\n### 2.3. Check overlap\n\nEach 8 spawns a 4\u00d74 block `[r..r+3] \u00d7 [c..c+3]`. Differences between row coordinates are multiples of 4 (2,6,10,14) and column coordinates differ by 4 or more, so these 4\u00d74 blocks only **touch at edges** but do not overlap. Therefore, with the bottom-right \u2192 top-left scan, **no pattern is skipped for overlap**.\n\n### 2.4. Template for 8\n\nFrom Example 4 (and also clearly visible as the 7-block in the test input itself), the pattern for an 8 at (r,c) is:\n\nWithin the 4\u00d74 starting at (r,c):\n\n- Row r:       7 at (r, c), (r, c+3)\n- Row r+1:     7 at (r+1, c+1), (r+1, c+2)\n- Row r+2:     7 at (r+2, c+1), (r+2, c+2)\n- Row r+3:     7 at (r+3, c), (r+3, c+3)\n\nEverything else stays 0.\n\nWe apply that at each of the 13 valid anchors.\n\n### 2.5. Resulting rows\n\nConstructing row by row (1-based rows, 1\u201320):\n\n- Rows 1, 18, 19, 20: no pattern covers them \u2192 all 0.\n\n- **Row 2** (anchors at (2,1),(2,5),(2,9),(2,13),(2,17), top row of template):\n  7 at columns 1,4,5,8,9,12,13,16,17,20.\n\n- **Row 3** (second row of those templates):\n  7 at columns 2,3,6,7,10,11,14,15,18,19.\n\n- **Row 4** (third row, same as row 3):\n  7 at columns 2,3,6,7,10,11,14,15,18,19.\n\n- **Row 5** (fourth row of those templates, like row 2):\n  7 at columns 1,4,5,8,9,12,13,16,17,20.\n\n- **Row 6** (top of templates from (6,1) and (6,17)):\n  7 at columns 1,4,17,20.\n\n- **Row 7** (second row of those templates):\n  7 at columns 2,3,18,19.\n\n- **Row 8** (third row of those templates):\n  7 at columns 2,3,18,19.\n\n- **Row 9** (fourth row of those templates):\n  7 at columns 1,4,17,20.\n\n- **Row 10** (top of templates from (10,1),(10,9),(10,17)):\n  7 at columns 1,4,9,12,17,20.\n\n- **Row 11** (second row of those templates):\n  7 at columns 2,3,10,11,18,19.\n\n- **Row 12** (third row of those templates):\n  7 at columns 2,3,10,11,18,19.\n\n- **Row 13** (fourth row of those templates):\n  7 at columns 1,4,9,12,17,20.\n\n- **Row 14** (top of templates from (14,1),(14,13),(14,17)):\n  7 at columns 1,4,13,16,17,20.\n\n- **Row 15** (second row of those templates):\n  7 at columns 2,3,14,15,18,19.\n\n- **Row 16** (third row of those templates, same as row 15):\n  7 at columns 2,3,14,15,18,19.\n\n- **Row 17** (fourth row of those templates, same shape as row 14):\n  7 at columns 1,4,13,16,17,20.\n\nThe original 7-block in rows 6\u20139, cols 5\u20138 (the prototype) is *not* reproduced unless there is an 8 marker there (there isn\u2019t), so it disappears in the output.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

Let's break this down systematically.\n\n1.  **Understanding the Task:** I'm given a grid of numbers (0-9, representing colors), some examples, and a test grid. The goal is to figure out the transformation rule applied to the test input based on what I see in the examples.\n\n2.  **Initial Observations:** I have four examples. There are hints: \"Objects Description\" mentions shapes like frames, diamonds, and diagonals, and also \"markers\" which are single cells. The \"Transformation Description\" gives away the mapping. It says something like \"Marker 2 becomes a 4x4 frame of color 4,\" etc. So, single markers are turned into bigger patterns. The hint also specifies \"top-left corner alignment\" of patterns, meaning the marker's cell is the top left of the new shape. Also, \"Multi-cell template patterns in the input are cleared\" and something about \"overlapping patterns\".\n\n    I immediately think, \"Okay, this is typical ARC stuff,\" but I have to verify these claims against the examples. The examples are the key!\n\n3.  **Example Verification:** I will carefully look at Example 1: I see markers like '2', '3', and '5'. The output for each example must correspond to what the description says. For example, for marker '2', I'm expecting a 4x4 color-4 box. Yup, that's what I see in the example. The marker '3' maps to a diamond of color 1 and marker '5' to the diagonal blocks.\n\n    However, I need to check the alignment. Let's see if the shape for each marker always begins at its position:\n\n    I looked at the specific cell, and it seems this is true. The 4x4 frame, Diamond, Diagonal blocks all start at the marker position.\n\n    But one question is, how about the templates? They are present in the grid also, and the description says that the template must be erased.\n\n    I think the input grid also contains \"template shapes,\" which are like pre-drawn shapes that need to be removed. So I think the rule is that marker digits are seeds which are mapped to 4x4 shapes, but these are cleared first.\n\n4.  **Collision and Overlap Rules:** The description talks about \"overlapping patterns\". After analyzing Example 3, I think I understood the logic. The rule is that patterns at the \"bottom\" (higher row index) take priority, and if rows are the same, the rightmost wins. The \"lower\" pattern will be entirely removed. This means the other pattern has its place.\n\n    So, essentially: If patterns overlap, the one with the *larger* row or column (if rows are equal) takes precedence. The lower pattern is simply erased. This \"cancellation\" logic is a central part of how to approach the task.\n\n5.  **Defining the Shapes:** I will make sure the descriptions match what I am seeing.\n    *   **Marker '2':** A 4x4 frame of color 4.\n    *   **Marker '3':** A 4x4 diamond of color 1.\n    *   **Marker '5':** Two 2x2 diagonal blocks of color 6.\n    *   **Marker '8':** 4x4 shape. (Color 7). The prompt described it as an \"anti-diagonal\", but it's an X.\n\n6.  **Analyzing the Test Input:** It's time to test the rules against the provided test input. I start scanning for the markers (2, 3, 5, 8). I find a row of markers that appear to be '8'. I also note a pattern of \"7\" in the test input. It looks like the template that must be removed.\n\n    I need to pay attention to grid boundaries. Anything that overflows must be discarded. I also should verify and apply any found offset.\n\n7.  **Marker Validation and Boundary Rule:** I carefully analyze the positions of all found markers, making sure to apply the collision logic from the previous step. Any marker that overlaps with another will be considered invalid. Then, \"Patterns extending beyond grid boundaries are not placed\" must be considered. Anything at the right boundary must be removed because I have determined, the bottom 3 rows are out of bounds.\n\n    I then identify the coordinates of the valid markers (8s): (1,0), (1,4), (1,8), (1,12), (1,16) - (5,0), (5,16) - (9,0), (9,8), (9,16\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid containing \"marker\" pixels and \"template\" patterns into a final grid where markers are replaced by specific 4x4 shapes, and everything else is cleared.\n\n**1. identifying the Rules and Patterns:**\nBased on the provided examples and descriptions, we can deduce the following rules:\n\n*   **Markers & Shapes:**\n    *   **Marker `2`:** Produces a **4x4 Hollow Frame** of color **4**.\n        Pattern:\n        ```\n        4 4 4 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 4 4 4\n        ```\n    *   **Marker `3`:** Produces a **4x4 Hollow Diamond** of color **1**.\n        Pattern:\n        ```\n        0 1 1 0\n        1 0 0 1\n        1 0 0 1\n        0 1 1 0\n        ```\n    *   **Marker `5`:** Produces **4x4 Diagonal Blocks** of color **6**.\n        Pattern:\n        ```\n        6 6 0 0\n        6 6 0 0\n        0 0 6 6\n        0 0 6 6\n        ```\n    *   **Marker `8`:** Produces a **4x4 X-Shape (Anti-Diagonal + Diagonal)** of color **7**.\n        Pattern (inferred from Example 4):\n        ```\n        7 0 0 7\n        0 7 7 0\n        0 7 7 0\n        7 0 0 7\n        ```\n\n*   **Placement Logic:**\n    *   The marker's position in the input grid becomes the **top-left corner** (0,0) of the 4x4 pattern in the output grid.\n    *   **Boundaries:** Patterns that extend beyond the grid boundaries (e.g., if row + 3 >= grid height) are **not placed**.\n    *   **Priority/Overlaps:** If patterns overlap, the one with the higher row index (bottom-most) takes priority. If row indices are equal, the one with the higher column index (right-most) takes priority. Lower priority patterns are completely removed if they clash with a higher priority one.\n    *   **Cleanup:** Any pre-existing patterns or shapes in the input (templates) are cleared; only shapes generated by valid markers remain.\n\n**2. Applying to Test Input:**\nThe test input is a 20x20 grid. We scan for markers `2`, `3`, `5`, and `8`.\n\n*   **Found Markers (All are `8`):**\n    *   **Row 1:** (1,0), (1,4), (1,8), (1,12), (1,16).\n    *   **Row 5:** (5,0), (5,16). (Note: The shape at (5,4) is a template made of 7s, not a marker).\n    *   **Row 9:** (9,0), (9,8), (9,16).\n    *   **Row 13:** (13,0), (13,12), (13,16).\n    *   **Row 17:** (17,0), (17,4), (17,8), (17,12), (17,16).\n\n*   **Validity Check:**\n    *   The grid has rows 0-19.\n    *   Patterns starting at Row 17 would occupy rows 17, 18, 19, 20.

                "response": "**The ARC Puzzle's Logic Unraveled**\n\nAlright, so I've been tasked with dissecting these three candidates' solutions for this ARC puzzle, and here's what I've figured out. It all boils down to how these solutions handle the grid's boundaries and overlapping patterns.\n\nThe core idea seems to be that specific pixel values \u2013 our markers \u2013 act as seeds to generate these 4x4 patterns. There's also this cleaning phase where pre-existing patterns that aren't markers are cleared, which is key. The real challenge, though, is how these patterns behave when they bump up against the grid's edges or if they overlap with one another.\n\nAfter digging into the examples, it became clear that Candidate 2 had the most solid grasp of the rules. It uses this \"Validity Check\" system. Think of it like this: a pattern can only exist if it fits entirely within the bounds of the grid *and* doesn't overlap any existing patterns. If it fails either of those conditions, it's just omitted entirely. This is why when markers are right on the edge (as in Example 2) or overlap an existing pattern (as in Example 3), the patterns aren't just partially drawn or mixed together; they're completely ignored.\n\nCandidate 0, on the other hand, thought that patterns are just \"clipped\" at the grid's edge, even though clipping seems a bit too simple to explain. While this interpretation aligns with my prior graphics design experience, it doesn't account for the complete lack of patterns in the boundary or the \"nothing\" approach, as observed in Example 3. This led me to believe that the key is the validity check.\n\nCandidate 1 was a bit out in left field, in my opinion. It assumed that these templates or pre-existing patterns should stick around, which directly contradicts what we see in the examples. It failed on that front.\n\nSo, in short, I'm going with Candidate 2 because it has the most logical and consistent approach, where it's a \"fit or no fit\" situation, as observed. Candidate 0 is valid, but missed the deeper nuance, while Candidate 1 is off-base due to template retention.",

problem!** The user wants me to solve this based on examples.  I see a pattern-based transformation here.  First, I'm identifying \"markers\" in the input grid.  These markers, each with a specific color, seem to trigger the output of a pre-defined \"pattern\" or \"sprite\".  Each pattern is 4x4, and is defined by blocks of color in the input.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n*   **Mapping:** The key is figuring out the mapping between input marker color and output pattern. I found that different input colors trigger specific output patterns. The mappings are as follows:\n    *   `2` (Red) triggers a Yellow (4) Hollow Square.\n    *   `3` (Green) triggers a Blue (1) Hollow Circle/Diamond.\n    *   `5` triggers a Magenta (6) Steps pattern.\n    *   `8` (from Example 4 and the Test Input) triggers an Orange (7) \"X\" or Hourglass pattern.\n*   **Pattern Definition:** Importantly, the input grid seems to *define* these patterns through blocks of color. Each input block with a unique pattern (like the \"Steps\" pattern) is tied to a specific marker (like 5 or 8). Where there's a marker and pattern in the input, the output replaces the marker with the pattern. The original pattern, if present in the input *without* a marker, is removed (replaced with zeros).\n*   **Test Input Strategy:** The Test Input grid has specific locations where a pattern is defined, and where the markers are located.  For this specific test case, the problem is about replacing markers and keeping the same definition throughout the grid.\n\n**Applying the Rules:**\n\nThe solution strategy is:\n\n1.  **Identify Marker Locations:** I'll locate the instances of marker `8` in the Test Input (at rows 1, 5, 9, 13, and 17).\n2.  **Locate Pattern definition:** I found the \"hourglass\" pattern in the Test Input, at Rows 5-8, Cols 4-7.\n3.  **Draw Patterns:** For each marker `8`, I will place the Orange \"X\" pattern at that location. Note: if the boundary of the grid would be exceeded, I have to *clip* to the boundary, as is the ARC way. Where the pattern definition itself is, if there is no corresponding marker, fill the region with 0s.\n4.  **No Overlap:** The way the markers are placed guarantees that there will be no overlap, so each pattern is in its own space.\n\nThis should give me the correct output, which is the Orange \"X\" pattern repeated across the grid at the marker locations, with the pattern defined area replaced with zeros.  I have double-checked the logic and the calculations, and I'm ready to produce the solution!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid containing \"markers\" and a \"pattern definition\" into a completed grid where the markers are replaced by the pattern.\n\n**Analysis of the Transformation Rule:**\n1.  **Identify Markers:** In the input grid, single non-zero pixels act as markers. Their color indicates which pattern they should be replaced with. In the solved examples:\n    *   Marker `2` (Red) $\\rightarrow$ Yellow (`4`) Hollow Square pattern.\n    *   Marker `3` (Green) $\\rightarrow$ Blue (`1`) Diamond/Circle pattern.\n    *   Marker `5` (Gray) $\\rightarrow$ Magenta (`6`) Steps pattern.\n    *   Marker `8` (Azure) $\\rightarrow$ Orange (`7`) X/Hourglass pattern.\n2.  **Identify Pattern Definitions:** The input grid may contain a fully drawn example of a pattern. In the output, this definition is removed (replaced by `0`s) unless a marker is present at its top-left corner.\n    *   In the Test Input, we see a pattern made of color `7` (Orange) located at rows 5-8, columns 4-7.\n    *   The shape of this pattern is:\n        ```\n        7,0,0,7\n        0,7,7,0\n        0,7,7,0\n        7,0,0,7\n        ```\n    *   The markers in the Test Input are color `8` (Azure). Based on Example 4 and the presence of the `7` pattern, we infer that marker `8` triggers the Orange X pattern.\n3.  **Apply Transformation:**\n    *   Locate every `8` in the input grid.\n    *   Replace each `8` with the 4x4 Orange X pattern, anchored with the top-left of the pattern at the position of the `8`.\n    *   Any area not covered by a pattern expansion (including the original definition area if it lacks a marker) becomes `0` (Black).\n    *   If a pattern extends beyond the grid boundaries, it is clipped.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Grid Size:** 20x20.\n*   **Pattern:** Orange X (color 7).\n*   **Marker Locations (Color 8):**\n    *   Row 1: Columns 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n    *   Row 5: Columns 0, 16. (Note: The definition at col 4 is removed).\n    *   Row 9: Columns 0, 8, 16.\n    *   Row 13: Columns 0, 12, 16.\n    *   Row 17: Columns 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n*   **Clipping:** The markers on Row 17 will generate a 4-high pattern at rows 17, 18, 19, 20.

The core challenge is deciphering how the input grids (made of numbers 0-9) are mapped to output grids, which also contain numbers. I suspect a key is to identify specific \"markers\" in the input that trigger the generation of particular patterns or shapes in the output. Based on this, it's a pattern recognition plus execution task.\n\n**Deconstructing the Example Transformations:**\n\nLet's begin by deconstructing each example step by step, focusing on mapping input values to output patterns. The initial goal is to find a recurring relationship. Looking at the examples, the outputs seem to consist of distinct shapes or \"glyphs\" composed of specific numbers. A quick scan of the first few rows shows 2D grids as input and output. The task is to infer the transformation.\n\n*   **Example 1**:\n    *   Looking at example 1, it's 20x20 in both input and output. It appears the rule is not row-based processing. The output features distinct shapes or \"glyphs\", such as a hollow 4x4 squares (value 4), and another pattern that is hard to determine initially. But also the diamond/circle shape with 1s.\n    *   I've noticed something. I need to index 0-indexed as opposed to 1-indexed. The input's numbers form a grid. Specifically, it's obvious to me that the shapes or glyphs in output are related to numbers in the input. For instance, input has a 6x6, and in the output, you can find diagonal lines, with 6 values. 2 input seems to correspond to the rectangular shapes on output.\n    *   Let's check the relation of input-output. Top-Left: a block of 6 in input maps to a diagonal line-looking glyph.\n    *   Hypothesis: A particular input number (e.g., 6) maps to a distinct shape in the output. I should check which input number generates which output shape. This is likely how the task has been solved.\n    *   I'll refer to specific input-output pairs as the pairs of number and their respective shapes.\n*   **Example 2**:\n    *   Going to Example 2 (smaller 10x10 grids).\n    *   The 3 in the top left in input generates a distinct pattern (circle of 1s) in output.\n    *   Input 2, at another location, also generates another shape.\n    *   It seems each input number corresponds to a unique output shape.\n    *   In the input, there are some patterns, for example, the pattern \"0, 0, 3, 0\" in a row. It is related to shape 1 in the output.\n\n**Establishing the Marker-to-Shape Mapping:**\n\n*   Based on these preliminary observations from Example 1 and Example 2, I form a hypothesis: specific input numbers (\"markers\") define what and where to draw shapes in the output. The shape themselves will be predetermined. So now, my goal is to figure out each specific input-output map, and the relationship of the numbers, input numbers with locations on output.\n*   **Example 1 Again**:\n    *   Input: A 6 maps to some Checkers, and 2 to 4.\n    *   Input: 3 is producing an output that looks like the \"circle of 1s\".\n*   **Example 2**:\n    *   I see a '3' generating the circle and '2' generating a 'box'.\n*   I can state my current hypothesis:\n    *   **2 -> 4** (\"Box\")\n    *   **3 -> 1** (\"Circle\")\n    *   **5 -> 6** (\"Checkers\" / diagonal).\n*   **Example 4**:\n    *   Example 4 uses all values. The Input has an 8 mapped to what looks like a pattern of 7's at the output.\n    *   **8 -> 7** (\"X\" / Orange pattern).\n*   In summary, these are the current mappings:\n\n    *   **2 -> 4 (Box)**\n    *   **3 -> 1 (Circle)**\n    *   **5 -> 6 (Checkers)**\n    *   **8 -> 7 (X)**\n*   From observation, input looks like a grid. I suspect the markers are at the corners of a grid.\n*   Ex 4 tells me they are at positions r%4==0, c%4==0, where r,c is index.\n\n**Identifying the Grid and Marker\n\nThe problem asks us to infer a transformation rule from examples and apply it to a test input. The input and output grids represent colors using integers 0-9.\n\n### Analysis of Examples\n\n1.  **Markers and Shapes**:\n    By comparing the inputs and outputs, we can observe that specific single pixels in the input act as \"markers\" or \"seeds\" that generate 4x4 patterns in the output. The color of the marker determines the color and shape of the output pattern.\n    \n    *   **Marker 2** generates a yellow (4) **Hollow Box**:\n        ```\n        4 4 4 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 4 4 4\n        ```\n    *   **Marker 3** generates a blue (1) **Hollow Circle/Diamond**:\n        ```\n        0 1 1 0\n        1 0 0 1\n        1 0 0 1\n        0 1 1 0\n        ```\n    *   **Marker 5** generates a pink (6) **Checkers** pattern:\n        ```\n        6 6 0 0\n        6 6 0 0\n        0 0 6 6\n        0 0 6 6\n        ```\n    *   **Marker 8** generates an orange (7) **X** pattern (deduced from Example 4):\n        ```\n        7 0 0 7\n        0 7 7 0\n        0 7 7 0\n        7 0 0 7\n        ```\n\n2.  **Positioning**:\n    The position of the marker in the input grid corresponds exactly to the **top-left corner** (row, column) of the 4x4 shape in the output grid.\n    *   In Example 4, markers are at indices like (0,0), (0,4), etc., and the shapes perfectly fill the 4x4 blocks starting at those coordinates.\n    *   In Example 3, a marker 2 at (6,0) produces a shape starting at row 6, col 0.\n\n3.  **Noise and Cleanup**:\n    *   The input grids often contain \"debris\" or pre-existing shapes (e.g., solid blocks of 6s in Example 1, a partial shape of 1s in Example 2, or a shape of 4s in Example 3).\n    *   The transformation **clears the grid** to 0 (black) and only draws the shapes generated by valid markers.\n    *   Valid markers are isolated pixels of values 2, 3, 5, or 8. If a shape is present in the input but its corresponding marker is missing (like the box of 4s in Example 3 which lacks a marker 2), it is removed.\n\n### Application to Test Input\n\n1.  **Identify Markers**:\n    We scan the test input (20x20 grid) for markers. The only valid markers present are **8s**.\n    The positions of the 8s are:\n    *   **Row 1**: Cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n    *   **Row 5**: Cols 0, 16.\n    *   **Row 9**: Cols 0, 8, 16.\n    *   **Row 13**: Cols 0, 12, 16.\n    *   **Row 17**: Cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n\n    *Note: There is a pre-existing orange (7) \"X\" shape at Row 5, Col 4. However, there is no marker '8' at (5,4) to generate it. Based on the rules (specifically Example 3), this pre-existing shape is treated as debris and removed.*\n\n2.  **Generate Output**:\n    We create a blank 20x20 grid and draw the 4x4 \"X\" shape (color 7) at each marker location.\n    \n    *   **Row 1 markers**: Generate a continuous strip of patterns from row 1 to 4.\n    *   **Row 5 markers**: Generate patterns at the left and right edges (cols 0-3 and 16-19).\n    *   **Row 9 markers**: Generate patterns at edges and the center (cols 8-11).\n    *   **Row 13 markers**: Generate patterns at edges and col 12-15.\n    *   **Row 17 markers**: Generate a continuous strip starting at row 17.

My brain immediately jumps into analyze-the-examples mode. My first thought is to understand the rules by looking for patterns in a few provided examples.  I know I'm dealing with a grid and a set of instructions, and the goal is likely to transform the input grid into a different output grid.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis: Pinpointing Potential Rules**\n\nExample 1 is a 20x20 grid, so I start there. I start by observing what's contained in the grid, seeing clusters of 6s, some isolated pixels. I see a pattern to the layout, I check if the output grid is also the same size. I think that the size of the input and output is the same, and I start wondering how the input relates to the output. My mind quickly goes to 4x4 blocks because the number 20 is divisible by 4.\n\nI try to break down Example 1 and check the arrangement of the numbers, looking for alignment between the input numbers and what that generates in the output. I start thinking: are these values in the input coordinates?\n\nMy focus shifts towards seeing those 2x2 blocks of 6s and what those map to in the output. I get confused with indices and coordinates, and I re-read the input text carefully. I start analyzing the layout of the 6s in the input, but then I remember I need to connect them with the layout of the output. I keep going deeper and try to understand how an \"input block\" maps to an \"output block.\"\n\n**Hypothesis: Mapping and Pattern Generation**\n\nIt's clear the example is a map, so I quickly form a hypothesis: the non-zero pixels in the input are markers that *trigger* pre-defined patterns in the output. I want to test if that hypothesis works out. I'm focusing now on the mapping aspect.\n\nI start testing this by looking at Example 2. I compare the input and output positions, and I now need to determine what pattern each non-zero pixel in the input corresponds to in the output. I realize the output grids appear to have simple \"shapes\" made of numbers, in this case, 1 and 4, and I want to determine how the input values select them.\n\n**Testing the Hypothesis with Coordinates and Patterns**\n\nI meticulously check coordinates. Example 2 now. The input shows a pixel with the number 3, and I see what that generated in the output. I check the output, row by row and coordinate by coordinate. I notice a pattern emerging, I can draw the \"shape\" that the number 3 forms. I call this the \"shape 3.\"\n\nI then repeat this for other pixels, like the 2 in the input grid. I quickly see this as the \"hollow square of 4s\". I try to connect the dots and think: Is there a general rule where each input value produces a unique shape in the output?\n\nI observe the pixels and the shapes, and I start relating how the values of the pixels correlate with the outputs. I want to know if the value of the pixel determines the shape.  I look at a different set of 1's and test if the input values are linked to the layout in the output. I start thinking there may be other information to consider that is not explicitly written.\n\n**Seeds and Overlapping Patterns**\n\nI then hit a stumbling block with Example 2. I have a cluster of 1s in the input, which *resembles* the shape already, but it doesn't quite work. I notice the shapes are drawn at the position of specific *trigger* pixels, not by patterns present in the input.\n\nThis is a turning point.  I have the idea of a \"seed\" pixel, and I can start understanding what makes a seed \"valid.\" I begin to question what those 1s mean. Are they just noise? Are they part of the output shape? Or something else? I also start to question what defines the output's pixel layout.\n\nI re-examine the Examples. I look at Example 3: I have a full \"hollow square of 4s,\" so I want to know what this pre-existing pattern does.  I now have a hunch about *overlapping*. What happens when an input pixel value would generate a pattern which overlaps with a pre-existing pattern? I start seeing a clearer rule: Replace the seeds and remove everything else!\n\nI examine Example 3. I see a connection between the seeds with the number 2, and I realize a very important rule: I've to remove everything else, which means the initial pattern disappears! I test what happens if two patterns may overlap.\n\n**Grid Alignment and Valid Seeds**\n\nI then check Example 1 to see how to define the coordinates of\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid of integers based on rules inferred from examples.\n\n**Inferred Rules:**\n1.  **Seeds and Patterns:** The input grid contains \"seed\" pixels (single non-zero integers) that trigger the creation of a specific 4x4 pattern in the output grid.\n    *   **Seed `2`** creates a **Hollow Square of `4`s**:\n        ```\n        4 4 4 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 4 4 4\n        ```\n    *   **Seed `3`** creates a **Circle of `1`s**:\n        ```\n        0 1 1 0\n        1 0 0 1\n        1 0 0 1\n        0 1 1 0\n        ```\n    *   **Seed `5`** creates a **Checkerboard of `6`s**:\n        ```\n        6 6 0 0\n        6 6 0 0\n        0 0 6 6\n        0 0 6 6\n        ```\n    *   **Seed `8`** creates an **X-shape of `7`s**:\n        ```\n        7 0 0 7\n        0 7 7 0\n        0 7 7 0\n        7 0 0 7\n        ```\n\n2.  **Placement:** The top-left corner of the 4x4 pattern is placed exactly at the coordinate `(row, col)` of the seed pixel.\n3.  **Conflict/Validation:** A seed at `(r, c)` generates a pattern *only if* the 4x4 area anchored at `(r, c)` (i.e., rows `r` to `r+3` and columns `c` to `c+3`) contains no **other** seed pixels. If another seed falls within this area, the seed at `(r, c)` is considered \"blocked\" or invalid and produces nothing (or is suppressed by the other seed).\n    *   Existing patterns in the input (blocks of color corresponding to output patterns) are treated as noise/background and are removed unless regenerated by a valid seed. They do not act as seeds.\n4.  **Canvas:** The output grid starts as all zeros (black). Only the patterns from valid seeds are drawn. Patterns are clipped if they extend beyond the grid boundaries.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Grid Size:** 20x20.\n*   **Seeds Identification:** The input contains seeds of value `8`. There are also pixels of value `7`, but `7` is the pattern color for seed `8`, not a seed itself (analogous to `4`s in Example 3 not being seeds). The `7`s form a pre-existing shape at rows 5-8, cols 4-7.\n*   **Valid Seeds (Value 8):**\n    *   **Row 1:** Seeds at columns 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. None overlap or contain other seeds. All valid.\n    *   **Row 5:** Seeds at columns 0, 16. (Pixel at (5,4) is `7`, not a seed). All valid.\n    *   **Row 9:** Seeds at columns 0, 8, 16.

It's all about pattern recognition and applying the provided rules!**\n\nFirst things first: I'm given an input grid of numbers (0-9) and I need to produce an output grid with a similar format. The key is to figure out the transformation.  I'm also told to infer the logic from a set of solved examples.  I need to use this information to determine how input grid values are mapped to output shapes.\n\nMy initial thought is to figure out the connection between the input grids and their descriptions.  The problem description gives me a mapping: `2->4`, `3->1`, `5->6`, `8->7`. So I know the value `2` should correspond to a shape with color `4` in the output, `3` corresponds to `1`, `5` maps to `6` and `8` to `7`. This seems important so I keep it in mind.\n\nI started examining **Example 1**: I'm hunting for patterns, trying to verify the initial mapping. I carefully look at the input and output grids, looking at the location of specific input values and the corresponding shapes in the output. I also made sure to confirm the grid sizes.  I realize that input values '2', '3', '5', '8' create shapes in the output.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing Example 1, I find out that the output shapes come from the *markers* which are values \"2\", \"3\", \"5\", \"8\"  In other words, the location of '2' gives the location of a 4x4 shape. I also notice existing input shapes (blocks of 6 in this example) completely disappear in the output.\n\nI confirm the initial assumption the description gives the correct mapping: `2->4`, `3->1`, `5->6`, `8->7` based on the coordinates. Example 1 also has a marker at (5,5). However, no shape is there!\n\nSo, I study **Example 2**: I look at where the values 2, 3, 5, or 8 are. The provided description says \"Any existing non-marker shapes on the grid are cleared/removed.\"  I see that values '1' form a shape. They disappear! I also see that existing shapes are removed in Example 2.\n\nI carefully examine the coordinates of these markers and corresponding shape color. I'm focusing to confirm my understanding of that transformation:\n*   Find markers: '2', '3', '5', '8'.\n*   The pixel becomes the upper-left corner of a 4x4 shape.\n\nDuring Example 2, I notice the location of an existing diamond shape made of '1's. When the markers are placed, the output has a shape made of '1's as the same color. It seems the pre-existing shapes are ignored or removed and only shapes based on input markers are present.\n\nNow for **Example 3**: I pay special attention to overlaps here, given the description. Example 3 has many '2' markers, all giving shapes. I also confirm the output here. However, I notice that one marker did not produce a shape, even though the description says markers produce a shape.\n\nI realize that shapes overlap in Example 3. I hypothesize the reason for this missing shape is the overlap: maybe there's a priority order when shapes overlap in the output grid (I'm leaning towards 'later one wins'). However, I don't know the full rule. I focus to find the rule behind this conflict.  I know that one shape is completely gone.\n\nI then study **Example 4**:  I carefully notice the input and the output.  It appears to be a much easier example.  All shapes are non-overlapping here.  I can verify here, all mappings appear correct in this example.  This reinforces my previous thinking: the conflict-free construction means all shapes are there. It looks like my assumption about overlaps is correct here.\n\nI go back to Example 3's issue.  The rule must be related to how to deal with conflicts and how the order of shapes matters.  I hypothesize:  If shape A and shape B overlap and shape B is 'later' in a specific sense (e.g. at the bottom-right of the overlapping area), B \"wins\" and overwrites A or cancels it out entirely.  I confirm it: it seems \"later one wins\", meaning, right and bottom coordinates have preference.\n\nNow, with this understanding, I can finally attack the main task!  I know the mapping from values to shape colors, the size of shapes and how to resolve overlaps (the \"later shape wins\" rule). I start from the new 20x20 grid now\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples and the object descriptions provided:\n\n1.  **Identify Transformation Rules**:\n    *   **Markers**: The input contains single pixels (values 2, 3, 5, 8) that act as \"markers\".\n    *   **Mapping**: Each marker value corresponds to a specific 4x4 pattern:\n        *   `2` $\\rightarrow$ Box (Color 4)\n        *   `3` $\\rightarrow$ Diamond (Color 1)\n        *   `5` $\\rightarrow$ Checkerboard (Color 6)\n        *   `8` $\\rightarrow$ X-shape (Color 7)\n    *   **Placement**: The marker's position $(r, c)$ becomes the top-left corner of the 4x4 pattern in the output.\n    *   **Cleanup**: Any non-marker non-zero pixels in the input (like the '7's forming a shape in the test input) are treated as background noise or existing shapes to be removed. The background is initialized to 0.\n    *   **Overlap/Clipping**: Based on the examples, patterns define the output. If a pattern extends beyond the grid boundaries (as seen in the analysis of the test input size), it is clipped.\n\n2.  **Analyze Test Input**:\n    *   **Grid Size**: 20x20.\n    *   **Markers Found**: The input contains markers with value `8`.\n        *   **Row 1** (Index 1): Cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n        *   **Row 5** (Index 5): Cols 0, 16. (Note: The shape made of 7s at (5,4) is ignored).\n        *   **Row 9** (Index 9): Cols 0, 8, 16.\n        *   **Row 13** (Index 13): Cols 0, 12, 16.\n        *   **Row 17** (Index 17): Cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n    *   **Pattern**: All markers are `8`, which maps to the **X-shape** (Color 7).\n        *   Row 0: `7, 0, 0, 7`\n        *   Row 1: `0, 7, 7, 0`\n        *   Row 2: `0, 7, 7, 0`\n        *   Row 3: `7, 0, 0, 7`\n\n3.  **Construct Output**:\n    *   **Row 0**: Empty (0s).\n    *   **Rows 1-4**: Markers at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 generate a full row of 5 X-shapes.\n    *   **Rows 5-8**: Markers at 0, 16 generate X-shapes at the far left and right. The center is empty.\n    *   **Rows 9-12**: Markers at 0, 8, 16 generate X-shapes at Left, Middle, Right.\n    *   **Rows 13-16**: Markers at 0, 12, 16 generate X-shapes at Left, and two on the Right side.\n    *   **Rows 17-19**: Markers at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 start a full row of X-shapes. However, since the grid ends at Row 19, only the first 3 rows of the pattern (Rows 17, 18, 19) are rendered. The 4th row of the pattern is clipped.\n\noutput:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"F\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_11_step_5_gemini_gen_sol\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at this problem, I need to understand how single-pixel markers transform into 4x4 patterns.\n\n## Analysis\n\nFrom the examples, I can see that:\n1.

The objective is to decipher the transformation rules between input and output grids in these ARC tasks. I'm focusing on identifying consistent patterns and mappings. It seems like the core idea here is a tile-based grid, where the input defines the layout and content of these tiles, and the output reflects these definitions. Let's start with Example 1: a 20x20 input to a 20x20 output.\n\n**Example 1 Deciphering and Rule Finding**\n\nInitial thoughts: the input seems sparse, single pixels are \"anchors\" of the pattern. Examining the structure, it appears the grid is divided into 4x4 tiles, that make up a 5x5 meta grid in the 20x20 example.\nThe initial thoughts about diagonal checkerboard-like patterns were close but the data is cleaner than first thought. Specifically, there is color assignment in the tiles. These small colored shapes are repeated. I'm seeing patterns here.\nThe output seems composed of these repeating 4x4 tiles.\nInput features appear to define the content, maybe via these anchors or \"seeds\" of the tile patterns. Example 1 shows us that the `6,6` in the anchor define what output the final 4x4 block will look like. The output shows pattern `6` is a color. Let's keep this in mind.\nNow, the 20x20 means a 5x5 layout of 4x4 tiles. Let's look at the meta layout of the Input for where the patterns \"start\".\nIf we look at example 2, in a 10x10. If we split this into 4x4 tiles. The input row 1 column 1 has a `3`. The output is the color for the `3`. Input row 1 column 5 has a `2`. and the corresponding output tile is the color of the `2`.\nAlso, in example 2, it is noted that the last two columns and last two rows are all `0`. Therefore, the 10x10 example, the grid is 8x8 with 0 borders. So `3` and `2` correspond to the colors of what pattern they will be. We're on the right track here!\n\n**Hypothesis Refinement: Mapping and Definitions**\n\nIt's becoming clear: the input uses single-pixel markers to \"point\" to a specific output pattern. These single pixels are acting as \"keys\" and the 4x4 tiles are the blocks to make the output. Further analysis of examples 1 and 2, and 3: the Input marker \"seeds\" act as an \"Instruction\". So if the input is:\n`3,0,0,0`\n`0,0,0,0`\n...\nthe output is Pattern 3 (or the appropriate color) to the 4x4 pattern.\n\n**Expanding the Analysis with Example 2**\n\nGoing back to Example 2: a 10x10 grid with non-zero pixels at (1,1), (1,5), (5,1), and (5,5) that are marker pixels. The marker pixel defines the block, and also, the pixel can be mapped to another location via an \"Instruction\". So we're looking at what is the instruction, and, where is it. The example shows there is a \"map\" that allows you to figure out what color each marker has, and where it must be mapped. Here's what's going on: (1,1)=3, (1,5)=2, (5,1)=2, (5,5)=3\n(1,1)=3 should map to the instruction of the `3` pixel, but the `2` pixel has an `0`. So the single pixels instruct.\nExample 3: the non-zero pixels are at (0,0), (0,6), (4,4), and (6,0) that are marker pixels, or blocks.\nThe 0 and 10 and 6 rows of pixels create the colored structure of each instruction.\nThe pixel values are the \"Key\". For Example 3:\nPixel 4 is the instruction and key.\n`2` is the pixel and key.\nIn Example 1:\n`6` is the pixel and key.\nThe key here is that the values act as \"Keys\" for the colors in the blocks in the output. And can map to their appropriate positions.\n\n**The Marker System and Universal Mapping**\n\nThe crucial insight: markers serve as references to pattern definitions, with the color of the marker being the associated color of the pattern. The key here is not the *color*, but the relationship\n\nThe problem involves identifying a grid of 4x4 tiles where each tile's content is determined by a \"marker\" pixel at its top-left corner in the input grid.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Grid Structure**: The input and output grids are divided into 4x4 regions (tiles), often aligned to specific rows and columns.\n2.  **Markers & Patterns**:\n    *   Single non-zero pixels (markers) in the input indicate which pattern should be filled into that 4x4 tile in the output.\n    *   There is a consistent mapping from Marker Value $\\rightarrow$ Pattern Color & Shape.\n    *   **Mapping found from examples:**\n        *   Marker `2` $\\rightarrow$ Pattern `4` (Yellow hollow square).\n        *   Marker `3` $\\rightarrow$ Pattern `1` (Blue diamond).\n        *   Marker `5` $\\rightarrow$ Pattern `6` (Magenta checkerboard).\n        *   Marker `8` $\\rightarrow$ Pattern `7` (Orange X-shape).\n3.  **Pattern Definitions**:\n    *   The specific shape of a pattern is sometimes explicitly defined in the input grid itself. A tile will contain the marker at the top-left, and the rest of the 4x4 area shows the pattern pixels.\n    *   In the output, \"definition tiles\" are cleared to 0 (unless the marker is also a pointer to itself, which is not the case for `6`, `4`, `7`).\n    *   \"Pointer tiles\" (tiles with just the marker) are filled with the corresponding pattern.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Scan for Markers**:\n    *   Row 0: All 0s.\n    *   Row 1: Markers `8` at columns 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n    *   Row 5: Marker `8` at col 0, `7` at col 4, `8` at col 16. Columns 8 and 12 are 0.\n        *   Note: The tile at (5,4) contains the full pattern for color 7: `7,0,0,7` / `0,7,7,0` ... This confirms the pattern for `7`. Since `7` is the definition marker and `8` is the pointer, this tile will be cleared in the output.\n    *   Row 9: Markers `8` at columns 0, 8, 16.\n    *   Row 13: Markers `8` at columns 0, 12, 16.\n    *   Row 17: Markers `8` at columns 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n\n2.  **Determine Pattern**:\n    *   Marker `8` maps to Pattern `7`.\n    *   Pattern `7` (from the definition at Row 5, Col 4) is:\n        ```\n        7, 0, 0, 7\n        0, 7, 7, 0\n        0, 7, 7, 0\n        7, 0, 0, 7\n        ```\n\n3.  **Construct Output**:\n    *   **Row 0**: Empty (0s).\n    *   **Rows 1-4**: Fill Pattern `7` at cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n    *   **Rows 5-8**: Fill Pattern `7` at cols 0 and 16. Clear col 4 (definition).

I've got a few examples to work with, which is great.  Looking at them, I'm noticing a few things right off the bat: the inputs are usually sparse, just a few colored pixels, while the outputs are denser with recognizable patterns, often looking like repeated tiles. The grid dimensions are all the same, 20x20.\n\nMy immediate thought is that these 4x4 blocks are key, that the whole grid is somehow broken down into those units. I analyze the examples, focusing on how input pixels map to output patterns, always keeping in mind the 4x4 blocks.  I start noticing there's a relationship between the color of a pixel in the input and the pattern it generates in the output. For example, a red pixel in the input generates a yellow square in the output. I start taking notes on the color mappings I observe.\n\nThe patterns are all 4x4, and there's usually a 1 pixel gap between each of the blocks. The question that has me is about how these blocks are arranged: it's not a direct pixel-to-pixel mapping, that much is clear, instead it seems the input is used as a type of key or seed, and the colors are a type of pattern library.\n\nSo, I figure that I need to find the \"seed\" pixels, then apply the correct pattern in the corresponding position in the output.  The output is a 20x20 grid of 4x4 blocks separated by 1-pixel spacing.  The seed is defined as a non-zero pixel in the input which drives the color of a 4x4 block in the output.  This is proven by analyzing all the examples, finding cases where seeds are at 1 row off, 1 column off and still defining the 4x4 block pattern.\n\nIt turns out that some blocks are empty, which means the seed in input grid needs a color, so if it's the right color, it drives a particular output pattern. The rule is simple: Each seed color maps to a unique 4x4 pattern, like a red pixel always results in yellow blocks, a green pixel blue ring and so on. If the input contains a pattern which \"should be the output,\" it's ignored. I need to handle cases where there are overlapping seed locations, so the pattern should be overwritten in that case.  The color 6, for instance, produces an empty black block in output. The Test input requires me to convert color 8 into an orange pattern.\n\nSo, I need to look at each seed position in the input and replace the appropriate area of the output grid with the corresponding pattern.\n\nI construct a strategy, and work the test input, by starting with a zero grid. Then I identify each seed pixel in the test input, and use their coordinates to construct the final output. The main problem is building and identifying the pattern and color mappings. All examples are considered by following the coordinate position in each of them.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a sparse input grid into a patterned output grid based on observed rules from examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:**\n    *   The grids are conceptually divided into 4x4 blocks.\n    *   The \"seeds\" in the input determine where these 4x4 patterns appear in the output.\n    *   The top-left corner of the seed pixel in the input corresponds to the top-left corner of the 4x4 pattern in the output.\n\n2.  **Color Mapping and Patterns:**\n    *   Input **Red (2)** $\\rightarrow$ Output **Yellow (4)** Hollow Square.\n        Pattern:\n        ```\n        4 4 4 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 4 4 4\n        ```\n    *   Input **Green (3)** $\\rightarrow$ Output **Blue (1)** Ring.\n        Pattern:\n        ```\n        0 1 1 0\n        1 0 0 1\n        1 0 0 1\n        0 1 1 0\n        ```\n    *   Input **Gray (5)** $\\rightarrow$ Output **Magenta (6)** Checkerboard.\n        Pattern:\n        ```\n        6 6 0 0\n        6 6 0 0\n        0 0 6 6\n        0 0 6 6\n        ```\n    *   Input **Teal (8)** $\\rightarrow$ Output **Orange (7)** Pattern.\n        Pattern:\n        ```\n        7 0 0 7\n        0 7 7 0\n        0 7 7 0\n        7 0 0 7\n        ```\n\n3.  **Behavior of Other Inputs:**\n    *   Input pixels that are part of a pre-drawn pattern (e.g., the magenta blocks in Ex 1, the yellow square in Ex 3, the partial orange pattern in the test input) are ignored and result in empty (0) output cells.

The only seed color present is **8**, so:\n\n   - All 8\u2019s will generate the pink 7\u2011glyph.\n   - The existing 7\u2011shaped pattern in the middle of the input is **ignored as an input object** (it is a leftover pink glyph with no grey seed at its top\u2011left, just like the unused 4\u2011ring in Example 3).\n\n   **Locations of 8 seeds** (1\u2011based row, column):\n\n   - Row 2:  (2,1), (2,5), (2,9), (2,13), (2,17)\n   - Row 6:  (6,1), (6,17)\n   - Row 10: (10,1), (10,9), (10,17)\n   - Row 14: (14,1), (14,13), (14,17)\n   - Row 18: (18,1), (18,5), (18,9), (18,13), (18,17)\n\n   For each such (r,c), we stamp:\n\n   ```\n   at (r+0,c+0) = 7, (r+0,c+3) = 7\n   at (r+1,c+1) = 7, (r+1,c+2) = 7\n   at (r+2,c+1) = 7, (r+2,c+2) = 7\n   at (r+3,c+0) = 7, (r+3,c+3) = 7\n   ```\n   where those coordinates lie inside the 20\u00d720 grid. For seeds on row 18, the row `r+3 = 21` lies outside, so the bottom row of the pattern is cropped.\n\n   Because all seeds are spaced at least 4 cells apart in both directions, their \\(4\\times4\\) patterns do not overlap; we simply OR them into the zero grid.\n\n---\n\n### Final output grid\n\nPutting all of these stamped glyphs together gives the following 20\u00d720 output:\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"L\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nTo solve this puzzle, I first looked at the four provided examples to spot a consistent rule. Every non\u2011zero pixel in the input that is an isolated singleton of a \u201cglyph\u201d colour is replaced by a fixed \\(4\\times 4\\) motif anchored with its top\u2011left corner at the original pixel location; all other input cells are ignored. The glyph colours and their output motifs are:\n\n- 2 (red) \u2192 colour\u202f4 motif: a full border ring `[[4,4,4,4],[4,0,0,4],[4,0,0,4],[4,4,4,4]]`\n- 3 (green) \u2192 colour\u202f1 motif: `[[0,1,1,0],[1,0,0,1],[1,0,0,1],[0,1,1,0]]`\n- 5 (grey) \u2192 colour\u202f6 motif: `[[6,6,0,0],[6,6,0,0],[0,0,6,6],[0,0,6,6]]`\n- 8 (light blue) \u2192 colour\u202f7 motif: `[[7,0,0,7],[0,7,7,0],[0,7,7,0],[7,0,0,7]]`\n\nOnly single\u2011pixel components of these colours are expanded; other colours and larger components are dropped. Patterns are clipped at the grid boundary, and because the seeds in the test are spaced by 4 both horizontally and vertically, none of the motifs overlap.\n\nIn the test input, the only glyph colour present is 8. Each 8 is isolated, so I placed the orange (7) motif at each of their coordinates, truncating the bottom row for motifs starting at row\u202f17. All other cells remain 0. The resulting 20\u00d720 output grid is:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"M\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nTo solve this task, first identify the \u201cseed\u201d pixels: isolated single pixels of the recognised input colours 2 (red), 3 (green), 5 (grey) and 8 (light blue).

The input contains a \"template pattern\" (a 4x4 shape made of a specific color) and various \"marker\" values scattered at grid intersections.\n\n2. The markers are single values (2, 3, 5, 8, etc.) placed at positions that define a grid structure.\n\n3. Each marker value maps to a specific 4x4 pattern in the output:\n   - 2 \u2192 Color 4 pattern (filled rectangle outline)\n   - 3 \u2192 Color 1 pattern (hollow square)\n   - 5 \u2192 Color 6 pattern (diagonal 2x2 blocks)\n   - 8 \u2192 Color 7 pattern (X/diamond shape)\n\n4. The template pattern in the input shows what pattern shape corresponds to which color.\n\n**For the Test Input:**\n\nThe template is the color 7 pattern at rows 5-8, cols 4-7:\n```\n7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7\n```\n\nMarkers identified (value 8 and 7 which is the template):\n- Row 1: cols 0,4,8,12,16 (all 8s)\n- Row 5: col 0 (8), col 4 (7-template), col 16 (8)\n- Row 9: cols 0,8,16 (8s)\n- Row 13: cols 0,12,16 (8s)\n- Row 17: cols 0,4,8,12,16 (8s)\n\nSince 8 \u2192 7 pattern, every marker position gets filled with the 7 pattern.

I see large grids, typically filled with sparse, non-zero pixel data. The outputs appear similar in size to the inputs. A key observation is the recurrence of 4x4 blocks in the output. I note Example 2's size and consider the block-based structuring. I re-examine Example 1's input and notice pixel coordinates, color codes (like magenta '6' and yellow '4') and identify trigger points, pixels (1,8) and (1,13) result in identical yellow block patterns in the output, while pixel (5,5) creates nothing. Further examination reveals that the inputs can be split into 4x4 blocks, and that the positions of pixels relative to these cells determine output placement.\n\n**Hypothesis Formation: Pixel-to-Pattern Mapping & Initial Rule**\n\nI hypothesize that a non-zero pixel at a coordinate (r, c) with a color 'C' triggers a specific 4x4 pattern, the top-left corner of which is placed at (r, c). I now begin to map color codes to unique patterns. For example, a red '2' generates a Yellow Hollow Square, green '3' generates a blue diamond and grey '5' creates a magenta 2x2. The pixel at (5,5) seems to break the rule, producing nothing. The top-left corner placement seems to be consistent across examples, including the 10x10 ones. I note that even in those cases where '5' does produce an output, like (11,8), it's a 2x2.\n\n**Rule Refinement & \"Solo Pixel\" Filtering**\n\nI examine why (5,5) input generates no output: (5,5) is alone on its row. I test this \"solo pixel\" rule against other examples. I find that pixels that form a group, i.e. are not alone in a row, cause output. I refine my rules with the trigger colors {2,3,5,8} and add a filter that discards trigger pixels that are alone in their row.\n\n**Pattern Preservation & Output Construction: The \"Orange X\"**\n\nAnalyzing the test input, I observe that some pixels form recognizable 7-based orange 'X' patterns. This leads me to believe I need to incorporate existing patterns. Any existing \"7\" blocks are to be kept and not overwritten.\n\n**Final Rule Set & Code Generation**\n\nIn summary, the rule is to generate the appropriate 4x4 pattern for all input colors {2,3,5,8}, discarding those that have no other non-zero pixels in their respective rows, and adding the existing 7s to the output.\n\nApplying the rule to the test input: I generate the appropriate output Orange X shape for colors that have valid input points, following the color code's specific patterns. These outputs are created by copying an existing orange 7 pattern to create the output, ensuring a final 20x20 grid that represents the test answer.\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the rules inferred from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Rules:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**: The output grids are composed of $4 \\times 4$ patterns. The position of these patterns corresponds to the position of \"trigger\" pixels in the input grid. Specifically, a non-zero pixel at $(r, c)$ in the input triggers the drawing of a $4 \\times 4$ pattern with its top-left corner at $(r, c)$ in the output.\n\n2.  **Color Mapping**: Each input color maps to a specific output pattern and color scheme.\n    *   **Input 2 (Red)** $\\rightarrow$ **Output 4 (Yellow)**: A hollow $4 \\times 4$ square.\n        ```\n        4 4 4 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 4 4 4\n        ```\n    *   **Input 3 (Green)** $\\rightarrow$ **Output 1 (Blue)**: A diamond/circle shape.\n        ```\n        0 1 1 0\n        1 0 0 1\n        1 0 0 1\n        0 1 1 0\n        ```\n    *   **Input 5 (Grey)** $\\rightarrow$ **Output 6 (Magenta)**: Two diagonal $2 \\times 2$ blocks.\n        ```\n        6 6 0 0\n        6 6 0 0\n        0 0 6 6\n        0 0 6 6\n        ```\n    *   **Input 8 (Azure)** (From Test Input/Example 4) $\\rightarrow$ **Output 7 (Orange)**: An \"X\" or hourglass shape.\n        ```\n        7 0 0 7\n        0 7 7 0\n        0 7 7 0\n        7 0 0 7\n        ```\n\n3.  **Filtering/Noise**:\n    *   Pixels of colors not in the trigger list (like 6 in Example 1) are ignored (noise).\n    *   **Isolation Rule**: A trigger pixel is only valid if it is **not** the only non-zero pixel in its row. In Example 1 and 3, isolated pixels (5 at (5,5), 2 at (4,4)) produced no output. In the test input, all trigger rows contain multiple elements, satisfying this condition.\n\n4.  **Preservation**: If the input already contains a partial or complete pattern (like the Orange X formed by 7s in the test input), it is preserved or treated as a trigger for that pattern.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Row 1**: Contains 8s at indices 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. These are valid triggers. We draw the Orange X pattern at each location.\n*   **Row 5**: Contains 8s at 0, 16. It also contains 7s at cols 4-7 forming an Orange X. This counts as a valid pattern at index 4. Indices 8 and 12 are empty gaps.\n    *   Pattern sequence: Pattern, Pattern, Gap, Gap, Pattern.\n*   **Row 9**: Contains 8s at 0, 8, 16. Gaps at 4, 12.\n    *   Pattern sequence: Pattern, Gap, Pattern, Gap, Pattern.\n*   **Row 13**: Contains 8s at 0, 12, 16.

Overlaying tile T\u2088 at those positions (and at the\n   existing 7\u2011block at `(6,5)`) yields the final grid below.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\nRow by row:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7  \n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0  \n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0  \n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7  \n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7  \n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0  \n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0  \n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7  \n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7  \n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0  \n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0  \n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7  \n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7  \n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0  \n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0  \n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7  \n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7  \n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0  \n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"J\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**The Problem-Solving Process**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants me to tackle an ARC problem, and the goal is to transform a grid based on some examples. It's an ARC task, so it's about finding the underlying logic and generalizing it.\n\n1.  **Understanding the Request**: The core task is clear: I have input grids, and I need to transform them to get output grids. I've got examples, which are super important because they hold the clues to the transformation. I also have some hints, but I know better than to just blindly trust them. They're often slightly off, or they only hint at part of the process.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Data**: My first step is to analyze the data. I've got examples to examine, a key aspect of these problems. I've to decode the transformation rules and see how the inputs turn into the outputs. Dimensions are constant. This is good to know, and the hints \"Glyph Expansion\", \"Rigid color mapping\", and \"Existing objects preserved\" are like breadcrumbs. I am very much checking those hints, but I know there may be a lot of nuances in the details!\n\n3.  **Digging into the examples**: The specific hint says \"Single pixels are 3x3 pattern.\" Oh, but the given examples looks like 4x4 patterns! Maybe the hint is misleading, or it's a simplification, or I'm missing something. That's a classic ARC thing, I think. I'm going to look very closely at the pixel expansions and build my understanding. The sizes seem to be: `2 -> 4-ring pattern`, `3-> 1(octagon) pattern`, `5 -> 6 pattern` etc.\n\n    *   **The Grid Size:** The input and output grids are of the same size across all examples. This offers clarity.\n\n    *   **Pattern Mapping:** The pattern is very important here. For example, if I see input `3`, the pattern that matches it seems to be centered around it. I have to align indices to the pattern grid. My intuition tells me that the top-left coordinate, (r,c), where an input value exists corresponds to the location of the top-left coordinate of the 4x4 output block.\n\n    *   **Expansion:** Input `3` at (1,1) becomes the center of a block. Input `2` at (1,5) expands to a 4x4 block. Input color, locations and the output shapes, and the pixel values of shapes within output are all related, and that's the key.\n\n    *   **Mapping Rules:** I create mapping rules: Input `3` becomes 1 Octagon. Input `2` becomes a 4-ring. Input `5` becomes 6 pattern, etc.\n\n    *   **Overlapping and Objects:** The hint states that \"Existing objects ... are preserved.\" But, is it? Example 1 seems to imply that objects that are not \"valid shapes\" will be removed. Does that mean the input objects (blocks of colors) have to conform to a specific list of *patterns*, and *colors*? Example 2 has some patterns being overwritten. I'm building a clearer view of this.\n\n4.  **Verifying Assumptions**: In example 1, I find the 2x2 blocks of `6` (magenta). They just *disappear* in the output. The hint \"existing objects...\" also doesn't apply? Is 6 a dead color? The same thing happens with example 3: the 4x4 block of yellow is just gone. My theory is that, while blocks are \"existing\" they need to be of known pattern. Or it's a matter of the \"Expansion\" overwriting the old objects.\n\n    *   I've got the rules for the patterns down to sizes and coordinates. The hint says \"expansion is centered\", but really, it's about the top-left coordinate.\n\n5.  **Let's check the test input**: The test input has a pre-existing Orange block of 7s that will, I think, be preserved.\n\n    *   I see a 4x4 `7` pattern, and a grid of `8`'s.\n    *   This is an existing object. It won't be modified in the output.\n    *   I think I need to expand the `8`s to create the pattern, but not to overwrite the original block.\n\n6.  **Forming a construction rule**: So here's the construction plan for each element in the final output grid:\n\n    *   Initialize the output grid (20x20).\n    *   Copy \"Existing Objects.\"\n    *   Find the single pixels with known colors (`\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid based on rules inferred from examples. Here is the step-by-step logical derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Transformation:**\n    The task is a \"Glyph Expansion\". Single pixels in the input (\"seeds\") are replaced by $4 \\times 4$ patterns in the output. The top-left corner of the $4 \\times 4$ output pattern corresponds to the coordinates of the input seed pixel.\n\n2.  **Determine Color Mappings and Patterns:**\n    By observing the examples, we can map specific input colors to output patterns (size $4 \\times 4$):\n    *   **Red (2) $\\to$ Yellow (4) Ring:** (Example 1 & 3)\n        ```\n        4 4 4 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 4 4 4\n        ```\n    *   **Green (3) $\\to$ Blue (1) Octagon:** (Example 2)\n        ```\n        0 1 1 0\n        1 0 0 1\n        1 0 0 1\n        0 1 1 0\n        ```\n    *   **Grey (5) $\\to$ Magenta (6) Pattern:** (Example 1)\n        ```\n        6 6 0 0\n        6 6 0 0\n        0 0 6 6\n        0 0 6 6\n        ```\n    *   **Light Blue (8) $\\to$ Orange (7) Hourglass:** (Example 4)\n        ```\n        7 0 0 7\n        0 7 7 0\n        0 7 7 0\n        7 0 0 7\n        ```\n\n3.  **Handle Existing Objects and Deletions:**\n    *   **Existing Objects:** Any pre-existing patterns that match the output format are preserved. The prompt notes that objects larger than a single pixel are copied. In the Test Input, there is a pre-formed Orange (7) pattern at rows 5-8, columns 4-7. This matches the result of an expansion, so it stays.\n    *   **Deletions:** Unrecognized single pixels or areas without seeds/objects become empty (0).\n\n4.  **Apply to Test Input:**\n    *   **Input Analysis:** The input contains seeds of color **8** (Light Blue) and one existing **7** (Orange) object.\n    *   **Grid Layout:** The seeds are positioned at intervals. They appear at rows 1, 5, 9, 13, and 17. Horizontally, they are at columns 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16.\n    *   **Expansion:** We replace every `8` with the $4 \\times 4$ Orange `7` pattern. We leave empty spaces (0) where seeds are missing. The existing object at (Row 5, Col 4) is preserved (which looks identical to an expanded seed).\n    *   **Boundary:** The grid is $20 \\times 20$.\n        *   Row 0 is empty.\n        *   Rows 1-4 contain the first row of patterns.\n        *   Rows 5-8 contain the second row of patterns.\n        *   Rows 9-12 contain the third row of patterns.\n        *   Rows 13-16 contain the fourth row of patterns.\n        *   Rows 17-19 contain the fifth row of patterns, but since the pattern is 4 pixels high and the grid ends at row 19, the last row of the pattern is truncated.\n\n    **Row-by-Row Construction Plan:**\n    *   **Row 0:** All `0`.\n    *   **Rows 1-4:** Seeds are present at cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. Full row of 5 patterns.\n    *   **Rows 5-8:** Seeds at 0, 16. Existing object at 4. Missing seeds at 8, 12. Result: Pattern, Pattern, Empty, Empty, Pattern.\n    *   **Rows 9-12:** Seeds at 0, 8, 16. Missing at 4, 12. Result: Pattern, Empty, Pattern, Empty, Pattern.\n    *   **Rows 13-16:** Seeds at 0, 12, 16. Missing at 4, 8. Result: Pattern, Empty, Empty, Pattern, Pattern.\n    *   **Rows 17-19:** Seeds at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. Full row of patterns (truncated to height 3).\n\noutput:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"K\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n## Analysis\n\n1. **Color Mapping for Single Pixels**: Single pixels expand into 4\u00d74 patterns:\n   -

I\u2019ll denote them by their geometry (using the output color that appears in the examples):\n\n- **Pattern P2 (hollow square)** \u2014 color 4  \n  ```\n  4 4 4 4\n  4 0 0 4\n  4 0 0 4\n  4 4 4 4\n  ```\n  Seen in:\n  - Example 3 input (as a template in color 4) and output at each 2.\n  - Example 1, 2, 4 outputs at each input color 2.\n\n- **Pattern P1 (diamond-ish)** \u2014 color 1  \n  ```\n  0 1 1 0\n  1 0 0 1\n  1 0 0 1\n  0 1 1 0\n  ```\n  Seen in:\n  - Example 2 input (as a template in color 1) around a 3, and output at each 3.\n  - Example 1 and 4 outputs at each input color 3.\n\n- **Pattern P3 (two diagonal 2\u00d72 blocks)** \u2014 color 6  \n  ```\n  6 6 0 0\n  6 6 0 0\n  0 0 6 6\n  0 0 6 6\n  ```\n  Seen in:\n  - Example 1 input as a cluster of 6s (template), and in output at certain 5s.\n  - Example 4 outputs at every input 5.\n\n- **Pattern P4 (corners + central 2\u00d72)** \u2014 color 7  \n  ```\n  7 0 0 7\n  0 7 7 0\n  0 7 7 0\n  7 0 0 7\n  ```\n  Seen in:\n  - Example 4 outputs at each input 8 (no template in input).\n  - The test input has exactly this shape in color 7 at rows 5\u20138, cols 4\u20137.\n\n2. **Map marker colors \u2192 patterns**\n\nFrom the examples, the mapping is consistent:\n\n- Input color **2** \u2192 pattern **P2**, drawn in color **4**.\n- Input color **3** \u2192 pattern **P1**, drawn in color **1**.\n- Input color **5** \u2192 pattern **P3**, drawn in color **6**.\n- Input color **8** \u2192 pattern **P4**, drawn in color **7**.\n\nThe colors 1,4,6,7 are \u201cpattern colors\u201d (used to draw the shapes); 2,3,5,8 are \u201cmarker colors\u201d.\n\n3. **Placement rules**\n\nFrom all examples:\n\n- For each marker cell of one of the marker colors, place the corresponding 4\u00d74 pattern with its **top\u2011left corner at that cell**, as long as the whole 4\u00d74 block fits inside the grid.\n  - Example 2: the 3 at (9,9) does nothing because a 4\u00d74 from (9,9) would go off the 10\u00d710 grid.\n  - Example 4: all markers are at rows/cols 0,4,8,12,16, so every 4\u00d74 fits.\n- If the pattern does not fit (i.e. row > H\u22124 or col > W\u22124), **ignore that marker**.\n- The final grid is made **only** of these patterns; original markers and any template shapes in the input are removed (Example 3: the original 4\u00d74 hollow square at the top\u2011left disappears; Example 1: original P3 cluster of 6s disappears). Effectively we start from an all\u20110 grid and stamp patterns.\n\n4. **Apply to the test input**\n\nThe test grid is 20\u00d720.\n\n**Non-zero colors in test input:**\n\n- Color **7**: forms a 4\u00d74 block at rows 5\u20138, cols 4\u20137:\n\n  ```\n  rows 5\u20138, cols 4\u20137:\n  7 0 0 7\n  0 7 7 0\n  0 7 7 0\n  7 0 0 7\n  ```\n\n  This is exactly pattern **P4**, in color 7. This serves as an in\u2011input example of P4 but, by the global rule, **it is not copied unless its color\u2019s marker (8) appears there**. It will be removed in the output if no stamp lands there.\n\n- Color **8**: appears at the following coordinates (row, col) (0\u2011based indices):\n\n  - Row 1: (1,0), (1,4), (1,8), (1,12), (1,16)\n  - Row 5: (5,0), (5,16)\n  - Row 9: (9,0), (9,8), (9,16)\n  - Row 13: (13,0), (13,12), (13,16)\n  - Row 17: (17,0), (17,4), (17,8), (17,12), (17,16)\n\nAccording to the learned mapping, each 8 should generate a **P4** stamp (pattern of 7s) with its top\u2011left at that cell, **if** the 4\u00d74 fits.\n\n- The grid size is 20\u00d720, so valid top\u2011left anchors satisfy row \u2264 16, col \u2264 16.\n- Thus, **all 8s in row 17 are invalid** as anchors (17+3=20, off the bottom), so those markers are ignored.\n- All 8s in rows 1,5,9,13 are valid (rows 1,5,9,13 \u226416; cols 0,4,8,12,16 \u226416).\n\nSo we will stamp P4 at these anchors:\n\n- A: (1,0)\n- B: (1,4)\n- C: (1,8)\n- D: (1,12)\n- E: (1,16)\n- F: (5,0)\n- G: (5,16)\n- H: (9,0)\n- I: (9,8)\n- J: (9,16)\n- K: (13,0)\n- L: (13,12)\n- M: (13,16)\n\n**Pattern P4 coordinates relative to anchor (r,c):**\n\nWe place 7 at:\n- (r+0, c+0), (r+0, c+3)\n- (r+1, c+1), (r+1, c+2)\n- (r+2, c+1), (r+2, c+2)\n- (r+3, c+0), (r+3, c+3)\n\nStamping each of the valid anchors, and knowing there is no overlap (the anchors are spaced so each 4\u00d74 region is disjoint), we get the following 7\u2011positions by row:\n\n- Row 0: none\n- Row 1: from A\u2013E \u2192 cols 0,3,4,7,8,11,12,15,16,19\n- Row 2: from A\u2013E \u2192 cols 1,2,5,6,9,10,13,14,17,18\n- Row 3: same as row 2\n- Row 4: same as row 1\n- Row 5: from F,G \u2192 cols 0,3,16,19\n- Row 6: from F,G \u2192 cols 1,2,17,18\n- Row 7: same as row 6\n- Row 8: same as row 5\n- Row 9: from H,I,J \u2192 cols 0,3,8,11,16,19\n- Row 10: from H,I,J \u2192 cols 1,2,9,10,17,18\n- Row 11: same as row 10\n- Row 12: same as row 9\n- Row 13: from K,L,M \u2192 cols 0,3,12,15,16,19\n- Row 14: from K,L,M \u2192 cols 1,2,13,14,17,18\n- Row 15: same as row 14\n- Row 16: same as row 13\n- Rows 17\u201319: none, because row\u201117 markers are invalid and we start from 0.\n\nThe original P4 of 7s at rows 5\u20138, cols 4\u20137 is **not** tied to any 8 marker, so under the learned rule it is removed (just like the original hollow square in Example 3).\n\n5. **Final output grid**\n\nNow write each row as 20 comma\u2011separated integers (0 or 7):\n\nRow 0:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 1:\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 2:\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 3:\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 4:\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 5:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 6:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 7:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 8:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 9:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 10:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 11:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 12:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 13:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 14:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 15:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 16:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 17:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 18:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 19:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"B\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-high_1_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nFirst I\u2019ll describe the pattern that\u2019s common to the training examples, then apply it to the test input.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the training examples are doing\n\nAcross the examples you can see that the outputs are built from a small set of **fixed 4\u00d74 patterns (\u201ctiles\u201d)**, always in the same colors and shapes:\n\n### The four 4\u00d74 tiles\n\nI\u2019ll write `x` for a colored cell and `.` for 0.\n\n1. **Tile A (border square, color 4)**  \n\n   ```\n   xxxx\n   x..x\n   x..x\n   xxxx\n   ```\n\n2. **Tile B (ring without corners, color 1)**  \n\n   ```\n   .xx.\n   x..x\n   x..x\n   .xx.\n   ```\n\n3. **Tile C (two 2\u00d72 blocks on the main diagonal, color 6)**  \n\n   ```\n   xx..\n   xx..\n   ..xx\n   ..xx\n   ```\n\n4. **Tile D (corners + central 2\u00d72 block, color 7)**  \n\n   ```\n   x..x\n   .xx.\n   .xx.\n   x..x\n   ```\n\nYou see these clearly in Example 4\u2019s output: it is a 5\u00d75 grid of 4\u00d74 tiles; each input number from {2,3,5,8} selects one of the four tiles:\n\n- Input 2 \u2192 Tile A (color 4)\n- Input 3 \u2192 Tile B (color 1)\n- Input 5 \u2192 Tile C (color 6)\n- Input 8 \u2192 Tile D (color 7)\n\nExample 2 and Example 1 show only some of these tiles (because their inputs use only some of the codes), but the mapping is consistent:\n\n- In Example 2:\n  - Input cells with value 2 generate Tile A (4s) at that location.\n  - Input cells with value 3 generate Tile B (1s) at that location.\n- In Example 3:\n  - We see Tile A (4s) replicated at each input 2-cell, except for the one 2-cell that is used as the \u201ctraining\u201d association with the prototype 4\u00d74 square in the input.\n- In Example 1:\n  - Input 2s produce Tile A (4s).\n  - Input 3s produce Tile B (1s).\n  - Input 5s produce Tile C (6s), again except for a single 5 which is used adjacent to a prototype pattern of 6s to \u201cdefine\u201d the mapping 5\u2192Tile C.\n\nThose \u201cprototype shapes\u201d (clusters of 4s, 1s, 6s etc. in the inputs) are just there to show what each tile looks like; the outputs themselves are constructed only from the code colors {2,3,5,8}, using the dictionary above. Where a code is too close to the bottom or right border so that a full 4\u00d74 tile would not fit, it is simply ignored (as in Example 2 for the 3 at the bottom-right).\n\nSo the operational rule is:\n\n> Start with an all\u2011zero grid.  \n> For every cell whose value is 2, 3, 5, or 8, if a 4\u00d74 tile placed with its top-left corner at that cell fits entirely inside the grid, draw the corresponding 4\u00d74 tile there using colors 4,1,6,7 as per the mapping.  \n> Ignore all other input cells (including the \u201cprototype\u201d shapes).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Understand the test input\n\nTest input (20\u00d720) uses values 8 and 7:\n\n- Many **8s** laid out in a 5\u00d75 grid (rows 1,5,9,13,17; columns 0,4,8,12,16).\n- A cluster of **7s** forming exactly Tile D (4\u00d74 \u201ccorner+center\u201d pattern) at rows 5\u20138, columns 4\u20137.\n\nGiven the training, we interpret:\n\n- 8 is a **code** value, which should generate **Tile D** (color 7).\n- 7s here are **a prototype shape** for Tile D and are not themselves codes, so they should not directly appear in the output unless overlapped by a tile.\n\nWe also must apply the border rule: a 4\u00d74 tile with top-left at (r,c) fits only if `r+3 \u2264 19` and `c+3 \u2264 19`. That is, valid anchors must satisfy `r \u2264 16` and `c \u2264 16`.\n\n### 8-cells in the test input\n\nList all 8s and check whether their tile would fit:\n\n- Row 1: (1,0), (1,4), (1,8), (1,12), (1,16) \u2014 all valid (1 \u2264 16, columns \u2264 16).\n- Row 5: (5,0), (5,16) \u2014 valid.\n- Row 9: (9,0), (9,8), (9,16) \u2014 valid.\n- Row 13: (13,0), (13,12), (13,16) \u2014 valid.\n- Row 17: (17,0), (17,4), (17,8), (17,12), (17,16) \u2014 **invalid** (17+3 = 20 > 19), so we ignore these.\n\nNo other nonzero codes 2,3,5 appear, so we only need to draw Tile D at these 13 valid 8-cells.\n\nThe prototype 7-shape at rows 5\u20138, cols 4\u20137 is not at a code location, so under the rule we do **not** copy it; those 7s disappear in the output (unless some tile happens to overwrite that region, which in this case they do not).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Constructing the output\n\nWe start with a 20\u00d720 grid of 0s.\n\nFor each valid 8 at (r,c), we draw Tile D (color 7) with its top-left at (r,c):\n\nTile D pattern:\n\n- Row r:     7,0,0,7\n- Row r + 1: 0,7,7,0\n- Row r + 2: 0,7,7,0\n- Row r + 3: 7,0,0,7\n\nBecause the 8s are spaced every 4 cells both horizontally and vertically, these 4\u00d74 tiles **abut but do not overlap**, so we can just place them all; between them and at top/bottom there remain all-0 rows/segments.\n\nDoing this for all valid 8s yields:\n\n- Row 0: no tile covers it \u2192 all 0.\n- Rows 1\u20134: a full row of tiles across columns 0\u201319.\n- Rows 5\u20138: tiles only at columns 0\u20133 and 16\u201319.\n- Rows 9\u201312: tiles at columns 0\u20133, 8\u201311, 16\u201319.\n- Rows 13\u201316: tiles at columns 0\u20133, 12\u201315, 16\u201319.\n- Rows 17\u201319: no tiles \u2192 all 0.\n\nWriting the resulting grid explicitly:\n\nRow 0:\n`0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 1 (dr0 repeated 5\u00d7):\n`7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7`\n\nRow 2 (dr1 repeated 5\u00d7):\n`0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0`\n\nRow 3 (same as row 2):\n`0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0`\n\nRow 4 (same as row 1):\n`7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7`\n\nRow 5 (tiles at c=0 and c=16):\n`7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7`\n\nRow 6:\n`0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0`\n\nRow 7 (same as row 6):\n`0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0`\n\nRow 8 (same as row 5):\n`7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7`\n\nRow 9 (tiles at c=0,8,16):\n`7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7`\n\nRow 10:\n`0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0`\n\nRow 11 (same as row 10):\n`0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0`\n\nRow 12 (same as row 9):\n`7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7`\n\nRow 13 (tiles at c=0,12,16):\n`7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7`\n\nRow 14:\n`0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0`\n\nRow 15 (same as row 14):\n`0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0`\n\nRow 16 (same as row 13):\n`7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7`\n\nRow 17:\n`0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 18:\n`0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 19:\n`0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\nHere is the completed output grid in the required format:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"C\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_2_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nFrom the four solved pairs you can see that the output is built from standard 4\u00d74 \u201cstamps\u201d. Only the input colours 2,\u202f3,\u202f5 and\u202f8 are used; other input values are ignored. Each of those four input values maps to a fixed stamp and output colour:\n\n- 2 \u2192 colour\u202f4, full hollow square  \n  ```\n  4 4 4 4\n  4 0 0 4\n  4 0 0 4\n  4 4 4 4\n  ```\n- 3 \u2192 colour\u202f1, border without the corners  \n  ```\n  0 1 1 0\n  1 0 0 1\n  1 0 0 1\n  0 1 1 0\n  ```\n- 5 \u2192 colour\u202f6, two filled 2\u00d72 blocks on the main diagonal  \n  ```\n  6 6 0 0\n  6 6 0 0\n  0 0 6 6\n  0 0 6 6\n  ```\n- 8 \u2192 colour\u202f7, corners and centre filled  \n  ```\n  7 0 0 7\n  0 7 7 0\n  0 7 7 0\n  7 0 0 7\n  ```\n\nStamps are placed with their top\u2011left corner at the coordinate of the triggering input cell. Processing is done from bottom rows to top so that earlier stamps can block later ones: before placing a stamp you check that the 4\u00d74 area lies wholly inside the grid and that none of its cells in the output are already non\u2011zero. If either condition fails the stamp is skipped. The output starts as all zeros and only these stamps are drawn.\n\nIn the test grid only value\u202f8 is relevant. The 8s on row\u202f17 would overrun the bottom of the grid so they are skipped; the rest fit and do not overlap. Ignoring the input 7\u2011pattern, the resulting output grid is:\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"D\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-high_4_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Identify what the colors mean in the examples**\n\n   Looking at Examples 1\u20134, there is a consistent behavior:\n\n   - Certain input colors act as *commands* and are always replaced by a fixed 4\u00d74 pattern of a *different* color:\n     \n     From Examples 2 and 4:\n     - Input `2` \u2192 outputs a 4\u00d74 hollow square of color `4`.\n       ```\n       4 4 4 4\n       4 0 0 4\n       4 0 0 4\n       4 4 4 4\n       ```\n     - Input `3` \u2192 outputs a 4\u00d74 \u201cdiamond/cross\u201d of color `1`:\n       ```\n       0 1 1 0\n       1 0 0 1\n       1 0 0 1\n       0 1 1 0\n       ```\n     - Input `5` \u2192 outputs a 4\u00d74 of color `6` with two 2\u00d72 blocks on the diagonal:\n       ```\n       6 6 0 0\n       6 6 0 0\n       0 0 6 6\n       0 0 6 6\n       ```\n     - Input `8` \u2192 outputs a 4\u00d74 \u201cring\u201d of color `7`:\n       ```\n       7 0 0 7\n       0 7 7 0\n       0 7 7 0\n       7 0 0 7\n       ```\n\n   - These patterns appear with their **top-left corner** exactly at the coordinates of the command cell.\n\n   - Other colors in the input (like the 6-blocks or 4-blocks used as prototypes) disappear in the outputs; the outputs are built from scratch by placing these patterns.\n\n   - If placing a 4\u00d74 pattern would extend beyond the bounds of the grid, the command is **ignored**, not clipped.  \n     Example 2: input has a `3` at (10,10); a 4\u00d74 pattern from there would go off the bottom edge. In the output, there is no partial pattern at the bottom-right: that `3` is simply ignored.\n\n   - Overlaps between patterns are rare and not essential here; conceptually we can think of drawing on a blank canvas with these tiles.\n\n   Therefore, the abstract rule:\n\n   > Start from an all-zero grid. For every cell:\n   > - If it is `2`, place the 4\u00d74 `4`-square at that position (if fully inside).\n   > - If it is `3`, place the 4\u00d74 `1`-cross at that position (if fully inside).\n   > - If it is `5`, place the 4\u00d74 `6`-diagonal pattern at that position (if fully inside).\n   > - If it is `8`, place the 4\u00d74 `7`-ring at that position (if fully inside).\n   > Ignore all other colors in the input as *non-commands*.\n   > If a command\u2019s 4\u00d74 tile would go out of bounds, skip it.\n\n   Example 4 shows all four commands (`2,3,5,8`) producing their respective patterns (`4,1,6,7`).  \n   Example 3 shows that pre-existing shapes can appear in the input but the output is *still* generated by applying the above commands (there, only `2` is a command; the pre-existing `4`-shape is effectively replaced by copies determined by `2`\u2019s positions).\n\n2. **Analyze the test input**\n\n   Test input uses only colors `8` and `7` (plus `0`):\n\n   - `8` occurs at:\n     - Row 2: c1, c5, c9, c13, c17\n     - Row 6: c1, c17\n     - Row 10: c1, c9, c17\n     - Row 14: c1, c13, c17\n     - Row 18: c1, c5, c9, c13, c17\n   - `7` forms a 4\u00d74 ring in rows 6\u20139, cols 5\u20138, which is exactly the `7`-ring pattern we saw as **output** from `8` in training. Here it appears in the **input**, but no training example ever uses `7` as a command color, so by the rule above, `7` is not a command and is ignored.\n\n   We only treat `8` as a command.\n\n3. **Decide which `8` cells are valid commands**\n\n   The tile for `8` is a 4\u00d74 block. A command at (r,c) is valid only if\n   - r+3 \u2264 20 and c+3 \u2264 20 (grid is 20\u00d720).\n\n   Check each row of `8`s:\n\n   - r = 2: 2+3 = 5 \u2264 20 \u2192 all `8`s in row 2 valid.\n   - r = 6: 6+3 = 9 \u2264 20 \u2192 both `8`s in row 6 valid.\n   - r = 10: 10+3 = 13 \u2264 20 \u2192 all row-10 `8`s valid.\n   - r = 14: 14+3 = 17 \u2264 20 \u2192 all row-14 `8`s valid.\n   - r = 18: 18+3 = 21 > 20 \u2192 all row-18 `8`s are **invalid** and must be ignored.\n\n   So we place `7`-ring tiles at:\n\n   - (2,1), (2,5), (2,9), (2,13), (2,17)\n   - (6,1), (6,17)\n   - (10,1), (10,9), (10,17)\n   - (14,1), (14,13), (14,17)\n\n4. **Compute the positions of `7` for each tile**\n\n   The 4\u00d74 pattern for an `8` at (r,c) is:\n\n   ```\n   (r,  c)   = 7   (r,  c+1) = 0   (r,  c+2) = 0   (r,  c+3) = 7\n   (r+1,c)   = 0   (r+1,c+1) = 7   (r+1,c+2) = 7   (r+1,c+3) = 0\n   (r+2,c)   = 0   (r+2,c+1) = 7   (r+2,c+2) = 7   (r+2,c+3) = 0\n   (r+3,c)   = 7   (r+3,c+1) = 0   (r+3,c+2) = 0   (r+3,c+3) = 7\n   ```\n\n   Doing this for each valid command and taking the union (no overlaps here), we get all 7-positions row by row:\n\n   - Row 1: none\n   - Row 2: from tiles at (2,1),(2,5),(2,9),(2,13),(2,17):  \n     7 at c1,4,5,8,9,12,13,16,17,20\n   - Row 3: from the same tiles (their second row):  \n     7 at c2,3,6,7,10,11,14,15,18,19\n   - Row 4: identical to Row 3 (third row of those tiles)\n   - Row 5: identical to Row 2 (fourth row of those tiles)\n\n   - Row 6: from tiles at (6,1),(6,17):  \n     7 at c1,4,17,20\n   - Row 7: from those tiles (row+1):  \n     7 at c2,3,18,19\n   - Row 8: same as Row 7\n   - Row 9: same as Row 6\n\n   - Row 10: from tiles at (10,1),(10,9),(10,17):  \n     7 at c1,4,9,12,17,20\n   - Row 11: from those tiles (row+1):  \n     7 at c2,3,10,11,18,19\n   - Row 12: same as Row 11\n   - Row 13: same as Row 10\n\n   - Row 14: from tiles at (14,1),(14,13),(14,17):  \n     7 at c1,4,13,16,17,20\n   - Row 15: from those tiles (row+1):  \n     7 at c2,3,14,15,18,19\n   - Row 16: same as Row 15\n   - Row 17: same as Row 14\n\n   - Rows 18, 19, 20: no valid tiles reach here \u2192 all 0.\n\n   We start from an all-zero grid and put 7s at exactly those coordinates. The original central 7-ring in rows 6\u20139, cols 5\u20138 is **ignored** (it is not regenerated), since color `7` is not a command color in the learned rule.\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\nHere is the completed 20\u00d720 output grid:\n\nRow 1:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 2:\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 3:\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 4:\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 5:\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 6:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 7:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 8:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 9:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n\nRow10:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n\nRow11:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow12:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow13:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n\nRow14:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n\nRow15:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow16:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow17:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n\nRow18:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow19:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow20:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"E\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-high_3_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nBelow is how I inferred the rule and applied it.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Understanding the transformation from the examples\n\n### 1.1. Marker colors and their templates\n\nAcross the examples, only the colors `{2,3,5,8}` in the **input** cause visible structured patterns in the **output**. Other input colors (1,4,6,7, etc.) serve only as *template colors* for these patterns or are just removed.\n\nFor each marker color we consistently get a 4\u00d74 pattern in a *different* output color:\n\n- **Input 2 \u2192 Output color 4**, pattern: a hollow 4\u00d74 square.\n\n  Seen in:\n  - Example 1,2,3,4 outputs.\n  - Explicit prototype: Example 3 input top-left 4\u00d74 block of 4\u2019s.\n\n- **Input 3 \u2192 Output color 1**, pattern: 4\u00d74 \u201cX\u201d (or diamond) of 1\u2019s:\n  ```\n  0 1 1 0\n  1 0 0 1\n  1 0 0 1\n  0 1 1 0\n  ```\n  Seen in:\n  - Example 1,2,4 outputs.\n  - Prototype in Example 2 input around the central 3 at (row6,col6).\n\n- **Input 5 \u2192 Output color 6**, pattern: 4\u00d74 with two 2\u00d72 diagonal blocks of 6\u2019s:\n  ```\n  6 6 0 0\n  6 6 0 0\n  0 0 6 6\n  0 0 6 6\n  ```\n  Seen in:\n  - Example 1 & 4 outputs.\n  - Prototype hinted in Example 1 by 6-cluster + a 5.\n\n- **Input 8 \u2192 Output color 7**, pattern: 4\u00d74 with a 2\u00d72 block in the middle plus all four corners:\n  ```\n  7 0 0 7\n  0 7 7 0\n  0 7 7 0\n  7 0 0 7\n  ```\n  Seen clearly in Example 4: each 8 in the input becomes this 4\u00d74 7-pattern in the output.\n\nAll these 4\u00d74 patterns are anchored so that the **top\u2011left of the 4\u00d74 pattern sits exactly on the cell that had the marker color**.\n\n### 1.2. Which colors are markers vs. ignored\n\nFrom the examples:\n\n- Only inputs of **colors 2, 3, 5, 8** ever spawn new patterns.\n- Input colors **1,4,6,7** (and anything else) are not markers:\n  - Example 3: input 4\u2019s form a 4\u00d74 hollow square prototype, but in the output that block is removed and only 2-markers generate new 4\u00d74 blocks of 4\u2019s.\n  - Example 2: input 1\u2019s are part of the 3-template prototype, but the transformation is governed by 3\u2019s, not by 1\u2019s.\n  - Example 1: input 6\u2019s form the prototype for the 5\u21926 diagonal pattern, but 6\u2019s themselves do not spawn patterns.\n\nSo the algorithm treats only `{2,3,5,8}` as pattern anchors. Other colors are effectively ignored (the output starts from an empty grid and is filled by the patterns).\n\n### 1.3. Boundary and overlap rules\n\nFrom Example 2 and 3:\n\n- **Boundary rule**: if a 4\u00d74 pattern would go out of bounds, that marker is ignored.\n  - Example 2: a 3 at bottom-right would require rows 10\u201313 in a 10\u00d710 grid, so no pattern is drawn for it.\n  - This is the only clear way such a marker \u201cdisappears\u201d.\n\n- **Overlap rule** (key to Example 1 & 3):\n  - Example 3 has 2\u2019s at (0,6), (4,4), (6,0), (6,6). If all spawned 4\u00d74 hollow squares, the one at (4,4) would overlap the one at (6,6), but in the output we see only three squares, missing the one from (4,4).\n  - This is explained by scanning the grid **from bottom-right to top-left** and placing patterns only into empty cells:\n    - process 2\u2019s in order: (6,6) \u2192 (6,0) \u2192 (4,4) \u2192 (0,6).\n    - place pattern at (6,6) and (6,0) (no conflict yet).\n    - when reaching (4,4), its proposed 4\u00d74 area overlaps the existing square at (6,6), so skip it.\n    - finally, (0,6) is free, so place it.\n  - Example 1: the \u201cprototype\u201d 5 at (row6,col6) would generate a diagonal 6-pattern overlapping with the later 2-pattern at (row7,col9). When processed bottom-up/right-to-left, that 5 is considered after the lower 2, thus its pattern overlaps existing non-zeros and is skipped. The other 5\u2019s (later in the scan) are free and do create patterns.\n\nThus the generic procedure for each pair is:\n\n1. Start with an all-zero output grid.\n2. Scan input cells from **bottom row to top row**, and within each row from **right to left**.\n3. If the cell has color C in `{2,3,5,8}`:\n   - Let P(C) be the corresponding 4\u00d74 template.\n   - Check the 4\u00d74 block starting at that cell:\n     - If part of it would lie outside the grid, skip this marker.\n     - Else if any cell in that 4\u00d74 region is already non-zero in the output, skip (avoid overlapping).\n     - Otherwise, copy the template\u2019s non-zero cells into that 4\u00d74 region of the output.\n4. Ignore all other input colors.\n\nThis rule reproduces all training outputs.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying the rule to the test input\n\nThe test input is 20\u00d720 and contains only colors **7** and **8** (besides 0).\n\n### 2.1. Determine which cells are markers\n\nOnly markers are `{2,3,5,8}` \u2192 here **only 8\u2019s** are markers.\n\nThe 7\u2019s are not markers; they serve as a **prototype** (indeed, they form exactly the 8\u21927 template pattern once in the input), but prototypes don\u2019t directly survive\u2014they are only there to let us see the template.\n\nPositions of 8\u2019s (1-based row, col):\n\n- Row 2: (2,1), (2,5), (2,9), (2,13), (2,17)\n- Row 6: (6,1), (6,17)\n- Row 10: (10,1), (10,9), (10,17)\n- Row 14: (14,1), (14,13), (14,17)\n- Row 18: (18,1), (18,5), (18,9), (18,13), (18,17)\n\n### 2.2. Apply boundary rule\n\nFor a 4\u00d74 pattern anchored at (r,c) to fit in a 20\u00d720 grid, we need:\n\n- `r \u2264 17` and `c \u2264 17`.\n\nAll our c\u2019s (1,5,9,13,17) are \u2264 17, so fine horizontally.\n\nBut for rows:\n\n- Anchors at row 18 would need rows 18\u201321 \u2192 out of bounds \u2192 **ignore all 8\u2019s on row 18**.\n\nSo valid anchors are:\n\n- (2,1), (2,5), (2,9), (2,13), (2,17)\n- (6,1), (6,17)\n- (10,1), (10,9), (10,17)\n- (14,1), (14,13), (14,17)\n\n### 2.3. Check overlap\n\nEach 8 spawns a 4\u00d74 block `[r..r+3] \u00d7 [c..c+3]`. Differences between row coordinates are multiples of 4 (2,6,10,14) and column coordinates differ by 4 or more, so these 4\u00d74 blocks only **touch at edges** but do not overlap. Therefore, with the bottom-right \u2192 top-left scan, **no pattern is skipped for overlap**.\n\n### 2.4. Template for 8\n\nFrom Example 4 (and also clearly visible as the 7-block in the test input itself), the pattern for an 8 at (r,c) is:\n\nWithin the 4\u00d74 starting at (r,c):\n\n- Row r:       7 at (r, c), (r, c+3)\n- Row r+1:     7 at (r+1, c+1), (r+1, c+2)\n- Row r+2:     7 at (r+2, c+1), (r+2, c+2)\n- Row r+3:     7 at (r+3, c), (r+3, c+3)\n\nEverything else stays 0.\n\nWe apply that at each of the 13 valid anchors.\n\n### 2.5. Resulting rows\n\nConstructing row by row (1-based rows, 1\u201320):\n\n- Rows 1, 18, 19, 20: no pattern covers them \u2192 all 0.\n\n- **Row 2** (anchors at (2,1),(2,5),(2,9),(2,13),(2,17), top row of template):\n  7 at columns 1,4,5,8,9,12,13,16,17,20.\n\n- **Row 3** (second row of those templates):\n  7 at columns 2,3,6,7,10,11,14,15,18,19.\n\n- **Row 4** (third row, same as row 3):\n  7 at columns 2,3,6,7,10,11,14,15,18,19.\n\n- **Row 5** (fourth row of those templates, like row 2):\n  7 at columns 1,4,5,8,9,12,13,16,17,20.\n\n- **Row 6** (top of templates from (6,1) and (6,17)):\n  7 at columns 1,4,17,20.\n\n- **Row 7** (second row of those templates):\n  7 at columns 2,3,18,19.\n\n- **Row 8** (third row of those templates):\n  7 at columns 2,3,18,19.\n\n- **Row 9** (fourth row of those templates):\n  7 at columns 1,4,17,20.\n\n- **Row 10** (top of templates from (10,1),(10,9),(10,17)):\n  7 at columns 1,4,9,12,17,20.\n\n- **Row 11** (second row of those templates):\n  7 at columns 2,3,10,11,18,19.\n\n- **Row 12** (third row of those templates):\n  7 at columns 2,3,10,11,18,19.\n\n- **Row 13** (fourth row of those templates):\n  7 at columns 1,4,9,12,17,20.\n\n- **Row 14** (top of templates from (14,1),(14,13),(14,17)):\n  7 at columns 1,4,13,16,17,20.\n\n- **Row 15** (second row of those templates):\n  7 at columns 2,3,14,15,18,19.\n\n- **Row 16** (third row of those templates, same as row 15):\n  7 at columns 2,3,14,15,18,19.\n\n- **Row 17** (fourth row of those templates, same shape as row 14):\n  7 at columns 1,4,13,16,17,20.\n\nThe original 7-block in rows 6\u20139, cols 5\u20138 (the prototype) is *not* reproduced unless there is an 8 marker there (there isn\u2019t), so it disappears in the output.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

Instead, certain marker values cause a fixed 4\u00d74 template to be stamped into the output, with all other cells set to zero.\n\nThe templates are:\n\n- for an input\u202f2: a 4\u00d74 hollow square of colour\u202f4;\n- for an input\u202f3: a 4\u00d74 \u201cborder without corners\u201d of colour\u202f1;\n- for an input\u202f5: a 4\u00d74 with the two diagonal 2\u00d72 quadrants filled, colour\u202f6;\n- for an input\u202f8: a 4\u00d74 with the four corner cells and the central 2\u00d72 filled, colour\u202f7.\n\nMarkers are treated as the top\u2011left corner of the 4\u00d74 block; if the 4\u00d74 would run off the grid it is skipped. Other input values are ignored.\n\nIn the test case the only recognised markers are the 8s.

For each active marker at position (r,c), if the 4\u00d74 tile starting there would run off the grid it is skipped. A marker is also skipped if another active marker lies within its 4\u00d74 area, so only the \u201clowest/rightmost\u201d of a potentially overlapping pair is kept. Otherwise, a 4\u00d74 motif of a specific colour is drawn with its top\u2011left at (r,c):\n\n- 2 \u2192 colour\u202f4, hollow square border,\n- 3 \u2192 colour\u202f1, hollow square with missing corners,\n- 5 \u2192 colour\u202f6, two 2\u00d72 blocks on the main diagonal,\n- 8 \u2192 colour\u202f7, four corners and centre 2\u00d72 block.\n\nIn the test grid the only active markers are the 8s.

The rest of the grid remains 0.\n\nFinal output grid:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"I\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-high_5_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"J\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-high_7_step_5_image\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Understanding the rule from the examples**\n\n1. **All outputs are made of 4\u00d74 \u201ctiles\u201d.**  \n   In every example, non\u2011zero cells in the output always form one of a few fixed 4\u00d74 patterns.\n\n2. **There are four tile types (patterns) and each has a fixed color:**\n\n   - **Tile A (color 4):** a 4\u00d74 hollow square of 4s (border of 4s, interior 0).  \n   - **Tile B (color 6):** two filled 2\u00d72 blocks of 6s on the main diagonal:\n     ```\n     6 6 0 0\n     6 6 0 0\n     0 0 6 6\n     0 0 6 6\n     ```\n   - **Tile C (color 7):**\n     ```\n     7 0 0 7\n     0 7 7 0\n     0 7 7 0\n     7 0 0 7\n     ```\n   - **Tile D (color 1):** a ring of 1s with empty corners:\n     ```\n     0 1 1 0\n     1 0 0 1\n     1 0 0 1\n     0 1 1 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Markers vs. templates.**\n\n   - Small **single pixels** of certain colors act as **markers** telling where to place tiles.\n   - Larger connected components of the tile\u2011colors themselves (4,1,6,7) are just **templates/prototypes** and are not copied as such; they are effectively removed unless a tile is drawn over them.\n\n4. **Color pairing (marker \u2192 tile type / color).**\n\n   From all four training examples we can read off consistent pairings:\n\n   - Marker **2 \u2192 Tile A (color 4)**\n   - Marker **3 \u2192 Tile D (color 1)**\n   - Marker **5 \u2192 Tile B (color 6)**\n   - Marker **8 \u2192 Tile C (color 7)**\n\n   These mappings are global across the task.\n\n5. **Placement rule.**\n\n   - For every marker pixel of one of these colors, place the corresponding 4\u00d74 tile whose **top\u2011left cell is at the marker\u2019s coordinates**, **provided** the entire 4\u00d74 block fits inside the grid (row \u2264 H\u22123 and col \u2264 W\u22123).  \n   - Cells that are not covered by any tile become 0, except that if two tiles ever overlapped the later one would overwrite, but in the given grids the tiles never overlap.\n\n6. **Handling prototype shapes.**\n\n   In examples 1 and 3, large shapes made from colors 6 and 4 appear in the inputs but are gone (or overwritten) in the outputs where no tile is drawn. So any pre\u2011existing multi\u2011cell shapes of the tile colors are treated as prototypes only and are **erased** unless overwritten by a tile.\n\n---\n\n**Applying the rule to the test input**\n\n- The test grid has colors **8** and **7**.\n- According to the mapping, **8 is a marker** for **Tile C (color 7)**.\n- The 7s in the centre form exactly the Tile\u2011C 4\u00d74 pattern; they are a **prototype**, not markers, so they are erased unless a tile overlaps them. No 8 marker lies at their top\u2011left, so no tile overlaps them: the prototype disappears.\n\n1. **Find all 8 markers** and keep only those that can host a full 4\u00d74 tile:\n\n   Grid is 20\u00d720, so valid anchors have row \u2264 17 and col \u2264 17.\n\n   8s at:\n   - Row 2: (2,1), (2,5), (2,9), (2,13), (2,17)\n   - Row 6: (6,1), (6,17)\n   - Row 10: (10,1), (10,9), (10,17)\n   - Row 14: (14,1), (14,13), (14,17)\n   - Row 18: (18,1), (18,5), (18,9), (18,13), (18,17)\n\n   Anchors on row 18 are invalid (18+3 > 20), so they are ignored; their cells become 0.\n\n   Valid anchors (13 of them):\n   (2,1), (2,5), (2,9), (2,13), (2,17),\n   (6,1), (6,17),\n   (10,1), (10,9), (10,17),\n   (14,1), (14,13), (14,17).\n\n2. **Place Tile C (pattern of 7s) at each valid anchor.**\n\n   For each anchor (r,c), fill rows r..r+3, cols c..c+3 with:\n   ```\n   7 0 0 7\n   0 7 7 0\n   0 7 7 0\n   7 0 0 7\n   ```\n\n3. **Erase the prototype 7s** in the original central 4\u00d74 region (rows 6\u20139, cols 5\u20138) that are not covered by tiles; set them to 0.\n\nAfter doing this, the resulting grid is:\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n      7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"K\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_8_step_5_image\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nThe four training pairs can be explained by a simple painting rule. Only input colours 2,\u202f3,\u202f5 and\u202f8 are \u201cactive\u201d. For each active pixel you try to stamp a 4\u00d74 motif into a fresh zero grid, anchored at the same row and column. The motif depends only on the input colour:\n- 2 \u2192 colour\u202f4, full 4\u00d74 hollow square (border all round),\n- 3 \u2192 colour\u202f1, hollow square with the four corners missing,\n- 5 \u2192 colour\u202f6, two 2\u00d72 blocks on the main diagonal of the 4\u00d74,\n- 8 \u2192 colour\u202f7, the four corners and the central 2\u00d72 of the 4\u00d74 filled.\nPixels of other colours are ignored. You process input pixels from bottom\u2011right to top\u2011left, stamping a motif only if the entire 4\u00d74 block lies inside the grid and none of its cells has already been painted; otherwise you skip it. The output grid is initially all zeros and is the same size as the input.\n\nIn the test grid only colour\u202f8 pixels are active, so we place the \u201ccorners plus centre\u201d pattern of colour\u202f7 at each 8 that fits; the bottom\u2011row 8\u2019s are skipped because the 4\u00d74 would run off the grid.

Let's break this down systematically.\n\n1.  **Understanding the Task:** I'm given a grid of numbers (0-9, representing colors), some examples, and a test grid. The goal is to figure out the transformation rule applied to the test input based on what I see in the examples.\n\n2.  **Initial Observations:** I have four examples. There are hints: \"Objects Description\" mentions shapes like frames, diamonds, and diagonals, and also \"markers\" which are single cells. The \"Transformation Description\" gives away the mapping. It says something like \"Marker 2 becomes a 4x4 frame of color 4,\" etc. So, single markers are turned into bigger patterns. The hint also specifies \"top-left corner alignment\" of patterns, meaning the marker's cell is the top left of the new shape. Also, \"Multi-cell template patterns in the input are cleared\" and something about \"overlapping patterns\".\n\n    I immediately think, \"Okay, this is typical ARC stuff,\" but I have to verify these claims against the examples. The examples are the key!\n\n3.  **Example Verification:** I will carefully look at Example 1: I see markers like '2', '3', and '5'. The output for each example must correspond to what the description says. For example, for marker '2', I'm expecting a 4x4 color-4 box. Yup, that's what I see in the example. The marker '3' maps to a diamond of color 1 and marker '5' to the diagonal blocks.\n\n    However, I need to check the alignment. Let's see if the shape for each marker always begins at its position:\n\n    I looked at the specific cell, and it seems this is true. The 4x4 frame, Diamond, Diagonal blocks all start at the marker position.\n\n    But one question is, how about the templates? They are present in the grid also, and the description says that the template must be erased.\n\n    I think the input grid also contains \"template shapes,\" which are like pre-drawn shapes that need to be removed. So I think the rule is that marker digits are seeds which are mapped to 4x4 shapes, but these are cleared first.\n\n4.  **Collision and Overlap Rules:** The description talks about \"overlapping patterns\". After analyzing Example 3, I think I understood the logic. The rule is that patterns at the \"bottom\" (higher row index) take priority, and if rows are the same, the rightmost wins. The \"lower\" pattern will be entirely removed. This means the other pattern has its place.\n\n    So, essentially: If patterns overlap, the one with the *larger* row or column (if rows are equal) takes precedence. The lower pattern is simply erased. This \"cancellation\" logic is a central part of how to approach the task.\n\n5.  **Defining the Shapes:** I will make sure the descriptions match what I am seeing.\n    *   **Marker '2':** A 4x4 frame of color 4.\n    *   **Marker '3':** A 4x4 diamond of color 1.\n    *   **Marker '5':** Two 2x2 diagonal blocks of color 6.\n    *   **Marker '8':** 4x4 shape. (Color 7). The prompt described it as an \"anti-diagonal\", but it's an X.\n\n6.  **Analyzing the Test Input:** It's time to test the rules against the provided test input. I start scanning for the markers (2, 3, 5, 8). I find a row of markers that appear to be '8'. I also note a pattern of \"7\" in the test input. It looks like the template that must be removed.\n\n    I need to pay attention to grid boundaries. Anything that overflows must be discarded. I also should verify and apply any found offset.\n\n7.  **Marker Validation and Boundary Rule:** I carefully analyze the positions of all found markers, making sure to apply the collision logic from the previous step. Any marker that overlaps with another will be considered invalid. Then, \"Patterns extending beyond grid boundaries are not placed\" must be considered. Anything at the right boundary must be removed because I have determined, the bottom 3 rows are out of bounds.\n\n    I then identify the coordinates of the valid markers (8s): (1,0), (1,4), (1,8), (1,12), (1,16) - (5,0), (5,16) - (9,0), (9,8), (9,16\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid containing \"marker\" pixels and \"template\" patterns into a final grid where markers are replaced by specific 4x4 shapes, and everything else is cleared.\n\n**1. identifying the Rules and Patterns:**\nBased on the provided examples and descriptions, we can deduce the following rules:\n\n*   **Markers & Shapes:**\n    *   **Marker `2`:** Produces a **4x4 Hollow Frame** of color **4**.\n        Pattern:\n        ```\n        4 4 4 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 4 4 4\n        ```\n    *   **Marker `3`:** Produces a **4x4 Hollow Diamond** of color **1**.\n        Pattern:\n        ```\n        0 1 1 0\n        1 0 0 1\n        1 0 0 1\n        0 1 1 0\n        ```\n    *   **Marker `5`:** Produces **4x4 Diagonal Blocks** of color **6**.\n        Pattern:\n        ```\n        6 6 0 0\n        6 6 0 0\n        0 0 6 6\n        0 0 6 6\n        ```\n    *   **Marker `8`:** Produces a **4x4 X-Shape (Anti-Diagonal + Diagonal)** of color **7**.\n        Pattern (inferred from Example 4):\n        ```\n        7 0 0 7\n        0 7 7 0\n        0 7 7 0\n        7 0 0 7\n        ```\n\n*   **Placement Logic:**\n    *   The marker's position in the input grid becomes the **top-left corner** (0,0) of the 4x4 pattern in the output grid.\n    *   **Boundaries:** Patterns that extend beyond the grid boundaries (e.g., if row + 3 >= grid height) are **not placed**.\n    *   **Priority/Overlaps:** If patterns overlap, the one with the higher row index (bottom-most) takes priority. If row indices are equal, the one with the higher column index (right-most) takes priority. Lower priority patterns are completely removed if they clash with a higher priority one.\n    *   **Cleanup:** Any pre-existing patterns or shapes in the input (templates) are cleared; only shapes generated by valid markers remain.\n\n**2. Applying to Test Input:**\nThe test input is a 20x20 grid. We scan for markers `2`, `3`, `5`, and `8`.\n\n*   **Found Markers (All are `8`):**\n    *   **Row 1:** (1,0), (1,4), (1,8), (1,12), (1,16).\n    *   **Row 5:** (5,0), (5,16). (Note: The shape at (5,4) is a template made of 7s, not a marker).\n    *   **Row 9:** (9,0), (9,8), (9,16).\n    *   **Row 13:** (13,0), (13,12), (13,16).\n    *   **Row 17:** (17,0), (17,4), (17,8), (17,12), (17,16).\n\n*   **Validity Check:**\n    *   The grid has rows 0-19.\n    *   Patterns starting at Row 17 would occupy rows 17, 18, 19, 20.

Each of these values is replaced by a fixed 4\u00d74 pattern anchored with its top\u2011left corner at the marker:\n\n- 2 \u2192 a hollow 4\u00d74 rectangle of color\u202f4.\n- 3 \u2192 a \u201cdiamond\u201d shape of color\u202f1:  \n  [[0,1,1,0],[1,0,0,1],[1,0,0,1],[0,1,1,0]].\n- 5 \u2192 two 2\u00d72 blocks on the main diagonal of color\u202f6:  \n  [[6,6,0,0],[6,6,0,0],[0,0,6,6],[0,0,6,6]].\n- 8 \u2192 an \u201cX\u201d shape of color\u202f7 (both diagonals):  \n  [[7,0,0,7],[0,7,7,0],[0,7,7,0],[7,0,0,7]].\n\nAll other nonzero input cells are ignored. A marker is used only if its entire 4\u00d74 pattern fits within the grid; otherwise it is skipped (as seen with out\u2011of\u2011bounds markers). If markers are isolated (the only one in their row and column), they are also ignored.

It may have multiple ANSWER blocks, all with the same OUTPUT_GRID.\n  2. Among its ANSWERs, choose a \"representative explanation\":\n     - Prefer the explanation that is:\n       - most complete,\n       - least self-contradictory,\n       - easiest to understand.\n  3.

                "response": "**Initial Assessment**\n\nAlright, I've got to audit these three candidates for this ARC task. The input is sparse grids with markers, and the output needs to be a patterned grid with those markers replaced by 4x4 tiles. The patterns are specific to the marker number (2, 3, 5, 8). I need to figure out what each candidate's rules are and see how well they handle the examples and the test case.\n\n**Candidate 0: The \"Clean Slate\" Approach**\n\nCandidate 0 seems to be going for a \"clean slate\" approach \u2013 markers generate patterns, and everything else is cleared unless it's a marker. The logic looks solid: markers (2,3,5,8) produce specific 4x4 patterns, boundary clipping applies. The key detail is that any pre-existing patterns are ignored unless they overlap a marker. I've got to double-check their claims about edge behavior \u2013 specifically, how it's handled when the patterns go out of bounds.\n\n**Candidate 1: The \"Maybe It's a Marker?\"**\n\nCandidate 1 is similar to 0 in that markers generate patterns. However, it seems to be confused about the pre-existing 7 pattern. 7 is a pattern, not a marker. They seem to want to preserve that 7 pattern, but example 3 shows this is incorrect, as input patterns are not preserved.\n\n**Candidate 2: The \"All or Nothing\" Rule**\n\nCandidate 2 is taking a \"skip if it doesn't fit\" approach. The rule seems to be: \"If a command's 4x4 tile would go out of bounds, skip it.\" I need to see if this is all-or-nothing, or if clipping is applied to those that partially extend out of the grid. If it's the \"all or nothing\", what are the consequences of their implementation for the test input?\n\n**Let's Dive In**\n\nI need to analyze all the examples to identify the pattern and boundary handling logic. It seems that the key is \"what happens at the edges,\" as many examples have edges or overlaps.\n\n**Test Input**\n\nThe test input is a 20x20 grid, with markers on rows 1, 5, 9, 13, and 17. The primary conflict is whether the patterns starting at row 17 should be clipped or skipped. There is a \"7\" in the test input, which needs to be removed.\n\n**Candidate 0 Analysis**\n\nThe most consistent example is 3, which removes an input square. Given the rule, it draws rows 17-19 of the pattern, it removed the pre-existing pattern, so the logic of \"clean slate\" works. Candidate 0 clips the pattern on the boundaries. This seems consistent with the visual pattern, where the rule is simply \"Fill\". In Example 2 (Marker 3 at edge) both solutions clip and skip result in a correct output of 0, but usually, visual patterns imply clipping, so it is safer to adopt this behavior.\n\n**Candidate 1 Analysis**\n\nCandidate 1 seems to hallucinate a marker 7 and want to preserve the existing 7 pattern at the edge. However, Example 3 explicitly demonstrates an input pattern is removed, contradicting the proposed rule and rendering this candidate incorrect. Therefore, it is lower scored.\n\n**Candidate 2 Analysis**\n\nCandidate 2 has the very hard-edged rule. \"4x4 is only valid if it fits entirely\". Thus, the markers on Row 17 should be skipped/omitted because the bottom row goes out of bounds. This is logical and consistent but creates an incomplete visual pattern. This is a very interesting constraint. I would have assumed clipping, but it might be correct. Both the input from Ex 2 and 3 can be produced with \"skip\" with specific logic.\n\n**Comparing Candidate 0 and 2**\n\nCandidate 0 \"Clips\", Candidate 2 \"Skips\". \"Skips\" might be more logically consistent with Example 3 suppression. However, the visual completeness of the pattern supports clipping.\n\n**Reconsidering Candidate 2 Logic**\n\nIn Example 3, if (4,4) is skipped due to existing non-zero, this implies \"conditional placement\".\n\nIt must skip if pixels are out of bounds. Thus, row 17 of the test grid is empty. However, this is probably not the typical ARC behavior.\n\nI want to test for \"Visual completion\" and \"Valid rules for the examples\".\n\n**Re-evaluating**\n\nEx 3: The marker at (4,4) is missing in the output. Candidate 0 and 2 handle this in opposite ways:\nCand 0: Output 6,6, so (4,4) is gone.\nCand 2\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 2,\n      \"score\": 9.0,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\",\n          \"4\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"The rule correctly identifies markers, noise removal, and implements a strict validity check (skip if overlap/out-of-bounds) which explains Example 3's suppression behavior perfectly.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Markers trigger 4x4 patterns.
