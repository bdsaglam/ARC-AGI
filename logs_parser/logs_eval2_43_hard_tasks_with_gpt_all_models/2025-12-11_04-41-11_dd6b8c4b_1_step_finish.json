The goal is to come up with a rule based on what's visible in each grid.\n\n1.  **I started by analyzing Example 1.** I noticed a colored background with a rectangular frame, and inside, there was a small square with a colored center. There were scattered colored pixels, but I'll call them '9s'. I then compared the input and output grids. Initially, it seemed like the '9s' outside were somehow being collected and inserted into that small square. The colored square would have a mix of 3s and 2s, but the output changed those to nines.\n2.  **So I looked more closely at the position of the nines** and whether they were somehow related to the box's position. I counted how many there were in both. I also looked at Example 2.\n3.  **In Example 2, some nine's disappeared completely, and the center's color also changes.** This tells me the number of nines could have something to do with the outcome.\n4.  **I tried a gravity model** where nines are falling towards the box. It kind of works but doesn't quite explain every case.\n5.  **I tried something more spatial.** Could the grid be \"wrapped\" or \"connected\"? Maybe the frame acted as a barrier.\n6.  **I started playing around with coordinates, trying to map where the input nines were located in the new output.** I considered rotation and mirroring as operations. This didn't quite pan out.\n7.  **Then I considered the colored pixels and the structure, and I got to this idea of \"walls\", and what's connected to those walls.** I also realized the frame's color was significant.\n8.  **I also saw that the output 3x3 had some changes, but other changes also happened to the outer tiles.** So maybe outer tiles could map to tiles within the 3x3 somehow.\n9.  **Then came the \"Extraction and Mapping\" idea:** The idea was that nines are relative coordinates, which are extracted relative to some central reference and re-mapped inside the box.\n10. **I began investigating the concept of \"gravity\",** where the nine tiles fall to the bottom row, and fill the small box if they are on a column or row intersecting with the small box.\n11. **But then I tried the idea of \"Connected Components.\"** Maybe nines that are connected to a colored structure were active, meaning they get absorbed, and others are just along for the ride.\n12. **Next, the count and fill idea emerged.** I thought about how many nines were present and whether they were removed. The basic rule seems to be: \"Count the reachable nines and fill the target.\" I'll determine how to determine \"reachable\" in a moment.\n13. **So here's the pathfinding rule I settled on.** The rule is: starting from the box's cells, check if you can travel through 7-colored pixels to the \"nine\" to determine if it is \"reachable\" or \"active\".\n14. **So, I tried applying this new rule to the samples**. And it fit! The pathfinding, where the \"path\" is 7 colored pixels, seemed to correctly identify nines that should be absorbed.\n15. **After this, I went through the test input and followed the steps:** I created this rule: if the nines are \"reachable\" from the center, then the boxes' pixels' position is determined, and they can be filled with nines.\n16. **Then I created my solution.**\n\nThis rule accounts for all the examples I've seen, and I'm ready to apply this to the test input.\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the transformation rule based on three solved examples and apply it to a test input.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n\n1.  **Structure:** All grids are 11x11. There is a background of Orange (7) and a structure of Magenta (6) pixels acting as walls. In the center (Rows 4-6, Columns 4-6), there is a 3x3 \"Green Box\" (initially mostly Green (3) with a Red (2) center). There are scattered Maroon (9) pixels.\n2.  **Transformation Process:**\n    *   **Absorption of Maroon (9) Pixels:** Certain Maroon (9) pixels in the grid disappear (turn into background 7).\n    *   **Filling the Green Box:** The Green Box pixels change from Green (3) or Red (2) to Maroon (9). The number of pixels that change in the box seems directly related to the number of Maroon pixels that disappeared from the grid.\n3.  **Determining Which 9s Disappear:**\n    *   By examining the Magenta (6) structures, we can see they form enclosures or barriers.\n    *   In **Example 1**, the 9s at (8,7) and (8,8) disappear. These are reachable from the Green Box through the background (7) path. Other 9s, like those above the top wall (Row 3) or blocked by side walls, remain.\n    *   In **Example 2**, a large number of 9s disappear. The container is open at the bottom, and Row 10 acts as a passage connecting different areas. Most 9s are reachable and thus disappear.\n    *   In **Example 3**, there are no Magenta walls. All 9s disappear.\n    *   **Rule:** A Maroon (9) pixel is \"absorbed\" if it is connected to the central Green Box via a path of background (7) pixels (orthogonal movement, not blocked by Magenta 6s).\n4.  **Determining the Box Fill Pattern:**\n    *   Let $N$ be the count of absorbed 9s.\n    *   The Green Box (3x3) is filled with $N$ Maroon (9) pixels, replacing the original values.\n    *   The filling order is reading order: Row by Row, Left to Right.\n        *   Indices:\n            (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)\n            (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n            (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n    *   **Example 1:** $N=2$. Positions (0,0) and (0,1) become 9. Center (1,1) remains 2.\n    *   **Example 3:** $N=4$. Positions (0,0) to (1,0) become 9. Center (1,1) remains 2.\n    *   **Example 2:** $N \\ge 5$. The center (1,1) becomes 9. In this case, the box was completely filled ($N \\ge 9$).\n    *   **Conclusion:** We fill the first $N$ pixels of the 3x3 box. If $N \\ge 5$, the center (red 2) gets overwritten.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Structure:**\n    *   There is a large container defined by Magenta (6) walls: Row 1 (Top), Column 1 (Left), Column 9 (Right), and Row 9 (Bottom).\n    *   The Green Box is at the center (Rows 4-6, Columns 4-6).\n    *   There are gaps in the inner horizontal walls (Row 3 and Row 7) at Column 5, allowing access between the Box and the rest of the container.\n    *   There are gaps in the inner vertical walls (Column 3 and Column 7) at Row 5, also allowing access.\n2.  **Count Reachable 9s:**\n    *   We scan the grid for Maroon (9) pixels inside the container (Rows 2-8, Columns 2-8).\n    *   (2,2): Inside. Reachable.\n    *   (2,8): Inside. Reachable.\n    *   (8,2): Inside. Reachable.\n    *   (8,5): Inside. Reachable.\n    *   (8,8): Inside. Reachable.\n    *   **Total Count ($N$) = 5.**\n    *   Note: The 9s at (0,2), (0,8), (2,0), (3,10), (5,10), (7,10) are blocked by walls (Row 1, Col 1, Col 9). They remain unchanged.\n3.  **Update Grid:**\n    *   **Remove Absorbed 9s:** Change (2,2), (2,8), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8) to 7.\n    *   **Fill Green Box:** $N=5$. We fill the first 5 pixels of the box with 9s.\n        *   (4,4) -> 9\n        *   (4,5) -> 9\n        *   (4,6) -> 9\n        *   (5,4) -> 9\n        *   (5,5) -> 9 (Center overwrites 2)\n        *   Remaining pixels (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) retain their original values (3, 3, 3, 3). Note: (5,6) was 3.\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\n\n*   Row 2 becomes: `9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7` (Indices 2 and 8 changed to 7).\n*   Row 8 becomes: `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7` (Indices 2, 5, 8 changed to 7).\n*   Green Box (Rows 4-6, Cols 4-6):\n    *   Row 4: `9,9,9`\n    *   Row 5: `9,9,3`\n    *   Row 6: `3,3,3`\n\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,3,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n<REASONING_MODEL_B model_id=\"gemini-3-high_2_step_1\">\n**Problem Breakdown and Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process. The user wants me to solve an ARC task where I need to take three example input-output pairs, analyze them, and apply the pattern I discover to a new test input. The problem looks like it's about transforming a grid, probably based on moving pixels with specific values.\n\nI'm starting by carefully examining the examples. I'm looking for consistent structures like patterns, symmetries, and any elements that remain fixed or changed predictably.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\nI noticed that the grid has a background color (7, orange), and a shape made of a specific color, magenta. Inside, there seems to be a central core of 3x3 cells. Sometimes there are random pixels (maroon) scattered around.\n\n*   **Initial Observation**: There's a rectangular frame made of color 6 (magenta) containing a 3x3 square of color 3 (green) with a central 2 (red). There is also a scattered background of color 9 (maroon) pixels.\n*   **Detailed Observation**: The 9s inside the frame changed to a mixture of 9s and 3s. The outer 9s remained. Rows 5-7 have some pattern inside the 6-frame. The output is where 9s have changed to some number inside the 6-frame.\n*   **Hypothesis**: The change is inside the frame. The input has 9s and they somehow \"move\" to the center of the 3x3 green box.\n\nI examined the input and output pixels. I also observed 9s (maroon) seem to move into the frame. Then I noted how there seems to be a frame around the central 3x3 box. Also, the 9 pixels seem to go into the green square.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n\nI noticed that I could find the position of the 9s relative to the center 3x3 box. I saw the same core, but the 9s had a bigger pattern. In Example 2, some of the 9s were inside the outer frame, some were outside. In Example 2 output, the entire 3x3 box turned to 9s. I noticed that the pixels outside of a certain range remain untouched in both the Example 1 and Example 2 output.\n\n*   **Observations**: In Example 2, all 9s within the \"6\" frame are \"absorbed\" into the central 3x3 area. The entire 3x3 block (including the center \"2\") transforms into 9s in the output. The pixels *outside* the 6-frame remain unchanged.\n*   **Deeper analysis**: The \"9\" pixels that move are somehow linked to the frame. I noticed that 9s outside the 6 frame were untouched, while 9s inside were absorbed to the central 3x3 area. I then noticed that some pixels changed into 9s. Then I checked how the pixels in the box in Example 2 were updated.\n*   **Hypothesis Update**: The 6 frame is the key to define some boundary. I theorized that pixels could only be altered if inside the central 3x3 box or a certain range or area to the box.\n\nI'm thinking now about a possible \"gravity\" effect: The 9s \"fall\" towards the central target (the 3x3 area) if the area around is \"empty\". Now, maybe they have to be enclosed or next to the box.\n\n**Example 3 Analysis:**\n\nThis example had no external frame. The 9s simply moved into the center. There was a direct relationship between *all* 9s and the central box. I also looked at the color values and how pixels were arranged. The frame 6 color was missing.\n\n*   **Observation**: Example 3 has no outer \"frame\", and *all* the 9s are absorbed into the central area. The central 3x3 box now contained all \"9\" pixels, even the center \"2\", completely erasing any trace of them outside of that box. The 9s were somehow getting absorbed in the 3x3 core.\n*   **Hypothesis**: Maybe the frame 6 is irrelevant?\n*   **New Hypothesis**: I have a theory that all the 9s will move and become part of the central 3x3. I will test this by looking at the input to the test case, and then applying the process.\n\n**Generalizing the Rule**\n\nI noticed now a filling order pattern in the box. Now, the main rule is:\n\n1.  Identify the 3x3 central target (with 3s and a 2 in the center).\n2.  Find *all* 9s\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on a pattern inferred from three examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n1.  **Identify the Target Container:**\n    In all examples, there is a central 3x3 block composed of green (3) pixels with a single red (2) pixel in the center.\n    - Example 1: Rows 4-6, Cols 4-6.\n    - Example 2: Rows 4-6, Cols 4-6.\n    - Example 3: Rows 4-6, Cols 4-6.\n    This 3x3 block acts as a \"container\" or \"collector\" for maroon (9) pixels.\n\n2.  **Identify Movable Objects (9s):**\n    The grid contains scattered maroon (9) pixels.\n    - In Example 1, the 9s *inside* the magenta (6) frame move to the target. The 9s *outside* the frame stay.\n    - In Example 2, the 9s that can reach the target (the frame is open at the bottom) move. 9 9s moved, completely filling the 3x3 container. The distant/isolated 9s stayed.\n    - In Example 3, there are no walls; all 9s move.\n\n    **Rule:** A maroon (9) pixel moves to the target container if and only if it is **accessible** to the target. Accessibility is defined by a path of non-wall pixels (where walls are magenta 6s) connecting the 9 to the 3x3 block.\n\n3.  **Transformation Process:**\n    - Count the number of accessible 9s, let's say $N$.\n    - The capacity of the 3x3 target container is 9 pixels.\n    - The first $N$ spots in the target container are filled with 9s. The filling order is standard reading order: Row 4 (Left to Right), then Row 5 (Left to Right), then Row 6 (Left to Right).\n    - If $N < 9$, the remaining spots in the target retain their original color (3 or 2).\n    - If $N \\ge 9$, the entire target becomes 9s (excess 9s disappear? In the examples, $N$ matches the moved count or fills the container, so we assume we just fill up to the limit).\n    - The accessible 9s in the original grid are replaced by the background color (7).\n    - Inaccessible 9s remain unchanged.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Locate Target:**\n    The 3x3 block of 3s and 2 is at Rows 4-6, Cols 4-6.\n\n2.  **Map Accessibility:**\n    - **Walls (6):** There is a solid wall at Row 1 (`6,6...`). There are vertical walls at Col 1 and Col 9 enclosing the center. There is a bottom wall at Row 9 (partial).\n    - **Accessible Zone:** The region bounded by Row 1, Col 1, Col 9, and Row 9 contains the target. The target itself is surrounded by partial 6s but has openings (e.g., at (3,5), (5,3), (5,7), (7,5)).\n    - **Scanning for 9s:**\n        - **Row 0:** `(0,2), (0,8)` are 9s. They are above the solid wall at Row 1. **Inaccessible**.\n        - **Row 2:** `(2,0)` is 9 (blocked by col 1 wall). `(2,2)` and `(2,8)` are 9s inside the main enclosure. **Accessible**.\n        - **Row 3:** `(3,10)` is 9 (outside col 9 wall). **Inaccessible**.\n        - **Row 5:** `(5,10)` is 9 (outside col 9 wall). **Inaccessible**.\n        - **Row 8:** `(8,2), (8,5), (8,8)` are 9s inside the enclosure. `(8,8)` connects via `(8,7)-(8,6)-(8,5)`. **Accessible**.\n    - **Accessible 9s Count:** 5 pixels at `(2,2), (2,8), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8)`.\n\n3.  **Construct Output:**\n    - **Move 9s:** Change the 5 accessible 9s at `(2,2), (2,8), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8)` to background `7`.\n    - **Fill Target:** Fill the first 5 spots of the 3x3 target with `9`.\n        - Spot 1 `(4,4)`: 3 -> 9\n        - Spot 2 `(4,5)`: 3 -> 9\n        - Spot 3 `(4,6)`: 3 -> 9\n        - Spot 4 `(5,4)`: 3 -> 9\n        - Spot 5 `(5,5)`: 2 -> 9\n    - **Remain:** The remaining 4 spots `(5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)` stay as `3`.\n    - **Inaccessible:** All other 9s `(0,2), (0,8), (2,0), (3,10), (5,10), ...` remain `9`.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,3,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n</REASONING_MODEL_B>\n<REASONING_MODEL_C model_id=\"gemini-3-high_4_step_3\">\n**ARC Task: Color Grid Transformation**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to figure out a rule for these color grid problems. My initial plan is to look at the examples and try to understand how the input grid is changed into the output grid. The grids use numbers 0-9 to represent colors.\n\n**First Look at Example 1:**\nThe grid is mostly orange (7) with a magenta (6) structure and a green (3) 3x3 square with a red (2) center. This green square has some scattered maroon (9) pixels around it. The output grid has changes inside that 3x3 square. It looks like the scattered 9s might be moving into the 3x3 square, so I\u2019ll need to check carefully for this.\n\n**Analyzing the Difference:**\nI'm now comparing the input and output pixel by pixel. In the output grid, it looks like some of those maroon (9) pixels have \"moved\" into that 3x3 green square. Hmm, are they *all* moving? Let's check coordinates of the changes more closely. I see that certain 9s are indeed disappearing from their original spots, and 9s are appearing in that 3x3 area. So the 9s seem to be \"filling\" the square.\n\n**Example 2: A Pattern Emerges:**\nLet\u2019s see if this pattern holds in another example. In Example 2, the 3x3 square is again in the same place. I notice that the 3x3 square is *completely* filled with 9s in the output. This solidifies my thought about the 9s moving into the 3x3 region.\n\n**Looking for a Rule:**\nIt looks like this might be a \"move\" or \"fill\" task. The goal seems to be to fill that central 3x3 area with the maroon (9) color, and the original color 2 gets replaced. I need to figure out what criteria decides *which* 9s move. I\u2019m thinking there might be a \"distance\" or \"accessibility\" factor involved. I noticed something: the 9s that moved were inside of an enclosure formed by color 6.\n\n**\"Rooms\" and \"Accessibility\":**\nI'm beginning to think the rule is about a kind of \"connectivity\" or \"reachability.\" Pixels of color 6 (magenta) seem to be acting like walls. Only the 9s that are \"accessible\" or \"connected\" to that target 3x3 area, *without* crossing color 6, are allowed to move. I'll test this hypothesis to see if this is true in both the previous and new examples.\n\n**Testing the Accessibility Rule:**\nI can see in Example 1 that some 9s were *inside* a room made of 6s, and those moved. Others were outside and didn\u2019t move. Hmm, I\u2019m getting closer!\n\n**The \"Move if Connected\" Rule:**\nIt seems that the 9s are moving if they are \"connected\" to the 3x3 green square. Connected means there is a non-color-6 (non-wall) path to reach this area. I believe the rule is now that any pixel of color 9 that can be \"reached\" or \"connected to\" the 3x3 target grid, without hitting walls, must move into the target grid, filling the 3x3 grid using the order cells are in the grid. If the 3x3 box is full, any further 9s remain in place.\n\n**The Strategy for a New Task:**\n*   Identify the target: the 3x3 area with the color 3s and 2 in the center.\n*   Find the \"connected\" 9s: These must be reachable without passing through the \"walls\" (color 6).\n*   Move the 9s.\n*   The original position of the \"9\" pixel changes to 7.\n*   If more 9s are connected than cells in the box, fill the box up with cells in reading order. Remaining connected cells don't move.\n\n**Applying to the Test Input:**\nNow, I'll use the rule to analyze the test input. First, I have to figure out the location of the 3x3 target and walls of color 6s. Then I can identify and move the connected 9s. I see that the target 3x3 grid is in the same location as before.  I'm looking for the connected components of the 9s. It looks like the target is at rows 4-6, cols 4-6. I will identify the walls. The ones at 1-7 in row 1,1. I see the 9s at (2,\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the transformation rule based on the provided examples and apply it to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal Structure:** In all examples, there is a distinct 3x3 square composed mainly of green pixels (3) with a red center (2). This structure, which we can call the \"Nest\" or \"Target Box,\" is located at rows 4-6 and columns 4-6 (0-indexed).\n    *   Example 1: The nest is partially filled with maroon pixels (9) in the output.\n    *   Example 2: The nest is completely filled with maroon pixels (9) in the output.\n    *   Example 3: The nest is partially filled with maroon pixels (9) in the output.\n\n2.  **Identify the Moving Parts:** The pixels that change are maroon (9) pixels scattered throughout the grid. In the output, some of these 9s disappear from their original positions and appear inside the Nest. The original positions of these moving 9s become background color (7).\n\n3.  **Determine the Rule for Movement:**\n    *   **Connectivity:** The grid contains walls made of magenta pixels (6). We treat the grid as a maze where 6s are obstacles.\n    *   In Example 1, the 9s in the \"top room\" (rows 1-3) do not move. This room is completely enclosed by walls of 6s. The 9s in the \"bottom room\" (rows 7-9) *do* move. There is a gap in the wall at (7,5) that connects the bottom room to the area containing the Nest.\n    *   In Example 3, there are no walls (6s). All scattered 9s move into the Nest.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Only 9s that are *connected* to the Nest via a path of non-wall pixels (usually 7s) are moved. 9s that are isolated by walls of 6s remain in place.\n\n4.  **Filling Order and Limit:**\n    *   The 9s fill the Nest starting from the top-left (4,4), moving row by row (reading order).\n    *   The center pixel (5,5), originally 2, is overwritten if enough 9s arrive (as seen in Example 2). If not enough 9s arrive, the remaining 3s and the 2 stay unchanged (Examples 1 and 3).\n    *   If there are more connected 9s than the Nest can hold (9 spots), priority is likely given to the closest ones (by path distance), and the rest stay put. However, in the Test Input, we just need to check if we exceed the limit.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Locate the Nest:** Rows 4-6, Cols 4-6.\n2.  **Analyze Walls (6s) and Connectivity:**\n    *   **Row 1** is a solid wall of 6s (`6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6`). This completely isolates **Row 0**. The 9s at (0,2) and (0,8) cannot reach the Nest.\n    *   **Cols 1 and 9** form vertical walls extending from Row 1 to Row 9. This isolates **Col 0** and **Col 10**.\n        *   The 9 at (2,0) is isolated.\n        *   The 9s at (3,10), (5,10), and (7,10) are isolated.\n    *   **The Inner Region:** The area between Col 1 and Col 9 (i.e., Cols 2-8) is connected.\n        *   Row 3 and Row 7 have walls but contain gaps at Col 2, 5, and 8. Specifically, the gap at (7,5) connects the Nest area to the bottom section (Row 8).

My gut feeling tells me this involves understanding a rule and applying it. Here's what I'm thinking:\n\n*   **Initial Goal:** Decode the rule from the examples. I need to figure out what's happening to pixels and how to apply it to a new grid.\n*   **Observations:** The examples show a \"core\" object (a green square with a red center). Maroon pixels seem to gravitate toward this core, but magenta pixels (walls) act as barriers.\n*   **The \"Magnet\" Hint:** The core seems to exert a \"pull\" on the maroons. This \"gravity\" metaphor feels crucial.\n*   **Refining the Concept:** Maroons *slide* towards the core center, but walls stop them. So, is it shortest path or sliding? In a real gravity simulation, what does \"move towards\" look like?\n*   **A-ha! The Key:** The examples reveal a pathfinding problem. Maroons move to the closest empty spot to the core. This is where I started thinking that this is related to Manhattan distance from the core.\n*   **The Overwrite Dilemma:** The most confusing part is that the maroons overwrite the core, especially the red pixel (center). Sometimes the red pixel gets overwritten, sometimes it doesn't. Why?\n*   **The Key: Raster Order** This leads to the crucial detail: The core is actually an area (3x3), and the maroons fill it from top-left. And the red pixel is just the last in line to be overwritten.\n*   **The Logic:** I can model this as a Breadth-First Search (BFS). I need to calculate a distance field from the core's center, respecting walls and then simulate a teleport to a raster order priority fill of the core.\n    -   Identify the Core (Red 2 pixel and neighbors).\n    -   Find the Maroons, which are the movers\n    -   Run a path search (BFS) on each maroon, and check the path towards any of the pixels of the core\n    -   For all those maroons, clear them from their starting location\n    -   The core cells can then be filled based on raster scan priority\n*   **The Implementation:**\n    1.  Parse the grid: Identify the core, walls, and maroons.\n    2.  Distance Field: BFS from each core cell to every point, considering walls as obstacles.\n    3.  Reachability: Maroons \"in\" means there's a valid path to the core (inside the 'room').\n    4.  Fill Priority: Sort slots within the core using raster scan (top-left to bottom-right).\n    5.  Move and Overwrite: Remove all maroons that are able to reach the Core, and teleport these maroons in. The count from Input will determine how many slots.\n*   **Tests and Validation:** I walked through all examples to confirm: the core has 3x3 slots, but also the Red cell can be overwritten. Those maroons that can get to the core, move to the core. Those that can't, stay.\n*   **The Test Run:** I'll apply the logic to the test case, check the Maroons are counted, and run through my steps to generate the output, one cell at a time. The result will confirm my understanding and provide the answer.\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the final state of a grid where specific \"mobile\" pixels (Maroon, 9) are attracted to a \"magnet\" or target object (Green/Red 3x3 block), subject to barriers (Magenta, 6).\n\n### Analysis of Examples\n\n1.  **Target Object (Core):** In all examples, there is a central 3x3 structure composed of Green (3) pixels with a Red (2) pixel in the center. This acts as the \"gravity well.\"\n2.  **Mobile Pixels:** Maroon (9) pixels are the ones that move.\n3.  **Barriers:** Magenta (6) pixels are walls that block movement.\n4.  **Movement Rule:**\n    *   Maroon pixels move towards the Core.\n    *   Only Maroon pixels that have a valid path to the Core (not blocked by walls) are moved. Pixels that are completely walled off remain in their original positions (as seen in Example 1 and Example 2).\n    *   The \"gravity\" effect pulls the mobile pixels into the Core itself.\n5.  **Filling Logic:**\n    *   The Maroon pixels that successfully reach the Core occupy the cells of the Core.\n    *   The available \"slots\" in the Core are filled in a specific order: **Top-Left to Bottom-Right** (Raster Scan order).\n        *   Example 3 shows 4 pixels filling the top row (indices 4,4; 4,5; 4,6) and the left-middle pixel (5,4).\n    *   The mobile pixels can overwrite the Green (3) and even the central Red (2) pixels if enough Maroon pixels arrive (as seen in Example 2).\n    *   The number of slots filled equals the number of Maroon pixels that had a valid path to the Core.\n    *   The original positions of the moved Maroon pixels become empty background (Orange, 7).\n\n### Application to Test Input\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Core**\nThe 3x3 Core is located at row indices 4, 5, and 6, and column indices 4, 5, and 6.\n*   Row 4: `...6,3,3,3,6...`\n*   Row 5: `...7,3,2,3,7...`\n*   Row 6: `...6,3,3,3,6...`\n\n**Step 2: Identify Reachable Maroon Pixels**\nWe analyze the grid to find Maroon (9) pixels and check if they can reach the Core via open space (7). The grid has walls (6) isolating certain sections.\n\n*   **Top Area (Rows 0-1):** Blocked by a full wall at Row 1 (Index 1). Maroons at `(0,2)` and `(0,8)` are trapped and **stay**.\n*   **Outer Sides:** There are vertical walls at Column 1 and Column 9 in the middle section.\n    *   Left side: Maroon at `(2,0)` is outside the wall. **Stays**.\n    *   Right side: Maroons at `(3,10)`, `(5,10)`, `(7,10)` are outside the wall. **Stay**.\n*   **Middle/Inner Area:** This area is connected to the Core. We check the Maroons here:\n    *   `(2,2)`: Connected. Path exists downwards through holes in walls at Rows 4, 5, 6. **Moves**.\n    *   `(2,8)`: Connected. Path exists downwards. **Moves**.\n    *   `(8,2)`: Connected. Path exists upwards. **Moves**.\n    *   `(8,5)`: Connected. Directly below the Core. **Moves**.\n    *   `(8,8)`: Connected. Path exists upwards. **Moves**.\n\n**Total Reachable Movers:** 5 pixels.\n\n**Step 3: Update the Grid**\n1.  **Remove Movers:** Change the 5 identified mobile pixels at `(2,2)`, `(2,8)`, `(8,2)`, `(8,5)`, and `(8,8)` to background color (7).\n2.  **Fill Core:** Fill the first 5 slots of the 3x3 Core with Maroon (9).\n    *   The Core coordinates are (Row, Col): `(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)`.\n    *   Fill `(4,4)` -> 9\n    *   Fill `(4,5)` -> 9\n    *   Fill `(4,6)` -> 9\n    *   Fill `(5,4)` -> 9\n    *   Fill `(5,5)` -> 9 (Overwrites the Red center)\n    *   The remaining slots `(5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)` retain their original Green (3) color.\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\n*   **Row 0:** Unchanged.\n*   **Row 1:** Unchanged.\n*   **Row 2:** `9,6,9...` becomes `9,6,7...` (indices 2 and 8 become 7).\n*   **Row 3:** Unchanged.\n*   **Row 4:** Core top row `...3,3,3...` becomes `...9,9,9...`.\n*   **Row 5:** Core mid row `...3,2,3...` becomes `...9,9,3...`.\n*   **Row 6:** Core bot row `...3,3,3...` remains `...3,3,3...`.\n*   **Row 7:** Unchanged.\n*   **Row 8:** `7,6,9,7,7,9,7,7,9,6,7` becomes `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7` (indices 2, 5, 8 become 7).\n*   **Row 9:** Unchanged.\n*   **Row 10:** Unchanged.\n\n### Completed Output Grid\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,3,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n</REASONING_MODEL_E>\n<REASONING_MODEL_F model_id=\"gemini-3-high_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\n**Okay, let's break down this ARC problem. The user wants me to write a program that takes three examples and one test case to generate a correct output grid.**\n\nI start by looking at what makes the grids tick. It's an 11x11 grid with numbers 0-9.  I notice that 7 is the background, 9 is a scattershot color I'll call maroon, 3 is green, 2 is red, and 6 is magenta, which seems to form lines or enclosures.\n\nNow, Example 1. There is a 3x3 green square in the center with a red dot. Surrounding this are magenta lines. I also see maroon pixels that are scattered around. The trick appears to be how the maroon pixels end up in the center. I trace some of the scattered pixels and see a pattern. It looks like the maroon pixels above the green square end up *inside* it in the output. There are magenta lines that may act as walls or constraints. I suspect they 'fall' or move towards the center. There is a \"magnet\" property in play. The 6s are barriers. So, I realize the maroon pixels *slide* toward the green square. The Magenta are rigid, but *do* contain the maroon pixels.\n\nMoving to Example 2. I note the maroon pixels are in different positions, and the green/red center is *completely* filled with them in the output. It is more than three pixels wide. And, the original locations are empty.  I make the crucial observation that the walls of magenta may not be walls *for all* maroon pixels.  The pixels seem to move to a center, even if blocked. I start thinking about the box-like walls. But the maroon pixels seem to tunnel through the wall.\n\nI refine my hypothesis: Maroon pixels (9s) move toward the center (3x3 with red 2 in the middle). The Magenta lines (6s) are rigid, and I need to look at if pixels can *get past them*. I am thinking there may be multiple paths to the center. So, if a maroon pixel reaches the zone, it 'fills' it.  I must count the moving pixels to know how many to move.\n\nI look at Example 1 and trace it again. I see that pixels blocked by walls still *influence* the output somehow.  I start noticing there are different types of walls and holes in some.\n\nExample 3 is crucial - there are *no* 6s, and the pixels just seem to \"fall\" down to the green center. So gravity is the main thing now. This leads to the idea that there is a pull from the center to them. With all those pixels, the green box is now filled. This points me to the *filling order* being row-by-row, from left to right. Also I see that if there are too many, the red is overwritten.\n\nI go back to Example 2 and see it completely fills the box, even overwriting the red. So if the number of maroon pixels is greater than the total pixel count of the target area, the target is fully filled. So, with enough, the red (2) is *always* overwritten, no matter what. There is also a rule: The red pixel might not be overwritten.  This must mean there is a priority to the target zone.\n\nI formalize the hypothesis:\n1.  All maroon pixels can move\n2.  Magenta are walls, the number of target pixels matters to the overwrite. If too many maroon pixels are accessible to the target zone, the red will disappear.\n3.  Each maroon pixel is evaluated to see if it can reach the center box\n4.  If not, it will remain\n5.  If it can, I count it\n6.  The green box is then filled using the count. I keep the pixels, unless I run out.\n\nNow, for the test input.\n\nFirst, I identify all maroon pixels. There is a specific shape to the center - it's a 3x3 square with a red 2 in the middle, surrounded by Magenta and some other pixels. There are magenta (6) walls at the sides and top, but there is also a gap. There is also a 6 wall at the top and bottom. There are gaps on the left and right, and access to the center on top and bottom.  I count the \"reachable\" maroon pixels (those that have a clear path to the center) and find five. This can be done by a pathfinding exercise.\n\nI start building the output. The pixels go in, and now I fill the center, then I make the output grid, one row at a time. The final result is made.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to simulate the movement of \"mobile\" Maroon (9) pixels towards a \"magnet\" or \"gravity well\" in the center, which is a 3x3 square initially composed of Green (3) pixels with a Red (2) pixel in the middle. Magenta (6) pixels act as rigid walls.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Target:** The target is the 3x3 central square (Rows 4-6, Cols 4-6).\n2.  **Identify Mobile Units:** The Maroon (9) pixels are the mobile units.\n3.  **Identify Barriers:** The Magenta (6) pixels are walls.\n4.  **Determine Reachability:** For each Maroon (9) pixel in the input grid, we determine if there is a valid path to the central 3x3 square. A valid path consists of moving horizontally or vertically through empty space (Orange/7) or other traversable cells (like the target itself). Paths cannot pass through walls (6).\n    *   **Top 9s:**\n        *   (0,2) and (0,8) are blocked by the solid wall of 6s on Row 1. They are unreachable.\n        *   (2,2) and (2,8) are inside the main enclosure. Row 3 has a gap at column 5 (index 5). These pixels can move to column 5 and proceed down into the center. They are **reachable**.\n        *   (2,0) is blocked by the solid wall on Column 1. Unreachable.\n    *   **Side 9s:**\n        *   (3,10), (5,10), (7,10) are to the right of the solid wall on Column 9. They are unreachable.\n    *   **Bottom 9s:**\n        *   Row 8 contains 9s at (8,2), (8,5), and (8,8).\n        *   (8,5) is directly below the center. Row 7 has a gap at column 5. It can move straight up. **Reachable**.\n        *   (8,2) is to the left. Row 8 is open between columns 1 and 9. It can move right to column 5 and then up. **Reachable**.\n        *   (8,8) is to the right. It can move left to column 5 and then up. **Reachable**.\n5.  **Count Reachable Units:** There are 2 reachable pixels from Row 2 and 3 reachable pixels from Row 8. Total = 5.\n6.  **Fill the Target:** We fill the 3x3 target square with 9s, starting from the top-left (4,4) and proceeding row by row.\n    *   We have 5 pixels to place.\n    *   Row 4: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) become 9.\n    *   Row 5: (5,4), (5,5) become 9. ((5,5) was Red/2, now overwritten).\n    *   The remaining cells ((5,6) and Row 6) remain as they were (Green/3).\n7.  **Clear Source Pixels:** The 5 reachable Maroon (9) pixels in the input grid are replaced with the background color Orange (7). The unreachable ones remain Maroon (9).\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n*   Rows 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10 are unchanged (except for potential 9 removals, but none of the reachable 9s are on these rows).\n*   Row 2: 9s at (2,2) and (2,8) become 7. (2,0) stays 9.\n*   Row 4: Center (4,4)-(4,6) becomes 9,9,9.\n*   Row 5: Center (5,4)-(5,5) becomes 9,9.

What the transformation does\n\nAcross the examples the following behavior is consistent:\n\n- **Mobile color (maroon)**: `9`\n- **Wall color (magenta)**: `6`\n- **Central \u201cmagnet\u201d object**: a `3\u00d73` block whose outer cells are `3` and whose center is `2`\n- **Background**: `7` (and sometimes other colors, but they don\u2019t move)\n\nThe transformation looks like this:\n\n1. **Find the central 3\u00d73 magnet**  \n   It\u2019s always the 3\u00d73 block centered in the grid containing a single `2` in the center and `3`s around it.\n\n2. **Find maroon pixels that are \u201cattracted\u201d to the magnet**\n   - Treat `6` cells as **solid walls**.\n   - Treat `2`, `3`, `7`, and `9` as passable terrain (for the purpose of connectivity).\n   - Compute which `9` cells are in the same passable region as the magnet. Any `9` in a region that is separated by a complete band of `6`s (like a solid row or solid column of `6`s) is **blocked** and does not move.\n   - The movable maroons are exactly those reachable from the magnet without crossing a `6`.\n\n   In the examples:\n   - Example 3 has no `6`s, so all `9`s can reach the magnet \u2192 all 4 move.\n   - Example 1: only the two bottom maroons are in the same reachable pocket as the magnet \u2192 2 move.\n   - Example 2: the cross of `6`s splits off a batch of maroons near the top; 9 maroons remain in the same component as the magnet \u2192 9 move.\n\n   The **total number of moving maroons** `m` equals the number of reachable `9` cells.\n\n3. **Move (reassign) the moving maroons into the 3\u00d73 magnet**\n   - The magnet has 9 cells. We \u201cfill\u201d it with the `m` moving maroons in a fixed order:\n     - Order of cells inside the 3\u00d73 (row-major, top-left first):\n\n       1. (top row) left, middle, right\n       2. (middle row) left, center, right\n       3. (bottom row) left, middle, right\n\n       In coordinates relative to the grid this is:\n       ```\n       (r-1,c-1), (r-1,c), (r-1,c+1),\n       (r,  c-1), (r,  c), (r,  c+1),\n       (r+1,c-1), (r+1,c), (r+1,c+1)\n       ```\n       where `(r,c)` is the center cell (the `2`).\n\n   - For the first `m` cells in that order, overwrite whatever is there (3 or 2) with `9`.\n   - If `m < 9`, only a prefix of that order is turned into `9`s; the rest of the magnet stays as in the input.\n   - If `m \u2265 9`, the entire 3\u00d73 block becomes `9`s.\n\n   You can see this in the examples:\n   - Example 1: `m = 2` \u2192 only the top-left 2 cells of the 3\u00d73 (r5c5, r5c6) become `9`.\n   - Example 3: `m = 4` \u2192 (r5c5, r5c6, r5c7, r6c5) become `9`.\n   - Example 2: `m = 9` \u2192 the whole 3\u00d73 becomes `9`.\n\n4. **Erase the moved maroons from their original locations**\n   - Every `9` that we counted as reachable/moving disappears from its original position.\n   - In the examples, all those start cells become `7` in the output.\n   - Maroons that are in a different connectivity component (blocked by `6` walls) remain where they are.\n\n5. **All non-9, non-magnet parts of the grid otherwise stay unchanged.**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Apply this to the test input\n\n### 2.1. Locate the magnet\n\nTest input (for reference):\n\n```\nRow1:  6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\nRow2:  6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\nRow3:  9,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,7\nRow4:  7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\nRow5:  7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\nRow6:  7,6,7,7,3,2,3,7,7,6,9\nRow7:  7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\nRow8:  7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\nRow9:  7,6,9,7,7,9,7,7,9,6,7\nRow10: 7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\nRow11: 7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n```\n\nThe central 3\u00d73 with a `2` in the middle is at rows 5\u20137, columns 5\u20137:\n\n- Row 5, cols 5\u20137: `3,3,3`\n- Row 6, cols 5\u20137: `3,2,3`\n- Row 7, cols 5\u20137: `3,3,3`\n\nSo the magnet is:\n- Center `(r,c) = (6,6)`\n- Magnet cells:\n  - Row 5: (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)\n  - Row 6: (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)\n  - Row 7: (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)\n\n### 2.2.

Thus:\n\n- `(1,3)` and `(1,9)` are **blocked** by the row-2 wall and do not move.\n\nAll the other 9s (rows \u2265 3 and not on col 10) are in the same passable region as the magnet when you treat `6` as walls and walk through `7/3/2/9`. They are reachable and thus **will move**.\n\nSo:\n\n- **Unreachable and static**: (1,3), (1,9)  \u2192 stay as `9`.\n- **Reachable and moving**:  \n  (3,1), (3,3), (3,9), (4,11), (6,11), (8,11), (9,3), (9,6), (9,9)\n\nThere are 9 moving maroons, `m = 9`.\n\n### 2.3. Fill the magnet with the 9 moving maroons\n\nThe 3\u00d73 magnet has 9 cells, and `m = 9`, so it becomes **entirely filled with 9s**.\n\nRow-major order for the magnet cells:\n\n1. (5,5)\n2.

Some of the `3` (and sometimes the `2`) inside the central \\(3 \\times 3\\) are turned into `9`.\n\n   So the transformation is: **take some of the external 9\u2019s and move them into the central \\(3 \\times 3\\)**, in a fixed order, conserving the total number of `9` cells.\n\n3. **Which 9\u2019s are donors?**\n\n   A simple way to describe the donor set that fits Example 1 and Example 3 and is plausible for the test:\n\n   - Treat colour `6` as walls.\n   - All other colours (`0\u20135,7\u20139` here: `7,3,2,9`) are traversable.\n   - Starting from the central `2`, perform a flood\u2011fill over non\u2011`6` cells and obtain its connected region \\(R\\).\n   - **Donor 9\u2019s are the `9` cells that lie inside \\(R\\)** (i.e. in the same open region as the `2`, not separated by `6` walls).\n   - Remove each donor by painting it `7`.\n   - Let \\(K\\) be the number of donor 9\u2019s.\n\n4. **Where are the new 9\u2019s placed?**\n\n   Inside the fixed central \\(3\\times 3\\) pattern, we use a deterministic order:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{(row 5, col 5)},\\ \n   (5,6),\\ \n   (5,7),\\ \n   (6,5),\\ \n   (6,6),\\ \n   (6,7),\\ \n   (7,5),\\ \n   (7,6),\\ \n   (7,7)\n   \\]\n\n   i.e. **row\u2011major from the top\u2011left of the \\(3\\times 3\\)**.\n\n   For the first \\(K\\) positions in that sequence we paint them `9`. If \\(K<9\\), the remaining central cells keep their original `3` or `2`. If \\(K\\ge 9\\), the whole \\(3\\times 3\\) becomes `9`.\n\n   In each example the number of new `9` cells in the center equals the number of erased external `9` cells, so the total number of `9`s is conserved.\n\n5. **Apply to the test input**\n\n   Test grid (with coordinates; rows and columns are 1\u2011based):\n\n   ```\n   r1: 6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n   r2: 6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n   r3: 9,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,7\n   r4: 7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n   r5: 7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n   r6: 7,6,7,7,3,2,3,7,7,6,9\n   r7: 7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n   r8: 7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n   r9: 7,6,9,7,7,9,7,7,9,6,7\n   r10:7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n   r11:7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n   ```\n\n   - The central \\(3\\times 3\\) is rows 5\u20137, cols 5\u20137, containing the usual ring of `3`s with center `2` at (6,6).\n\n   **5.1.

The unique `2` marks the center of the 3\u00d73 block of `3`s; those nine cells form the target cluster.\n\nI first found the connected component of open (non\u20116) cells that contains the `2` using 8\u2011neighbour connectivity. Only `9`s in this component can be moved. The number to move is the minimum of the number of accessible `9`s and the cluster capacity (nine cells).\n\nTo choose which accessible `9`s to move, I scanned the grid from the bottom row up to the first row that contains a `6`, left\u2011to\u2011right within each row, selecting accessible `9`s until the required count was reached. Since the first row already contains `6`, this pass covered all rows; no second pass was needed. The selected `9`s are set to `7`.\n\nFinally, I filled the cluster cells in row\u2011major order with `9` for as many as were moved; the remaining cluster cells stayed unchanged.\n\nApplying this to the test grid, six `9`s at positions (9,3),(9,6),(9,9),(3,1),(3,3),(3,9) are moved into the first six cluster cells, and the output grid becomes:\n\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n<REASONING_MODEL_B model_id=\"gemini-3-high_12_step_5_gemini_gen_sol\">\n**Finalized Strategy for ARC Task: \"Pattern Filling\"**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to figure out this pattern-filling puzzle. I've broken it down step-by-step, using the examples and test case. Here's the plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the \"Core\"**: This is usually a 3x3 block in the middle, often with a \"2\" in the center. In the examples, I see the core centered at R4-R6, C4-C6.\n\n2.  **Find Connected \"9\" Pixels**: This is the heart of the algorithm. I need to count the number of \"9\" pixels that are *connected* to the core. A pixel is connected if there is a path of adjacent pixels (horizontally or vertically) made up of only background color (\"7\"), the \"9\" pixels themselves, or the core numbers (3,2). Important to note that the frame color \"6\" forms walls, blocking connection.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Fill Count**: The number of connected \"9\"s determines how many pixels within the core will be replaced with \"9\". Crucially, the maximum count seems to be capped at 9.\n\n4.  **Fill the Core**: The core is filled in a *specific* order: Top row (left to right), Middle row (left to right), Bottom row. The filling uses this specific count. The original numbers of the core get overwritten.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown of the process:**\n\n1.  **Example Analysis:**\n    *   I carefully examine the examples. In each one, I trace paths from the core to find connected \"9\" pixels.\n    *   Walls (defined by color 6) are crucial, as they can block connection and, thus, limit the count of \"9\".\n    *   Ex 1: 2, 2.\n    *   Ex 2: 8, 8 and, finally, I got 9 from a re-reading.\n    *   Ex 3: 4, 4.\n2.  **The \"Connected Pixel\" Logic:**\n    *   The algorithm identifies \"rooms\" that form separate components on the grid.\n    *   A pixel is part of the count if there is an unbroken connection to the core through \"7\"s and \"9\"s. A wall made of \"6\" blocks that path.\n\n3.  **The Center \"2\"**:  The number of \"2\" at the center stays during the whole filling process.\n\n4.  **Test the Input**\n    *   I carefully analyze and build the logic from the given input.\n    *   I see the frame as the border.\n\n**Putting It All Together**\n\nThis procedure is what I'll apply to each input grid. First, I identify the core and the \"connected 9\"s using my path-finding and wall analysis techniques. Then I calculate the \"fill count\" and replace parts of the core based on the filling strategy.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to simulate a specific transformation process on a grid of colored pixels. Based on the provided examples, here is the derived logic:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core:** Locate the 3x3 pattern consisting of color `3` (green) pixels surrounding a central color `2` (red) pixel. In the test input, this core is located at Rows 4-6 and Columns 4-6.\n\n2.  **Identify Connected Noise:** Identify all pixels of color `9` (maroon) that are topologically connected to the Core. Connectivity is defined by a path of non-blocking pixels (typically background `7`, core `3`/`2`, or other `9`s). Pixels of color `6` (magenta) act as walls/barriers. The count is limited to a maximum of 9.\n\n    *   **Connectivity Analysis for Test Input:**\n        *   The core is inside an inner room (Rows 3-7, Cols 3-7), with gaps in the walls at `R5C3` and `R5C7`.\n        *   These gaps lead to the outer region within the main frame (Rows 2-8, Cols 2-8).\n        *   From this outer region, we can reach `R9C8` (a gap in the bottom frame).\n        *   This gap leads to Row 10 (bottom edge), which is open (all `7`s).\n        *   Row 10 allows travel to Column 0.\n        *   **Connected `9`s found:**\n            1.  `R2C2`: Accessible from the inner region.\n            2.  `R2C8`: Accessible from the inner region.\n            3.  `R8C2`: Accessible from the inner region.\n            4.  `R8C5`: Accessible from the inner region (via R8).\n            5.  `R8C8`: Accessible from the inner region (via R8).\n            6.  `R2C0`: Accessible via the path exiting at `R9C8`, traversing `R10` to `C0`, and moving up.\n        *   **Isolated `9`s (Not Counted):**\n            *   `R0C2`, `R0C8`: Blocked by the solid wall at Row 1.\n            *   `R3C10`, `R5C10`, `R7C10`: Blocked by the solid vertical wall at Column 9.\n\n    *   **Total Count:** 6 pixels.\n\n3.  **Remove Source Pixels:** Change the identified connected `9`s to the background color `7`.\n    *   `R2C2`, `R2C8` become `7`.\n    *   `R8C2`, `R8C5`, `R8C8` become `7`.\n    *   `R2C0` becomes `7`.\n\n4.  **Fill the Core:** Fill the 3x3 Core with `9`s corresponding to the count, in row-major order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).\n    *   Count is 6.\n    *   Fill the first 6 positions of the 3x3 grid (Rows 4 and 5).\n    *   `R4C4`, `R4C5`, `R4C6` become `9`.\n    *   `R5C4`, `R5C5` (center), `R5C6` become `9`.\n    *   The remaining pixels (`R6C4`, `R6C5`, `R6C6`) remain `3`.\n\n**Final Grid Construction:**\nStart with the input grid and apply the changes.\n\n*   **Row 0:** `6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6` (Unchanged)\n*   **Row 1:** `6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6` (Unchanged)\n*   **Row 2:** `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7` (`9`s at C0, C2, C8 -> `7`)\n*   **Row 3:** `7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9` (Unchanged)\n*   **Row 4:** `7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7` (Core top row -> `9,9,9`)\n*   **Row 5:** `7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9` (Core mid row -> `9,9,9`)\n*   **Row 6:** `7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7` (Core bot row -> Unchanged `3,3,3`)\n*   **Row 7:** `7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9` (Unchanged)\n*   **Row 8:** `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7` (`9`s at C2, C5, C8 -> `7`)\n*   **Row 9:** `7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6` (Unchanged)\n*   **Row 10:** `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6` (Unchanged)\n\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n</REASONING_MODEL_B>\n<REASONING_MODEL_C model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_12_step_5_gemini_gen_sol\">\nLooking at this problem, I need to:\n1.

Find \u201cdoor\u201d cells and the walkable graph\n\nWalkable colors: `7` and `9`.  \nWalls: `6`, `3`, `2`.\n\nWe look at cells adjacent (4-neighbors) to the core that are `7` or `9`. Those are the door cells:\n\n- Above the core: row 4, cols 5\u20137 \u2192 values: `6,7,6` \u2192 door at (4,6).\n- Below the core: row 8, cols 5\u20137 \u2192 `6,7,6` \u2192 door at (8,6).\n- Left of the core: col 4, rows 5\u20137 \u2192 values `6,7,6` \u2192 door at (6,4).\n- Right of the core: col 8, rows 5\u20137 \u2192 `6,7,6` \u2192 door at (6,8).\n\nSo door set D = { (4,6), (6,4), (6,8), (8,6) }.\n\nNow perform a flood fill from D through cells whose color is `7` or `9`, treating all `6`, `3`, `2` as walls, to find all reachable `9`s.\n\n### 2.3. List `9` pixels in the grid\n\nPositions of `9` in the test input:\n\n- Row 1: (1,3), (1,9)\n- Row 3: (3,1), (3,3), (3,9)\n- Row 4: (4,11)\n- Row 6: (6,11)\n- Row 8: (8,11)\n- Row 9: (9,3), (9,6), (9,9)\n\nTotal: 11 pixels of color 9.\n\nBecause row 2 is all `6`, row 1 is isolated above a solid wall; so (1,3) and (1,9) are **not** connected to the core region.\n\nAlso, column 10 from rows 3\u201311 is all `6`, so column 11\u2019s walkable cells (rows 3\u20139) form a separate component that is **not** connected to the doors; thus (4,11), (6,11), (8,11) are also disconnected from the door component.\n\nRunning the flood fill from D through `7`/`9` in rows 3\u201311, you get that the reachable `9` pixels are exactly:\n\n- (3,1)\n- (3,3)\n- (3,9)\n- (9,3)\n- (9,6)\n- (9,9)\n\nThese 6 are in the same connected component as the doors. The 5 others:\n\n- (1,3), (1,9), (4,11), (6,11), (8,11)\n\nare in different components, hence not \u201cconnected to the core\u201d under the rule.\n\nSo `N = 6` reachable `9`s (and N \u2264 9, so no capping needed).\n\n### 2.4. Modify the outer `9` pixels\n\nTurn these 6 reachable `9` cells into `7`:\n\n- (3,1): 9 \u2192 7\n- (3,3): 9 \u2192 7\n- (3,9): 9 \u2192 7\n- (9,3): 9 \u2192 7\n- (9,6): 9 \u2192 7\n- (9,9): 9 \u2192 7\n\nAll other `9`s remain as they are.\n\n### 2.5. Fill the core with `9`s in row-major order\n\nRow-major order of the core cells:\n\n1. (5,5)\n2. (5,6)\n3. (5,7)\n4. (6,5)\n5. (6,6)\n6. (6,7)\n7. (7,5)\n8. (7,6)\n9. (7,7)\n\nWe have N = 6 reachable 9s, so we overwrite the first 6 core cells with `9`:\n\n- (5,5): 3 \u2192 9\n- (5,6): 3 \u2192 9\n- (5,7): 3 \u2192 9\n- (6,5): 3 \u2192 9\n- (6,6): 2 \u2192 9\n- (6,7): 3 \u2192 9\n\nThe remaining core cells stay as they were:\n\n- (7,5), (7,6), (7,7) remain `3`.\n\nSo the core becomes:\n\n```\nrow5 col5\u20137: 9 9 9\nrow6 col5\u20137: 9 9 9\nrow7 col5\u20137: 3 3 3\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Final output grid\n\nApplying both sets of changes (outer 9\u21927 and core filling) to the test input yields:\n\nRow 1: unchanged  \n`6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6`\n\nRow 2: unchanged  \n`6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6`\n\nRow 3: (3,1),(3,3),(3,9) turned to 7  \n`7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7`\n\nRow 4: unchanged  \n`7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9`\n\nRow 5: core updated at cols 5\u20137  \n`7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7`\n\nRow 6: core updated at cols 5\u20137  \n`7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9`\n\nRow 7: core bottom row unchanged  \n`7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7`\n\nRow 8: unchanged  \n`7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9`\n\nRow 9: (9,3),(9,6),(9,9) turned to 7  \n`7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7`\n\nRow10: unchanged  \n`7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6`\n\nRow11: unchanged  \n`7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6`\n\nSo the completed output grid is:\n\n```\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_D>\n<REASONING_MODEL_E model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_12_step_5_gemini_gen_sol\">\nThe training examples show a 3\u00d73 \u201ccore\u201d of 3s with a 2 in the middle sitting inside a region bounded by 6s.

The user's prompt is a bit contradictory, but I'll make the call to provide the explanation *before* the grid, as the final instruction seems more direct. Now, I have to figure out this ARC task. Let's get to it.\n\nThe task appears to involve moving some \"9s\" into a 3x3 box (containing 3s and a center 2). I need to discern the rules behind which 9s are moved.\n\nFirst, I went through the examples one-by-one, trying to understand what's happening. I quickly noticed that there are \"noise\" 9s scattered in the input and that the output changes these to \"7s\", and sometimes put 9s inside the 3x3 box. I went through and tried to note all of the coordinate details of the 9s.\n\nIn example 1, I noted how some 9s outside the box become 7s, and some of the positions inside became 9s. I tried to determine where the new 9s came from. But the specific coordinates weren't clear yet. In example 2, I examined how the 9s had moved into the box. All 9s that were \"scattered\" seemed to be moved. In example 3, it was a similar story, but without the \"6\" walls of the other examples. This made things even more complicated.\n\nInitially, I thought some were kept. There must be a reason. Then, I considered \"Connectedness\". But why were things at the top kept, and things at the bottom moved? And the shapes. It made no sense yet. I tried to figure out a rule based on what was *not* changed. I focused on \"9s\", \"7s\", and \"6s\".\n\nI hypothesized that some might be protected by \"6s\". I called these the \"6\" walls. At first, it seemed like the \"6s\" acted as walls. I also hypothesized that perhaps all 9s within \"6s\" were removed. But these didn't always work. But it didn't seem to work. Some were removed, some not. I tried to figure out what was \"inside\" the 6 structure.\n\nNext, I thought of a \"Flood Fill\". I imagined 9s being pulled to the box. I tested this with the examples. The box seemed connected. It was blocked, and unblocked. If I could get to the 9 through \"7s\", I'd get it. If not, I wouldn't. This was the key.\n\nThis changed when example 3, without \"6s\", was present. Everything changed if there weren't \"6s\". This made the flood-fill hypothesis even more important. All 9s would move if there were no \"6s\" present. If there were \"6s\", then *some* 9s moved. I realized the \"6s\" were barriers.\n\nMy new hypothesis: \"6s block 9s from moving.\" I started to classify the 9s based on where they were: Above, Below, Outside. This didn't seem to work, though. Finally, I tested if 9s could block.\n\nI started to check if the path could pass over the 9s. This meant if 9s acted like walls. And that's when it hit me. Only reachable 9s are moved. This means there's a flood. The path can only have \"7s\". And some 9s might be blocked.\n\nTo find the correct path, I must imagine a flood that goes through \"7s\" and moves, if possible, over the \"9s\" to reach the 3-box. This finally clicked with the examples, and I felt I understood the logic! \n\nTo solve this problem, I will:\n\n1.  Flood from the box through 7s.\n2.  If the 9 is met, take it!\n3.  Once the box is at capacity, stop taking 9s.\n\nNow, with the new Test Input, I went through the 9s carefully. I found 6. I'm going to set these to \"7\" and put 9s in the target box.\n\n\nThe puzzle asks us to identify a transformation rule based on three examples and apply it to a test input. The grids contain integer values representing colors.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Object Decomposition**:\n    *   **The Container**: In all examples and the test input, there is a distinct 3x3 structure composed of `3`s (Green) with a `2` (Red) in the center. In the Test Input, this is located at Rows 4-6, Columns 4-6.\n    *   **The Candidate Objects**: There are scattered `9`s (Maroon) throughout the grid.\n    *   **The Network**: There are `6`s (Magenta) forming walls, loops, or rail-like structures. These act as barriers.\n    *   **The Background**: The background is `7` (Orange).\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule**:\n    *   **Reachability**: The core logic is a flood-fill or pathfinding operation starting from the \"Container\" (the 3x3 box). The `6`s act as solid walls. The flood can pass through `7`s (background) and `9`s (candidates).\n    *   **Collection**: Any `9` (Maroon) that is *reachable* from the Container via a path of non-`6` cells is identified for movement.\n    *   **Transportation**: The reachable `9`s are \"moved\" into the Container.\n        *   The original location of the reachable `9` becomes `7` (background).\n        *   The Container fills up with `9`s starting from the top-left cell (0,0) of the 3x3 box, proceeding row by row (reading order).\n        *   The filling overwrites the existing `3`s and the central `2`.\n    *   **Capacity**: The Container has a capacity of 9 cells. In Example 2, the number of reachable `9`s exceeded the capacity (or filled it exactly), and the closest ones were prioritized. In the Test Input, the number of reachable `9`s is less than the capacity.\n    *   **Unreachable Objects**: `9`s that are completely walled off by `6`s (relative to the Container) remain in their original positions.\n\n3.  **Application to Test Input**:\n    *   **Container Location**: Rows 4-6, Columns 4-6. Center at (5,5).\n    *   **Walls (6s)**:\n        *   Column 1 is a solid wall of `6`s from Row 0 to Row 9. (Row 10 is `7`, creating an opening at the bottom left).\n        *   Column 9 is a solid wall of `6`s (or backed by `6`s) effectively blocking the right side.\n        *   Row 1 is a solid wall of `6`s.\n    *   **Openings**:\n        *   The Container is open to the \"Inside Arena\" (Rows 2-8, Cols 2-8) via gaps in the surrounding `6`s at (5,3) and (5,7).\n        *   The \"Inside Arena\" connects to the \"Outside\" bottom strip (Row 10) via a gap at (9,8).\n        *   The bottom strip (Row 10) connects to the left strip (Column 0) via the gap at (10,1).\n    *   **Reachable 9s**:\n        *   **Inside Arena**: (2,2), (2,8), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8). These are directly connected to the box. (5 total).\n        *   **Left Strip**: (2,0). This is reachable via the path: Box -> Inside -> Bottom Gap (9,8) -> Bottom Row (10) -> Bottom Left Gap (10,1) -> Up Column 0 -> (2,0). (1 total).\n        *   **Blocked 9s**:\n            *   (0,2), (0,8): Blocked by the solid wall at Row 1.\n            *   (3,10), (5,10), (7,10): Blocked by the solid wall at Column 9.\n    *   **Execution**:\n        *   Total reachable `9`s = 6.\n        *   Remove these 6 `9`s from the grid (change to `7`).\n        *   Fill the first 6 cells of the Container with `9`s.\n            *   Container Row 0 (Grid Row 4): All 3 cells become `9`.\n            *   Container Row 1 (Grid Row 5): All 3 cells become `9`.\n            *   Container Row 2 (Grid Row 6): Remains unchanged (original `3`s).\n\n**Test Input Grid Generation:**\n*   Input `9`s at (2,0), (2,2), (2,8), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8) become `7`.\n*   Box cells at (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6) become `9`.\n\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n</REASONING_MODEL_F>\n<REASONING_MODEL_G model_id=\"gemini-3-high_5_step_5_deep_thinking\">\nAlright, let's see. This ARC task seems to involve a collector, a kind of 3x3 block with a special center, that snatches up maroon (9) pixels from its surroundings and stuffs them into itself.  The background's usually orange (7) but it's not the crucial part. The 6's are clearly walls, and they define a space.\n\nAnalyzing the examples, it's pretty clear that if a 9 is blocked by a wall of 6's, it's safe.  The collector, a 3x3 block with a red dot (2) in the center and green (3) all around it, \"collects\" accessible 9s and replaces them with itself. Accessible means can be reached by a walk that follows 3 and 7 pixels. The center acts like a beacon for the collectable 9's, which are removed from the original place and transferred into the collector itself.\n\nSo, the game is to figure out if we can \"reach\" any maroon pixels from this 3x3 block, which is also called the \"basket\".  If they're trapped inside a 6 enclosure, they're not reachable. If not, they are added in the box itself. The number of accessible 9s determines how many cells in the basket are filled. The rule is that it starts filling the basket from the top left corner.\n\nNow, I'm given a new grid and I've to trace a path starting from the center of the 3x3 block (the 2) by following either 3s or 7s, avoiding 6s. If I find a 9 along the way, I add that 9 to the basket. If K is less than 9, that's easy! Put those k 9's into the basket. If it's more, fill it up completely. If, for instance, there's a 9 that's cut off from the collector by a wall of 6s, that's like a lost gem - it's left as it is. After determining how many 9s, the output grid is updated.\n\nSeems like a straightforward pathfinding and set-filling problem once the core mechanic is understood. Let's start with a test input. I can visualize the walls and the paths, trace it, and replace the reachable 9s, then update the basket accordingly. I need to make sure I don't get tricked by any hidden walls.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid based on logic inferred from three examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Objects:**\n    *   **Basket:** A 3x3 region defined by a border of green (3) pixels and a red (2) pixel in the center. In the examples, this basket serves as a collection point.\n    *   **Targets:** Maroon (9) pixels scattered throughout the grid.\n    *   **Walls:** Magenta (6) pixels act as barriers.\n    *   **Agent/Reachability:** The red pixel (2) inside the basket acts as the \"agent\". The transformation depends on which Target pixels (9s) are *reachable* from the agent using orthogonal movement (up, down, left, right) through empty space (color 7) or other traversable pixels (3s, 2s, 9s), but **not** through walls (6s).\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Pathfinding):** Perform a flood-fill or pathfinding operation starting from the center of the basket (the 2). Determine the connected component of traversable cells. Walls (6s) block movement.\n    *   **Step 2 (Collection):** Identify all Target pixels (9s) that fall within this connected component. These are the \"collected\" items.\n    *   **Step 3 (Removal):** In the output grid, replace the collected 9s with the background color (7). 9s that are *not* reachable (blocked by walls) remain in their original positions.\n    *   **Step 4 (Deposit):** Count the number of collected 9s ($K$). Fill the 3x3 basket with $K$ maroon (9) pixels. The filling order is reading order (row by row, from top-left to bottom-right):\n        *   $(r_{top}, c_{left})$\n        *   $(r_{top}, c_{mid})$\n        *   $(r_{top}, c_{right})$\n        *   $(r_{mid}, c_{left})$\n        *   ...and so on.\n    *   Any cells in the basket that are not filled with 9s retain their original color (3 or 2).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Basket:** The basket is the 3x3 block at Rows 4-6, Columns 4-6. The center is at `(5, 5)`.\n    *   Row 4: `...3,3,3...`\n    *   Row 5: `...3,2,3...`\n    *   Row 6: `...3,3,3...`\n\n2.  **Pathfinding & Reachability:**\n    *   We start at `(5, 5)`.\n    *   **Walls:** Row 1 is a solid line of 6s, making Row 0 completely unreachable.

Interpreting the colors and the setup\n\nFrom the hints and the examples:\n\n- **Maroon = color 9** \u2192 these are the **mobile pixels**.\n- **Magenta = color 6** \u2192 these are the **rigid walls**.\n- **The central object** is always a **3\u00d73 block of 3\u2019s with a 2 at the center**. This is the **gravity well / target**.\n- **Background** is mostly 7.\n\nIn every example:\n\n- Some 9\u2019s disappear from where they were and reappear **inside the 3\u00d73 central object**, turning some of the 3\u2019s (and sometimes the central 2) into 9\u2019s.\n- The total **count of 9\u2019s is preserved**.\n- The 6\u2019s never move or change.\n- The 7\u2019s only change where a 9 leaves or where a 9 appears.\n\nSo the transformation is:\n\n1. Decide **which 9\u2019s are \u201cattracted\u201d** into the central well (others stay put).\n2. Those attracted 9\u2019s are all **collected and placed inside the 3\u00d73 object** in a fixed order.\n3. Their **original cells are turned to background (7)**.\n\nThe key is how many 9\u2019s get attracted and how they are laid out inside the 3\u00d73.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How many 9\u2019s are sucked into the well?\n\nThe walls (6\u2019s) carve the board into \u201cbasins\u201d. For a given puzzle:\n\n- 9\u2019s that are in the **same basin** as the central 3\u00d73 (when you move through cells that are *not* 6) are **candidates** to be pulled in.\n- 9\u2019s that are **behind solid walls of 6\u2019s** and cannot reach the 3\u00d73 without crossing a 6 are **blocked** and stay where they are.\n\nIn the three training examples:\n\n- Example 3 has **no 6\u2019s**, so **all** 9\u2019s are in the same basin \u2192 all 4 move to the central area.\n- Example 1 has the 3\u00d73 surrounded by 6\u2019s with just a **single open \u201cdoor\u201d** below; only **two** 9\u2019s (the pair just below that door) are in the same basin as the center; the others are separated by 6 walls \u2192 N = 2.\n- Example 2\u2019s 6\u2011cross encloses the center with one open side; **exactly 9** of the 9\u2019s can reach that central basin without crossing a 6 \u2192 N = 9.\n\nThen:\n\n- Let **N = number of maroon 9\u2019s in the same 4\u2011connected region as the central 3\u00d73, when you treat 6 as walls**.\n- These N maroon pixels are \u201csucked in\u201d. Everywhere else, 9\u2019s are unchanged.\n\n---\n\n## 3. How the 9\u2019s fill the 3\u00d73 central object\n\nOnce you know N:\n\n- Take the 3\u00d73 central mask (rows r\u2080..r\u2080+2, cols c\u2080..c\u2080+2 where the 3\u2019s & the 2 are).\n- Visit its 9 cells **in reading order**: top row left\u2192right, then middle, then bottom.\n- Paint the **first N cells** of that 3\u00d73 **with color 9**.\n- Leave the remaining cells of that 3\u00d73 unchanged (still 3 or 2).\n\nThis pattern matches the examples:\n\n- Example 1: N = 2 \u2192 top row cells (1) and (2) become 9:  \n  3\u00d73 becomes  \n  `9 9 3`  \n  `3 2 3`  \n  `3 3 3`  \n  which is exactly the given output.\n- Example 3: N = 4 \u2192 cells (1\u20134) in reading order become 9:  \n  `9 9 9`  \n  `9 2 3`  \n  `3 3 3`  \n  matches the example.\n- Example 2: N \u2265 9 \u2192 all 9 cells become 9: full 3\u00d73 of 9\u2019s, as in the output.\n\nSeparately, for the N 9\u2019s that got sucked in, their original locations are turned to background 7.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Apply the rule to the test input\n\n### 4.1. Locate the central object\n\nThe central 3\u00d73 of 3\u2019s with a 2 in the middle is:\n\nRows 4\u20136, columns 4\u20136 (0\u2011based indexing):\n\n- Row 4: `...,6,3,3,3,6,...` \u2192 cells (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) are 3.\n- Row 5: `...,7,3,2,3,7,...` \u2192 cells (5,4), (5,5), (5,6) are 3,2,3.\n- Row 6: `...,6,3,3,3,6,...` \u2192 cells (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) are 3.\n\nSo the 3\u00d73 mask is:\n\n- (4,4) (4,5) (4,6)\n- (5,4) (5,5) (5,6)\n- (6,4) (6,5) (6,6)\n\n### 4.2. List all the 9\u2019s\n\nCoordinates (row, col):\n\n- Row 0: (0,2), (0,8)\n- Row 2: (2,0), (2,2), (2,8)\n- Row 3: (3,10)\n- Row 5: (5,10)\n- Row 7: (7,10)\n- Row 8: (8,2), (8,5), (8,8)\n\nTotal 11 maroon pixels.\n\n### 4.3. Find which 9\u2019s are in the same basin as the center\n\nTreat **6 as wall** and all other colors (7,3,2,9) as passable. Use 4\u2011connected adjacency (up/down/left/right).\n\nFrom the central 3\u00d73 we flood outwards:\n\n- Because of the big horizontal wall of 6\u2019s at row 1, the 9\u2019s on **row 0** \u2013 (0,2) and (0,8) \u2013 are **cut off**: you cannot get from the central region to row 0 without crossing row 1\u2019s 6\u2019s. So these two 9\u2019s are **blocked** and do not move.\n- The right edge has a vertical wall of 6\u2019s around column 9/10 that isolates the 9\u2019s at:\n  - (3,10), (5,10), (7,10)  \n    They have only neighbors that are 6 or out of bounds, except each other and some 7\u2019s behind the same wall; that pocket is sealed from the central basin by 6\u2019s. So these three are also **blocked**.\n- The remaining 9\u2019s:\n  - (2,0), (2,2), (2,8)\n  - (8,2), (8,5), (8,8)\n  are **reachable** from the central region via 4\u2011connected paths that do not go through any 6.\n\nThus the number of maroon pixels attracted into the well is:\n\n- **N = 6** (those six reachable 9\u2019s).\n\nThese are the ones whose original cells will be emptied (turned to 7) and whose mass will reappear in the 3\u00d73.\n\n### 4.4. Fill the central 3\u00d73 with N=6 maroon pixels\n\nThe 3\u00d73 cells in reading order:\n\n1. (4,4)\n2. (4,5)\n3. (4,6)\n4. (5,4)\n5. (5,5)\n6. (5,6)\n7. (6,4)\n8. (6,5)\n9. (6,6)\n\nWith N=6, we make cells 1\u20136 equal to 9 and leave cells 7\u20139 as they were:\n\n- (4,4) 3 \u2192 9\n- (4,5) 3 \u2192 9\n- (4,6) 3 \u2192 9\n- (5,4) 3 \u2192 9\n- (5,5) 2 \u2192 9\n- (5,6) 3 \u2192 9\n- (6,4) 3 \u2192 3 (unchanged)\n- (6,5) 3 \u2192 3\n- (6,6) 3 \u2192 3\n\nSo the central block becomes:\n\nRow 4 cols 4\u20136: `9,9,9`  \nRow 5 cols 4\u20136: `9,9,9`  \nRow 6 cols 4\u20136: `3,3,3`  (unchanged).\n\n### 4.5. Remove the six moved maroon pixels from their original positions\n\nThe six reachable maroon coordinates:\n\n- (2,0), (2,2), (2,8), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8)\n\nEach of these becomes 7.\n\nUpdate affected rows:\n\n- Row 2 original: `9,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,7`  \n  After clearing (2,0), (2,2), (2,8):  \n  \u2192 `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7`\n\n- Row 8 original: `7,6,9,7,7,9,7,7,9,6,7`  \n  After clearing (8,2), (8,5), (8,8):  \n  \u2192 `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7`\n\nAll other rows\u2019 9\u2019s were blocked and remain unchanged.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Final output grid\n\nPutting it all together, the output grid is:\n\nRow 0: `6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6`  \nRow 1: `6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6`  \nRow 2: `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7`  \nRow 3: `7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9`  \nRow 4: `7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7`  \nRow 5: `7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9`  \nRow 6: `7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7`  \nRow 7: `7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9`  \nRow 8: `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7`  \nRow 9: `7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6`  \nRow10: `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6`\n\nSo the completed output grid is:\n\n```\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_K>\n<REASONING_MODEL_L model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\nTo solve this task I looked at the three worked examples and identified three key colours:\n\n- `6` is the magenta \u201cwall\u201d colour that is impassable.\n- `9` is the maroon \u201cmobile\u201d colour that gets attracted.\n- The small 3\u00d73 patch of `3`s with a single `2` in its centre is the \u201cmagnet\u201d object.\n\nIn all examples the transformation conserves the number of `9`s, but some `9`s disappear from their original locations and reappear over the central object. The pattern of the re\u2011appearing `9`s is always the top\u2011left part of the 3\u00d73 magnet region in row\u2011major order, and the `2` is overwritten if enough `9`s are available. The positions that lose their `9` become background `7`.\n\nThe decisive factor is whether a `9` can reach the magnet without crossing a wall. The way to model that is to do a breadth\u2011first search (BFS) from all cells of the 3\u00d73 magnet region through all non\u2011`6` cells. Every time the BFS encounters a cell containing a `9` we add it to a list in order of increasing distance. At the end, we take as many of these reachable `9`s as there are cells in the magnet (at most 9). Those selected `9`s are removed from their original positions (set to `7`) and placed into the magnet cells in fixed row\u2011major order: (row\u202f5,col\u202f5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). Any remaining `9`s that are unreachable, or beyond the first nine, remain where they were.\n\nApplying this to the test grid:\n\n- Row\u202f2 is entirely walls, so the two `9`s in row\u202f1 are unreachable and stay put.\n- Column\u202f10 is entirely walls, so the `9`s in column\u202f11 form an isolated component and stay put.\n- The BFS from the magnet within the reachable component finds exactly six `9`s at positions (3,1),(3,3),(3,9),(9,3),(9,6),(9,9). These are removed.\n- The first six magnet cells in row\u2011major order are filled with `9`s; the last three remain as they were.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n</REASONING_MODEL_L>\n<REASONING_MODEL_M model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\nTo solve this task I first identified the three relevant colours from the examples:\n\n- `6` is the \u201cmagenta\u201d wall and blocks movement.\n- The central 3\u00d73 object made of `3` with a `2` in the centre is the target.\n- `9` are the maroon mobile pixels.\n\nIn all examples the only changes are that some `9`s disappear from their original positions and re\u2011appear inside the 3\u00d73 target. The number inserted equals the number of \u201creachable\u201d `9`s, capped at the nine cells of the block, and they are written into the block in row\u2011major order (top row left to right, then next row, etc.). Any cells of the block not filled remain as they were. The moved `9`s\u2019 original cells are set back to the background colour `7`; unreachable `9`s stay where they were.\n\nTo determine reachability and closeness I perform a BFS starting from all cells of the target block through all non\u2011wall cells (any value other than `6`). This gives the shortest path length to the target for every cell; cells not reached are unreachable. If there are more reachable `9`s than the nine block cells, I would take the nearest ones by this distance, but in this test there are fewer than nine so all reachable `9`s move.\n\nApplying this to the test input, the row of `6`s on row\u00a02 isolates row\u00a01, and the solid column of `6`s at col\u00a010 isolates col\u00a011, so the reachable `9`s are at (3,1),(3,3),(3,9),(9,3),(9,6),(9,9); all six move. They fill the first six positions of the 3\u00d73 block, turning the centre `2` into `9` as well. The original positions of those six are set to `7`.

In each case the small \\(3\\times 3\\) block of colour\u202f3 with a 2 in the centre was the target of the change. Colour\u202f6 acts as a wall or frame: I treat all 6\u2011cells as obstacles that partition the grid. I find the connected component of non\u20116 cells that contains the core. Only 9s in this component are \u201cavailable\u201d to move; 9s in other components (for example, separated by a complete row or column of 6s) are left alone and act as fixed markers.\n\nFrom the available 9s, I count how many there are. If there is an unobstructed 9 in the same row or column as the core centre within this component, the centre cell is eligible to be filled; otherwise it stays 2. I lay out the potential fill positions of the core in row\u2011major order (top left across and then down), including the centre if it is eligible. I take as many positions from this list as there are available 9s, and set those core cells to 9. The original available 9s are consumed and turned into background 7; cells outside the core\u2019s component remain unchanged.\n\nIn the test grid, the row of all 6s at row\u202f2 and the full column of 6s at column\u202f10 split the grid into components. The core\u2019s component contains six 9s at (3,1), (3,3), (3,9), (9,3), (9,6) and (9,9). There is a clear 9 in the same column as the centre at (9,6), so the centre is included. Using the six available 9s, I fill the first six core positions in row\u2011major order, and turn those six original 9s into 7.

The task is to take maroon pixels (9) that lie in the same open region as the green patch, where open cells are anything but 6, and move as many of them as possible into the green patch. You compute the size of the green patch (9 cells) and the set of 9s connected to it through non\u20116 cells. Let k be the minimum of these two counts. Remove those k maroons closest to the green region (in the examples this simply meant all connected maroons when there were fewer than nine, or the nine shortest\u2011path maroons when there were more), setting their old positions to background 7.

(Example 2 appears to introduce an additional complication I can't fully resolve, but it doesn\u2019t change what happens in the test configuration, which structurally matches examples 1 and 3.)\n\n## Observed structure\n\nIn all examples and the test:\n\n- The grid is 11\u00d711.\n- There is a central 3\u00d73 block of `(3,3,3; 3,2,3; 3,3,3)` at rows 4\u20136, cols 4\u20136 (0-based).\n- Color 7 is the background.\n- Color 6 makes a kind of frame or corridors around that central block (in examples 1, 2, and the test).\n- Color 9 appears scattered around and is the only color that changes aside from some of the 3s (and the central 2 in example 2).\n\nAcross examples:\n\n- Some 9s are turned into 7.\n- An equal number of cells inside the central 3\u00d73 block are turned from 3 to 9 (and sometimes also the 2 is turned to 9 when the whole block is filled).\n- So the total count of 9s is preserved, but 9s are \u201cmoved\u201d from outside into the central block.\n\nFor examples 1 and 3 there is a very simple pattern:\n\n- Identify a *particular band of rows* inside the big 6-frame where the 9s are the \u201csource\u201d:\n  - Example 1: inside the interior bounded by the 6 frame, the **lowest** row that still contains any 9s is row 8 (0-based). Those 9s at `(8,7)` and `(8,8)` are the only ones that move.\n  - Example 3: there is no 6 at all, so the entire grid is effectively \u201cinterior\u201d; **all** 9s are treated as source.\n- The number of source 9s, call it K, then determines how many cells inside the 3\u00d73 are turned to 9:\n  - The K cells of the 3\u00d73 are filled with 9s in **row-major order** from the top-left of the 3\u00d73:\n    - Cell order: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n  - The same K source 9 cells are turned into 7.\n- Example 3 (no 6): 4 source 9s \u2192 first 4 cells of the 3\u00d73 become 9.\n- Example 1 (strong 6-frame): 2 source 9s in the lowest interior row (row 8) \u2192 first 2 cells of the 3\u00d73 become 9.\n\nThe **test grid** has a strong 6-frame very similar in spirit to example 1: 6s on row 1 and row 9, and vertical 6-columns at col 1 and col 9, giving a large rectangular interior with the 3\u00d73 inside it.

It seems pretty straightforward on the surface, with these grids having a consistent structure: an orange background, a green-centered red 3x3 block (the \"Core\"), sometimes magenta \"Frames,\" and maroon \"Markers.\" My goal is to figure out the rules for the transformation.\n\nAfter looking at a few examples, a few key things stand out. The Core often gets changed. These scattered markers are also changed in the output. The Frame and background colors mostly stay put. But the 9's *inside* the 6-structure are key to this.\n\nI've laid out the rules that describe the transformations provided by the task:\n\n1.  **Core:** Defined as the central 3x3 green block with a red center.\n2.  **Aligned 9s:** If a marker (9) is directly above, below, to the left, or right of the Core's center, the whole Core becomes 9s.\n3.  **Diagonal 9s**: If a marker (9) is located *diagonally* to the Core, the Core is filled from the \"opposite corner\", as defined in the examples.\n4.  **No Frame:** If there's no surrounding frame, you count all the 9s in the entire grid and use them to change the Core cells in reading order (skipping the center).\n5.  **Removal:** Any 9s found inside the Frame (the enclosing 6-structure) are removed/changed to background color.\n6.  **Outside 9s:** Any markers that are located outside the defined 6-structure will remain.\n\nNow, I'm going to carefully analyze the provided examples, especially focusing on how the markers are positioned relative to the Core and Frame.\n\n**Example 1**\n\nIn Example 1, I see this complex structure, there are two 6-structures. There are some 9s scattered around, but the ones *inside* this \"lower\" structure seem to be crucial. In this example, just *two* 9s were *consumed* by the lower frame. Using the prompt's Rule 3,  I'm now counting the 9s that are found within the defined 6-structure.  The markers in this structure are SE, and following the prompt's Rule 3 - this means the first cells of the Core (NW) will change. The transformation does not involve the center.\n\n**Example 2**\n\nExample 2 is interesting because the whole core turned into 9s. Following the Alignment rule, since the 9s are *vertically* aligned with the core's center, the *entire* Core becomes 9s, including the center! This confirms that alignment trumps the more general \"partial fill\" rule. The aligned 9s are consumed/removed.\n\n**Example 3**\n\nThis one has *no* Frame. Here, I'm using the \"No Frame\" rule. It's simply a matter of counting all 9s in the grid, removing them, and then filling those many Core cells in reading order, *skipping the center*.\n\nI've now gotten a handle on the rules.\n\nBased on the example analysis I now have this workflow:\n\n1.  **Identify Frame**: Find the connected structure made of 6s that surrounds or is adjacent to the Core. The whole grid is treated as the Frame if no 6s are present.\n2.  **Identify Markers**: Find all the 9s *within* the \"inside\" area defined by the Frame (or the whole grid if no frame exists).\n3.  **Check Alignment**: Are any of these markers in the *same row or column* as the Core's center?\n    *   **Yes**: Core Transformation = **Full**: The *entire* Core becomes 9s.\n    *   **No**: Core Transformation = **Count**: Count the number of markers (9s) within the defined Frame structure (if any). Let *N* be this number. Change the first N cells of the Core in reading order, *skipping the center*, to 9s.\n4.  **Clean Up**: Change all markers identified as being *inside* the Frame (or whole grid in a no-frame situation) to the background color 7. Markers outside the Frame are left unchanged.\n\nI think I've got this. Let's see if this logic holds true.\n\nI have to carefully apply these rules to the *Test Input*.\n\n**Test Input**\n\nAnalyzing this input, I notice this one has a defined, closed-off Frame (the big box of 6s on the edges). Within this box, I find\n\nThe transformation logic is based on the interaction between a central \"core\" (3x3 block), a \"frame\" (magenta 6s), and \"markers\" (maroon 9s).\n\n**1. Identify Objects:**\n*   **Core**: A 3x3 block centered at `(5,5)` containing green (3) and a red center (2). In the input, it spans rows 4-6 and columns 4-6.\n*   **Frame**: A structure of magenta (6) cells enclosing a central region. In the test input, the outer boundary of the frame is defined by row 1 (top), row 9 (bottom), column 1 (left), and column 9 (right).\n*   **Markers (Inside)**: Maroon (9) cells located within the frame's boundaries. In the test input, the markers at `(2,2)`, `(2,8)`, `(8,2)`, `(8,5)`, and `(8,8)` are inside this frame.\n*   **Markers (Outside)**: Maroon (9) cells outside the frame (e.g., at row 0, column 0, column 10). These remain unchanged.\n\n**2. Determine Transformation Rule:**\n*   Check for **Alignment**: Are any *inside* markers in the same row or column as the Core's center `(5,5)`?\n    *   The marker at `(8,5)` is in column 5, which is aligned with the center `(5,5)`.\n*   **Rule Application**: According to the problem description, if aligned markers exist, the **entire core** is transformed into maroon 9s (including the center).\n    *   If there were no alignment, we would count the markers and fill the core partially. Here, alignment triggers the full fill.\n\n**3. Apply Transformation:**\n*   **Core**: Change cells `(4,4)` through `(6,6)` to 9s.\n*   **Inside Markers**: Remove all markers identified as being inside the frame (change them to background color 7).\n    *   ` (2,2) -> 7`\n    *   ` (2,8) -> 7`\n    *   ` (8,2) -> 7`\n    *   ` (8,5) -> 7`\n    *   ` (8,8) -> 7`\n*   **Outside Markers**: Preserve them as 9.\n*   **Background/Frame**: Preserve as 7/6.\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\n*   **Row 2**: Input `9,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,7` becomes `9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7` (Inside 9s at col 2 and 8 removed).\n*   **Row 4**: Input `...3,3,3...` (Core) becomes `...9,9,9...`.\n*   **Row 5**: Input `...3,2,3...` (Core) becomes `...9,9,9...`.\n*   **Row 6**: Input `...3,3,3...` (Core) becomes `...9,9,9...`.\n*   **Row 8**: Input `7,6,9,7,7,9,7,7,9,6,7` becomes `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7` (Inside 9s at col 2, 5, 8 removed).\n*   Other rows remain unchanged or only retain outside 9s.\n\noutput:\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n<REASONING_MODEL_B model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_11_step_5_opus_gen_sol\">\nLooking at this problem, I need to:\n1.

                "response": "**Alright, let's break down these ARC puzzle solutions as if they were my own thought process.**  I'm looking for the most logical, consistent approach.  It's clear the core idea involves reachable pixels, which I'm calling the \"maroons\" or 9s.\n\nI first considered **Candidate 0**. It's all about finding those \"reachable\" 9s \u2013 the ones that are connected to the core block through a path of the orange background color (7s).  This idea of connectivity \u2013 avoiding walls \u2013 seemed spot-on. I'd count the reachable ones, get my 'N' number, then fill that many cells in the core. Easy and pretty solid.\n\nThen, there was **Candidate 1**. It's largely the same, but it gets complicated. Why skip the center pixel? That adds complexity without really helping the model fit the examples. It looks overfitted to me.\n\n**Candidate 3** made little sense. It seemed to ignore the essential connectivity. So, completely irrelevant.\n\n**Candidate 4** on the other hand, got my full attention. It uses similar logic of calculating the number of accessible cells, but the audit revealed that this model correctly handled a tricky wraparound case. This is crucial for me since I aim at complete and accurate logic in solutions.  I'd say this is a critical aspect. The solution and audit text were coherent and robust. This method seems like the best approach.\n\n**Candidate 8** had a 'lowest row' idea. This has no supporting evidence and is inconsistent across examples. I'd ignore it.\n\nFinally, **Candidate 11** was a bit too \"magical.\" Introducing alignment rules only when it\u2019s needed to achieve some goal seems a bit suspect. The counting rule is more consistent.\n\nSo here's what I've got:\n\n*   Candidate 4: The top choice. Sound logic that works, plus precise execution. Model O is the main point of this solution.\n\n*   Candidate 0: This is a strong contender but it misses a critical wrapped path on this input. Great basic logic.\n\n*   Candidate 1: Same as Candidate 0 + unnecessary complexities.\n\n*   The rest are out.",

The goal is to come up with a rule based on what's visible in each grid.\n\n1.  **I started by analyzing Example 1.** I noticed a colored background with a rectangular frame, and inside, there was a small square with a colored center. There were scattered colored pixels, but I'll call them '9s'. I then compared the input and output grids. Initially, it seemed like the '9s' outside were somehow being collected and inserted into that small square. The colored square would have a mix of 3s and 2s, but the output changed those to nines.\n2.  **So I looked more closely at the position of the nines** and whether they were somehow related to the box's position. I counted how many there were in both. I also looked at Example 2.\n3.  **In Example 2, some nine's disappeared completely, and the center's color also changes.** This tells me the number of nines could have something to do with the outcome.\n4.  **I tried a gravity model** where nines are falling towards the box. It kind of works but doesn't quite explain every case.\n5.  **I tried something more spatial.** Could the grid be \"wrapped\" or \"connected\"? Maybe the frame acted as a barrier.\n6.  **I started playing around with coordinates, trying to map where the input nines were located in the new output.** I considered rotation and mirroring as operations. This didn't quite pan out.\n7.  **Then I considered the colored pixels and the structure, and I got to this idea of \"walls\", and what's connected to those walls.** I also realized the frame's color was significant.\n8.  **I also saw that the output 3x3 had some changes, but other changes also happened to the outer tiles.** So maybe outer tiles could map to tiles within the 3x3 somehow.\n9.  **Then came the \"Extraction and Mapping\" idea:** The idea was that nines are relative coordinates, which are extracted relative to some central reference and re-mapped inside the box.\n10. **I began investigating the concept of \"gravity\",** where the nine tiles fall to the bottom row, and fill the small box if they are on a column or row intersecting with the small box.\n11. **But then I tried the idea of \"Connected Components.\"** Maybe nines that are connected to a colored structure were active, meaning they get absorbed, and others are just along for the ride.\n12. **Next, the count and fill idea emerged.** I thought about how many nines were present and whether they were removed. The basic rule seems to be: \"Count the reachable nines and fill the target.\" I'll determine how to determine \"reachable\" in a moment.\n13. **So here's the pathfinding rule I settled on.** The rule is: starting from the box's cells, check if you can travel through 7-colored pixels to the \"nine\" to determine if it is \"reachable\" or \"active\".\n14. **So, I tried applying this new rule to the samples**. And it fit! The pathfinding, where the \"path\" is 7 colored pixels, seemed to correctly identify nines that should be absorbed.\n15. **After this, I went through the test input and followed the steps:** I created this rule: if the nines are \"reachable\" from the center, then the boxes' pixels' position is determined, and they can be filled with nines.\n16. **Then I created my solution.**\n\nThis rule accounts for all the examples I've seen, and I'm ready to apply this to the test input.\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the transformation rule based on three solved examples and apply it to a test input.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n\n1.  **Structure:** All grids are 11x11. There is a background of Orange (7) and a structure of Magenta (6) pixels acting as walls. In the center (Rows 4-6, Columns 4-6), there is a 3x3 \"Green Box\" (initially mostly Green (3) with a Red (2) center). There are scattered Maroon (9) pixels.\n2.  **Transformation Process:**\n    *   **Absorption of Maroon (9) Pixels:** Certain Maroon (9) pixels in the grid disappear (turn into background 7).\n    *   **Filling the Green Box:** The Green Box pixels change from Green (3) or Red (2) to Maroon (9). The number of pixels that change in the box seems directly related to the number of Maroon pixels that disappeared from the grid.\n3.  **Determining Which 9s Disappear:**\n    *   By examining the Magenta (6) structures, we can see they form enclosures or barriers.\n    *   In **Example 1**, the 9s at (8,7) and (8,8) disappear. These are reachable from the Green Box through the background (7) path. Other 9s, like those above the top wall (Row 3) or blocked by side walls, remain.\n    *   In **Example 2**, a large number of 9s disappear. The container is open at the bottom, and Row 10 acts as a passage connecting different areas. Most 9s are reachable and thus disappear.\n    *   In **Example 3**, there are no Magenta walls. All 9s disappear.\n    *   **Rule:** A Maroon (9) pixel is \"absorbed\" if it is connected to the central Green Box via a path of background (7) pixels (orthogonal movement, not blocked by Magenta 6s).\n4.  **Determining the Box Fill Pattern:**\n    *   Let $N$ be the count of absorbed 9s.\n    *   The Green Box (3x3) is filled with $N$ Maroon (9) pixels, replacing the original values.\n    *   The filling order is reading order: Row by Row, Left to Right.\n        *   Indices:\n            (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)\n            (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n            (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n    *   **Example 1:** $N=2$. Positions (0,0) and (0,1) become 9. Center (1,1) remains 2.\n    *   **Example 3:** $N=4$. Positions (0,0) to (1,0) become 9. Center (1,1) remains 2.\n    *   **Example 2:** $N \\ge 5$. The center (1,1) becomes 9. In this case, the box was completely filled ($N \\ge 9$).\n    *   **Conclusion:** We fill the first $N$ pixels of the 3x3 box. If $N \\ge 5$, the center (red 2) gets overwritten.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Structure:**\n    *   There is a large container defined by Magenta (6) walls: Row 1 (Top), Column 1 (Left), Column 9 (Right), and Row 9 (Bottom).\n    *   The Green Box is at the center (Rows 4-6, Columns 4-6).\n    *   There are gaps in the inner horizontal walls (Row 3 and Row 7) at Column 5, allowing access between the Box and the rest of the container.\n    *   There are gaps in the inner vertical walls (Column 3 and Column 7) at Row 5, also allowing access.\n2.  **Count Reachable 9s:**\n    *   We scan the grid for Maroon (9) pixels inside the container (Rows 2-8, Columns 2-8).\n    *   (2,2): Inside. Reachable.\n    *   (2,8): Inside. Reachable.\n    *   (8,2): Inside. Reachable.\n    *   (8,5): Inside. Reachable.\n    *   (8,8): Inside. Reachable.\n    *   **Total Count ($N$) = 5.**\n    *   Note: The 9s at (0,2), (0,8), (2,0), (3,10), (5,10), (7,10) are blocked by walls (Row 1, Col 1, Col 9). They remain unchanged.\n3.  **Update Grid:**\n    *   **Remove Absorbed 9s:** Change (2,2), (2,8), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8) to 7.\n    *   **Fill Green Box:** $N=5$. We fill the first 5 pixels of the box with 9s.\n        *   (4,4) -> 9\n        *   (4,5) -> 9\n        *   (4,6) -> 9\n        *   (5,4) -> 9\n        *   (5,5) -> 9 (Center overwrites 2)\n        *   Remaining pixels (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) retain their original values (3, 3, 3, 3).

The user wants me to solve an ARC task where I need to take three example input-output pairs, analyze them, and apply the pattern I discover to a new test input. The problem looks like it's about transforming a grid, probably based on moving pixels with specific values.\n\nI'm starting by carefully examining the examples. I'm looking for consistent structures like patterns, symmetries, and any elements that remain fixed or changed predictably.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\nI noticed that the grid has a background color (7, orange), and a shape made of a specific color, magenta. Inside, there seems to be a central core of 3x3 cells. Sometimes there are random pixels (maroon) scattered around.\n\n*   **Initial Observation**: There's a rectangular frame made of color 6 (magenta) containing a 3x3 square of color 3 (green) with a central 2 (red). There is also a scattered background of color 9 (maroon) pixels.\n*   **Detailed Observation**: The 9s inside the frame changed to a mixture of 9s and 3s. The outer 9s remained. Rows 5-7 have some pattern inside the 6-frame. The output is where 9s have changed to some number inside the 6-frame.\n*   **Hypothesis**: The change is inside the frame. The input has 9s and they somehow \"move\" to the center of the 3x3 green box.\n\nI examined the input and output pixels. I also observed 9s (maroon) seem to move into the frame. Then I noted how there seems to be a frame around the central 3x3 box. Also, the 9 pixels seem to go into the green square.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n\nI noticed that I could find the position of the 9s relative to the center 3x3 box. I saw the same core, but the 9s had a bigger pattern. In Example 2, some of the 9s were inside the outer frame, some were outside. In Example 2 output, the entire 3x3 box turned to 9s. I noticed that the pixels outside of a certain range remain untouched in both the Example 1 and Example 2 output.\n\n*   **Observations**: In Example 2, all 9s within the \"6\" frame are \"absorbed\" into the central 3x3 area. The entire 3x3 block (including the center \"2\") transforms into 9s in the output. The pixels *outside* the 6-frame remain unchanged.\n*   **Deeper analysis**: The \"9\" pixels that move are somehow linked to the frame. I noticed that 9s outside the 6 frame were untouched, while 9s inside were absorbed to the central 3x3 area. I then noticed that some pixels changed into 9s. Then I checked how the pixels in the box in Example 2 were updated.\n*   **Hypothesis Update**: The 6 frame is the key to define some boundary. I theorized that pixels could only be altered if inside the central 3x3 box or a certain range or area to the box.\n\nI'm thinking now about a possible \"gravity\" effect: The 9s \"fall\" towards the central target (the 3x3 area) if the area around is \"empty\". Now, maybe they have to be enclosed or next to the box.\n\n**Example 3 Analysis:**\n\nThis example had no external frame. The 9s simply moved into the center. There was a direct relationship between *all* 9s and the central box. I also looked at the color values and how pixels were arranged. The frame 6 color was missing.\n\n*   **Observation**: Example 3 has no outer \"frame\", and *all* the 9s are absorbed into the central area. The central 3x3 box now contained all \"9\" pixels, even the center \"2\", completely erasing any trace of them outside of that box. The 9s were somehow getting absorbed in the 3x3 core.\n*   **Hypothesis**: Maybe the frame 6 is irrelevant?\n*   **New Hypothesis**: I have a theory that all the 9s will move and become part of the central 3x3. I will test this by looking at the input to the test case, and then applying the process.\n\n**Generalizing the Rule**\n\nI noticed now a filling order pattern in the box. Now, the main rule is:\n\n1.  Identify the 3x3 central target (with 3s and a 2 in the center).\n2.  Find *all* 9s\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on a pattern inferred from three examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n1.  **Identify the Target Container:**\n    In all examples, there is a central 3x3 block composed of green (3) pixels with a single red (2) pixel in the center.\n    - Example 1: Rows 4-6, Cols 4-6.\n    - Example 2: Rows 4-6, Cols 4-6.\n    - Example 3: Rows 4-6, Cols 4-6.\n    This 3x3 block acts as a \"container\" or \"collector\" for maroon (9) pixels.\n\n2.  **Identify Movable Objects (9s):**\n    The grid contains scattered maroon (9) pixels.\n    - In Example 1, the 9s *inside* the magenta (6) frame move to the target. The 9s *outside* the frame stay.\n    - In Example 2, the 9s that can reach the target (the frame is open at the bottom) move. 9 9s moved, completely filling the 3x3 container. The distant/isolated 9s stayed.\n    - In Example 3, there are no walls; all 9s move.\n\n    **Rule:** A maroon (9) pixel moves to the target container if and only if it is **accessible** to the target. Accessibility is defined by a path of non-wall pixels (where walls are magenta 6s) connecting the 9 to the 3x3 block.\n\n3.  **Transformation Process:**\n    - Count the number of accessible 9s, let's say $N$.\n    - The capacity of the 3x3 target container is 9 pixels.\n    - The first $N$ spots in the target container are filled with 9s. The filling order is standard reading order: Row 4 (Left to Right), then Row 5 (Left to Right), then Row 6 (Left to Right).\n    - If $N < 9$, the remaining spots in the target retain their original color (3 or 2).\n    - If $N \\ge 9$, the entire target becomes 9s (excess 9s disappear? In the examples, $N$ matches the moved count or fills the container, so we assume we just fill up to the limit).\n    - The accessible 9s in the original grid are replaced by the background color (7).\n    - Inaccessible 9s remain unchanged.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Locate Target:**\n    The 3x3 block of 3s and 2 is at Rows 4-6, Cols 4-6.\n\n2.  **Map Accessibility:**\n    - **Walls (6):** There is a solid wall at Row 1 (`6,6...`). There are vertical walls at Col 1 and Col 9 enclosing the center. There is a bottom wall at Row 9 (partial).\n    - **Accessible Zone:** The region bounded by Row 1, Col 1, Col 9, and Row 9 contains the target. The target itself is surrounded by partial 6s but has openings (e.g., at (3,5), (5,3), (5,7), (7,5)).\n    - **Scanning for 9s:**\n        - **Row 0:** `(0,2), (0,8)` are 9s. They are above the solid wall at Row 1. **Inaccessible**.\n        - **Row 2:** `(2,0)` is 9 (blocked by col 1 wall). `(2,2)` and `(2,8)` are 9s inside the main enclosure. **Accessible**.\n        - **Row 3:** `(3,10)` is 9 (outside col 9 wall). **Inaccessible**.\n        - **Row 5:** `(5,10)` is 9 (outside col 9 wall). **Inaccessible**.\n        - **Row 8:** `(8,2), (8,5), (8,8)` are 9s inside the enclosure. `(8,8)` connects via `(8,7)-(8,6)-(8,5)`. **Accessible**.\n    - **Accessible 9s Count:** 5 pixels at `(2,2), (2,8), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8)`.\n\n3.  **Construct Output:**\n    - **Move 9s:** Change the 5 accessible 9s at `(2,2), (2,8), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8)` to background `7`.\n    - **Fill Target:** Fill the first 5 spots of the 3x3 target with `9`.\n        - Spot 1 `(4,4)`: 3 -> 9\n        - Spot 2 `(4,5)`: 3 -> 9\n        - Spot 3 `(4,6)`: 3 -> 9\n        - Spot 4 `(5,4)`: 3 -> 9\n        - Spot 5 `(5,5)`: 2 -> 9\n    - **Remain:** The remaining 4 spots `(5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)` stay as `3`.\n    - **Inaccessible:** All other 9s `(0,2), (0,8), (2,0), (3,10), (5,10), ...` remain `9`.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,3,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,7,9,9,3,7,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"C\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_4_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**ARC Task: Color Grid Transformation**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to figure out a rule for these color grid problems. My initial plan is to look at the examples and try to understand how the input grid is changed into the output grid. The grids use numbers 0-9 to represent colors.\n\n**First Look at Example 1:**\nThe grid is mostly orange (7) with a magenta (6) structure and a green (3) 3x3 square with a red (2) center. This green square has some scattered maroon (9) pixels around it. The output grid has changes inside that 3x3 square. It looks like the scattered 9s might be moving into the 3x3 square, so I\u2019ll need to check carefully for this.\n\n**Analyzing the Difference:**\nI'm now comparing the input and output pixel by pixel. In the output grid, it looks like some of those maroon (9) pixels have \"moved\" into that 3x3 green square. Hmm, are they *all* moving? Let's check coordinates of the changes more closely. I see that certain 9s are indeed disappearing from their original spots, and 9s are appearing in that 3x3 area. So the 9s seem to be \"filling\" the square.\n\n**Example 2: A Pattern Emerges:**\nLet\u2019s see if this pattern holds in another example. In Example 2, the 3x3 square is again in the same place. I notice that the 3x3 square is *completely* filled with 9s in the output. This solidifies my thought about the 9s moving into the 3x3 region.\n\n**Looking for a Rule:**\nIt looks like this might be a \"move\" or \"fill\" task. The goal seems to be to fill that central 3x3 area with the maroon (9) color, and the original color 2 gets replaced. I need to figure out what criteria decides *which* 9s move. I\u2019m thinking there might be a \"distance\" or \"accessibility\" factor involved. I noticed something: the 9s that moved were inside of an enclosure formed by color 6.\n\n**\"Rooms\" and \"Accessibility\":**\nI'm beginning to think the rule is about a kind of \"connectivity\" or \"reachability.\" Pixels of color 6 (magenta) seem to be acting like walls. Only the 9s that are \"accessible\" or \"connected\" to that target 3x3 area, *without* crossing color 6, are allowed to move. I'll test this hypothesis to see if this is true in both the previous and new examples.\n\n**Testing the Accessibility Rule:**\nI can see in Example 1 that some 9s were *inside* a room made of 6s, and those moved. Others were outside and didn\u2019t move. Hmm, I\u2019m getting closer!\n\n**The \"Move if Connected\" Rule:**\nIt seems that the 9s are moving if they are \"connected\" to the 3x3 green square. Connected means there is a non-color-6 (non-wall) path to reach this area. I believe the rule is now that any pixel of color 9 that can be \"reached\" or \"connected to\" the 3x3 target grid, without hitting walls, must move into the target grid, filling the 3x3 grid using the order cells are in the grid. If the 3x3 box is full, any further 9s remain in place.\n\n**The Strategy for a New Task:**\n*   Identify the target: the 3x3 area with the color 3s and 2 in the center.\n*   Find the \"connected\" 9s: These must be reachable without passing through the \"walls\" (color 6).\n*   Move the 9s.\n*   The original position of the \"9\" pixel changes to 7.\n*   If more 9s are connected than cells in the box, fill the box up with cells in reading order. Remaining connected cells don't move.\n\n**Applying to the Test Input:**\nNow, I'll use the rule to analyze the test input. First, I have to figure out the location of the 3x3 target and walls of color 6s. Then I can identify and move the connected 9s. I see that the target 3x3 grid is in the same location as before.  I'm looking for the connected components of the 9s. It looks like the target is at rows 4-6, cols 4-6. I will identify the walls. The ones at 1-7 in row 1,1. I see the 9s at (2,\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the transformation rule based on the provided examples and apply it to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal Structure:** In all examples, there is a distinct 3x3 square composed mainly of green pixels (3) with a red center (2). This structure, which we can call the \"Nest\" or \"Target Box,\" is located at rows 4-6 and columns 4-6 (0-indexed).\n    *   Example 1: The nest is partially filled with maroon pixels (9) in the output.\n    *   Example 2: The nest is completely filled with maroon pixels (9) in the output.\n    *   Example 3: The nest is partially filled with maroon pixels (9) in the output.\n\n2.  **Identify the Moving Parts:** The pixels that change are maroon (9) pixels scattered throughout the grid. In the output, some of these 9s disappear from their original positions and appear inside the Nest. The original positions of these moving 9s become background color (7).\n\n3.  **Determine the Rule for Movement:**\n    *   **Connectivity:** The grid contains walls made of magenta pixels (6). We treat the grid as a maze where 6s are obstacles.\n    *   In Example 1, the 9s in the \"top room\" (rows 1-3) do not move. This room is completely enclosed by walls of 6s. The 9s in the \"bottom room\" (rows 7-9) *do* move. There is a gap in the wall at (7,5) that connects the bottom room to the area containing the Nest.\n    *   In Example 3, there are no walls (6s). All scattered 9s move into the Nest.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Only 9s that are *connected* to the Nest via a path of non-wall pixels (usually 7s) are moved. 9s that are isolated by walls of 6s remain in place.\n\n4.  **Filling Order and Limit:**\n    *   The 9s fill the Nest starting from the top-left (4,4), moving row by row (reading order).\n    *   The center pixel (5,5), originally 2, is overwritten if enough 9s arrive (as seen in Example 2). If not enough 9s arrive, the remaining 3s and the 2 stay unchanged (Examples 1 and 3).\n    *   If there are more connected 9s than the Nest can hold (9 spots), priority is likely given to the closest ones (by path distance), and the rest stay put. However, in the Test Input, we just need to check if we exceed the limit.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Locate the Nest:** Rows 4-6, Cols 4-6.\n2.  **Analyze Walls (6s) and Connectivity:**\n    *   **Row 1** is a solid wall of 6s (`6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6`). This completely isolates **Row 0**. The 9s at (0,2) and (0,8) cannot reach the Nest.\n    *   **Cols 1 and 9** form vertical walls extending from Row 1 to Row 9. This isolates **Col 0** and **Col 10**.\n        *   The 9 at (2,0) is isolated.\n        *   The 9s at (3,10), (5,10), and (7,10) are isolated.\n    *   **The Inner Region:** The area between Col 1 and Col 9 (i.e., Cols 2-8) is connected.\n        *   Row 3 and Row 7 have walls but contain gaps at Col 2, 5, and 8. Specifically, the gap at (7,5) connects the Nest area to the bottom section (Row 8).

My gut feeling tells me this involves understanding a rule and applying it. Here's what I'm thinking:\n\n*   **Initial Goal:** Decode the rule from the examples. I need to figure out what's happening to pixels and how to apply it to a new grid.\n*   **Observations:** The examples show a \"core\" object (a green square with a red center). Maroon pixels seem to gravitate toward this core, but magenta pixels (walls) act as barriers.\n*   **The \"Magnet\" Hint:** The core seems to exert a \"pull\" on the maroons. This \"gravity\" metaphor feels crucial.\n*   **Refining the Concept:** Maroons *slide* towards the core center, but walls stop them. So, is it shortest path or sliding? In a real gravity simulation, what does \"move towards\" look like?\n*   **A-ha! The Key:** The examples reveal a pathfinding problem. Maroons move to the closest empty spot to the core. This is where I started thinking that this is related to Manhattan distance from the core.\n*   **The Overwrite Dilemma:** The most confusing part is that the maroons overwrite the core, especially the red pixel (center). Sometimes the red pixel gets overwritten, sometimes it doesn't. Why?\n*   **The Key: Raster Order** This leads to the crucial detail: The core is actually an area (3x3), and the maroons fill it from top-left. And the red pixel is just the last in line to be overwritten.\n*   **The Logic:** I can model this as a Breadth-First Search (BFS). I need to calculate a distance field from the core's center, respecting walls and then simulate a teleport to a raster order priority fill of the core.\n    -   Identify the Core (Red 2 pixel and neighbors).\n    -   Find the Maroons, which are the movers\n    -   Run a path search (BFS) on each maroon, and check the path towards any of the pixels of the core\n    -   For all those maroons, clear them from their starting location\n    -   The core cells can then be filled based on raster scan priority\n*   **The Implementation:**\n    1.  Parse the grid: Identify the core, walls, and maroons.\n    2.  Distance Field: BFS from each core cell to every point, considering walls as obstacles.\n    3.  Reachability: Maroons \"in\" means there's a valid path to the core (inside the 'room').\n    4.  Fill Priority: Sort slots within the core using raster scan (top-left to bottom-right).\n    5.  Move and Overwrite: Remove all maroons that are able to reach the Core, and teleport these maroons in. The count from Input will determine how many slots.\n*   **Tests and Validation:** I walked through all examples to confirm: the core has 3x3 slots, but also the Red cell can be overwritten. Those maroons that can get to the core, move to the core. Those that can't, stay.\n*   **The Test Run:** I'll apply the logic to the test case, check the Maroons are counted, and run through my steps to generate the output, one cell at a time. The result will confirm my understanding and provide the answer.\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the final state of a grid where specific \"mobile\" pixels (Maroon, 9) are attracted to a \"magnet\" or target object (Green/Red 3x3 block), subject to barriers (Magenta, 6).\n\n### Analysis of Examples\n\n1.  **Target Object (Core):** In all examples, there is a central 3x3 structure composed of Green (3) pixels with a Red (2) pixel in the center. This acts as the \"gravity well.\"\n2.  **Mobile Pixels:** Maroon (9) pixels are the ones that move.\n3.  **Barriers:** Magenta (6) pixels are walls that block movement.\n4.  **Movement Rule:**\n    *   Maroon pixels move towards the Core.\n    *   Only Maroon pixels that have a valid path to the Core (not blocked by walls) are moved. Pixels that are completely walled off remain in their original positions (as seen in Example 1 and Example 2).\n    *   The \"gravity\" effect pulls the mobile pixels into the Core itself.\n5.  **Filling Logic:**\n    *   The Maroon pixels that successfully reach the Core occupy the cells of the Core.\n    *   The available \"slots\" in the Core are filled in a specific order: **Top-Left to Bottom-Right** (Raster Scan order).\n        *   Example 3 shows 4 pixels filling the top row (indices 4,4; 4,5; 4,6) and the left-middle pixel (5,4).\n    *   The mobile pixels can overwrite the Green (3) and even the central Red (2) pixels if enough Maroon pixels arrive (as seen in Example 2).\n    *   The number of slots filled equals the number of Maroon pixels that had a valid path to the Core.\n    *   The original positions of the moved Maroon pixels become empty background (Orange, 7).\n\n### Application to Test Input\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Core**\nThe 3x3 Core is located at row indices 4, 5, and 6, and column indices 4, 5, and 6.\n*   Row 4: `...6,3,3,3,6...`\n*   Row 5: `...7,3,2,3,7...`\n*   Row 6: `...6,3,3,3,6...`\n\n**Step 2: Identify Reachable Maroon Pixels**\nWe analyze the grid to find Maroon (9) pixels and check if they can reach the Core via open space (7). The grid has walls (6) isolating certain sections.\n\n*   **Top Area (Rows 0-1):** Blocked by a full wall at Row 1 (Index 1). Maroons at `(0,2)` and `(0,8)` are trapped and **stay**.\n*   **Outer Sides:** There are vertical walls at Column 1 and Column 9 in the middle section.\n    *   Left side: Maroon at `(2,0)` is outside the wall. **Stays**.\n    *   Right side: Maroons at `(3,10)`, `(5,10)`, `(7,10)` are outside the wall. **Stay**.\n*   **Middle/Inner Area:** This area is connected to the Core. We check the Maroons here:\n    *   `(2,2)`: Connected. Path exists downwards through holes in walls at Rows 4, 5, 6. **Moves**.\n    *   `(2,8)`: Connected. Path exists downwards. **Moves**.\n    *   `(8,2)`: Connected. Path exists upwards. **Moves**.\n    *   `(8,5)`: Connected. Directly below the Core. **Moves**.\n    *   `(8,8)`: Connected. Path exists upwards. **Moves**.\n\n**Total Reachable Movers:** 5 pixels.\n\n**Step 3: Update the Grid**\n1.  **Remove Movers:** Change the 5 identified mobile pixels at `(2,2)`, `(2,8)`, `(8,2)`, `(8,5)`, and `(8,8)` to background color (7).\n2.  **Fill Core:** Fill the first 5 slots of the 3x3 Core with Maroon (9).\n    *   The Core coordinates are (Row, Col): `(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)`.\n    *   Fill `(4,4)` -> 9\n    *   Fill `(4,5)` -> 9\n    *   Fill `(4,6)` -> 9\n    *   Fill `(5,4)` -> 9\n    *   Fill `(5,5)` -> 9 (Overwrites the Red center)\n    *   The remaining slots `(5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)` retain their original Green (3) color.\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\n*   **Row 0:** Unchanged.\n*   **Row 1:** Unchanged.\n*   **Row 2:** `9,6,9...` becomes `9,6,7...` (indices 2 and 8 become 7).\n*   **Row 3:** Unchanged.\n*   **Row 4:** Core top row `...3,3,3...` becomes `...9,9,9...`.\n*   **Row 5:** Core mid row `...3,2,3...` becomes `...9,9,3...`.\n*   **Row 6:** Core bot row `...3,3,3...` remains `...3,3,3...`.\n*   **Row 7:** Unchanged.\n*   **Row 8:** `7,6,9,7,7,9,7,7,9,6,7` becomes `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7` (indices 2, 5, 8 become 7).\n*   **Row 9:** Unchanged.\n*   **Row 10:** Unchanged.\n\n### Completed Output Grid\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,3,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,7,9,9,3,7,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"F\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Okay, let's break down this ARC problem. The user wants me to write a program that takes three examples and one test case to generate a correct output grid.**\n\nI start by looking at what makes the grids tick. It's an 11x11 grid with numbers 0-9.  I notice that 7 is the background, 9 is a scattershot color I'll call maroon, 3 is green, 2 is red, and 6 is magenta, which seems to form lines or enclosures.\n\nNow, Example 1. There is a 3x3 green square in the center with a red dot. Surrounding this are magenta lines. I also see maroon pixels that are scattered around. The trick appears to be how the maroon pixels end up in the center. I trace some of the scattered pixels and see a pattern. It looks like the maroon pixels above the green square end up *inside* it in the output. There are magenta lines that may act as walls or constraints. I suspect they 'fall' or move towards the center. There is a \"magnet\" property in play. The 6s are barriers. So, I realize the maroon pixels *slide* toward the green square. The Magenta are rigid, but *do* contain the maroon pixels.\n\nMoving to Example 2. I note the maroon pixels are in different positions, and the green/red center is *completely* filled with them in the output. It is more than three pixels wide. And, the original locations are empty.  I make the crucial observation that the walls of magenta may not be walls *for all* maroon pixels.  The pixels seem to move to a center, even if blocked. I start thinking about the box-like walls. But the maroon pixels seem to tunnel through the wall.\n\nI refine my hypothesis: Maroon pixels (9s) move toward the center (3x3 with red 2 in the middle). The Magenta lines (6s) are rigid, and I need to look at if pixels can *get past them*. I am thinking there may be multiple paths to the center. So, if a maroon pixel reaches the zone, it 'fills' it.  I must count the moving pixels to know how many to move.\n\nI look at Example 1 and trace it again. I see that pixels blocked by walls still *influence* the output somehow.  I start noticing there are different types of walls and holes in some.\n\nExample 3 is crucial - there are *no* 6s, and the pixels just seem to \"fall\" down to the green center. So gravity is the main thing now. This leads to the idea that there is a pull from the center to them. With all those pixels, the green box is now filled. This points me to the *filling order* being row-by-row, from left to right. Also I see that if there are too many, the red is overwritten.\n\nI go back to Example 2 and see it completely fills the box, even overwriting the red. So if the number of maroon pixels is greater than the total pixel count of the target area, the target is fully filled. So, with enough, the red (2) is *always* overwritten, no matter what. There is also a rule: The red pixel might not be overwritten.  This must mean there is a priority to the target zone.\n\nI formalize the hypothesis:\n1.  All maroon pixels can move\n2.  Magenta are walls, the number of target pixels matters to the overwrite. If too many maroon pixels are accessible to the target zone, the red will disappear.\n3.  Each maroon pixel is evaluated to see if it can reach the center box\n4.  If not, it will remain\n5.  If it can, I count it\n6.  The green box is then filled using the count. I keep the pixels, unless I run out.\n\nNow, for the test input.\n\nFirst, I identify all maroon pixels. There is a specific shape to the center - it's a 3x3 square with a red 2 in the middle, surrounded by Magenta and some other pixels. There are magenta (6) walls at the sides and top, but there is also a gap. There is also a 6 wall at the top and bottom. There are gaps on the left and right, and access to the center on top and bottom.  I count the \"reachable\" maroon pixels (those that have a clear path to the center) and find five. This can be done by a pathfinding exercise.\n\nI start building the output. The pixels go in, and now I fill the center, then I make the output grid, one row at a time. The final result is made.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to simulate the movement of \"mobile\" Maroon (9) pixels towards a \"magnet\" or \"gravity well\" in the center, which is a 3x3 square initially composed of Green (3) pixels with a Red (2) pixel in the middle. Magenta (6) pixels act as rigid walls.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Target:** The target is the 3x3 central square (Rows 4-6, Cols 4-6).\n2.  **Identify Mobile Units:** The Maroon (9) pixels are the mobile units.\n3.  **Identify Barriers:** The Magenta (6) pixels are walls.\n4.  **Determine Reachability:** For each Maroon (9) pixel in the input grid, we determine if there is a valid path to the central 3x3 square. A valid path consists of moving horizontally or vertically through empty space (Orange/7) or other traversable cells (like the target itself). Paths cannot pass through walls (6).\n    *   **Top 9s:**\n        *   (0,2) and (0,8) are blocked by the solid wall of 6s on Row 1. They are unreachable.\n        *   (2,2) and (2,8) are inside the main enclosure. Row 3 has a gap at column 5 (index 5). These pixels can move to column 5 and proceed down into the center. They are **reachable**.\n        *   (2,0) is blocked by the solid wall on Column 1. Unreachable.\n    *   **Side 9s:**\n        *   (3,10), (5,10), (7,10) are to the right of the solid wall on Column 9. They are unreachable.\n    *   **Bottom 9s:**\n        *   Row 8 contains 9s at (8,2), (8,5), and (8,8).\n        *   (8,5) is directly below the center. Row 7 has a gap at column 5. It can move straight up. **Reachable**.\n        *   (8,2) is to the left. Row 8 is open between columns 1 and 9. It can move right to column 5 and then up. **Reachable**.\n        *   (8,8) is to the right. It can move left to column 5 and then up. **Reachable**.\n5.  **Count Reachable Units:** There are 2 reachable pixels from Row 2 and 3 reachable pixels from Row 8. Total = 5.\n6.  **Fill the Target:** We fill the 3x3 target square with 9s, starting from the top-left (4,4) and proceeding row by row.\n    *   We have 5 pixels to place.\n    *   Row 4: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) become 9.\n    *   Row 5: (5,4), (5,5) become 9. ((5,5) was Red/2, now overwritten).\n    *   The remaining cells ((5,6) and Row 6) remain as they were (Green/3).\n7.  **Clear Source Pixels:** The 5 reachable Maroon (9) pixels in the input grid are replaced with the background color Orange (7).

The 9s are attracted to the center 3x3 block and fill it\n2. The 6s form rigid walls/barriers\n3. 9s that can \"reach\" the center (not completely blocked above the main wall) move to fill the center\n4. 9s turn to 7 at their original positions when they move\n\n**Test input structure:**\n- Center is at (5,5) with value 2, surrounded by 3s at rows 4-6, columns 4-6\n- Row 1 is completely 6s (top wall)\n- Columns 1 and 9 are mostly 6s (side walls)\n\n**Identifying 9s:**\n- Row 0: (0,2), (0,8) - above top wall\n- Row 2: (2,0), (2,2), (2,8)\n- Row 3: (3,10)\n- Row 5: (5,10)\n- Row 7: (7,10)\n- Row 8: (8,2), (8,5), (8,8)\n\n**Which 9s move:**\nBased on the pattern, 9s at or below the top wall (row 1) can contribute. 9s above the wall only contribute if in center columns (4-6).\n- (0,2) and (0,8) are in row 0 but columns 2 and 8 (not center columns) \u2192 stay\n- All other 9s \u2192 move (9 total)\n\nSince 9 9s move and center capacity is 9, the entire center fills with 9s.\n\n**Changes:**\n- Center (rows 4-6, cols 4-6): all become 9\n- 9s that move become 7: (2,0), (2,2), (2,8), (3,10), (5,10), (7,10), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8)\n- 9s that stay: (0,2), (0,8)\n\n**Output:**\n```\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"E\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-high_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nFirst I\u2019ll describe the pattern I inferred from the three training examples, then I\u2019ll show exactly how I applied it to the test grid, and finally I\u2019ll give the resulting output grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the transformation does\n\nAcross the examples the following behavior is consistent:\n\n- **Mobile color (maroon)**: `9`\n- **Wall color (magenta)**: `6`\n- **Central \u201cmagnet\u201d object**: a `3\u00d73` block whose outer cells are `3` and whose center is `2`\n- **Background**: `7` (and sometimes other colors, but they don\u2019t move)\n\nThe transformation looks like this:\n\n1. **Find the central 3\u00d73 magnet**  \n   It\u2019s always the 3\u00d73 block centered in the grid containing a single `2` in the center and `3`s around it.\n\n2. **Find maroon pixels that are \u201cattracted\u201d to the magnet**\n   - Treat `6` cells as **solid walls**.\n   - Treat `2`, `3`, `7`, and `9` as passable terrain (for the purpose of connectivity).\n   - Compute which `9` cells are in the same passable region as the magnet. Any `9` in a region that is separated by a complete band of `6`s (like a solid row or solid column of `6`s) is **blocked** and does not move.\n   - The movable maroons are exactly those reachable from the magnet without crossing a `6`.\n\n   In the examples:\n   - Example 3 has no `6`s, so all `9`s can reach the magnet \u2192 all 4 move.\n   - Example 1: only the two bottom maroons are in the same reachable pocket as the magnet \u2192 2 move.\n   - Example 2: the cross of `6`s splits off a batch of maroons near the top; 9 maroons remain in the same component as the magnet \u2192 9 move.\n\n   The **total number of moving maroons** `m` equals the number of reachable `9` cells.\n\n3. **Move (reassign) the moving maroons into the 3\u00d73 magnet**\n   - The magnet has 9 cells. We \u201cfill\u201d it with the `m` moving maroons in a fixed order:\n     - Order of cells inside the 3\u00d73 (row-major, top-left first):\n\n       1. (top row) left, middle, right\n       2. (middle row) left, center, right\n       3. (bottom row) left, middle, right\n\n       In coordinates relative to the grid this is:\n       ```\n       (r-1,c-1), (r-1,c), (r-1,c+1),\n       (r,  c-1), (r,  c), (r,  c+1),\n       (r+1,c-1), (r+1,c), (r+1,c+1)\n       ```\n       where `(r,c)` is the center cell (the `2`).\n\n   - For the first `m` cells in that order, overwrite whatever is there (3 or 2) with `9`.\n   - If `m < 9`, only a prefix of that order is turned into `9`s; the rest of the magnet stays as in the input.\n   - If `m \u2265 9`, the entire 3\u00d73 block becomes `9`s.\n\n   You can see this in the examples:\n   - Example 1: `m = 2` \u2192 only the top-left 2 cells of the 3\u00d73 (r5c5, r5c6) become `9`.\n   - Example 3: `m = 4` \u2192 (r5c5, r5c6, r5c7, r6c5) become `9`.\n   - Example 2: `m = 9` \u2192 the whole 3\u00d73 becomes `9`.\n\n4. **Erase the moved maroons from their original locations**\n   - Every `9` that we counted as reachable/moving disappears from its original position.\n   - In the examples, all those start cells become `7` in the output.\n   - Maroons that are in a different connectivity component (blocked by `6` walls) remain where they are.\n\n5. **All non-9, non-magnet parts of the grid otherwise stay unchanged.**\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Find which 9s are reachable (not blocked by 6-walls)\n\nAll maroons (`9`) in the grid:\n\n- Row 1: (1,3), (1,9)\n- Row 3: (3,1), (3,3), (3,9)\n- Row 4: (4,11)\n- Row 6: (6,11)\n- Row 8: (8,11)\n- Row 9: (9,3), (9,6), (9,9)\n\nWe now look at the walls:\n\n- Row 2 is entirely `6`s \u2192 a **solid horizontal wall**.\n- Column 10 is entirely `6`s \u2192 a **solid vertical wall**.\n- Column 2 is `6` from row 1 to row 10 (only row 11 has non-6 in col 2), giving nearly a full vertical wall.\n\nBecause row 2 is all `6`, anything in **row 1** (above that solid wall) is in a separate component from the magnet; there is no way to reach the magnet (rows 5\u20137) without crossing row 2. Thus:\n\n- `(1,3)` and `(1,9)` are **blocked** by the row-2 wall and do not move.\n\nAll the other 9s (rows \u2265 3 and not on col 10) are in the same passable region as the magnet when you treat `6` as walls and walk through `7/3/2/9`. They are reachable and thus **will move**.\n\nSo:\n\n- **Unreachable and static**: (1,3), (1,9)  \u2192 stay as `9`.\n- **Reachable and moving**:  \n  (3,1), (3,3), (3,9), (4,11), (6,11), (8,11), (9,3), (9,6), (9,9)\n\nThere are 9 moving maroons, `m = 9`.\n\n### 2.3. Fill the magnet with the 9 moving maroons\n\nThe 3\u00d73 magnet has 9 cells, and `m = 9`, so it becomes **entirely filled with 9s**.\n\nRow-major order for the magnet cells:\n\n1. (5,5)\n2. (5,6)\n3. (5,7)\n4. (6,5)\n5. (6,6)\n6. (6,7)\n7. (7,5)\n8. (7,6)\n9. (7,7)\n\nSince we have exactly 9 moving maroons, all these cells are set to `9`.\n\nOriginal magnet:\n\n- Row 5: `..., 3,3,3, ...`\n- Row 6: `..., 3,2,3, ...`\n- Row 7: `..., 3,3,3, ...`\n\nAfter filling:\n\n- Row 5: `..., 9,9,9, ...`\n- Row 6: `..., 9,9,9, ...`\n- Row 7: `..., 9,9,9, ...`\n\n### 2.4. Erase the moved maroons from their start positions\n\nEvery **moving** `9` is replaced by background `7` at its original location:\n\n- (3,1): 9 \u2192 7\n- (3,3): 9 \u2192 7\n- (3,9): 9 \u2192 7\n- (4,11): 9 \u2192 7\n- (6,11): 9 \u2192 7\n- (8,11): 9 \u2192 7\n- (9,3): 9 \u2192 7\n- (9,6): 9 \u2192 7\n- (9,9): 9 \u2192 7\n\nThe two **blocked** maroons in row 1 remain as `9`.\n\nEverything else stays the same.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

Some `9`\u2011cells elsewhere in the grid are turned into `7` (erased).\n     2. Some of the `3` (and sometimes the `2`) inside the central \\(3 \\times 3\\) are turned into `9`.\n\n   So the transformation is: **take some of the external 9\u2019s and move them into the central \\(3 \\times 3\\)**, in a fixed order, conserving the total number of `9` cells.\n\n3. **Which 9\u2019s are donors?**\n\n   A simple way to describe the donor set that fits Example 1 and Example 3 and is plausible for the test:\n\n   - Treat colour `6` as walls.\n   - All other colours (`0\u20135,7\u20139` here: `7,3,2,9`) are traversable.\n   - Starting from the central `2`, perform a flood\u2011fill over non\u2011`6` cells and obtain its connected region \\(R\\).\n   - **Donor 9\u2019s are the `9` cells that lie inside \\(R\\)** (i.e. in the same open region as the `2`, not separated by `6` walls).\n   - Remove each donor by painting it `7`.\n   - Let \\(K\\) be the number of donor 9\u2019s.\n\n4. **Where are the new 9\u2019s placed?**\n\n   Inside the fixed central \\(3\\times 3\\) pattern, we use a deterministic order:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{(row 5, col 5)},\\ \n   (5,6),\\ \n   (5,7),\\ \n   (6,5),\\ \n   (6,6),\\ \n   (6,7),\\ \n   (7,5),\\ \n   (7,6),\\ \n   (7,7)\n   \\]\n\n   i.e. **row\u2011major from the top\u2011left of the \\(3\\times 3\\)**.\n\n   For the first \\(K\\) positions in that sequence we paint them `9`.

The unique `2` marks the center of the 3\u00d73 block of `3`s; those nine cells form the target cluster.\n\nI first found the connected component of open (non\u20116) cells that contains the `2` using 8\u2011neighbour connectivity. Only `9`s in this component can be moved. The number to move is the minimum of the number of accessible `9`s and the cluster capacity (nine cells).\n\nTo choose which accessible `9`s to move, I scanned the grid from the bottom row up to the first row that contains a `6`, left\u2011to\u2011right within each row, selecting accessible `9`s until the required count was reached. Since the first row already contains `6`, this pass covered all rows; no second pass was needed. The selected `9`s are set to `7`.\n\nFinally, I filled the cluster cells in row\u2011major order with `9` for as many as were moved; the remaining cluster cells stayed unchanged.\n\nApplying this to the test grid, six `9`s at positions (9,3),(9,6),(9,9),(3,1),(3,3),(3,9) are moved into the first six cluster cells, and the output grid becomes:\n\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"B\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_12_step_5_gemini_gen_sol\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Finalized Strategy for ARC Task: \"Pattern Filling\"**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to figure out this pattern-filling puzzle. I've broken it down step-by-step, using the examples and test case. Here's the plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the \"Core\"**: This is usually a 3x3 block in the middle, often with a \"2\" in the center. In the examples, I see the core centered at R4-R6, C4-C6.\n\n2.  **Find Connected \"9\" Pixels**: This is the heart of the algorithm. I need to count the number of \"9\" pixels that are *connected* to the core. A pixel is connected if there is a path of adjacent pixels (horizontally or vertically) made up of only background color (\"7\"), the \"9\" pixels themselves, or the core numbers (3,2). Important to note that the frame color \"6\" forms walls, blocking connection.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Fill Count**: The number of connected \"9\"s determines how many pixels within the core will be replaced with \"9\". Crucially, the maximum count seems to be capped at 9.\n\n4.  **Fill the Core**: The core is filled in a *specific* order: Top row (left to right), Middle row (left to right), Bottom row. The filling uses this specific count. The original numbers of the core get overwritten.\n\n**Detailed Breakdown of the process:**\n\n1.  **Example Analysis:**\n    *   I carefully examine the examples. In each one, I trace paths from the core to find connected \"9\" pixels.\n    *   Walls (defined by color 6) are crucial, as they can block connection and, thus, limit the count of \"9\".\n    *   Ex 1: 2, 2.\n    *   Ex 2: 8, 8 and, finally, I got 9 from a re-reading.\n    *   Ex 3: 4, 4.\n2.  **The \"Connected Pixel\" Logic:**\n    *   The algorithm identifies \"rooms\" that form separate components on the grid.\n    *   A pixel is part of the count if there is an unbroken connection to the core through \"7\"s and \"9\"s. A wall made of \"6\" blocks that path.\n\n3.  **The Center \"2\"**:  The number of \"2\" at the center stays during the whole filling process.\n\n4.  **Test the Input**\n    *   I carefully analyze and build the logic from the given input.\n    *   I see the frame as the border.\n\n**Putting It All Together**\n\nThis procedure is what I'll apply to each input grid. First, I identify the core and the \"connected 9\"s using my path-finding and wall analysis techniques. Then I calculate the \"fill count\" and replace parts of the core based on the filling strategy.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to simulate a specific transformation process on a grid of colored pixels. Based on the provided examples, here is the derived logic:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core:** Locate the 3x3 pattern consisting of color `3` (green) pixels surrounding a central color `2` (red) pixel. In the test input, this core is located at Rows 4-6 and Columns 4-6.\n\n2.  **Identify Connected Noise:** Identify all pixels of color `9` (maroon) that are topologically connected to the Core. Connectivity is defined by a path of non-blocking pixels (typically background `7`, core `3`/`2`, or other `9`s). Pixels of color `6` (magenta) act as walls/barriers. The count is limited to a maximum of 9.\n\n    *   **Connectivity Analysis for Test Input:**\n        *   The core is inside an inner room (Rows 3-7, Cols 3-7), with gaps in the walls at `R5C3` and `R5C7`.\n        *   These gaps lead to the outer region within the main frame (Rows 2-8, Cols 2-8).\n        *   From this outer region, we can reach `R9C8` (a gap in the bottom frame).\n        *   This gap leads to Row 10 (bottom edge), which is open (all `7`s).\n        *   Row 10 allows travel to Column 0.\n        *   **Connected `9`s found:**\n            1.  `R2C2`: Accessible from the inner region.\n            2.  `R2C8`: Accessible from the inner region.\n            3.  `R8C2`: Accessible from the inner region.\n            4.  `R8C5`: Accessible from the inner region (via R8).\n            5.  `R8C8`: Accessible from the inner region (via R8).\n            6.  `R2C0`: Accessible via the path exiting at `R9C8`, traversing `R10` to `C0`, and moving up.\n        *   **Isolated `9`s (Not Counted):**\n            *   `R0C2`, `R0C8`: Blocked by the solid wall at Row 1.\n            *   `R3C10`, `R5C10`, `R7C10`: Blocked by the solid vertical wall at Column 9.\n\n    *   **Total Count:** 6 pixels.\n\n3.  **Remove Source Pixels:** Change the identified connected `9`s to the background color `7`.\n    *   `R2C2`, `R2C8` become `7`.\n    *   `R8C2`, `R8C5`, `R8C8` become `7`.\n    *   `R2C0` becomes `7`.\n\n4.  **Fill the Core:** Fill the 3x3 Core with `9`s corresponding to the count, in row-major order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom).\n    *   Count is 6.\n    *   Fill the first 6 positions of the 3x3 grid (Rows 4 and 5).\n    *   `R4C4`, `R4C5`, `R4C6` become `9`.\n    *   `R5C4`, `R5C5` (center), `R5C6` become `9`.\n    *   The remaining pixels (`R6C4`, `R6C5`, `R6C6`) remain `3`.\n\n**Final Grid Construction:**\nStart with the input grid and apply the changes.\n\n*   **Row 0:** `6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6` (Unchanged)\n*   **Row 1:** `6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6` (Unchanged)\n*   **Row 2:** `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7` (`9`s at C0, C2, C8 -> `7`)\n*   **Row 3:** `7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9` (Unchanged)\n*   **Row 4:** `7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7` (Core top row -> `9,9,9`)\n*   **Row 5:** `7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9` (Core mid row -> `9,9,9`)\n*   **Row 6:** `7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7` (Core bot row -> Unchanged `3,3,3`)\n*   **Row 7:** `7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9` (Unchanged)\n*   **Row 8:** `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7` (`9`s at C2, C5, C8 -> `7`)\n*   **Row 9:** `7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6` (Unchanged)\n*   **Row 10:** `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6` (Unchanged)\n\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"C\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_12_step_5_gemini_gen_sol\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at this problem, I need to:\n1.

What the task is doing\n\nAcross the three examples, there is always:\n\n- A **3\u00d73 \u201ccore\u201d** made of colors `3` and `2`:\n  - pattern:  \n    ```\n    3 3 3\n    3 2 3\n    3 3 3\n    ```\n- Many pixels of color **`9`** scattered around.\n- Color **`6`** acts as **walls/barriers**.\n- Color **`7`** (and `9`) act as **open space / walkable** cells.\n\nThe transformation:\n\n1. **Find all `9` pixels that are connected to the core via a path through only `7` or `9`, with `6` blocking movement.**  \n   - Movement is 4-connected (up, down, left, right).\n   - The path may not step on `3` or `2`; they are part of the core, not part of the walkable graph.\n   - Practically:  \n     - Take all `7`/`9` cells that touch the core (the \u201cdoor\u201d cells around the 3\u00d73 block).  \n     - Run a flood fill (BFS/DFS) from these door cells through cells that are either `7` or `9`, with `6` (and also `3`/`2`) treated as walls.  \n     - Collect every `9` that lies in this reachable region.\n2. Let the number of such reachable `9`s be `N`. If `N > 9`, cap it to `9`.\n3. **Turn those `N` source `9` pixels into `7`.**\n4. **In the core\u2019s 3\u00d73 block, overwrite the first `N` cells (in row-major order: top-left to bottom-right) with `9`.**  \n   - Remaining core cells (if `N < 9`) keep their original values (3 or 2).\n   - If `N \u2265 9`, the entire 3\u00d73 becomes `9`.\n\nYou can verify this on the examples:\n\n- Example 1: Only 2 `9`s are reachable from the core through `7`/`9` without crossing `6`, so 2 `9`s are removed from outside and the first two cells of the core (top row, first two) become `9`.\n- Example 2: Many `9`s are reachable; more than 9, so only the 9 closest in BFS order are used. The core becomes fully 9s.\n- Example 3: 4 `9`s in the grid, all reachable and there are no `6` walls. All 4 are removed from outside, and the first four core cells become `9`.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Apply the rule to the test input\n\n### 2.1. Identify the core\n\nCore is the 3\u00d73 block of `3`s and `2`:\n\nRows 5\u20137, columns 5\u20137 in the test:\n\n```\nrow5 col5\u20137: 3 3 3\nrow6 col5\u20137: 3 2 3\nrow7 col5\u20137: 3 3 3\n```\n\nSo the core coordinates are:\n\n- (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)\n- (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)\n- (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)\n\n### 2.2. Find \u201cdoor\u201d cells and the walkable graph\n\nWalkable colors: `7` and `9`.  \nWalls: `6`, `3`, `2`.\n\nWe look at cells adjacent (4-neighbors) to the core that are `7` or `9`. Those are the door cells:\n\n- Above the core: row 4, cols 5\u20137 \u2192 values: `6,7,6` \u2192 door at (4,6).\n- Below the core: row 8, cols 5\u20137 \u2192 `6,7,6` \u2192 door at (8,6).\n- Left of the core: col 4, rows 5\u20137 \u2192 values `6,7,6` \u2192 door at (6,4).\n- Right of the core: col 8, rows 5\u20137 \u2192 `6,7,6` \u2192 door at (6,8).\n\nSo door set D = { (4,6), (6,4), (6,8), (8,6) }.\n\nNow perform a flood fill from D through cells whose color is `7` or `9`, treating all `6`, `3`, `2` as walls, to find all reachable `9`s.\n\n### 2.3. List `9` pixels in the grid\n\nPositions of `9` in the test input:\n\n- Row 1: (1,3), (1,9)\n- Row 3: (3,1), (3,3), (3,9)\n- Row 4: (4,11)\n- Row 6: (6,11)\n- Row 8: (8,11)\n- Row 9: (9,3), (9,6), (9,9)\n\nTotal: 11 pixels of color 9.\n\nBecause row 2 is all `6`, row 1 is isolated above a solid wall; so (1,3) and (1,9) are **not** connected to the core region.\n\nAlso, column 10 from rows 3\u201311 is all `6`, so column 11\u2019s walkable cells (rows 3\u20139) form a separate component that is **not** connected to the doors; thus (4,11), (6,11), (8,11) are also disconnected from the door component.\n\nRunning the flood fill from D through `7`/`9` in rows 3\u201311, you get that the reachable `9` pixels are exactly:\n\n- (3,1)\n- (3,3)\n- (3,9)\n- (9,3)\n- (9,6)\n- (9,9)\n\nThese 6 are in the same connected component as the doors. The 5 others:\n\n- (1,3), (1,9), (4,11), (6,11), (8,11)\n\nare in different components, hence not \u201cconnected to the core\u201d under the rule.\n\nSo `N = 6` reachable `9`s (and N \u2264 9, so no capping needed).\n\n### 2.4. Modify the outer `9` pixels\n\nTurn these 6 reachable `9` cells into `7`:\n\n- (3,1): 9 \u2192 7\n- (3,3): 9 \u2192 7\n- (3,9): 9 \u2192 7\n- (9,3): 9 \u2192 7\n- (9,6): 9 \u2192 7\n- (9,9): 9 \u2192 7\n\nAll other `9`s remain as they are.\n\n### 2.5. Fill the core with `9`s in row-major order\n\nRow-major order of the core cells:\n\n1. (5,5)\n2. (5,6)\n3. (5,7)\n4. (6,5)\n5. (6,6)\n6. (6,7)\n7. (7,5)\n8. (7,6)\n9. (7,7)\n\nWe have N = 6 reachable 9s, so we overwrite the first 6 core cells with `9`:\n\n- (5,5): 3 \u2192 9\n- (5,6): 3 \u2192 9\n- (5,7): 3 \u2192 9\n- (6,5): 3 \u2192 9\n- (6,6): 2 \u2192 9\n- (6,7): 3 \u2192 9\n\nThe remaining core cells stay as they were:\n\n- (7,5), (7,6), (7,7) remain `3`.\n\nSo the core becomes:\n\n```\nrow5 col5\u20137: 9 9 9\nrow6 col5\u20137: 9 9 9\nrow7 col5\u20137: 3 3 3\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3.

The user's prompt is a bit contradictory, but I'll make the call to provide the explanation *before* the grid, as the final instruction seems more direct. Now, I have to figure out this ARC task. Let's get to it.\n\nThe task appears to involve moving some \"9s\" into a 3x3 box (containing 3s and a center 2). I need to discern the rules behind which 9s are moved.\n\nFirst, I went through the examples one-by-one, trying to understand what's happening. I quickly noticed that there are \"noise\" 9s scattered in the input and that the output changes these to \"7s\", and sometimes put 9s inside the 3x3 box. I went through and tried to note all of the coordinate details of the 9s.\n\nIn example 1, I noted how some 9s outside the box become 7s, and some of the positions inside became 9s. I tried to determine where the new 9s came from. But the specific coordinates weren't clear yet. In example 2, I examined how the 9s had moved into the box. All 9s that were \"scattered\" seemed to be moved. In example 3, it was a similar story, but without the \"6\" walls of the other examples. This made things even more complicated.\n\nInitially, I thought some were kept. There must be a reason. Then, I considered \"Connectedness\". But why were things at the top kept, and things at the bottom moved? And the shapes. It made no sense yet. I tried to figure out a rule based on what was *not* changed. I focused on \"9s\", \"7s\", and \"6s\".\n\nI hypothesized that some might be protected by \"6s\". I called these the \"6\" walls. At first, it seemed like the \"6s\" acted as walls. I also hypothesized that perhaps all 9s within \"6s\" were removed. But these didn't always work. But it didn't seem to work. Some were removed, some not. I tried to figure out what was \"inside\" the 6 structure.\n\nNext, I thought of a \"Flood Fill\". I imagined 9s being pulled to the box. I tested this with the examples. The box seemed connected. It was blocked, and unblocked. If I could get to the 9 through \"7s\", I'd get it. If not, I wouldn't. This was the key.\n\nThis changed when example 3, without \"6s\", was present. Everything changed if there weren't \"6s\". This made the flood-fill hypothesis even more important. All 9s would move if there were no \"6s\" present. If there were \"6s\", then *some* 9s moved. I realized the \"6s\" were barriers.\n\nMy new hypothesis: \"6s block 9s from moving.\" I started to classify the 9s based on where they were: Above, Below, Outside. This didn't seem to work, though. Finally, I tested if 9s could block.\n\nI started to check if the path could pass over the 9s. This meant if 9s acted like walls. And that's when it hit me. Only reachable 9s are moved. This means there's a flood. The path can only have \"7s\". And some 9s might be blocked.\n\nTo find the correct path, I must imagine a flood that goes through \"7s\" and moves, if possible, over the \"9s\" to reach the 3-box. This finally clicked with the examples, and I felt I understood the logic! \n\nTo solve this problem, I will:\n\n1.  Flood from the box through 7s.\n2.  If the 9 is met, take it!\n3.  Once the box is at capacity, stop taking 9s.\n\nNow, with the new Test Input, I went through the 9s carefully. I found 6. I'm going to set these to \"7\" and put 9s in the target box.\n\n\nThe puzzle asks us to identify a transformation rule based on three examples and apply it to a test input. The grids contain integer values representing colors.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Object Decomposition**:\n    *   **The Container**: In all examples and the test input, there is a distinct 3x3 structure composed of `3`s (Green) with a `2` (Red) in the center. In the Test Input, this is located at Rows 4-6, Columns 4-6.\n    *   **The Candidate Objects**: There are scattered `9`s (Maroon) throughout the grid.\n    *   **The Network**: There are `6`s (Magenta) forming walls, loops, or rail-like structures. These act as barriers.\n    *   **The Background**: The background is `7` (Orange).\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule**:\n    *   **Reachability**: The core logic is a flood-fill or pathfinding operation starting from the \"Container\" (the 3x3 box). The `6`s act as solid walls. The flood can pass through `7`s (background) and `9`s (candidates).\n    *   **Collection**: Any `9` (Maroon) that is *reachable* from the Container via a path of non-`6` cells is identified for movement.\n    *   **Transportation**: The reachable `9`s are \"moved\" into the Container.\n        *   The original location of the reachable `9` becomes `7` (background).\n        *   The Container fills up with `9`s starting from the top-left cell (0,0) of the 3x3 box, proceeding row by row (reading order).\n        *   The filling overwrites the existing `3`s and the central `2`.\n    *   **Capacity**: The Container has a capacity of 9 cells. In Example 2, the number of reachable `9`s exceeded the capacity (or filled it exactly), and the closest ones were prioritized. In the Test Input, the number of reachable `9`s is less than the capacity.\n    *   **Unreachable Objects**: `9`s that are completely walled off by `6`s (relative to the Container) remain in their original positions.\n\n3.  **Application to Test Input**:\n    *   **Container Location**: Rows 4-6, Columns 4-6. Center at (5,5).\n    *   **Walls (6s)**:\n        *   Column 1 is a solid wall of `6`s from Row 0 to Row 9. (Row 10 is `7`, creating an opening at the bottom left).\n        *   Column 9 is a solid wall of `6`s (or backed by `6`s) effectively blocking the right side.\n        *   Row 1 is a solid wall of `6`s.\n    *   **Openings**:\n        *   The Container is open to the \"Inside Arena\" (Rows 2-8, Cols 2-8) via gaps in the surrounding `6`s at (5,3) and (5,7).\n        *   The \"Inside Arena\" connects to the \"Outside\" bottom strip (Row 10) via a gap at (9,8).\n        *   The bottom strip (Row 10) connects to the left strip (Column 0) via the gap at (10,1).\n    *   **Reachable 9s**:\n        *   **Inside Arena**: (2,2), (2,8), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8). These are directly connected to the box. (5 total).\n        *   **Left Strip**: (2,0). This is reachable via the path: Box -> Inside -> Bottom Gap (9,8) -> Bottom Row (10) -> Bottom Left Gap (10,1) -> Up Column 0 -> (2,0). (1 total).\n        *   **Blocked 9s**:\n            *   (0,2), (0,8): Blocked by the solid wall at Row 1.\n            *   (3,10), (5,10), (7,10): Blocked by the solid wall at Column 9.\n    *   **Execution**:\n        *   Total reachable `9`s = 6.\n        *   Remove these 6 `9`s from the grid (change to `7`).\n        *   Fill the first 6 cells of the Container with `9`s.\n            *   Container Row 0 (Grid Row 4): All 3 cells become `9`.\n            *   Container Row 1 (Grid Row 5): All 3 cells become `9`.\n            *   Container Row 2 (Grid Row 6): Remains unchanged (original `3`s).\n\n**Test Input Grid Generation:**\n*   Input `9`s at (2,0), (2,2), (2,8), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8) become `7`.\n*   Box cells at (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6) become `9`.\n\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"G\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_5_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nAlright, let's see. This ARC task seems to involve a collector, a kind of 3x3 block with a special center, that snatches up maroon (9) pixels from its surroundings and stuffs them into itself.  The background's usually orange (7) but it's not the crucial part. The 6's are clearly walls, and they define a space.\n\nAnalyzing the examples, it's pretty clear that if a 9 is blocked by a wall of 6's, it's safe.  The collector, a 3x3 block with a red dot (2) in the center and green (3) all around it, \"collects\" accessible 9s and replaces them with itself. Accessible means can be reached by a walk that follows 3 and 7 pixels. The center acts like a beacon for the collectable 9's, which are removed from the original place and transferred into the collector itself.\n\nSo, the game is to figure out if we can \"reach\" any maroon pixels from this 3x3 block, which is also called the \"basket\".  If they're trapped inside a 6 enclosure, they're not reachable. If not, they are added in the box itself. The number of accessible 9s determines how many cells in the basket are filled. The rule is that it starts filling the basket from the top left corner.\n\nNow, I'm given a new grid and I've to trace a path starting from the center of the 3x3 block (the 2) by following either 3s or 7s, avoiding 6s. If I find a 9 along the way, I add that 9 to the basket. If K is less than 9, that's easy! Put those k 9's into the basket. If it's more, fill it up completely. If, for instance, there's a 9 that's cut off from the collector by a wall of 6s, that's like a lost gem - it's left as it is. After determining how many 9s, the output grid is updated.\n\nSeems like a straightforward pathfinding and set-filling problem once the core mechanic is understood. Let's start with a test input. I can visualize the walls and the paths, trace it, and replace the reachable 9s, then update the basket accordingly. I need to make sure I don't get tricked by any hidden walls.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid based on logic inferred from three examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Objects:**\n    *   **Basket:** A 3x3 region defined by a border of green (3) pixels and a red (2) pixel in the center. In the examples, this basket serves as a collection point.\n    *   **Targets:** Maroon (9) pixels scattered throughout the grid.\n    *   **Walls:** Magenta (6) pixels act as barriers.\n    *   **Agent/Reachability:** The red pixel (2) inside the basket acts as the \"agent\". The transformation depends on which Target pixels (9s) are *reachable* from the agent using orthogonal movement (up, down, left, right) through empty space (color 7) or other traversable pixels (3s, 2s, 9s), but **not** through walls (6s).\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Pathfinding):** Perform a flood-fill or pathfinding operation starting from the center of the basket (the 2). Determine the connected component of traversable cells. Walls (6s) block movement.\n    *   **Step 2 (Collection):** Identify all Target pixels (9s) that fall within this connected component. These are the \"collected\" items.\n    *   **Step 3 (Removal):** In the output grid, replace the collected 9s with the background color (7). 9s that are *not* reachable (blocked by walls) remain in their original positions.\n    *   **Step 4 (Deposit):** Count the number of collected 9s ($K$). Fill the 3x3 basket with $K$ maroon (9) pixels. The filling order is reading order (row by row, from top-left to bottom-right):\n        *   $(r_{top}, c_{left})$\n        *   $(r_{top}, c_{mid})$\n        *   $(r_{top}, c_{right})$\n        *   $(r_{mid}, c_{left})$\n        *   ...and so on.\n    *   Any cells in the basket that are not filled with 9s retain their original color (3 or 2).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Basket:** The basket is the 3x3 block at Rows 4-6, Columns 4-6. The center is at `(5, 5)`.\n    *   Row 4: `...3,3,3...`\n    *   Row 5: `...3,2,3...`\n    *   Row 6: `...3,3,3...`\n\n2.  **Pathfinding & Reachability:**\n    *   We start at `(5, 5)`.\n    *   **Walls:** Row 1 is a solid line of 6s, making Row 0 completely unreachable. Columns 1 and 9 are largely walls, but there are critical openings.\n    *   **Openings:**\n        *   Row 9 has a gap at Column 8 (`(9, 8)` is 7). This allows passage from the central region to the bottom row (Row 10).\n        *   Row 9 also has a gap at Column 0 (`(9, 0)` is 7).\n        *   Row 10 (bottom row) is entirely clear (7s) from Column 0 to Column 8.\n    *   **Tracing Connectivity:**\n        *   The central area (containing the basket) connects to the right side of Row 8.\n        *   From Row 8, we can pass through the gap at `(9, 8)` to reach Row 10.\n        *   From Row 10, we can traverse left to Column 0.\n        *   From Column 0 (Row 10), we can move up the leftmost strip (Column 0).\n        *   The rightmost strip (Column 10) is blocked by a solid wall at Column 9 and the wall at `(10, 9)`.\n\n3.  **Identify Collected Targets:**\n    *   **Reachable 9s:**\n        *   `(2, 2)`: Inside the main central region.\n        *   `(2, 8)`: Inside the main central region.\n        *   `(8, 2)`: Inside the main central region.\n        *   `(8, 5)`: Inside the main central region.\n        *   `(8, 8)`: Inside the main central region.\n        *   `(2, 0)`: Reachable via the long path (Center -> R9 gap -> R10 -> Col 0 -> Up).\n    *   **Unreachable 9s (Not Collected):**\n        *   `(0, 2)` and `(0, 8)`: Blocked by solid wall at Row 1.\n        *   `(3, 10)`, `(5, 10)`, `(7, 10)`: Blocked by wall at Column 9.\n\n    *   **Total Count ($K$):** 6.\n\n4.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   **Remove:** Replace the 6 reachable 9s at `(2,0), (2,2), (2,8), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8)` with 7.\n    *   **Fill Basket:** We have 6 items. The basket cells are filled in order:\n        1.  `(4, 4)` -> 9\n        2.  `(4, 5)` -> 9\n        3.  `(4, 6)` -> 9\n        4.  `(5, 4)` -> 9\n        5.  `(5, 5)` -> 9\n        6.  `(5, 6)` -> 9\n        *   The remaining cells `(6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)` remain 3.\n\n**Final Grid Generation:**\n*   Row 2 becomes: `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7`.\n*   Row 8 becomes: `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7`.\n*   Basket (Rows 4, 5, 6 cols 4, 5, 6):\n    *   Row 4: `9, 9, 9`\n    *   Row 5: `9, 9, 9`\n    *   Row 6: `3, 3, 3`\n\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"H\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_6_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation rule:\n\n1.

Interpreting the colors and the setup\n\nFrom the hints and the examples:\n\n- **Maroon = color 9** \u2192 these are the **mobile pixels**.\n- **Magenta = color 6** \u2192 these are the **rigid walls**.\n- **The central object** is always a **3\u00d73 block of 3\u2019s with a 2 at the center**. This is the **gravity well / target**.\n- **Background** is mostly 7.\n\nIn every example:\n\n- Some 9\u2019s disappear from where they were and reappear **inside the 3\u00d73 central object**, turning some of the 3\u2019s (and sometimes the central 2) into 9\u2019s.\n- The total **count of 9\u2019s is preserved**.\n- The 6\u2019s never move or change.\n- The 7\u2019s only change where a 9 leaves or where a 9 appears.\n\nSo the transformation is:\n\n1. Decide **which 9\u2019s are \u201cattracted\u201d** into the central well (others stay put).\n2. Those attracted 9\u2019s are all **collected and placed inside the 3\u00d73 object** in a fixed order.\n3. Their **original cells are turned to background (7)**.\n\nThe key is how many 9\u2019s get attracted and how they are laid out inside the 3\u00d73.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How many 9\u2019s are sucked into the well?\n\nThe walls (6\u2019s) carve the board into \u201cbasins\u201d. For a given puzzle:\n\n- 9\u2019s that are in the **same basin** as the central 3\u00d73 (when you move through cells that are *not* 6) are **candidates** to be pulled in.\n- 9\u2019s that are **behind solid walls of 6\u2019s** and cannot reach the 3\u00d73 without crossing a 6 are **blocked** and stay where they are.\n\nIn the three training examples:\n\n- Example 3 has **no 6\u2019s**, so **all** 9\u2019s are in the same basin \u2192 all 4 move to the central area.\n- Example 1 has the 3\u00d73 surrounded by 6\u2019s with just a **single open \u201cdoor\u201d** below; only **two** 9\u2019s (the pair just below that door) are in the same basin as the center; the others are separated by 6 walls \u2192 N = 2.\n- Example 2\u2019s 6\u2011cross encloses the center with one open side; **exactly 9** of the 9\u2019s can reach that central basin without crossing a 6 \u2192 N = 9.\n\nThen:\n\n- Let **N = number of maroon 9\u2019s in the same 4\u2011connected region as the central 3\u00d73, when you treat 6 as walls**.\n- These N maroon pixels are \u201csucked in\u201d. Everywhere else, 9\u2019s are unchanged.\n\n---\n\n## 3. How the 9\u2019s fill the 3\u00d73 central object\n\nOnce you know N:\n\n- Take the 3\u00d73 central mask (rows r\u2080..r\u2080+2, cols c\u2080..c\u2080+2 where the 3\u2019s & the 2 are).\n- Visit its 9 cells **in reading order**: top row left\u2192right, then middle, then bottom.\n- Paint the **first N cells** of that 3\u00d73 **with color 9**.\n- Leave the remaining cells of that 3\u00d73 unchanged (still 3 or 2).\n\nThis pattern matches the examples:\n\n- Example 1: N = 2 \u2192 top row cells (1) and (2) become 9:  \n  3\u00d73 becomes  \n  `9 9 3`  \n  `3 2 3`  \n  `3 3 3`  \n  which is exactly the given output.\n- Example 3: N = 4 \u2192 cells (1\u20134) in reading order become 9:  \n  `9 9 9`  \n  `9 2 3`  \n  `3 3 3`  \n  matches the example.\n- Example 2: N \u2265 9 \u2192 all 9 cells become 9: full 3\u00d73 of 9\u2019s, as in the output.\n\nSeparately, for the N 9\u2019s that got sucked in, their original locations are turned to background 7.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Apply the rule to the test input\n\n### 4.1. Locate the central object\n\nThe central 3\u00d73 of 3\u2019s with a 2 in the middle is:\n\nRows 4\u20136, columns 4\u20136 (0\u2011based indexing):\n\n- Row 4: `...,6,3,3,3,6,...` \u2192 cells (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) are 3.\n- Row 5: `...,7,3,2,3,7,...` \u2192 cells (5,4), (5,5), (5,6) are 3,2,3.\n- Row 6: `...,6,3,3,3,6,...` \u2192 cells (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) are 3.\n\nSo the 3\u00d73 mask is:\n\n- (4,4) (4,5) (4,6)\n- (5,4) (5,5) (5,6)\n- (6,4) (6,5) (6,6)\n\n### 4.2. List all the 9\u2019s\n\nCoordinates (row, col):\n\n- Row 0: (0,2), (0,8)\n- Row 2: (2,0), (2,2), (2,8)\n- Row 3: (3,10)\n- Row 5: (5,10)\n- Row 7: (7,10)\n- Row 8: (8,2), (8,5), (8,8)\n\nTotal 11 maroon pixels.\n\n### 4.3. Find which 9\u2019s are in the same basin as the center\n\nTreat **6 as wall** and all other colors (7,3,2,9) as passable. Use 4\u2011connected adjacency (up/down/left/right).\n\nFrom the central 3\u00d73 we flood outwards:\n\n- Because of the big horizontal wall of 6\u2019s at row 1, the 9\u2019s on **row 0** \u2013 (0,2) and (0,8) \u2013 are **cut off**: you cannot get from the central region to row 0 without crossing row 1\u2019s 6\u2019s. So these two 9\u2019s are **blocked** and do not move.\n- The right edge has a vertical wall of 6\u2019s around column 9/10 that isolates the 9\u2019s at:\n  - (3,10), (5,10), (7,10)  \n    They have only neighbors that are 6 or out of bounds, except each other and some 7\u2019s behind the same wall; that pocket is sealed from the central basin by 6\u2019s. So these three are also **blocked**.\n- The remaining 9\u2019s:\n  - (2,0), (2,2), (2,8)\n  - (8,2), (8,5), (8,8)\n  are **reachable** from the central region via 4\u2011connected paths that do not go through any 6.\n\nThus the number of maroon pixels attracted into the well is:\n\n- **N = 6** (those six reachable 9\u2019s).\n\nThese are the ones whose original cells will be emptied (turned to 7) and whose mass will reappear in the 3\u00d73.\n\n### 4.4. Fill the central 3\u00d73 with N=6 maroon pixels\n\nThe 3\u00d73 cells in reading order:\n\n1. (4,4)\n2. (4,5)\n3. (4,6)\n4. (5,4)\n5. (5,5)\n6. (5,6)\n7. (6,4)\n8. (6,5)\n9. (6,6)\n\nWith N=6, we make cells 1\u20136 equal to 9 and leave cells 7\u20139 as they were:\n\n- (4,4) 3 \u2192 9\n- (4,5) 3 \u2192 9\n- (4,6) 3 \u2192 9\n- (5,4) 3 \u2192 9\n- (5,5) 2 \u2192 9\n- (5,6) 3 \u2192 9\n- (6,4) 3 \u2192 3 (unchanged)\n- (6,5) 3 \u2192 3\n- (6,6) 3 \u2192 3\n\nSo the central block becomes:\n\nRow 4 cols 4\u20136: `9,9,9`  \nRow 5 cols 4\u20136: `9,9,9`  \nRow 6 cols 4\u20136: `3,3,3`  (unchanged).\n\n### 4.5. Remove the six moved maroon pixels from their original positions\n\nThe six reachable maroon coordinates:\n\n- (2,0), (2,2), (2,8), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8)\n\nEach of these becomes 7.\n\nUpdate affected rows:\n\n- Row 2 original: `9,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,7`  \n  After clearing (2,0), (2,2), (2,8):  \n  \u2192 `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7`\n\n- Row 8 original: `7,6,9,7,7,9,7,7,9,6,7`  \n  After clearing (8,2), (8,5), (8,8):  \n  \u2192 `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7`\n\nAll other rows\u2019 9\u2019s were blocked and remain unchanged.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Final output grid\n\nPutting it all together, the output grid is:\n\nRow 0: `6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6`  \nRow 1: `6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6`  \nRow 2: `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7`  \nRow 3: `7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9`  \nRow 4: `7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7`  \nRow 5: `7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9`  \nRow 6: `7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7`  \nRow 7: `7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9`  \nRow 8: `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7`  \nRow 9: `7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6`  \nRow10: `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6`\n\nSo the completed output grid is:\n\n```\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"L\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nTo solve this task I looked at the three worked examples and identified three key colours:\n\n- `6` is the magenta \u201cwall\u201d colour that is impassable.\n- `9` is the maroon \u201cmobile\u201d colour that gets attracted.\n- The small 3\u00d73 patch of `3`s with a single `2` in its centre is the \u201cmagnet\u201d object.\n\nIn all examples the transformation conserves the number of `9`s, but some `9`s disappear from their original locations and reappear over the central object. The pattern of the re\u2011appearing `9`s is always the top\u2011left part of the 3\u00d73 magnet region in row\u2011major order, and the `2` is overwritten if enough `9`s are available. The positions that lose their `9` become background `7`.\n\nThe decisive factor is whether a `9` can reach the magnet without crossing a wall. The way to model that is to do a breadth\u2011first search (BFS) from all cells of the 3\u00d73 magnet region through all non\u2011`6` cells. Every time the BFS encounters a cell containing a `9` we add it to a list in order of increasing distance. At the end, we take as many of these reachable `9`s as there are cells in the magnet (at most 9). Those selected `9`s are removed from their original positions (set to `7`) and placed into the magnet cells in fixed row\u2011major order: (row\u202f5,col\u202f5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). Any remaining `9`s that are unreachable, or beyond the first nine, remain where they were.\n\nApplying this to the test grid:\n\n- Row\u202f2 is entirely walls, so the two `9`s in row\u202f1 are unreachable and stay put.\n- Column\u202f10 is entirely walls, so the `9`s in column\u202f11 form an isolated component and stay put.\n- The BFS from the magnet within the reachable component finds exactly six `9`s at positions (3,1),(3,3),(3,9),(9,3),(9,6),(9,9). These are removed.\n- The first six magnet cells in row\u2011major order are filled with `9`s; the last three remain as they were.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"M\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nTo solve this task I first identified the three relevant colours from the examples:\n\n- `6` is the \u201cmagenta\u201d wall and blocks movement.\n- The central 3\u00d73 object made of `3` with a `2` in the centre is the target.\n- `9` are the maroon mobile pixels.\n\nIn all examples the only changes are that some `9`s disappear from their original positions and re\u2011appear inside the 3\u00d73 target. The number inserted equals the number of \u201creachable\u201d `9`s, capped at the nine cells of the block, and they are written into the block in row\u2011major order (top row left to right, then next row, etc.). Any cells of the block not filled remain as they were. The moved `9`s\u2019 original cells are set back to the background colour `7`; unreachable `9`s stay where they were.\n\nTo determine reachability and closeness I perform a BFS starting from all cells of the target block through all non\u2011wall cells (any value other than `6`). This gives the shortest path length to the target for every cell; cells not reached are unreachable. If there are more reachable `9`s than the nine block cells, I would take the nearest ones by this distance, but in this test there are fewer than nine so all reachable `9`s move.\n\nApplying this to the test input, the row of `6`s on row\u00a02 isolates row\u00a01, and the solid column of `6`s at col\u00a010 isolates col\u00a011, so the reachable `9`s are at (3,1),(3,3),(3,9),(9,3),(9,6),(9,9); all six move. They fill the first six positions of the 3\u00d73 block, turning the centre `2` into `9` as well. The original positions of those six are set to `7`. All other cells remain unchanged.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"N\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_11_step_5_opus_gen_sol\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nTo solve the task, I first looked at the three solved examples to identify the rules. In each case the small \\(3\\times 3\\) block of colour\u202f3 with a 2 in the centre was the target of the change. Colour\u202f6 acts as a wall or frame: I treat all 6\u2011cells as obstacles that partition the grid. I find the connected component of non\u20116 cells that contains the core. Only 9s in this component are \u201cavailable\u201d to move; 9s in other components (for example, separated by a complete row or column of 6s) are left alone and act as fixed markers.\n\nFrom the available 9s, I count how many there are. If there is an unobstructed 9 in the same row or column as the core centre within this component, the centre cell is eligible to be filled; otherwise it stays 2. I lay out the potential fill positions of the core in row\u2011major order (top left across and then down), including the centre if it is eligible. I take as many positions from this list as there are available 9s, and set those core cells to 9. The original available 9s are consumed and turned into background 7; cells outside the core\u2019s component remain unchanged.\n\nIn the test grid, the row of all 6s at row\u202f2 and the full column of 6s at column\u202f10 split the grid into components. The core\u2019s component contains six 9s at (3,1), (3,3), (3,9), (9,3), (9,6) and (9,9). There is a clear 9 in the same column as the centre at (9,6), so the centre is included. Using the six available 9s, I fill the first six core positions in row\u2011major order, and turn those six original 9s into 7. The rest of the grid stays the same.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"O\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_7_step_5_image\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nThe grids all have a 3\u00d73 \u201cgreen\u201d patch (values\u202f3 with a 2 in the centre) surrounded by \u201cwalls\u201d of 6. The task is to take maroon pixels (9) that lie in the same open region as the green patch, where open cells are anything but 6, and move as many of them as possible into the green patch. You compute the size of the green patch (9 cells) and the set of 9s connected to it through non\u20116 cells. Let k be the minimum of these two counts. Remove those k maroons closest to the green region (in the examples this simply meant all connected maroons when there were fewer than nine, or the nine shortest\u2011path maroons when there were more), setting their old positions to background 7.

(Example 2 appears to introduce an additional complication I can't fully resolve, but it doesn\u2019t change what happens in the test configuration, which structurally matches examples 1 and 3.)\n\n## Observed structure\n\nIn all examples and the test:\n\n- The grid is 11\u00d711.\n- There is a central 3\u00d73 block of `(3,3,3; 3,2,3; 3,3,3)` at rows 4\u20136, cols 4\u20136 (0-based).\n- Color 7 is the background.\n- Color 6 makes a kind of frame or corridors around that central block (in examples 1, 2, and the test).\n- Color 9 appears scattered around and is the only color that changes aside from some of the 3s (and the central 2 in example 2).\n\nAcross examples:\n\n- Some 9s are turned into 7.\n- An equal number of cells inside the central 3\u00d73 block are turned from 3 to 9 (and sometimes also the 2 is turned to 9 when the whole block is filled).\n- So the total count of 9s is preserved, but 9s are \u201cmoved\u201d from outside into the central block.\n\nFor examples 1 and 3 there is a very simple pattern:\n\n- Identify a *particular band of rows* inside the big 6-frame where the 9s are the \u201csource\u201d:\n  - Example 1: inside the interior bounded by the 6 frame, the **lowest** row that still contains any 9s is row 8 (0-based). Those 9s at `(8,7)` and `(8,8)` are the only ones that move.\n  - Example 3: there is no 6 at all, so the entire grid is effectively \u201cinterior\u201d; **all** 9s are treated as source.\n- The number of source 9s, call it K, then determines how many cells inside the 3\u00d73 are turned to 9:\n  - The K cells of the 3\u00d73 are filled with 9s in **row-major order** from the top-left of the 3\u00d73:\n    - Cell order: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n  - The same K source 9 cells are turned into 7.\n- Example 3 (no 6): 4 source 9s \u2192 first 4 cells of the 3\u00d73 become 9.\n- Example 1 (strong 6-frame): 2 source 9s in the lowest interior row (row 8) \u2192 first 2 cells of the 3\u00d73 become 9.\n\nThe **test grid** has a strong 6-frame very similar in spirit to example 1: 6s on row 1 and row 9, and vertical 6-columns at col 1 and col 9, giving a large rectangular interior with the 3\u00d73 inside it. So I apply the \u201cframe-case\u201d logic analogous to example 1:\n\n1. **Define the interior** bounded by the 6-frame:\n\n   - The outer 6-frame is on rows 1 and 9 and columns 1 and 9.\n   - The interior (where we look for source 9s) is rows 2\u20138 and cols 2\u20138 (0-based).\n\n2. **Find the lowest interior row that contains any 9s**:\n\n   In the test input, interior rows 2\u20138, cols 2\u20138:\n\n   - Row 2: 9 at cols 2 and 8.\n   - Row 3: none in cols 2\u20138.\n   - Row 4: none.\n   - Row 5: none.\n   - Row 6: none.\n   - Row 7: none.\n   - Row 8: 9 at cols 2, 5, and 8.\n\n   The **lowest** interior row with 9s is row 8, and in that row the source 9s are at:\n\n   - (8,2), (8,5), (8,8)\n\n   So \\(K = 3\\) source 9s.\n\n3. **Move these K 9s into the central 3\u00d73**:\n\n   - Fill K=3 cells of the 3\u00d73 in row-major order with 9:\n\n     Central 3\u00d73 cells in order:\n     - 1st: (4,4)\n     - 2nd: (4,5)\n     - 3rd: (4,6)\n     - \u2026\n\n   - Turn those three cells from 3 to 9.\n\n4. **Erase the K source 9s**:\n\n   - Set (8,2), (8,5), (8,8) from 9 to 7.\n\n5.

It seems pretty straightforward on the surface, with these grids having a consistent structure: an orange background, a green-centered red 3x3 block (the \"Core\"), sometimes magenta \"Frames,\" and maroon \"Markers.\" My goal is to figure out the rules for the transformation.\n\nAfter looking at a few examples, a few key things stand out. The Core often gets changed. These scattered markers are also changed in the output. The Frame and background colors mostly stay put. But the 9's *inside* the 6-structure are key to this.\n\nI've laid out the rules that describe the transformations provided by the task:\n\n1.  **Core:** Defined as the central 3x3 green block with a red center.\n2.  **Aligned 9s:** If a marker (9) is directly above, below, to the left, or right of the Core's center, the whole Core becomes 9s.\n3.  **Diagonal 9s**: If a marker (9) is located *diagonally* to the Core, the Core is filled from the \"opposite corner\", as defined in the examples.\n4.  **No Frame:** If there's no surrounding frame, you count all the 9s in the entire grid and use them to change the Core cells in reading order (skipping the center).\n5.  **Removal:** Any 9s found inside the Frame (the enclosing 6-structure) are removed/changed to background color.\n6.  **Outside 9s:** Any markers that are located outside the defined 6-structure will remain.\n\nNow, I'm going to carefully analyze the provided examples, especially focusing on how the markers are positioned relative to the Core and Frame.\n\n**Example 1**\n\nIn Example 1, I see this complex structure, there are two 6-structures. There are some 9s scattered around, but the ones *inside* this \"lower\" structure seem to be crucial. In this example, just *two* 9s were *consumed* by the lower frame. Using the prompt's Rule 3,  I'm now counting the 9s that are found within the defined 6-structure.  The markers in this structure are SE, and following the prompt's Rule 3 - this means the first cells of the Core (NW) will change. The transformation does not involve the center.\n\n**Example 2**\n\nExample 2 is interesting because the whole core turned into 9s. Following the Alignment rule, since the 9s are *vertically* aligned with the core's center, the *entire* Core becomes 9s, including the center! This confirms that alignment trumps the more general \"partial fill\" rule. The aligned 9s are consumed/removed.\n\n**Example 3**\n\nThis one has *no* Frame. Here, I'm using the \"No Frame\" rule. It's simply a matter of counting all 9s in the grid, removing them, and then filling those many Core cells in reading order, *skipping the center*.\n\nI've now gotten a handle on the rules.\n\nBased on the example analysis I now have this workflow:\n\n1.  **Identify Frame**: Find the connected structure made of 6s that surrounds or is adjacent to the Core. The whole grid is treated as the Frame if no 6s are present.\n2.  **Identify Markers**: Find all the 9s *within* the \"inside\" area defined by the Frame (or the whole grid if no frame exists).\n3.  **Check Alignment**: Are any of these markers in the *same row or column* as the Core's center?\n    *   **Yes**: Core Transformation = **Full**: The *entire* Core becomes 9s.\n    *   **No**: Core Transformation = **Count**: Count the number of markers (9s) within the defined Frame structure (if any). Let *N* be this number. Change the first N cells of the Core in reading order, *skipping the center*, to 9s.\n4.  **Clean Up**: Change all markers identified as being *inside* the Frame (or whole grid in a no-frame situation) to the background color 7. Markers outside the Frame are left unchanged.\n\nI think I've got this. Let's see if this logic holds true.\n\nI have to carefully apply these rules to the *Test Input*.\n\n**Test Input**\n\nAnalyzing this input, I notice this one has a defined, closed-off Frame (the big box of 6s on the edges). Within this box, I find\n\nThe transformation logic is based on the interaction between a central \"core\" (3x3 block), a \"frame\" (magenta 6s), and \"markers\" (maroon 9s).\n\n**1. Identify Objects:**\n*   **Core**: A 3x3 block centered at `(5,5)` containing green (3) and a red center (2). In the input, it spans rows 4-6 and columns 4-6.\n*   **Frame**: A structure of magenta (6) cells enclosing a central region. In the test input, the outer boundary of the frame is defined by row 1 (top), row 9 (bottom), column 1 (left), and column 9 (right).\n*   **Markers (Inside)**: Maroon (9) cells located within the frame's boundaries. In the test input, the markers at `(2,2)`, `(2,8)`, `(8,2)`, `(8,5)`, and `(8,8)` are inside this frame.\n*   **Markers (Outside)**: Maroon (9) cells outside the frame (e.g., at row 0, column 0, column 10). These remain unchanged.\n\n**2. Determine Transformation Rule:**\n*   Check for **Alignment**: Are any *inside* markers in the same row or column as the Core's center `(5,5)`?\n    *   The marker at `(8,5)` is in column 5, which is aligned with the center `(5,5)`.\n*   **Rule Application**: According to the problem description, if aligned markers exist, the **entire core** is transformed into maroon 9s (including the center).\n    *   If there were no alignment, we would count the markers and fill the core partially. Here, alignment triggers the full fill.\n\n**3. Apply Transformation:**\n*   **Core**: Change cells `(4,4)` through `(6,6)` to 9s.\n*   **Inside Markers**: Remove all markers identified as being inside the frame (change them to background color 7).\n    *   ` (2,2) -> 7`\n    *   ` (2,8) -> 7`\n    *   ` (8,2) -> 7`\n    *   ` (8,5) -> 7`\n    *   ` (8,8) -> 7`\n*   **Outside Markers**: Preserve them as 9.\n*   **Background/Frame**: Preserve as 7/6.\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\n*   **Row 2**: Input `9,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,7` becomes `9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7` (Inside 9s at col 2 and 8 removed).\n*   **Row 4**: Input `...3,3,3...` (Core) becomes `...9,9,9...`.\n*   **Row 5**: Input `...3,2,3...` (Core) becomes `...9,9,9...`.\n*   **Row 6**: Input `...3,3,3...` (Core) becomes `...9,9,9...`.\n*   **Row 8**: Input `7,6,9,7,7,9,7,7,9,6,7` becomes `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7` (Inside 9s at col 2, 5, 8 removed).\n*   Other rows remain unchanged or only retain outside 9s.\n\noutput:\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n      7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n      7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"B\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_11_step_5_opus_gen_sol\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at this problem, I need to:\n1.

                "response": "**Candidate Evaluation for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got. I'm looking at a bunch of proposed solutions for this ARC problem where we're supposed to transform these grids with a central structure and scattered 9s.  The task is to move some of those 9s into the central 3x3 block, in a specific order, and also remove some of the original 9s.\n\nI'm starting with Candidate 0. The core idea is to find the reachable 9s (basically, can you get to them from the central block without hitting walls, which are the magenta 6s). It does a flood-fill to figure this out, which makes sense. Then, the candidate counts how many 9s are reachable ($N$) and fills the first $N$ spots of the 3x3 target in a reading order. The candidate also removes the original $N$ reachable 9s, turning them to 7s. Sounds reasonable, and the example audits seem to line up.\n\nI've tested the candidate with the test input, making sure to trace out the path the candidate is using and where 9s might be blocked. Specifically, I'm checking if the 9 at (2,0) is reachable. This took some effort. I had to look at each row and column and wall structures to verify the path.  It's clear, though, that Candidate 0's logic (N=5 reachable) is correct.\n\nNow, Candidate 1.  It seems to involve collecting 9s that are inside the 6-bounded region and put these 9s into the 3x3 block.  This part is simple. The issue arises with the center element. The candidate said it should \"skip\" the center element but the examples seem to contradict this behavior. The candidate's examples don't quite get to the details. The candidate did say skipping until needed. But, in the end, I'm going to consider it an overwrite. Based on Ex 2, the center element gets overwritten (when N >=9). I'm a bit concerned about Candidate 1, and so I have to score this one lower.\n\nCandidate 3 is a mess. It wants to do donor scanning but also doesn't consider the walls. The proposed approach removes the correct number of values but not the correct values.\n\nCandidate 4 is a bit chaotic; there are several answers associated with it. I'll need to figure out which answer to use as representative. The fundamental idea is to identify the connected component of non-6 cells that contain the \"2\" (the center). Move these 9s. Sounds good, but the analysis is where it gets crazy.  Many of its answers get the count wrong, which includes whether (2,0) is connected. This candidate has a lot of answers.  One specific answer (Answer F) that matched the same logic from candidate 0 is the best one.  I'll pick F because it is not self-contradictory.  However, this just makes candidate 4 identical to candidate 0. It's too bad candidate 4 has a lot of answers that contradict each other.\n\nCandidate 8 proposes using the \"lowest interior row\". But I don't see any logical reason why it should be this way. Test input, the (2,2) 9 is just as accessible as the (8,2) 9. It appears this rule is just for some edge cases.\n\nCandidate 11, it is speculating about \"alignment\" to explain the examples. Seems a bit arbitrary because simple count + flood fill works better.  I don't think \"alignment\" has anything to do with it and that's probably incorrect.\n\nI'm doing a quick double-check on N=5. If the count is wrong (N=6), then (2,0) is definitely included. However, (2,0) is blocked by the wall at column 1. Candidate 4 has a number of answers including this value or not. But only one gets the correct value. Only Candidate 0 includes N=5.\n\nI will confirm again, Ex 2 overwrites (5,5), while Ex 3 does not. This reconfirms Candidate 1 is \"wrong.\" Candidate 1 says skip center.\n\nBased on everything, here is the order I'm going to assign for candidates: Candidate 0. It's all clear and consistent. Then comes Candidate 4, but only if I pick the representative as the best. After that, I will place Candidate 1, then Candidate 11, and then finally 8. Candidate 3 is just a mess.\n\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 10.0,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"The rule (count reachable 9s using connectivity, fill 3x3 container in reading order overwriting contents) is fully consistent with all examples.
