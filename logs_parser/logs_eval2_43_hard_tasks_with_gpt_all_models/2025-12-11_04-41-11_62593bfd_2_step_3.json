        "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Solution for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of this ARC task. The user has given me an input grid, and I need to transform it into an output grid. I need to identify the pattern of the transformation and apply it to other inputs.\n\nFrom the start, the grid sizes are consistent, and black (0) seems to be the background color. I look at Example 1, breaking down the objects and their transformations from input to output:\n\n*   **Object Identification:** The first task is to spot the colored shapes on the black background. Each shape has unique pixels with associated color numbers (e.g., yellow = 4, red = 2).\n*   **Tracking Transformations:** I go through each color one by one, tracing them from their input locations to their output positions.\n    *   I see the yellow shapes in the top-left area are moved to the bottom-left area.\n    *   The red shapes move to the bottom-middle.\n    *   The blue objects move to the top-right.\n    *   And, finally, the green pieces go to the top-left.\n*   **Analyzing Transformations:** I look at *how* these shapes move. Are they rotated, reflected, stretched, or just translated? I see that each of them just moved vertically, keeping the x-coordinates consistent. This is a translation.\n*   **Finding the Rule:** To understand *why* they move, I try to understand if there is a sorting rule. I first consider the shapes' general locations (top, middle, bottom), but I can't quite get a pattern.\n*   **Hypothesis - Invert Positions:** Is it an \"invert vertical position\" operation? No.\n*   **Hypothesis - Pixel count or mass:** Does the number of pixels affect the movement? No, that is not consistent.\n*   **Hypothesis - Color sorting:** Is there a relationship between the colors and direction? Not consistent.\n*   **Hypothesis - Identify shapes to be up or down:** Can \"pointing\" shapes define the rule? I attempt to identify if the arrow points up or down, and in which direction the shapes move. This idea seems very promising.\n*   **Check Examples** Now, I move to Example 2 and try to apply this hypothesis.\n*   **Modified rule**: Symmetric object: Heavy side to wall. Asymmetric: Away from Heavy Side\n*   **Hypothesis - Heavy or Light Shapes:** I need to determine if a shape has a \"heavy\" or \"light\" side.\n    *   Symmetric shapes: their direction is determined by the heavier side (more mass, wider).\n    *   Asymmetric Shapes: They are not determined, I will explore the \"pointing\".\n*   **Looking at pointing direction:**  The shapes seem to point in a certain direction. I want to try to use the point of the arrow or the heavy part to understand the sorting.\n*   **Test Input** Finally, I use the rules that I found in the other examples and apply them.\n    *   I apply shape identification and transformation from examples.\n    *   I separate all of the shapes based on their \"heavy side.\"\n*   **Implementation** I have a plan for how to output these objects.\n    *   I need to implement parsing input and output for each object.\n    *   Identify the objects, locate their shape, and clear the space from the other objects.\n\nOkay, I'm confident I have a solid understanding of the patterns. This sounds like I have an excellent strategy to solve these kinds of tasks. I feel ready to implement my solution.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid by moving the colored objects.\nBased on the solved examples, the transformation rule involves moving each object vertically to either the top or bottom edge of the grid. The horizontal position (x-coordinates) of each object remains unchanged.\n\nThe decision to move an object **Up** (to the top edge) or **Down** (to the bottom edge) depends on the object's shape properties, specifically its **vertical symmetry** and \"heaviness\" (mass distribution).\n\n**Rules derived from Examples:**\n1.  **Symmetric Objects**:\n    *   If the object is **Top Heavy** (more pixels or wider at the top), it moves **Up**. (Example 1 Blue, Example 2 Green).\n    *   If the object is **Bottom Heavy** (more pixels or wider at the bottom), it moves **Down**. (Example 2 Blue, Example 2 Yellow).\n    *   If the object is **Balanced**, it moves **Up** (default). (Example 1 Green, Example 2 Red).\n    *   *Note*: Example 1 Red (moved Down) and Example 1 Yellow (moved Down) are the main outliers, possibly due to their specific \"hanging\" shapes or specific color overrides, but the majority rule for test shapes (which are clearly structured) seems to follow the Heavy Side -> Wall logic for symmetric shapes.\n\n2.  **Asymmetric Objects**:\n    *   Gamma-like shapes (L-shapes, corners) tend to move **Up**. (Example 2 Orange, Example 2 Maroon).\n    *   Example 1 Yellow (L-shape) moved Down, but it was much taller. The small Gamma shapes in the test input resemble the Example 2 cases.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\nThe background color is 9.\n\n*   **Object 1 (Green, Color 3):** Diamond shape at x=22-24. Symmetric and vertically balanced.\n    *   Action: Move **Up**.\n*   **Object 2 (Yellow, Color 4):** T-shape at x=15-17. Top bar width 3, stem width 1. Symmetric, **Top Heavy**.\n    *   Action: Move **Up**.\n*   **Object 3 (Blue, Color 1):** Cross/Sword shape at x=4-7. Crossbar (width 4) is high (row 6), stem is narrow. Symmetric, **Top Heavy**.\n    *   Action: Move **Up**.\n*   **Object 4 (Orange, Color 7):** Gamma shape at x=11-12. Top width 2, bottom width 1. Asymmetric, Top Heavy. Matches Example 2 Maroon.\n    *   Action: Move **Up**.\n*   **Object 5 (Magenta, Color 6):** Cross/Sword shape at x=21-24. Crossbar (width 4) is low (row 13), top stem is long. Symmetric, **Bottom Heavy**.\n    *   Action: Move **Down**.\n*   **Object 6 (Teal, Color 8):** Inverted Gamma shape at x=1-2. Top width 1, bottom width 2. Asymmetric, Bottom Heavy. Matches Example 2 Orange (conceptually similar small asymmetric block). Example 2 Orange moved Up. However, based on the strong \"Heavy side to wall\" correlation for clear shapes, and considering the \"Teal\" shape is bottom-heavy, does it go down?\n    *   Let's re-evaluate Ex 2 Orange. It was Bottom Heavy (`7` over `77`). It moved **Up**. This suggests small asymmetric objects move Up regardless.\n    *   Let's check the heavy-side rule again. If Ex 2 Orange (Bottom Heavy) moved Up, then Test Teal (Bottom Heavy) likely moves **Up**.\n    *   Also, moving Teal Up places it at `y=0-1`. Moving it Down places it at `y=17-18`. No collision either way. Given the prevalence of \"Move Up\" for small blocks in Ex 2, I will move it Up.\n\n**Final Configuration:**\n*   **Up (y=0 based):** Teal, Blue, Orange, Yellow, Green.\n*   **Down (y=18 based):** Magenta.\n\n**Coordinates:**\n*   **Teal (8):** x=1-2. Rows 0-1.\n*   **Blue (1):** x=4-7. Rows 0-3.\n*   **Orange (7):** x=11-12. Rows 0-1.\n*   **Yellow (4):** x=15-17. Rows 0-2.\n*   **Green (3):** x=22-24. Rows 0-2.\n*   **Magenta (6):** x=21-24. Rows 15-18 (Height 4).\n\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,8,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,7,7,9,9,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9\n9,8,8,9,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,7,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,3,9,3,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n...

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this ARC task, step by step:**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to solve an ARC task, likely involving some kind of grid transformation based on a couple of example inputs and an extra test case. My first instinct is to analyze the examples to understand the underlying rules.\n\n**Analyzing Example 1:**\n\n*   **Grid Dimensions:** Okay, let's start with the grid size. Looks like it's 28 rows by 19 columns. Let's make sure that's correct, given the commas. Yup, it's 28x19.\n*   **Background:** The background color is clearly zero (black). I see this because rows start with a ton of zeros.\n*   **Shapes:** There are a few distinct shapes scattered around.  Let's make a list. The first one is a yellow 'L' shape near the top-left (looks like the color 4).  Okay, let's trace this shape: (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1).\n    *   The second shape is red (color 2), a 3x3 block with a couple of extra pixels on the top-right and bottom-left.  This one is around row 5 and column 8. Let me trace that. Ok, it's a 3x3 block in the middle with a bit extra.\n    *   Third, a blue \"T\" near the top-right (color 1).  That's a horizontal line of 5 pixels with a vertical line of 2 pixels.\n    *   And finally, a green cross (color 3) near the bottom-left, a 5x5 outline. It goes 17-21, and 4-6 on the grid.\n*   **Output Observations:** Now, let's look at what changed in the output. The shapes are still there, the grid is the same dimensions, but the background is still black.  It looks like the shapes have moved around.\n*   **Shape Movement:** The yellow 'L' moved from the top-left to the bottom-left.  Red shape went to the bottom edge, right beside. The blue \"T\" went to the top edge. The green shape went to the top-left edge.\n*   **Key Question:**  What's the rule that describes this movement? Is it related to the shapes themselves, their colors, their positions, or some combination?  Is it based on the distance to the edge? \"Gravity?\"\n\n**Let's try some transformation rules:**\n\n*   **Edge Proximity:**  Maybe shapes move to the nearest edge?  That would explain blue and green. However, it fails for yellow and red because they should go to the top, which they don't. That won't work.\n*   **Farthest Edge:** How about farthest? Yellow/Red would go down, blue/green would go up. Not quite, blue went to the top. Maybe, however, that the initial position somehow determines which way to go.\n*   **Center Line:** What if there's an invisible \"center line\" at row 14? If a shape is above, it goes to the bottom. If it's below, it goes to the top? Let's check: Yes! Yellow, Red below. Blue, Green above.\n\nNow, I'm thinking about the shapes, and if any shape properties matter. Color? Count of the pixels? The number of holes? The symmetry?\n\n**Investigating Shape Properties**\n\n*   **Colors:** What if color dictates the movement? Let's see if 4 always goes down, 2 goes down, 1 goes up. It's not so simple.\n*   **Counts (pixel amount):** Let's see if the number of pixels in each shape is important. Yellow has 5, Red has 11, Blue and Green have 7. Still, there seems to be no direct link.\n*   **Holes?** Are the shapes with holes behaving a certain way? Not necessarily.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis**\n\nLet's look at Example 2. Let's see if the patterns repeat.\n\n*   **Grid Size:** 30x30. Background: Gray (5).\n*   **Shapes:** Now we have multiple colors. Orange and Maroon are close. Red shape is kind of a block. Yellow is blocky, and Green, and Blue.\n*   **Movement:** Let's look at the movement again. Red is at top, orange and maroon are at top, green is at top. Blue goes to the bottom, Yellow goes to the bottom.\n*   **\n\nThe goal of this task is to determine the transformation rule that governs the movement of colored shapes in the grid and apply it to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Shape Identification:** The grid contains several distinct shapes composed of non-background colors. In the examples, the background is 0 or 5. In the test input, the background is 9.\n2.  **Horizontal Movement:** By comparing the input and output grids, we observe that the horizontal (column) coordinates of the shapes are **preserved**. The shapes only move vertically.\n3.  **Vertical Movement & Direction:**\n    *   Shapes move to either the top edge (Row 0) or the bottom edge (Last Row) of the grid.\n    *   We can infer a \"preferred direction\" for each color based on the examples:\n        *   **Yellow (4)** consistently moves to the **Bottom**.\n        *   **Red (2), Green (3), Orange (7), Maroon (9)**, and **Blue (1)** (in Example 1) move to the **Top**.\n        *   There is a conflict/interaction logic.\n4.  **Conflict Resolution (Overlap Rule):**\n    *   When two shapes share the same horizontal columns (overlap in X), they cannot both occupy the same vertical space at the same edge.\n    *   **Rule derived from Example 1 (Red/Green) and Example 2 (Blue/Red):**\n        *   If two shapes overlap horizontally and both \"prefer\" the Top (e.g., Red and Green in Ex 1, Blue and Red in Ex 2), the shape that is originally **lower** in the grid (larger Y coordinate) moves to the **Top**.\n        *   The shape that is originally **higher** in the grid (smaller Y coordinate) is forced to the **Bottom**.\n    *   If the preferences do not conflict (e.g., Green \"Up\" and Yellow \"Down\" in Ex 2), each shape goes to its preferred edge.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Background:** 9\n*   **Shapes & Preferences:**\n    1.  **Teal (8)** [Cols 1-2]: No overlap. Assumed preference **Up** (like most colors). Moves to **Top**.\n    2.  **Blue (1)** [Cols 4-7]: No overlap. Preference **Up**. Moves to **Top**.\n    3.  **Orange (7)** [Cols 11-12]: No overlap. Preference **Up**. Moves to **Top**.\n    4.  **Yellow (4)** [Cols 15-17]: No overlap. Preference **Down**. Moves to **Bottom**.\n    5.  **Pink (6)** [Rows 11-14, Cols 21-24] and **Green (3)** [Rows 2-4, Cols 22-24]:\n        *   These two shapes overlap horizontally.\n        *   Assumed preference for both is **Up** (since only 4 has shown a Down preference).\n        *   **Conflict:** Pink is **Lower** (Row 11+), Green is **Higher** (Row 2+).\n        *   **Resolution:** The Lower shape (Pink) gets the **Top**. The Higher shape (Green) is forced to the **Bottom**.\n\n**Constructing the Output Grid:**\n*   **Top (Rows 0+):** Teal (Cols 1-2), Blue (Cols 4-7), Orange (Cols 11-12), Pink (Cols 21-24).\n*   **Bottom (Rows ~18):** Yellow (Cols 15-17), Green (Cols 22-24).\n\nThe shapes are drawn flush against the top or bottom edges, preserving their shape and column positions.\n\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,7,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,8,8,9,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,8,8,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,3,9,3,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9,9",

Horizontal positions are preserved.\n\n**Applying to Test Input (19 rows \u00d7 28 columns):**\n\nRow midpoint: ~9.5, Column midpoint: 14\n\nIdentifying shapes and their quadrants:\n1. **Green (3)**: rows 2-4, cols 22-24 \u2192 upper-right \u2192 TOP\n2. **Yellow (4)**: rows 4-6, cols 15-17 \u2192 upper-right \u2192 TOP  \n3. **Blue (1)**: rows 5-8, cols 4-7 \u2192 upper-left \u2192 BOTTOM\n4. **Orange (7)**: rows 7-8, cols 11-12 \u2192 upper-left \u2192 BOTTOM\n5. **Magenta (6)**: rows 11-14, cols 21-24 \u2192 lower-right \u2192 BOTTOM\n6. **Azure (8)**: rows 15-16, cols 1-2 \u2192 lower-left \u2192 TOP\n\n**Calculating new positions:**\n- TOP shapes shift up to start at row 0\n- BOTTOM shapes shift down to end at row 18\n\n```\n9,9,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9\n9,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,7,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation pattern:\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1. In both examples, objects are rearranged so they end up at either the very top or very bottom of the grid, with empty space in between.\n\n2. The key rule appears to be:\n   - Objects that **overlap in columns** form a group\n   - Within a group, if objects exist in **both** the top half AND bottom half of the grid, they **swap** destinations (top-half objects go to bottom edge, bottom-half objects go to top edge)\n   - **Ungrouped objects** (not overlapping with others) move to the edge of their original half\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\nGrid is 19 rows \u00d7 28 columns. Middle row \u2248 9.5 (top half: rows 0-9, bottom half: rows 10-18)\n\nObjects identified:\n- **1** (rows 5-8, cols 4-7) - top half\n- **7** (rows 7-8, cols 11-12) - top half  \n- **4** (rows 4-6, cols 15-17) - top half\n- **3** (rows 2-4, cols 22-24) - top half\n- **6** (rows 11-14, cols 21-24) - bottom half\n- **8** (rows 15-16, cols 1-2) - bottom half\n\n**Grouping by column overlap:**\n- Objects 3 and 6 overlap at cols 22-24 \u2192 they form a group (mixed: 3 in top, 6 in bottom \u2192 they swap)\n- Objects 1, 7, 4, 8 are standalone\n\n**Destinations:**\n- **6** (bottom half, grouped with 3) \u2192 goes to TOP\n- **3** (top half, grouped with 6) \u2192 goes to BOTTOM\n- **1, 7, 4** (top half, ungrouped) \u2192 stay at TOP edge\n- **8** (bottom half, ungrouped) \u2192 stays at BOTTOM edge\n\n**Output Grid:**\n\n```\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,7,7,9,9,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,7,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9\n9,9,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,3,9,9,9\n9,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Identify background and objects**\n\n   - Background in each task is a single, uniform color  \n     \u2013 Example 1: background = 0  \n     \u2013 Example 2: background = 5  \n     \u2013 Test: background = 9  \n\n   - Non\u2011background cells form distinct colored shapes (connected components in 4\u2011neighborhood) that we treat as \u201cobjects\u201d.\n\n2. **What happens in the examples**\n\n   Looking at Example 1:\n\n   - Colors present: 1, 2, 3, 4 (each in exactly one connected shape).\n   - In the output:\n     - Shapes of **odd colors** (1 and 3) are translated *vertically upwards* until their **topmost** row is at row 0 (top edge).\n     - Shapes of **even colors** (2 and 4) are translated *vertically downwards* until their **bottommost** row is at the last row (bottom edge).\n     - Horizontal positions and shapes themselves are preserved.\n     - The rows where those shapes originally were become background.\n\n   Example 2 is more cluttered (some colors appear twice, some objects already touch the bottom edge), but the consistent behavior that we need for the **test** case (where each color appears once and no object touches the bottom) is exactly the Example\u20111 behavior:\n\n   > For each color that forms a single interior object (not touching borders):  \n   > \u2022 if the color value is odd, move its entire shape straight up so its topmost cell lies on row 0;  \n   > \u2022 if the color value is even, move its entire shape straight down so its bottommost cell lies on the last row.\n\n3. **Apply this to the test grid**\n\n   Test grid size: 20 rows \u00d7 28 columns (rows 0\u201319, columns 0\u201327).  \n   Background: 9.\n\n   Non\u2011background colors and their shapes (using 0\u2011based (row, col)):\n\n   - **Color 1** (odd) \u2013 a T\u2011like shape:\n     - (5,6)\n     - (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)\n     - (7,6)\n     - (8,6)\n     - Bounding box rows 5\u20138 \u2192 ymin\u2081 = 5.\n\n     Move up by `dy\u2081 = -ymin\u2081 = -5` so its top is at row 0:\n\n     - (0,6)\n     - (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7)\n     - (2,6)\n     - (3,6)\n\n   - **Color 3** (odd) \u2013 diamond of four 3s:\n     - (2,23), (3,22), (3,24), (4,23)\n     - Bounding box rows 2\u20134 \u2192 ymin\u2083 = 2.\n\n     Move up by `dy\u2083 = -2`:\n\n     - (0,23)\n     - (1,22), (1,24)\n     - (2,23)\n\n   - **Color 7** (odd):\n     - (7,11), (7,12), (8,11)\n     - Bounding box rows 7\u20138 \u2192 ymin\u2087 = 7.\n\n     Move up by `dy\u2087 = -7`:\n\n     - (0,11), (0,12), (1,11)\n\n   - **Color 4** (even):\n     - (4,15), (4,16), (4,17), (5,16), (6,16)\n     - Bounding box rows 4\u20136 \u2192 ymax\u2084 = 6.\n\n     Move down so bottom hits last row (row 19):\n     `dy\u2084 = 19 \u2212 ymax\u2084 = 19 \u2212 6 = 13`:\n\n     - (17,15), (17,16), (17,17)\n     - (18,16)\n     - (19,16)\n\n   - **Color 6** (even):\n     - (11,22), (12,22), (13,21), (13,22), (13,23), (13,24), (14,22)\n     - Bounding box rows 11\u201314 \u2192 ymax\u2086 = 14.\n\n     Move down by `dy\u2086 = 19 \u2212 14 = 5`:\n\n     - (16,22)\n     - (17,22)\n     - (18,21), (18,22), (18,23), (18,24)\n     - (19,22)\n\n   - **Color 8** (even):\n     - (15,2), (16,1), (16,2)\n     - Bounding box rows 15\u201316 \u2192 ymax\u2088 = 16.\n\n     Move down by `dy\u2088 = 19 \u2212 16 = 3`:\n\n     - (18,2)\n     - (19,1), (19,2)\n\n   All moved shapes now sit flush either with the top edge (odd colors 1,3,7) or the bottom edge (even colors 4,6,8). None of their new positions overlap in the same cell (they share rows but not columns), so we can simply draw each at its new coordinates onto an all\u20119 background.\n\n4. **Construct the final grid**\n\n   Start with all 9s, then place all moved coordinates.

        "Full raw LLM response": "First I\u2019ll describe the transformation I inferred from the examples, then apply it step\u2011by\u2011step to the test input.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the transformation does (in the regime that matches the test)\n\nFrom the first example, ignoring the special separated bottom band seen only in Example 2, the consistent behavior is:\n\n1. **Background is a single dominant color** (0 in Example 1, 5 in Example 2, 9 in the test).\n2. **Find all connected components of non\u2011background cells**  \n   (4\u2011connectivity, i.e. up/down/left/right).\n\n3. For each component, compute:\n   - `min_row` and `max_row` (rows are 1\u2011based from top),\n   - a vertical \u201cposition\u201d such as the **center row** \\((\\text{min\\_row} + \\text{max\\_row}) / 2\\).\n\n4. **Sort the components by their center row (top to bottom)**.\n\n5. **Split them into two equal halves by this sorted order**:\n   - the **upper half** (those originally higher),\n   - the **lower half** (those originally lower).\n\n6. **Reposition them only vertically, preserving their shapes and columns**:\n   - Every component in the **lower half** is moved **up** so that its topmost cell is on **row 1**.  \n     (Translation by `dr = 1 - min_row`.)\n   - Every component in the **upper half** is moved **down** so that its bottommost cell is on the **last row H**.  \n     (Translation by `dr = H - max_row`.)\n\n7. Draw all components on a fresh grid filled with background color; since in the cases like Example 1 and the test the components on each side don\u2019t overlap horizontally, no conflicts arise.\n\nExample 1 fits this exactly:\n- Components sorted top\u2192bottom: 4, 2, 1, 3.\n- Upper half: {4, 2} \u21d2 pushed to the bottom of the grid.\n- Lower half: {1, 3} \u21d2 pulled up to the top of the grid.\n\nThe test input also has no large internal blank band and no duplicated components of the same color, so it falls into the same regime as Example 1, and we can apply this \u201chalf\u2011swap vertically\u201d rule directly.\n\n(Example 2 additionally has a large empty band and duplicate components of the same color forming a separate \u201cfloor\u201d; that special handling isn\u2019t needed for the test, so I won\u2019t rely on it.)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Analyze the test input\n\nBackground color is 9. Grid size: 19 rows \u00d7 28 columns.\n\nNon\u2011background components (each color appears in exactly one connected component):\n\n- **Color 3**: rows 3\u20135, around column 24  \n  Cells:  \n  (3,24), (4,23), (4,25), (5,24)  \n  \u2192 `min_row(3) = 3`, `max_row(3) = 5`, center = 4\n\n- **Color 4**: rows 5\u20137, columns 16\u201318  \n  Cells:  \n  (5,16), (5,17), (5,18), (6,17), (7,17)  \n  \u2192 `min_row(4) = 5`, `max_row(4) = 7`, center = 6\n\n- **Color 1**: rows 6\u20139, around columns 5\u20138  \n  Cells:  \n  (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,7), (9,7)  \n  \u2192 `min_row(1) = 6`, `max_row(1) = 9`, center = 7.5\n\n- **Color 7**: rows 8\u20139, around column 12  \n  Cells:  \n  (8,12), (8,13), (9,12)  \n  \u2192 `min_row(7) = 8`, `max_row(7) = 9`, center = 8.5\n\n- **Color 6**: rows 12\u201315, around columns 22\u201325  \n  Cells:  \n  (12,23), (13,23), (14,22), (14,23), (14,24), (14,25), (15,23)  \n  \u2192 `min_row(6) = 12`, `max_row(6) = 15`, center = 13.5\n\n- **Color 8**: rows 16\u201317, columns 2\u20133  \n  Cells:  \n  (16,3), (17,2), (17,3)  \n  \u2192 `min_row(8) = 16`, `max_row(8) = 17`, center = 16.5\n\nSorted by center row (top to bottom):\n\n1. 3 (center 4)\n2. 4 (center 6)\n3. 1 (center 7.5)\n4. 7 (center 8.5)\n5. 6 (center 13.5)\n6. 8 (center 16.5)\n\nTotal \\(N = 6\\). Split into two halves of 3:\n\n- **Upper half (originally higher)**: 3, 4, 1  \n- **Lower half (originally lower)**: 7, 6, 8  \n\nGrid height \\(H = 19\\).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Move the components\n\n### 3.1. Lower half \u2192 move up (anchor to row 1)\n\nEach gets vertical shift `dr_up = 1 - min_row`.\n\n#### Component 7\n- `min_row = 8` \u21d2 `dr = 1 - 8 = -7`\n- Original cells:\n  - (8,12), (8,13), (9,12)\n- New cells:\n  - (1,12), (1,13), (2,12)\n\n#### Component 6\n- `min_row = 12` \u21d2 `dr = 1 - 12 = -11`\n- Original cells:\n  - (12,23), (13,23), (14,22), (14,23), (14,24), (14,25), (15,23)\n- New cells:\n  - (1,23), (2,23), (3,22), (3,23), (3,24), (3,25), (4,23)\n\n#### Component 8\n- `min_row = 16` \u21d2 `dr = 1 - 16 = -15`\n- Original cells:\n  - (16,3), (17,2), (17,3)\n- New cells:\n  - (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)\n\nThese three components now occupy rows 1\u20134, with no column overlap among them.\n\n### 3.2. Upper half \u2192 move down (anchor to row H=19)\n\nEach gets vertical shift `dr_down = H - max_row`.\n\n#### Component 3\n- `max_row = 5` \u21d2 `dr = 19 - 5 = 14`\n- Original cells:\n  - (3,24), (4,23), (4,25), (5,24)\n- New cells:\n  - (17,24), (18,23), (18,25), (19,24)\n\n#### Component 4\n- `max_row = 7` \u21d2 `dr = 19 - 7 = 12`\n- Original cells:\n  - (5,16), (5,17), (5,18), (6,17), (7,17)\n- New cells:\n  - (17,16), (17,17), (17,18), (18,17), (19,17)\n\n#### Component 1\n- `max_row = 9` \u21d2 `dr = 19 - 9 = 10`\n- Original cells:\n  - (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (8,7), (9,7)\n- New cells:\n  - (16,7), (17,5), (17,6), (17,7), (17,8), (18,7), (19,7)\n\nAgain, these three components share the bottom rows 16\u201319 but occupy disjoint column ranges, so there\u2019s no overlap.\n\nAll other cells remain the background color 9.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

        "Full raw LLM response": "To solve this task I focused on how the examples rearrange the coloured connected components vertically while keeping their columns and shapes unchanged. The pattern that fits both training pairs is:\n\n- Find all connected components of non\u2011background colour.\n- If a colour has a component that touches the bottom edge, discard other components of that colour and keep the bottom\u2011touching ones as the bottom group. All other components form the top group.\n- If no component touches the bottom edge, sort components by their top row and split the list in half: the first half forms the bottom group, the second half the top group.\n- Place the top group by shifting each component up so its topmost row is at row\u202f0 and overlay them.\n- Place the bottom group by shifting each component down so its bottommost row is at the last row of the grid and overlay them.\n- Fill the rest with the background colour.\n\nFor the test input there are six components, none touch the bottom, so I sorted by top row and put the first three (3,4,1) into the bottom group and the last three (7,6,8) into the top group. After shifting accordingly and overlaying, the 19\u00d728 output grid is:\n\n9,9,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,3,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9",

        "Full raw LLM response": "The transformation keeps each coloured component\u2019s shape and horizontal position, but moves every component either to the very top of the grid or the very bottom. For colours that appear together in the same columns, the one with more cells in the overlapping columns is placed at the top edge and the other at the bottom edge. Colours that don\u2019t compete are assigned to top or bottom consistently with the example pattern, then each component is translated vertically so its top row is at row\u00a01 (for top components) or its bottom row is at the last row (for bottom components). All other cells remain the background.\n\nApplying this to the test input, colours\u00a06,\u00a01 and\u00a07 go to the top, while colours\u00a03,\u00a04 and\u00a08 go to the bottom, giving:\n\n```\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,7,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,9,9,9,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,6,6,6,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,4,4,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9\n9,9,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,3,9,9,9\n9,8,8,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,9,9,9,9\n```",
