Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Solution for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to crack this ARC puzzle, which involves figuring out how to transform an input grid into an output grid based on a few examples. I'm seeing 3x3 squares popping up, with different colors inside, and sometimes they disappear or change. My initial thought is to look for some pattern between the input and the output - maybe it's about the colors themselves, or the relationships between the squares.\n\nI start by going through the first example, and I notice that there\u2019s a big gray C-shape. Inside, there\u2019s a yellow 3x3 square with a red center. Then, there are a few other colorful squares scattered around. The output shows that the yellow square, and another blue square, both disappear, while the others remain with modified centers, somehow. After some more tracing, I realize that it\u2019s all about these squares \u201cpointing\u201d to each other based on their colors. If a square's *center* color matches another square's *body* color, the first square \u201ceats\u201d the second. The \"eater\" square stays, gets the other's center color, and the \"eaten\" one vanishes. It's like a chain reaction, where the squares are linked through their colors. I'm seeing patterns now: Squares are grouped into chains, and it's some sort of \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d based on these color-coded connections.\n\nThen I get this idea: there is a specific transformation rule. I'm going to formulate a hypothesis: Let's assume you have two squares, A and B. Square A has a specific body color and a center color, and B also has a body color and center color. If A's center color is the same as B's body color, that means that A \u201ceats\u201d B. The transformation: A stays, its center color changes to B's center color, and B disappears, becoming black (0).\n\nI test this hypothesis on the examples. I look at Example 2. Here are some examples of what is happening. The squares are transformed based on this logic: There is a chain where square T \u201ceats\u201d G, which \u201ceats\u201d R. The output: Only T survives, while G and R get removed. My hypothesis fits perfectly. Green's center (2) is transferred to Teal (T). The \"eater\" keeps the old target's center. It seems like the last element of the chain is always removed.\n\nWith this logic in mind, I look at the Test Input. Based on this, I apply the logic: (1) Find 3x3 squares with a center. (2) Build a directed graph from the body and center color. (3) Form groups based on chains. (4) Look at each chain. (5) Squares that \"eat\" survive. The centers of surviving squares are updated. Squares that are \"eaten\" vanish. (6) Copy the input and overwrite all the elements that have been processed to the output.\n\nAfter lots of counting and checking the color codes, I'm confident in my solution: (1) identify the squares, (2) look at the color links, (3) see the surviving pieces and their new center colors, and the removed pieces. All the work confirms that the solution is based on chain-building.\n\nThe test input is finally coming together. I have identified five possible squares in the input grid. There are several pieces (squares) that need to be removed. One part has to stay (and change). Based on all the previous cases, I think this is it. It looks like it should work.\n\nFinal prediction: I end up with the surviving squares and their updated center colors. The rest become zero. Then all I have to do is check the counts to make sure I am spot on. All looks good!\n\n\nThe logic for solving this task is based on identifying \"food chains\" among the 3x3 colored squares.\n\n**Rules inferred from examples:**\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all 3x3 squares of a solid color with a different center pixel color. Let's define a square by its **Body Color** and **Center Color**.\n2.  **Define Relationships:** A directed relationship (an \"eating\" or \"targeting\" link) exists from Square A to Square B if **Square A's Center Color matches Square B's Body Color**.\n    *   Example: A Green square with a Red center points to a Red square.\n3.  **Determine Survivors (Eating Logic):**\n    *   Form chains of these relationships (e.g., A points to B, B points to C).\n    *   Process chains starting from the \"top\" (squares that are not targeted by any active eater).\n    *   **Rule:** A square **survives (is kept)** if and only if it **successfully eats** its target.\n        *   If A eats B:\n            *   **A stays.** Its center color updates to become **B's center color**.\n            *   **B is removed** (turned into black/0 pixels).\n            *   Since B is removed/dead, it cannot eat C (if it pointed to C).\n            *   Consequently, C is not eaten. It must try to eat D to survive. If C has no target or its target doesn't exist, C is removed.\n    *   Squares that are not part of any chain (don't eat, aren't eaten) are removed (as seen with \"debris\" squares in examples). Effectively, **only successful eaters survive**.\n4.  **Background Preservation:** Any pixels not belonging to the identified 3x3 squares (like the gray structures) are preserved exactly as they are.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Squares:**\n    *   **S1 (Top-Left):** Body **Blue (1)**, Center **Green (3)**. Position: Rows 0-2, Cols 3-5.\n    *   **S2 (Top-Right):** Body **Magenta (6)**, Center **Blue (1)**. Position: Rows 0-2, Cols 7-9.\n    *   **S3 (Middle-Left):** Body **Red (2)**, Center **Yellow (4)**. Position: Rows 4-6, Cols 1-3.\n    *   **S4 (Middle-Right):** Body **Green (3)**, Center **Maroon (9)**. Position: Rows 5-7, Cols 5-7.\n    *   **S5 (Bottom-Left):** Body **Orange (7)**, Center **Red (2)**. Position: Rows 8-9 (cutoff), Cols 1-3.\n\n2.  **Establish Chains:**\n    *   S2 (Center 1) -> targets S1 (Body 1).\n    *   S1 (Center 3) -> targets S4 (Body 3).\n    *   S4 (Center 9) -> targets nothing (No Body 9).\n    *   S5 (Center 2) -> targets S3 (Body 2).\n    *   S3 (Center 4) -> targets nothing (No Body 4).\n\n    **Chains:**\n    *   Chain A: **S2 -> S1 -> S4**\n    *   Chain B: **S5 -> S3**\n\n3.  **Apply Logic:**\n    *   **Chain A:**\n        *   **S2 eats S1.**\n            *   **S2 Kept.** New Center = S1's Center (**3**).\n            *   **S1 Removed.**\n        *   S1 is dead, so it cannot eat S4.\n        *   S4 is not eaten. Does S4 eat anything? No target.\n        *   **S4 Removed** (failed to eat).\n    *   **Chain B:**\n        *   **S5 eats S3.**\n            *   **S5 Kept.** New Center = S3's Center (**4**).\n            *   **S3 Removed.**\n\n4.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   Copy input grid (preserving background 5s).\n    *   **Clear S1:** Set (0,3)-(2,5) to 0.\n    *   **Clear S3:** Set (4,1)-(6,3) to 0.\n    *   **Clear S4:** Set (5,5)-(7,7) to 0.\n    *   **Update S2:** Keep pixels, change center at (1,8) to **3**.\n    *   **Update S5:** Keep pixels, change center at (9,2) to **4**.\n\n**Output Grid Generation:**\n\n*   Row 0: S1 cleared, S2 kept.\n*   Row 1: S2 center becomes 3.\n*   Rows 4-6: S3 cleared.\n*   Rows 5-7: S4 cleared.\n*   Row 9: S5 center becomes 4.\n\n**Final Output:**\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,7,7,7,0,5,5,0,0,5\n0,7,4,7,0,0,0,5,5,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Task Breakdown & My Approach**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking as I tackle this ARC task. The core of it seems to involve some kind of transformation on a 10x10 grid of numbers (0-9, representing colors). My initial hunch is that it's all about identifying distinct objects or shapes within the grid and applying some rule to change them. The transformations are selective: some parts stay as they are, others get removed entirely, and some colors are altered.\n\n**First Look at the Examples**\n\nI started by examining the examples provided. The first example was key. I saw a few recurring patterns:\n\n*   **Donuts:** These are hollow 3x3 squares with a specific number in the center. I'm calling them \"Donuts.\"\n*   **Containers:** Some of these donuts are nested or surrounded by other shapes, creating a \"container\" structure.\n*   **Color Changes:** When comparing the input and output grids, the color of the central pixel in some Donuts changes. Some complete shapes/donuts are removed, i.e. replaced with 0s.\n\nI noticed a correlation between the center color of a donut and the color of its surroundings or the color of a subsequent target.\nA \"Receiver\" has a center pixel $C_r$, and the surrounding color of another shape is called the $S_s$. There is a \"Source\" shape. The relationship is that $C_r = S_s$.\n\n**The Transformation Rule: Eat or Be Eaten!**\n\nAfter studying the first two examples, I had a hypothesis: I think it boils down to identifying \"Receiver\" and \"Source\" relationships. A donut \"A\" will \"point to\" donut \"B\" if the center color of A matches the surrounding color of B. The rule seems to be:\n\n*   If A \"points to\" B, then A \"eats\" B.\n*   \"Eating\" means:\n    *   A keeps its surrounding shape\n    *   A updates its center to the center color of B.\n    *   B disappears (becomes all 0s).\n*   If a donut has no target or is at the end of a chain, it simply disappears (starves). It doesn't get to eat.\n\n**Example 2 & Chain Reaction**\n\nExample 2 showed me the idea of chains. Some Donuts point to other donuts, making longer sequences. Example 2 demonstrated the following rule. If a donut A, points to B, and B to C, then A \"eats\" B, and C can no longer \"eat\" B, C, is essentially unharmed by the chain of targets.\n\n**Applying the Rule to the Test Input**\n\nI applied this \"eat-or-be-eaten\" logic to the test input. First, I had to identify all the Donuts in the grid. Then, I mapped out the \"pointing\" relationships between them, creating a targeting graph, and then I followed the \"chains\". I started at the head of the chain (nodes with in-degree 0) and went down from there, with any Donuts that did not eat anyone getting removed. Finally, I constructed the output grid based on which donuts survived and what their new center colors were.\n\n**Edge Cases & Verification**\n\nThere were a couple of edge cases to consider:\n1.  **Orphan Donuts**: If a donut doesn't \"eat\" or isn't \"eaten,\" does it survive?\n2.  **No target**: This has been the key. \"If you are not eaten and you have no target, you are removed.\"\n3.  **Containers:** This also means that background 5s do not count, unless they are connected to a surviving donut (3x3).\n\nI made sure I correctly applied all these rules and edge cases, double-checking the center coordinates and how the 5-structures (the containers) were handled.\n\n**The Final Answer**\n\nAfter all that, I arrived at a complete, output grid, that I'm confident should solve this test input.\n\n\nThe task involves identifying interactions between specific shapes in the grid, which act as \"agents\" with a color and a center value. The transformation follows a specific set of rules based on these interactions.\n\n**1. Identification of Objects:**\nThe grid contains 3x3 square \"Donuts\" consisting of a surrounding border of one color and a single center pixel of a different color.\nIn the test input, we identify the following Donuts:\n- **D1**: Top-Middle. Surround Color **1**, Center **3**. (Rows 0-2, Cols 3-5)\n- **D6**: Top-Right. Surround Color **6**, Center **1**. (Rows 0-2, Cols 7-9)\n- **D2**: Mid-Left. Surround Color **2**, Center **4**. (Rows 4-6, Cols 1-3)\n- **D3**: Mid-Right. Surround Color **3**, Center **9**. (Rows 5-7, Cols 5-7)\n- **D7**: Bottom-Left. Surround Color **7**, Center **2**. (Rows 8-9, clipped).\n\nThere are also background structures made of 5s, which serve as containers or wires but remain unchanged unless they overlap with a deleted Donut (which they don't; the Donuts are inside or adjacent).\n\n**2. Interaction Rules (The \"Food Chain\"):**\n- A Donut **A** \"targets\" Donut **B** if **A**'s center number matches **B**'s surround color.\n- If **A** targets **B**, **A** attempts to \"eat\" **B**.\n- **Eating Rule**: If **A** eats **B**, **A** survives and its center number updates to become **B**'s center number. **B** is then removed (pixels become 0).\n- **Survival Logic**:\n    - Interactions resolve in chains starting from Donuts that are not targeted by anyone (predators).\n    - If **A** eats **B**, **B** is removed and cannot eat its target (if any).\n    - If a Donut is not eaten but has no valid target (prey), it \"starves\" and is removed.\n    - Only Donuts that successfully eat someone survive.\n\n**3. Applying Rules to Test Input:**\n\n*Chain 1:* **D6** (Center 1) targets **D1** (Color 1). **D1** (Center 3) targets **D3** (Color 3). **D3** (Center 9) targets nothing (no Donut 9).\n- **D6** eats **D1**.\n    - **D6** survives. Its center updates to **D1**'s center (**3**).\n    - **D1** is removed.\n- **D1** is dead, so it cannot eat **D3**.\n- **D3** is safe from **D1**, but it has no target.\n    - **D3** starves and is removed.\n\n*Chain 2:* **D7** (Center 2) targets **D2** (Color 2). **D2** (Center 4) targets nothing (no Donut 4).\n- **D7** eats **D2**.\n    - **D7** survives. Its center updates to **D2**'s center (**4**).\n    - **D2** is removed.\n- **D2** is dead.\n\n**4. Final State Construction:**\n- **D6** (Top-Right): Remains. Center changes from 1 to 3.\n- **D7** (Bottom-Left): Remains. Center changes from 2 to 4.\n- **D1**, **D2**, **D3**: Deleted (replaced with 0s).\n- **5s**: Remain unchanged.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,7,7,7,0,5,5,0,0,5\n0,7,4,7,0,0,0,5,5,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "The inputs all contain several disjoint 3\u00d73 \u201cframed\u201d squares: eight border cells of one colour with a different centre cell. The rest of the picture is some other shape that is left alone.\n\nThe transformation operates only on these framed blocks. View each block as a node labelled with its border colour and centre colour. If a block\u2019s centre colour equals the border colour of another block, draw a directed edge from the first to that second block. Because each block has at most one centre value, this gives a collection of chains ending in blocks whose centre value is not any block\u2019s border.\n\nFor each chain starting from a block with no incoming edge, walk along the edges. Starting at the root, mark every other block to keep (positions 0,\u202f2,\u202f4\u2026) but always discard the final sink; blocks at odd positions are discarded as well. A kept block has its border cells left as they are but its centre cell replaced with the original centre value of the block it points to (which is being discarded). All discarded blocks are erased: all nine cells in their 3\u00d73 area are set to zero. Everything not part of a framed block is unchanged.\n\nIn the test grid there are three framed blocks:\n- rows\u202f0\u20132, cols\u202f3\u20135: border\u202f1, centre\u202f3;\n- rows\u202f0\u20132, cols\u202f7\u20139: border\u202f6, centre\u202f1;\n- rows\u202f5\u20137, cols\u202f5\u20137: border\u202f3, centre\u202f9.\n\nThe edges form one chain: (6\u21921\u21923), i.e. the 6\u2011border block points to the 1\u2011border block, which points to the 3\u2011border block. Starting at the 6\u2011border block (the only root), we keep it, discard the other two, and set its centre to the discarded 1\u2011border block\u2019s centre value (3). The discarded blocks are zeroed. Applying this yields:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,2,2,2,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,2,4,2,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,2,2,2,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,7,7,7,0,5,5,0,0,5\n0,7,2,7,0,0,0,5,5,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "To solve this family of tasks I looked for regular 3\u00d73 \u201cframes\u201d: sub\u2011grids where all eight border cells share the same colour and the central cell is different. Each such frame gives a mapping from its border colour to its centre colour.\n\nThe frames can be linked into chains: if a frame\u2019s centre colour matches the border colour of another frame, then it points to that next frame. The sources of these chains are frames whose border colour is not used as a centre by any other frame. From each source, follow the chain until you reach a frame whose centre does not lead to another frame; that last frame is terminal.\n\nThe output is constructed as follows:\n\n- All cells with value\u202f5 in the input are copied unchanged to the output.\n- For each chain, only the non\u2011terminal frames at even positions along the chain (starting the source at index\u202f0) are kept. For a kept frame, its border stays the same, and its centre is replaced by the centre value of its successor frame in the chain.\n- All other coloured cells, including the terminal frames and any frame cells that are not kept, are set to 0.\n- Zeros in the input remain zero unless overwritten by the kept frame or a 5.\n\nApplying this to the test input, the detected frames are:\n\n- border\u202f1, centre\u202f3 at (0,3);\n- border\u202f6, centre\u202f1 at (0,7);\n- border\u202f2, centre\u202f4 at (4,1);\n- border\u202f3, centre\u202f9 at (5,5).\n\nThe chains are 6\u21921\u21923 (terminal) and 2 (terminal). Only the frame with border\u202f6 is kept, and its centre is replaced with the centre of the border\u202f1 frame (which is 3). The border\u202f2 and border\u202f3 frames are terminal and are removed, and the border\u202f1 frame at odd index is removed. All 5s are preserved.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0",

No two chosen edges share a vertex (each donut appears in at most one chosen edge).\n2. The set has maximum possible size (a maximum vertex\u2011disjoint matching).\n3. If there are several maximum matchings, choose the one where the *sum of distances from the **receiving** donuts to the grid center* is minimal  \n   (i.e. prefer pairings whose receivers are more centrally located).\n\nCheck how this reproduces the training outputs.\n\n### Example 3 (simple case)\n\nEdges: C\u2192A and B\u2192D.  \n\nThere is only one vertex\u2011disjoint matching of maximum size:  \nM = {C\u2192A, B\u2192D}.\n\nSo:\n- Donors (senders) = {C, B}\n- Recipients = {A, D}\n\nThis matches the output:\n\n- A\u2019s ring of 1s remains; its center changes from 2 to 9 (C\u2019s original center).\n- D\u2019s ring of 7s remains; its center changes from 4 to 3 (B\u2019s original center).\n- Donors B and C disappear completely.\n\n### Example 1\n\nEdges: A\u2192B, B\u2192D, D\u2192C.\n\nPossible vertex\u2011disjoint matchings:\n\n- {A\u2192B, D\u2192C} (size 2)\n- {A\u2192B} (size 1)\n- {B\u2192D} (size 1)\n- {D\u2192C} (size 1)\n\nWe must take the maximum size: size 2, so M = {A\u2192B, D\u2192C} (unique).\n\nThus:\n- Donors: A and D \u2192 their 3\u00d73 blocks are erased.\n- Recipients: B and C \u2192 their rings stay, centers updated:\n\n  - B.center: 4 \u2192 2 (from A.center)\n  - C.center: 1 \u2192 3 (from D.center)\n\nThis is exactly what we see.\n\n### Example 2 (ambiguous, where tie\u2011breaking matters)\n\nEdges: A\u2192B, B\u2192C, C\u2192E, E\u2192D (chain A\u2192B\u2192C\u2192E\u2192D).\n\nPossible maximum vertex\u2011disjoint matchings (size 2):\n\n1. {A\u2192B, C\u2192E} (recipients B and E)\n2. {A\u2192B, E\u2192D} (recipients B and D)\n3. {B\u2192C, E\u2192D} (recipients C and D)\n\nThe actual output keeps donuts C and D, and erases rings of B and E (with A also eventually erased). That corresponds to matching #3:  \nM = {B\u2192C, E\u2192D}.\n\nTo justify that selection, measure Manhattan distance from each donut center to the grid center (for a 10\u00d710 grid, center is at (5.5,5.5)):\n\n- A(2,2): 7\n- B(2,8): 6\n- C(6,2): 4\n- D(6,9): 4\n- E(9,6): 4\n\nFor each matching, sum distances of **recipients**:\n\n1. {A\u2192B, C\u2192E}: B(6) + E(4) = 10\n2. {A\u2192B, E\u2192D}: B(6) + D(4) = 10\n3. {B\u2192C, E\u2192D}: C(4) + D(4) = 8  \u2190 minimal\n\nSo the \u201cclosest recipients to the center\u201d rule picks exactly {B\u2192C, E\u2192D}.\n\nThen:\n\n- Donors B and E are erased.\n- Recipients:\n  - C keeps its ring of 8s, center 3 \u2192 2 (from B).\n  - D keeps its ring of 1s, center 4 \u2192 8 (from E).\n- Donut A is connected in the graph (A\u2192B), but has no chosen edge, so it is erased entirely.\n\nAgain, this matches the provided output.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Classify donuts and apply the transformation**\n\nGiven the chosen matching M:\n\n- **Donor**: donut which is the tail (sender) of an edge in M  \n  \u2192 Erase its entire 3\u00d73 block (ring + center \u2192 0).\n\n- **Recipient**: donut which is the head (receiver) of an edge in M  \n  \u2192 Keep its ring as-is; set its center to the **donor\u2019s original center color**.\n\n- **Isolated donuts**: donuts with *no* incoming or outgoing edges in the ring\u2013center graph  \n  \u2192 Left completely unchanged (ring and center).\n\n- **Connected but unmatched donuts**: donuts that do have at least one incident edge in the graph, but are not part of any chosen edge in M  \n  \u2192 Erase their entire 3\u00d73 block (they neither give nor receive in the final scheme).\n\nAll **non\u2011donut cells** are simply copied from the input.\n\nThis rule explains all three training examples.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apply the rule to the test input**\n\nTest input:\n\nRow1:  0,0,0,1,1,1,0,6,6,6  \nRow2:  0,0,0,1,3,1,0,6,1,6  \nRow3:  0,0,0,1,1,1,0,6,6,6  \nRow4:  5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0  \nRow5:  5,2,2,2,5,0,0,0,5,0  \nRow6:  5,2,4,2,5,3,3,3,5,0  \nRow7:  5,2,2,2,5,3,9,3,0,5  \nRow8:  0,5,5,0,5,3,3,3,0,5  \nRow9:  0,7,7,7,0,5,5,0,0,5  \nRow10: 0,7,2,7,0,0,0,5,5,0  \n\n### 5.1 Find all donuts\n\nScan for 3\u00d73 regions with uniform ring and different center.\n\nWe find 4 donuts:\n\n1.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Step 1 \u2013 What changes between input and output in the examples?**\n\nLooking at all three solved examples:\n\n- Almost the whole grid stays identical.\n- The *only* changes occur inside very specific **3\u00d73 \u201cframed\u201d blocks**:\n  - The 8 border cells of the 3\u00d73 are all the same non\u2011zero color.\n  - The center cell is a different color.\n- I\u2019ll call each such 3\u00d73 block a **frame** and describe it as a pair  \n  \\((B, C)\\) = (border color, center color) and by its center coordinates.\n\nExample 1 (just the frames):\n\n- A: border 3, center 4 at (1,8) \u2192 (3,4)\n- B: border 4, center 2 at (4,3) \u2192 (4,2)\n- C: border 6, center 1 at (5,8) \u2192 (6,1)\n- D: border 1, center 3 at (8,3) \u2192 (1,3)\n\nIn the **output**:\n- Frames A and C remain, but with **new center colors**:\n  - A: center 4 \u2192 2\n  - C: center 1 \u2192 3\n- Frames B and D are completely zeroed (all 9 cells \u2192 0).\n\nSimilarly in Example 2 and 3:\n- Only such frames are altered.\n- Some frames keep their border, get a new center.\n- The other frames are entirely replaced by 0s.\n\nSo the task is entirely about **detecting these 3\u00d73 frames and transforming them**.\n\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 How frames interact: build a directed graph**\n\nAcross all examples, frames interact based on their colors.\n\nDefine frames \\(F_i = (B_i, C_i)\\).\nDefine an arrow \\(F_i \\to F_j\\) **iff**\n- the border color of \\(F_i\\) equals the center color of \\(F_j\\):\n\n\\[\nB_i = C_j \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad F_i \\to F_j\n\\]\n\nThis gives us **directed chains** of frames.\n\n---\n\n### Example 1 chains\n\nFrames:\n- A: (3,4)\n- B: (4,2)\n- C: (6,1)\n- D: (1,3)\n\nEdges \\(B_i = C_j\\):\n\n- B (4,2) \u2192 A (3,4) because 4 (B) = 4 (center of A)\n- A (3,4) \u2192 D (1,3) because 3 = center of D\n- D (1,3) \u2192 C (6,1) because 1 = center of C\n- C has no outgoing arrow.\n\nChain: **B \u2192 A \u2192 D \u2192 C** (length 4).\n\nNow look at the output:\n- Centers become:\n  - A.new = 2 (center of B, its predecessor)\n  - C.new = 3 (center of D, its predecessor)\n- B and D disappear completely (their 3\u00d73 blocks zeroed).\n\nSo:\n- **Along the chain**, the center of each frame is replaced by the center of its immediate **predecessor**.\n- After that, in this example we **keep frame #2 and frame #4 in the chain**, and delete #1 and #3.\n\n---\n\n### Example 2 chains\n\nDetected frames:\n\n- F1: (2,6) at (1,1)\n- F2: (3,2) at (1,7)\n- F3: (8,3) at (5,1)\n- F4: (1,4) at (5,8)\n- F5: (4,8) at (8,5)\n\nEdges \\(B_i = C_j\\):\n\n- F2 (3,2) \u2192 F3 (8,3) because 3 = center of F3\n- F3 (8,3) \u2192 F5 (4,8) because 8 = center of F5\n- F5 (4,8) \u2192 F4 (1,4) because 4 = center of F4\n- F1 (2,6) has no edges.\n\nMain chain: **F2 \u2192 F3 \u2192 F5 \u2192 F4** (length 4).\nF1 is isolated.\n\nPropagation of centers (predecessor \u2192 recipient):\n\n- F3.new = center(F2) = 2\n- F5.new = center(F3) = 3\n- F4.new = center(F5) = 8\n\nIn the output:\n\n- Only F3 and F4 remain:\n  - F3\u2019s 3\u00d73 border of 8s keeps its border, center becomes 2.\n  - F4\u2019s 3\u00d73 border of 1s keeps its border, center becomes 8.\n- F2, F5, F1 are fully zeroed.\n\nAgain we see:\n- Centers updated from immediate predecessor on the chain.\n- Frames that **remain**: in this single chain, they are **node #2 and node #4**.\n- The isolated frame (F1) is removed.\n\n---\n\n### Example 3 chains\n\nFrames:\n\n- A: (1,2) at (1,1)\n- B: (4,3) at (1,8)\n- C: (3,6) at (5,5)\n- D: (2,9) at (8,1)\n- E: (7,4) at (8,8)\n\nEdges \\(B_i = C_j\\):\n\n- C (3,6) \u2192 B (4,3) because 3 = center of B\n- B (4,3) \u2192 E (7,4) because 4 = center of E\n- D (2,9) \u2192 A (1,2) because 2 = center of A\n- A and E have no outgoing edges.\n\nSo we have **two chains**:\n\n- Chain 1: C \u2192 B \u2192 E (length 3)\n- Chain 2: D \u2192 A (length 2)\n\nCenter propagation:\n\n- Chain 1:\n  - B.new = center(C) = 6\n  - E.new = center(B) = 3\n- Chain 2:\n  - A.new = center(D) = 9\n\nIn the output:\n\n- Only **A and E** remain:\n  - A keeps border 1, center becomes 9.\n  - E keeps border 7, center becomes 3.\n- B, C, D are completely zeroed.\n\nNow, in this case there are **two distinct chains**, and the surviving frames are exactly **the tails of each chain** (nodes with no outgoing edge).\n\n\n---\n\n### Synthesizing the rule\n\nFrom the three examples, a consistent procedure that reproduces all outputs is:\n\n1. **Find all frames.**  \n   3\u00d73 windows where the border 8 cells are the same non\u2011zero color and the center is different.\n\n2. **Build the directed graph.**  \n   For each pair of frames \\(F_i=(B_i,C_i), F_j=(B_j,C_j)\\), if \\(B_i = C_j\\), add edge  \n   \\(F_i \\to F_j\\).\n\n   Because of how the tasks are constructed, each frame has at most one incoming and one outgoing edge, so the graph decomposes into **directed chains** and isolated nodes.\n\n3. **Propagate centers along edges (one step).**  \n   For every edge \\(F_i \\to F_j\\), set\n\n   \\[\n   C_j^{\\text{new}} = C_i^{\\text{old}}\n   \\]\n\n   All center updates are computed from the **original** centers (do it conceptually in parallel).\n\n4. **Decide which frames survive:**\n   - **Isolated frames** (no incoming or outgoing edges):  \n     erase their 3\u00d73 area completely (all 0).\n   - **If there is more than one nontrivial chain (length \u2265 2):**\n     - For each chain, **keep only its tail frame** (the one with no outgoing edge),\n       with its new center; erase all other frames in that chain.\n     - This matches Example 3 (two chains \u2192 two tails kept).\n   - **If there is exactly one nontrivial chain:**\n     - Let the chain be \\(F_1 \\to F_2 \\to \\dots \\to F_n\\).\n     - **Keep frames \\(F_2\\) and \\(F_n\\)** with their updated centers.\n     - Erase all other frames in that chain.\n     - Erase all isolated frames.\n     - This matches Example 1 and Example 2.\n\n5. All other cells in the grid are left untouched.\n\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apply the rule to the test input**\n\nTest input (for reference):\n\nRow0: 0,0,0,1,1,1,0,6,6,6  \nRow1: 0,0,0,1,3,1,0,6,1,6  \nRow2: 0,0,0,1,1,1,0,6,6,6  \nRow3: 5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0  \nRow4: 5,2,2,2,5,0,0,0,5,0  \nRow5: 5,2,4,2,5,3,3,3,5,0  \nRow6: 5,2,2,2,5,3,9,3,0,5  \nRow7: 0,5,5,0,5,3,3,3,0,5  \nRow8: 0,7,7,7,0,5,5,0,0,5  \nRow9: 0,7,2,7,0,0,0,5,5,0  \n\n---\n\n### 3.1 Find all 3\u00d73 frames\n\nCheck all 3\u00d73 windows; the qualifying ones are:\n\n1. **Top middle** (rows 0\u20132, cols 3\u20135):\n\n   ```\n   1 1 1\n   1 3 1\n   1 1 1\n   ```\n\n   \u2192 Frame R1: border 1, center 3 at (1,4).
