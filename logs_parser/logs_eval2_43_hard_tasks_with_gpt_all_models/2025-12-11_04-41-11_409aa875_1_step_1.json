Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's my thought process:**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task. It's about modifying 16x16 grids. There are three examples and a test case. The objective seems to involve transforming the grid based on patterns or objects.\n\n*   **Initial Observations:** I see a constant background color (orange/7). The task is to \"solve\" a transformation, which suggests that there is a rule. The examples each follow a specific input to output structure. I need to figure out this transformation.\n\n*   **Example 1 Analysis:** Let's focus on this. I'm noting the positions of all non-background pixels (color 9). The input grid and output have a pattern. It starts at a specific position and \"moves\" down.  I notice that pixels from one part of the input are \"copied\" into the output but with a change in color (9 becomes 1). I must map this movement pattern or \"shift\" and any accompanying rules.\n\n*   **Identifying the Transformation:** It looks like a copy operation. But where? And why is one pixel different? I test my guess that the transformation involves copying a pattern from one row to a new row, changing color, or adding colors.\n\n*   **Example 2 and the Shift:** I think the example is an evolution from the first. It features a new object (color 0). The same copy and color change is apparent. I confirm that a shift (upward) is involved here too.\n\n*   **Ex 3:** I'm seeing multiple patterns or \"objects\". Now I'm starting to visualize a \"shift\" or copy operation with a color change. I trace this across the entire grid and note it is happening again. It looks like the same copy operation with changes in pixel color!\n\n*   **Generalizing the Rule:** It seems the rule always is to \"shift up 5 rows\". I analyze what happens when objects overlap with copies - there's a color hierarchy involved, I think. Then, if an object lands on the same position as the shift, there's a specific action.\n\n*   **Rule Refinement:** I think I have it: Non-background objects (a connected set of non-7s) are shifted up by 5 rows. The shifted copy has all of its non-7 pixels changed to 9. The original pixels, if there's a match, get overridden based on a hierarchy.\n\n*   **The Problematic \"1\":**  The one issue is the color change of \"9\" to \"1\". Is there a hidden rule? Maybe intersection? Or a center thing?\n\n*   **Test Input:** The test input reveals a new challenge: there are two objects. Let's see if the same rule of Shift and merge apply.\n\n*   **Shift, Shift, Shift...** Does it always shift up? It's key now to verify that shift direction. \n\n*   **Reconciling the Shift:** Ah, it appears that the horizontal shift amount is dependent on *where* the object is. \n*   **A \"Shift (-5, 0)\" Transformation:** It looks like for some colors, the shift rule is a simple vertical upward shift of five and no horizontal displacement.\n*   **The Overlap Problem:**  I also have the rule for what happens when a copied element lands on top of an existing one. And this appears to be the most complex portion to generalize.\n*   **Focus, the Shift is the key:** I'm not giving up on my shift plan.  For some cases, objects \"align\" to the left? Perhaps the rule is the shift + some horizontal adjustment.  The colors appear to be playing a role in the correct shift rules. I will try to verify.\n*   **Re-evaluating Overlap (and 6 in particular):** I get it!  The new color rules in an overlap state are the tricky part. For test input, I try to assume what the overlap is and how it behaves.  I'll work it out for the color 6 pixels to generalize.\n*   **Test: I have the general framework!** Now, I am testing to write a robust model based on my learnings in the examples and Test Input and the 9 (shift-5 color) behavior.\n*   **Applying the rules to create a matrix:**  I've come up with a rule! It involves a shift in the position of colors. It appears to be based on the general pattern and color type. I will construct the rules using all input pixels on new grid positions.\n*   **Applying the rules:**  I'm trying it out. Applying the model.\n*   **Final Verification:** Almost there, just a few quick checks before I can confidently produce the answer. Looks good!\n\n\nThe transformation rule inferred from the examples is as follows:\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all non-background (non-7) pixels in the grid.\n2.  **Shift and Copy:** For every identified pixel at position $(r, c)$, create a \"copy\" at position $(r-5, c)$. In other words, shift the pattern upwards by 5 rows.\n    *   Note: In Example 3 (Red/2 pixels), the shift was $(-5, -5)$, likely because the pattern was on the right and required centering or a specific alignment. However, in Examples 1 (Maroon/9) and 2 (Black/0), the shift was $(-5, 0)$. The Test Input (Magenta/6) shares the vertical alignment characteristics of Example 2 (the bottom object is directly below the top object), so a shift of $(-5, 0)$ is applied.\n3.  **Apply Color Change:** The copied pixels take the color 9 (Maroon), regardless of the source color (unless the source was 0, where in Ex 2 the copies were 9).\n4.  **Merge with Existing Grid:**\n    *   If the target position $(r-5, c)$ contains the background color (7), replace it with the copy color (9).\n    *   If the target position contains an existing object pixel (6 in this case):\n        *   Based on Example 3, the incoming copy (9) overwrites the existing mutable color (2). We assume 6 behaves like 2, so the intersection becomes 9.\n        *   Example 2 showed 0 was immutable, but 6 is likely mutable like 2.\n    *   If the source pixel is out of bounds after shifting (i.e., $r < 5$), it is discarded.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Top Object (Rows 2-8):**\n    *   Pixels from Row 5 shift to Row 0.\n    *   Pixels from Row 6 shift to Row 1.\n    *   Pixels from Row 7 shift to Row 2. (Overlap with existing R2).\n    *   Pixels from Row 8 shift to Row 3. (Overlap with existing R3).\n    *   Pixels from R2, R3, R4 shift off-grid (rows -3, -2, -1) and are lost.\n\n*   **Bottom Object (Rows 13-15):**\n    *   Pixels from Row 13 shift to Row 8. (Overlap with existing R8).\n    *   Pixels from Row 14 shift to Row 9.\n    *   Pixels from Row 15 shift to Row 10.\n\n*   **Detailed Row Changes:**\n    *   **Row 0:** Receives copy of R5 (6s at 9, 14). Becomes `...9...9...`.\n    *   **Row 1:** Receives copy of R6 (6s at 8, 10). Becomes `...9...9...`.\n    *   **Row 2:** Existing `...6...` (at 2) and `...6...6...` (at 8, 10). Receives copy of R7 (6 at 2). Intersection at 2 becomes 9. Result: 9 at 2; 6 at 8, 10.\n    *   **Row 3:** Existing `...6,6...` (at 1, 2) and `...6...6...` (at 9, 14). Receives copy of R8 (6s at 1, 3). Intersection at 1 becomes 9. New 9 at 3. Existing 6 at 2, 9, 14 remains. Result: 9 at 1; 6 at 2; 9 at 3; 6 at 9, 14.\n    *   **Row 8:** Existing `...6...6...` (at 1, 3). Receives copy of R13 (6 at 4). Result: 6 at 1, 3; 9 at 4.\n    *   **Row 9:** Existing empty. Receives copy of R14 (6s at 3, 5, 8, 9, 14). Result: 9s at those positions.\n    *   **Row 10:** Existing empty. Receives copy of R15 (6s at 9, 13, 15). Result: 9s at those positions.\n\noutput:\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,9,7,9\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Final Thoughts on ARC Task Solution**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The goal is to solve this ARC problem by analyzing the examples and figuring out the rule for transforming the input grid into the output. It looks like we're dealing with 16x16 grids, predominantly orange (7) with these patterns of other colors. My job is to figure out the rule.\n\n**Initial Assessment:**\n\nThe examples are key. Let's see. The first example (Ex 1) gives us a background and these 'V' or triangle shapes made of maroon (9). The pattern at the bottom is definitely key.  I looked for repeating patterns there. I focused on tracing the non-orange pixels, the 'V' shapes at the bottom. The output has *mostly* the same pattern. But wait, new non-background pixels show up on one row.\n\n**Deep Dive on Example 1:**\n\nIn Example 1, I saw an \"L\" shape too, but, mostly the V pattern. I noted that these new pixels in the output are actually 5 rows up from parts of the V shape. I noticed that for Example 1, there was a shift pattern (-5, 0) -- it's 5 rows up. Also, the output shows a different color in the new spot. So there's a shift and a *color change* happening here. It's not just moving the pattern, but moving key parts of the original pattern. Also, it's not simply moving a row up because it does not copy the entire \"V\". I thought about what could be at the new row and, the \"peak\" of the V. In Example 1, The L shape at the top seemed to cause the change of color, but that hypothesis didn't hold.\n\n**Key Observation: Peak Movement**\n\nOkay, then I started to think that the shift pattern is key. And, maybe, the new color depends on the old color? Also, maybe, there's a *shift* in the original pattern. Okay, now I have to figure out the rule of the shift vector and color change.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis**\n\nMoving to Example 2, there was the same format. In Ex 2 I had an input full of black 'V's. The output had a *similar* pattern made of maroon (9). The same -5 rows shift was happening. But, in this example, the background was all 7s, so, where's the overlap? In Example 2 it seemed like the shift was also (-5, 0) for these upside-down 'V's at the bottom of the grid. It looks like it follows the same process, copy the peak/top and shift up five rows. So, maybe that's it!\n\n**Example 3 Analysis**\n\nMoving to Example 3, there's a different input shape. Now the colors are red and there's a repetitive pattern. But it's not 'V's anymore! What's key is the shift vector is no longer (-5, 0), it's now (-5, -5). Aha! The new shapes are shifted diagonally, 5 rows and 5 columns!\n\n**Shift Vector Hypothesis and Pattern Analysis**\n\nI spent a lot of time trying to understand the vector shift and why it varied. Was there a special shape, an outlier? Is it because the shapes are different in Examples 3? Or, is it just about symmetry? And, the *colour* change? So maybe all that's important is *the key point* of each pattern. Maybe it's about the shape of the patterns!\n\n**The General Rule Emerges**\n\nBased on the three examples, I have the key rule. To transform the input to the output:\n\n*   **1. Identify key points/patterns in the input.**\n*   **2. Figure out the *shape* of key patterns.**\n*   **3. Determine a shift vector** and change colors of the new pixel. The color change *is not always the same!*\n\n*   The \"shift\" is (-5, 0), *if* the dominant shape is symmetric!\n*   The \"shift\" is (-5, -5), *if* the shape is not symmetric!\n\nSo, I had to find a rule! The shift, it seems, has to do with how the pattern looks (e.g. Is it symmetric? Is there a key coordinate, etc). It's all about how these key points move.\n\n**Test Input Application**\n\nOkay, now let's go! Time to apply this to the test input. It's magenta (6), but, I have to find the pattern. I looked at the magenta pixels and identified V shapes! And, there are a lot of V's. I used\n\nThe objective is to identify the transformation rule from the input to the output grids based on the provided examples and apply it to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of Solved Examples:**\n\n1.  **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** Background is Orange (7). There are Maroon (9) shapes at the bottom (rows 14-16) and one \"L\" shape at the top (rows 3-4). The bottom shapes are three \"V\" patterns (inverted triangles). The peaks of these \"V\"s are at (14,1), (14,7), and (14,14).\n    *   **Output:** New pixels appear in row 9. Specifically at (9,1), (9,7), and (9,14). The pixel at (9,7) is Blue (1), while others are Maroon (9). These positions correspond exactly to shifting the peaks of the \"V\" shapes **up by 5 rows** (Row 14 -> Row 9). The \"L\" shape does not appear to generate a corresponding output in the grid (likely because shifting it up would place it out of bounds).\n    *   **Rule inferred:** Identify \"V\" shapes, take their peak coordinate $(r, c)$, and mark the output at $(r-5, c)$ with Maroon (9) (with a special case for the middle one becoming Blue in this symmetric arrangement).\n\n2.  **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** Background is Orange (7). Black (0) shapes are scattered in the bottom half. These are \"V\" shapes (peaks at 10,1; 12,4; 13,11; 14,1; 14,7) and one at (11,8).\n    *   **Output:** New Maroon (9) pixels appear exactly 5 rows above the peaks of the Black \"V\" shapes. For instance, the peak at (10,1) results in a Maroon pixel at (5,1). The peak at (11,8) results in a Maroon pixel at (6,8).\n    *   **Rule confirmation:** Identify \"V\" shapes, shift their peaks **up by 5 rows** ($r-5$), and place a Maroon (9) pixel.\n\n3.  **Example 3:**\n    *   **Input:** Background is Orange (7). Red (2) \"Gamma\" shapes (2x2 block missing bottom-right).\n    *   **Output:** New Maroon (9) pixels appear. The transformation here is a shift **Up 5 and Left 5** ($r-5, c-5$). For example, a shape at (6,5) produces a pixel at (1,0).\n    *   **Synthesis:** The shift vector depends on the shape type. Symmetric \"V\" shapes pointing up use a vector of $(-5, 0)$. Asymmetric \"Gamma\" shapes pointing top-left use $(-5, -5)$.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Shapes:** The test input contains Magenta (6) shapes on an Orange (7) background. We look for the dominant shape type, which matches the \"V\" shapes from Examples 1 and 2 (a peak pixel on top, with two 'leg' pixels diagonally below).\n    *   Scanning the grid, we find 4 such \"V\" shapes:\n        1.  Peak at **(5, 9)**. Legs at (6,8), (6,10).\n        2.  Peak at **(7, 2)**. Legs at (8,1), (8,3).\n        3.  Peak at **(13, 4)**. Legs at (14,3), (14,5).\n        4.  Peak at **(14, 14)**. Legs at (15,13), (15,15).\n    *   There are other fragments (e.g., at (2,2), (2,8), (14,8)), but they form different shapes (Triangles, Inverted Vs, Gammas) which are singular instances and likely ignored in favor of the repeated \"V\" pattern, or simply don't fit the \"Upright V\" rule established in Ex 1 and 2.\n\n2.  **Apply Transformation:**\n    *   The shape is the symmetric \"Upright V\".\n    *   The shift rule for this shape is **Up 5 rows** ($r \\to r-5, c \\to c$).\n    *   The marker color is **Maroon (9)**.\n\n3.  **Calculate Destinations:**\n    *   (5, 9) $\\to$ **(0, 9)**\n    *   (7, 2) $\\to$ **(2, 2)**\n    *   (13, 4) $\\to$ **(8, 4)**\n    *   (14, 14) $\\to$ **(9, 14)**\n\n4.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   Copy the input grid.\n    *   Place a Maroon (9) pixel at the calculated destinations.\n    *   Note: At (2,2), the input has a Magenta (6) pixel. The new Maroon (9) pixel will overwrite it (consistent with Example 3 where overlap occurred).\n    *   No Blue (1) pixels are generated because there is no symmetric central arrangement of shapes as in Example 1.\n\n**Output Grid Details:**\n*   Row 0, Col 9 becomes 9.\n*   Row 2, Col 2 becomes 9.\n*   Row 8, Col 4 becomes 9.\n*   Row 9, Col 14 becomes 9.\n*   All other pixels remain identical to the input.\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6",

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "First I'll describe the pattern I inferred from the examples, then apply it to the test grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Inferring the rule from the examples\n\nAll examples have:\n\n- Background color 7\n- One \u201cobject\u201d color (9, 0, or 2)\n- New 9s (and once a 1) being added in otherwise empty areas\n\n### 1.1. The key shape: a \u201cV\u201d of the object color\n\nIn Examples 1 and 2, if you look at the non\u20117 cells, there is a recurring 3\u2011cell pattern shaped like a downward \u201cV\u201d:\n\nPattern (object color `X`):\n\n- Apex at `(r, c)` is `X`\n- Two diagonal neighbors one row below are `X`:\n  - `(r+1, c-1)` = `X`\n  - `(r+1, c+1)` = `X`\n\nExample 2 (color 0):\n\n- At `(10,1)`: `(11,0)` and `(11,2)` are 0 \u21d2 a V\n- At `(11,8)`: `(12,7)` and `(12,9)` are 0 \u21d2 a V\n- At `(12,4)`: `(13,3)` and `(13,5)` are 0 \u21d2 a V\n- At `(13,11)`: `(14,10)` and `(14,12)` are 0 \u21d2 a V\n- At `(14,1)`: `(15,0)` and `(15,2)` are 0 \u21d2 a V\n- At `(14,7)`: `(15,6)` and `(15,8)` are 0 \u21d2 a V\n\nExample 1 (color 9, bottom rows):\n\n- At `(14,1)`: `(15,0)` and `(15,2)` are 9 \u21d2 V\n- At `(14,7)`: `(15,6)` and `(15,8)` are 9 \u21d2 V\n- At `(14,14)`: `(15,13)` and `(15,15)` are 9 \u21d2 V\n\n### 1.2. What happens to each V\n\nFor each such V apex at `(r, c)` in Examples 1 and 2:\n\n- The output places a 9 exactly 5 rows above, same column: at `(r-5, c)`\n\nCheck example 2:\n\n- V at `(10,1)` \u2192 output has 9 at `(5,1)`\n- V at `(11,8)` \u2192 9 at `(6,8)`\n- V at `(12,4)` \u2192 9 at `(7,4)`\n- V at `(13,11)` \u2192 9 at `(8,11)`\n- V at `(14,1)` \u2192 9 at `(9,1)`\n- V at `(14,7)` \u2192 9 at `(9,7)`\n\nEverything else is unchanged.\n\nExample 1:\n\n- V at `(14,1)` \u2192 9 at `(9,1)`\n- V at `(14,7)` \u2192 marker at `(9,7)` (shown as 1 in the example, but structurally it is exactly where a 9 would go)\n- V at `(14,14)` \u2192 9 at `(9,14)`\n\nAgain, all other cells (object cells included) remain as in the input.\n\n### 1.3. Example 3\n\nExample 3 has no such V\u2011patterns of the object color (2); instead it has a different 3\u2011cell \u201cL\u201d pattern, and another layer of behavior. But:\n\n- Our test grid clearly contains V\u2011patterns,\n- And wherever Vs appear in the training set (Examples 1 & 2), they are the motif used for placing 9s, leaving the original object cells unchanged.\n\nSo for the test, we follow the V\u2011pattern rule.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying the rule to the test input\n\n### 2.1. Find all Vs of color 6\n\nObject color in the test is 6. We look for apexes `(r, c)` such that:\n\n- `grid[r][c] == 6`\n- `grid[r+1][c-1] == 6`\n- `grid[r+1][c+1] == 6`\n\nScanning the grid yields these apexes:\n\n1. `(5, 9)`:\n   - `(6,8) = 6` and `(6,10) = 6` \u21d2 V\n2. `(7, 2)`:\n   - `(8,1) = 6` and `(8,3) = 6` \u21d2 V\n3. `(13, 4)`:\n   - `(14,3) = 6` and `(14,5) = 6` \u21d2 V\n4. `(14, 14)`:\n   - `(15,13) = 6` and `(15,15) = 6` \u21d2 V\n\nNo other 6 satisfies the V condition.\n\n### 2.2. Place 9s 5 rows above each V\n\nFor each V apex at `(r, c)`, set output cell `(r-5, c)` to 9:\n\n1. `(5, 9)` \u2192 `(0, 9)` becomes 9\n2. `(7, 2)` \u2192 `(2, 2)` becomes 9\n3. `(13, 4)` \u2192 `(8, 4)` becomes 9\n4. `(14, 14)` \u2192 `(9, 14)` becomes 9\n\nAll other cells are copied from the input unchanged.\n\nNote: In this task, one of the projected positions `(2,2)` was originally 6; by analogy with the training Vs (where there was no overlap constraint given), we still overwrite with 9.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\nIn Example 1 and 2, there are upward-pointing arrow shapes (like `9` on top, `9 _ 9` below). The transformation places markers (usually 9) exactly 5 rows above each arrow's tip position.\n\nIn Example 1, there's also an L-shape pattern at the top, and the markers are placed at the midpoint row between the L-shape and arrows. One marker is 1 instead of 9 (the \"middle\" arrow gets 1).\n\n**Identifying patterns in test input:**\n\nUpward arrows (V-shapes pointing up):\n1. Rows 5-6, cols 8-10: tip at (5, 9)\n2. Rows 7-8, cols 1-3: tip at (7, 2) \n3. Rows 13-14, cols 3-5: tip at (13, 4)\n4. Rows 14-15, cols 13-15: tip at (14, 14)\n\nL-shapes:\n- Rows 2-3, cols 1-2 (position (2,2) has a 6)\n- Rows 14-15, cols 8-9\n\n**Applying transformation:**\n\nPlace markers 5 rows above each arrow tip:\n- (5,9) \u2192 marker at (0,9) = 9\n- (7,2) \u2192 marker at (2,2), but position already has 6 from L-shape, so no change\n- (13,4) \u2192 marker at (8,4) = 9  \n- (14,14) \u2192 marker at (9,14) = 9\n\nThe output keeps all original 6s and adds 9s at the calculated positions where the space was originally 7.\n\n```\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Example 1**: V-patterns (pointing down) at the bottom get markers 5 rows above their apexes. There's also a different pattern (L-shape) that targets one V, making its marker a \"1\" instead of \"9\".\n\n2. **Example 2**: Multiple V-patterns at various rows, each gets a \"9\" marker 5 rows above the apex. No isolated pattern means all markers are 9.\n\n3. **Example 3**: L-shaped patterns repeat at certain rows. An isolated L-shape's marker position (5 rows up, 5 columns left) overlaps with one of the repeating L-shapes, changing it to 9s. Markers are placed for each repeating pattern.\n\n**Key rules:**\n- Find V-patterns (pointing down) and place markers 5 rows above their apexes\n- \"Isolated\" patterns (different shapes like L-shapes, inverted Vs) target Vs at column (isolated_col - 5)\n- Targeted Vs get marker \"1\" instead of \"9\"\n\n**Analyzing test input:**\n\nV-patterns pointing down:\n- Col 2 (rows 7-8): apex at (7, 2) \u2192 marker at (2, 2)\n- Col 4 (rows 13-14): apex at (13, 4) \u2192 marker at (8, 4)\n- Col 9 (rows 5-6): apex at (5, 9) \u2192 marker at (0, 9)\n- Col 14 (rows 14-15): apex at (14, 14) \u2192 marker at (9, 14)\n\nIsolated patterns:\n- L-shape at cols 8-9 (rows 14-15): reference col 9 \u2192 targets col 9-5 = col 4\n- V pointing UP at col 9 (rows 2-3): targets col 9-5 = col 4\n- Zigzag at cols 13-14 (rows 3-5): reference col 14 \u2192 targets col 14-5 = col 9\n\n**Result:**\n- V at col 4: targeted \u2192 marker \"1\"\n- V at col 9: targeted \u2192 marker \"1\"  \n- V at col 2: not targeted \u2192 marker \"9\"\n- V at col 14: not targeted \u2192 marker \"9\"\n\n```\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Below is the reasoning I used, followed by the final output grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Observed pattern from the examples\n\n### a. Background and signal colors\nIn all examples:\n\n- The grid is 16\u00d716, with **7 as background**.\n- There is **one other \u201csignal\u201d color** in each input:\n  - Example 1: signal = 9\n  - Example 2: signal = 0\n  - Example 3: signal = 2\n- The output introduces a **new marking color**:\n  - If 9 is *not* used as a signal, the new markings are 9.\n  - If 9 *is* the signal color (example 1), a different color (1) is used for at least some of the markings, so as not to confuse old vs. new.\n\n### b. What gets moved / marked?\n\nLooking at examples 1 and 2 (the vertical case):\n\n- For the signal color cells, only **some** of them are used to produce new marks.\n- These \u201cused\u201d signal cells have a clear local property:\n\n> A signal-color cell is a \u201ctip\u201d if, in the **previous row**, neither of its two diagonal neighbors (up-left and up-right) are signal-colored.\n\nFormally, cell at (r, c) is a tip if:\n- grid[r][c] == signalColor, and\n- grid[r-1][c-1] != signalColor (or c == 1), and\n- grid[r-1][c+1] != signalColor (or c == 16).\n\nCheck this on example 2 (signal = 0):\n- The zeros at:\n  - (11,2), (12,9), (13,5), (14,12), (15,2), (15,8)\n  - are exactly those with **no diagonal-zero neighbors above**.\n- These are exactly the ones that produce 9\u2019s in the output.\n\nCheck on example 1 (signal = 9):\n- Among the 9\u2019s, the \u201ctip\u201d ones are:\n  - (4,13), (5,13), (15,2), (15,8), (15,15).\n- Of those, only the ones with r > 5 give in-bounds targets when moved 5 up:\n  - (15,2) \u2192 (10,2)\n  - (15,8) \u2192 (10,8)\n  - (15,15) \u2192 (10,15)\n- These are exactly the three new marks in row 10.\n\n(In example 3 there is also a diagonal variant, but in the test input there are *no* signal-color pairs separated by (5,5), so we only need the **vertical** behavior for this test.)\n\n### c. How are the tips moved?\n\nIn the vertical examples (1 and 2), each chosen \u201ctip\u201d cell at (r, c):\n\n- is mapped to a new mark at **(r - 5, c)** (5 rows upward, same column),\n- as long as r - 5 \u2265 1 (inside the grid).\n\nColor of the new mark:\n- If 9 is not already used as a signal color, use 9 for the marks.\n- In the test, signal color = 6, so we\u2019ll use 9.\n\nWe also allow overwriting existing colors at the target (example 3 shows overwriting of signal color by 9; there is nothing in the training that forbids overwriting).\n\n---\n\n## 2.

        "Full raw LLM response": "Sure! Let's walk through the pattern and apply it to the test case:\n\n**Understanding the Rules:**\n\n1. The rule checks whether there are any rows from row 5 onward (0-indexed) that contain horizontally adjacent non-background cells. If there are none (as in our test), then the transformation is applied with no horizontal shift.\n   \n2. For rows with non-adjacent non-background cells:\n   - If the row is even-numbered: select the first run of non-background cells, then continue selecting runs as long as the gap between consecutive runs is at least 5 columns. Stop if the gap is smaller.\n   - If the row is odd-numbered: select only the rightmost run of non-background cells in that row.\n   - Each selected run is copied upward by 5 rows, in the same column, changing its value to 9.\n   \n3. The bottom row (row 15) isn't involved in the transformation.\n\n**Applying the Rules:**\n\nHere are the runs in the test input and the results after applying the rule:\n\n- **Row 5 (odd):** runs at 9 and 14 \u2192 select 14 \u2192 copy to row 0, col 14.\n- **Row 6 (even):** runs at 8 and 10 \u2192 select 8 \u2192 copy to row 1, col 8.\n- **Row 7 (odd):** run at 2 \u2192 select 2 \u2192 copy to row 2, col 2.\n- **Row 8 (even):** runs at 1 and 3 \u2192 select 1 \u2192 copy to row 3, col 1.\n- **Row 13 (odd):** run at 4 \u2192 select 4 \u2192 copy to row 8, col 4.\n- **Row 14 (even):** runs at 3,5,8,9,14 \u2192 select 3 \u2192 copy to row 9, col 3.\n\nAll copied values are set to 9.\n\n**Final Output Grid:**\n\n```\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "To solve this task we look at how the training examples differ from their inputs. Two distinct mechanisms show up:\n\n* New `9` markers are inserted a fixed 5 rows above certain source rows. The source rows are determined by adjacency in the input: in examples\u202f1 and\u202f2 the marked source cells are those that have a diagonally adjacent cell of the same colour in the following row. In example\u202f3 there are horizontal runs of the same colour; in that case markers are placed for the horizontal run instead, shifted 5 rows up and 5 columns left. If a row contains multiple runs only the left\u2013hand start of each run is marked; if it contains a single run of length 2 both endpoints are marked. Rows that receive such horizontal markers are flagged, and diagonal markers into a flagged row are suppressed.\n\n* The markers do not overwrite existing non\u2011background cells: a candidate diagonal marker is skipped if the target cell is not background. For the horizontal markers we also propagate down one cell: if a horizontal marker lands above an input non\u2011background cell, that cell is turned into a `9` as well.\n\nApplying this combined rule to the test grid, there is one horizontal run at row\u202f14, columns\u202f8\u20139, so we place horizontal markers at row\u202f9, columns\u202f3 and\u202f4. Diagonal adjacencies produce candidates at (0,9), (2,2), (8,4), (9,8) and (9,14); the row\u202f9 candidates are suppressed because row\u202f9 already has horizontal markers, and (2,2) is skipped because it is not background. The remaining diagonal markers go to (0,9) and (8,4). Propagation does not add anything further.\n\nThe final output is therefore the input grid with `9`s inserted at (0,9), (8,4), (9,3) and (9,4):\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6",
