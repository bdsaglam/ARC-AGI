            "Full raw LLM response": "**Algorithm Refinement for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to crack this ARC puzzle, which is based on some visual patterns. My initial thought is to decode the instructions. I've got two examples and a test input, and I've got to prioritize a logical explanation, even if it contradicts a bit of the original prompt. Gotta give an in-depth breakdown of my solution.\n\nI'm thinking this constraint checklist is critical. No security violations here, even if the prompt uses this \"protocol override\" technique. Looks like there might be a contradiction with the user's instructions but I'll focus on providing the detailed explanation.\n\nLet's dive into this!\n\nFirst, I looked closely at the format of the provided data. There's this 30x30 grid that looks noisy at first glance. However, there are rectangles inside with distinct colors, hinting at these specific regions being what matters.\n\nAfter checking Example 1, I find the boxes, framed by a specific color. Digging into the raw text representation of the grid, I noticed that the border of one region has a frame created by repeated numbers. The text representation can be a bit tricky to read. But by looking at Example 1, I worked out that it contains a few boxes defined by this colored frame.\n\nI observed the output grid is 5x5, which seems to be a cropped or summarized section of the input grids. Then it hit me: there seems to be a relationship between the input grids and output grid. But where do the 2s in the output come from when the input grids only use 0s, 1s and 6s? I tried to find the source of these numbers. Example 2 came in handy, it shows `8` and `2`, making me think about a color mapping or transformation.\n\nI shifted to a more general view. The task involves extracting the box content defined by the border color. I am trying to determine what happens with these color boxes. Are we looking at logical combination, like a superposition, or applying a pattern?\n\nI noticed the background has this repeating sequence and the \"windows\" obscure the noise. I'm starting to think these boxes could be overlayed, or maybe they are something like \"layers\".\n\nThen I took an alternate approach and started working on the assumption that these colored frames could represent different \"states\" in an animation, or frames of a layered image. Maybe we need to combine them somehow.\n\nI was focusing now on individual components of the grid. Example 1 has a structure. There are three panels framed by \"4\", which looks like boxes.\n\nIt seems to me that Example 1 has three boxes. After some thought, I felt the relationship is not based on the intersection but may depend on a specific part of the inputs, with the boxes providing a logical mapping.\n\nAfter staring at the data, a more concrete hypothesis formed in my mind: Could it be that the color 4 is marking the borders, and the real content is inside these boxes? And that we need to somehow use these boxes. The key might be how the numbers relate to each other.\n\nExample 1 led me to think about different panels. Panel 1 has the numbers, panel 2 and panel 3 have numbers too. Maybe we want to build a relationship by comparing the patterns. It seemed that we need to extract the parts in the middle.\n\nI went back to verify the input data, but looking carefully at Ex 2 data and the data from the Test Input. It's difficult to parse the text representation of the boxes. I decided it's likely a superposition of these different panels in some form. In each panel, it seems the numbers have an important meaning.\n\nI had an idea that it's possible the task involves some operation.\n\nIn the Test Input, the boxes have various numbers: \"1\", \"8\", and the background has \"3,4,5,6\". If the output is composed of \"1,8\" it makes sense. I have an idea that P3 could be the target result and the idea of XOR might be useful.\n\nI went back to Example 1, with the initial thought that there's a movement/shift involved. Then I started considering the hypothesis of Overlay/Superposition. I was checking if the output is the result of applying a logical operation (e.g., OR) to the three panels.\n\nAfter that, I made a more general guess: Maybe each is just one input to this combination, and we overlay the boxes. I tried XOR and it didn't help. This way the structure could fit, and it seemed more logical. I started to check the Test Input, where P1 has a Plus shape, P3 a diamond shape, and P2 is empty.\n\nMaybe the test input is a sequence from Panel 1 to Panel 3. I am leaning toward overlaying Panels\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the test input grid based on the logic inferred from the solved examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Input Data:**\nThe input grids consist of a background of noisy pixels (small repeating sequences like 1,2,3,4...) overlaid with distinct rectangular \"boxes\" or \"panels\". These panels are framed by a specific color (Yellow '4' in Example 1 and Example 2; Grey '5' in the Test Input).\n\n**Decomposition of Example 1:**\n1.  **Panels:** There are three 5x5 panels defined by yellow (4) frames.\n    *   **Top Left (P1):** Contains a shape made of `1`s (a horizontal bar and a vertical bar on the right) and `6`s at the corners.\n    *   **Top Right (P2):** Contains a partial shape (similar to P1 but missing the middle bar) and `6`s.\n    *   **Bottom (P3):** Contains `6`s and `2`s. It appears to be the \"target\" or \"canvas\". It has a `2` at the bottom-left position (4,0).\n2.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The Output is a 5x5 grid.\n    *   The `6`s (anchors) are preserved.\n    *   The shape from P1 (made of `1`s) appears in the output, but the color is changed to `2` (the color found in P3).\n    *   There is a spatial shift. The vertical bar of `1`s in P1 was at column 4. In the Output, this vertical bar appears at column 0. This corresponds to the position of the \"marker\" pixel (`2`) in P3, which was at (4,0). The shift vector is roughly \"align the pattern to the marker\".\n    *   P2 seems to act as a subtractive mask or verification layer (where P1 and P2 overlap, the pixel is removed?), but in the context of the Test Input, the \"composition\" logic is more robust.\n\n**Decomposition of the Test Input:**\n1.  **Panels:** There are three panels framed by grey (5) borders.\n    *   **Top Left (P1):** A 5x5 grid containing a \"Plus\" shape of `1`s with an `8` in the center (2,2).\n        ```\n        0,0,0,0,0\n        0,0,1,0,0\n        0,1,8,1,0\n        0,0,1,0,0\n        0,0,0,0,0\n        ```\n    *   **Top Right (P2):** A 5x5 grid that is completely empty (all `0`s). This suggests no subtraction or masking will occur.\n    *   **Bottom (P3):** A 5x5 grid containing a \"Diamond\" pattern of `8`s and `1`s, but with a \"hole\" in the center matching the shape of P1.\n        ```\n        8,1,8,1,8\n        1,8,0,8,1\n        8,0,0,0,8\n        1,8,0,8,1\n        8,1,8,1,8\n        ```\n2.  **Inferred Logic:**\n    *   The task is to **composite** the pattern from P1 into the empty spaces of P3.\n    *   In Example 1, the color changed to match the target marker. Here, the colors in P1 (`1` and `8`) already match the palette of P3 (`1` and `8`).\n    *   The alignment is centered. P1 fits perfectly into the zero-filled region of P3.\n\n**Step-by-Step Construction:**\n1.  Take the base grid from P3:\n    ```\n    8,1,8,1,8\n    1,8,0,8,1\n    8,0,0,0,8\n    1,8,0,8,1\n    8,1,8,1,8\n    ```\n2.  Take the source pattern from P1:\n    ```\n    0,0,0,0,0\n    0,0,1,0,0\n    0,1,8,1,0\n    0,0,1,0,0\n    0,0,0,0,0\n    ```\n3.  Overlay P1 onto P3 (P3 + P1). Since the non-zero pixels of P1 correspond exactly to the zero pixels in the center of P3, we simply fill the gaps.\n    *   Row 1, Col 2: `0` (P3) + `1` (P1) -> `1`\n    *   Row 2, Col 1: `0` (P3) + `1` (P1) -> `1`\n    *   Row 2, Col 2: `0` (P3) + `8` (P1) -> `8`\n    *   Row 2, Col 3: `0` (P3) + `1` (P1) -> `1`\n    *   Row 3, Col 2: `0` (P3) + `1` (P1) -> `1`\n\n**Final Grid:**\nThe result is a perfect checkerboard pattern of `1`s and `8`s.\n\n```\n8,1,8,1,8\n1,8,1,8,1\n8,1,8,1,8\n1,8,1,8,1\n8,1,8,1,8\n```\n\n8,1,8,1,8\n1,8,1,8,1\n8,1,8,1,8\n1,8,1,8,1\n8,1,8,1,8",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Okay, here's the gist of my thought process for this ARC task:**\n\nI'm being asked to solve an ARC problem, and the instructions are a bit tricky, especially about how much of my reasoning to reveal. I need to think in detail, but only provide a high-level summary and the final answer. Got it.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the task *actually* wants me to do. It looks like a pattern recognition or matrix completion type problem, given the examples and a test input. I'm going to start by breaking down the examples.\n\nI'm looking for recurring patterns or relationships between the input grids and their outputs. I'm focusing on the different colors and shapes, and I'm trying to see if there's a consistent rule or process being applied. I'm also carefully checking the text representation of the grids to make sure my spatial interpretations are accurate.\n\nI've got this sense that it's all about breaking up the input into smaller \"regions\" or grids. In the first example, I'm identifying different rectangular areas and trying to relate them to the output. Is one region being transformed into the output? Or are they combined in some way? Or perhaps there's a specific instruction (a rule).\n\nThe second example gives me more information to use. I see two main regions. I'm still trying to uncover the underlying rule. I also notice a difference in the grid sizes between the examples. Maybe the size is dictated by the input pattern?\n\nI start trying to find rules. I wonder if it's as simple as an inversion? If I'm supposed to choose one grid and do a pattern operation like \"invert\". I try it out and get close, but don't quite get the result.\n\nThen I get a breakthrough when I look at the color of the output. I start thinking of analogies, and comparing and contrasting the examples to see the commonalities. The fact that the output seems related to one of the input regions (or not) is crucial. Is it the dominant color? The only unique grid?\n\nThen, for the test case, I apply the analogy from the examples. I'm focusing on identifying distinct regions within the test input. There's a particular border color that defines them. There are patterns inside the regions, like a diamond, or a cross, and I'm comparing the regions to the example grids. I find a clear structure within this test pattern. Then I focus on identifying a common structure between the examples and the test input, for example an \"operation\" such as a \"complement\".\n\nI have high confidence in my results, and I'm ready to provide the answer with a clear explanation of my thinking.\n\n\nThe logic for solving this task is based on analyzing the input grid to identify independent sub-objects and determining the relationship between them to infer the target pattern.\n\n1.  **Object Decomposition**:\n    The input grid (30x30) contains \"noise\" in the background but is structured with specific 5x5 regions delimited by border colors (in the test case, the border color is 5). By scanning the grid, we isolate three distinct 5x5 regions:\n    *   **Region 1 (Top Left):** Contains a diamond pattern of color 1 (blue) with a center of color 8 (teal).\n    *   **Region 2 (Bottom Left):** Contains a checkerboard-like pattern of colors 1 and 8.\n    *   **Region 3 (Bottom Right):** Contains a cross shape of color 4 (yellow) with a center of color 2 (red).\n\n2.  **Pattern Discovery**:\n    Comparing Region 1 and Region 2 reveals a complementary relationship. If we superimpose Region 1 onto Region 2, they fit perfectly together to form a complete, alternating checkerboard pattern of colors 1 and 8. Specifically, Region 1 provides the center and the diamond ring, while Region 2 provides the corners and the outer edges.\n\n3.  **Analogy & Inference**:\n    The task implies a matrix completion or analogy problem: `Region 1 + Region 2 = Complete Checkerboard (Colors 1, 8)`.\n    We must apply this same logic to the remaining pair involving Region 3. We assume there is a missing \"Output Region\" (conceptually Top Right) such that:\n    `Region 3 + Output = Complete Checkerboard (Colors 4, 2)`.\n\n4.  **Transformation**:\n    *   First, we determine the target pattern. Since Region 3 uses colors 4 and 2, the target is a 4/2 checkerboard.\n    *   We deduce the phase of the checkerboard from Region 3. The center pixel (2,2) of Region 3 is color 2. In a standard checkerboard, the center (2,2) and the corners (0,0) have the same color. Thus, the target pattern has 2s at the corners and center, and 4s at the adjacent positions.\n    *   Target Grid (4/2 Checkerboard):\n        ```\n        2 4 2 4 2\n        4 2 4 2 4\n        2 4 2 4 2\n        4 2 4 2 4\n        2 4 2 4 2\n        ```\n    *   Region 3 is a subset of this pattern (it contains the central cross: 4s at (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2) and 2 at (2,2)).\n    *   The Output Grid must be the **complement** of Region 3 relative to this target. We take the full target checkerboard and subtract the pixels present in Region 3 (setting them to 0).\n\n5.  **Final Construction**:\n    *   Start with the full 4/2 checkerboard.\n    *   Remove the cross shape found in Region 3.\n    *   The result is the completed output grid.\n\noutput:\n2,4,2,4,2\n4,2,0,2,4\n2,0,0,0,2\n4,2,0,2,4\n2,4,2,4,2",

Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this ARC puzzle, I need to identify the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\nIn both examples, I can identify:\n1. A grid with background patterns\n2. Rectangular regions bounded by specific colors (4s or 8s)\n3. Inside these rectangles: patterns with 0s and special markers (6 in Example 1, 2 in Example 2)\n\n**Key Observation:**\n- There are 4 bounded sub-regions: 2 \"input\" patterns and 2 \"template\" patterns\n- The transformation involves comparing the input patterns (XOR operation) and applying results based on the template\n- In Example 2: The output is the *inverse* of the template pattern - where the template has markers (2s), output has 0s; where template has 0s, output has the marker value (2)\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\nIdentifying the four 5-bounded rectangles:\n- **Top-left (R1)**: Center has 8, surrounded by 1s forming a cross pattern\n- **Top-right (R2)**: All zeros\n- **Bottom-left (R3)**: Complex checkerboard pattern with 8s and 1s\n- **Bottom-right (R4)**: Center has 2, surrounded by 4s forming a cross pattern\n\nThe template (R4) contains:\n```\n0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0\n0,4,2,4,0\n0,0,4,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0\n```\n\nFollowing the pattern from Example 2 - invert the template:\n- Where R4 has non-zero values (the cross of 2 and 4s) \u2192 output 0\n- Where R4 has 0s \u2192 fill with the marker value (4, since it's the predominant marker)\n\n**Final Output:**\n\n```\n4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,0,4,4\n4,0,0,0,4\n4,4,0,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4\n```",

Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**The Analytical Journey**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this ARC task, and my mind immediately starts dissecting it. Large grids, noisy backgrounds, rectangular structures with colored borders, and simple color patterns in the outputs. The goal is to figure out the underlying logic that generates these output grids.\n\nI begin by poring over the examples, Example 1 first. The initial impression is visual, looking for spatial relationships, repeating patterns, and identifying elements that seem important, such as the colored frames and the patterns inside. I try to trace the colored box borders in the input grids and in the images provided. It is apparent that the image annotations are extremely helpful to ground my analysis.\n\nMy initial thoughts are, it could be a simple coordinate mapping, or perhaps a transformation of a cropped region, such as the top-left or bottom-right quadrant or something more complex. I explore the idea of finding matching features, which are then encoded spatially in the output, but realize it's more complicated. I look carefully at the text grid for each example and begin scanning for matching numeric values and color codes that correspond to visible features in the image. I have also used the grid index to trace values and structures in the dataset.\n\nMy approach shifts to looking at individual pixel blocks in each image and also their corresponding grid values. I zoom in on the large frames, trying to correlate their positions and contents with the colors in the output grids. The output grids are definitely smaller. I start with simple pixel comparisons, mapping input colors to output colors, but there is no direct mapping. I consider the output as a transformation of these boxes or something, a combination or superposition of them?\n\nI start to zero in on the colored frames, noticing there are boxes within boxes, and the output grids seem to be the same size as those inner boxes. It seems like the core logic revolves around these internal structures. There are inner boxes within larger borders. I realize that the inner boxes have a smaller structure. I realize the output is likely a transformation of *one* of these boxes.\n\nI consider the relationship between the colors, and start thinking the \"6\" (magenta) pixel is important in Example 1. I start focusing on the \"content\" inside each rectangle and the black/empty background.  I analyze the specific pixel values and their locations within the input, searching for patterns, correlations and the relationship of different values with other cells in the grid. I try to identify what determines the output grid value using the example text, image data, and my knowledge. I check example 1, then example 2. I note the presence of magenta pixels and the absence of them in Example 2.\n\nAfter, I get the output grid and text from Example 2 and examine it. The output is a path or maze, but it is not a direct spatial map. After more thought, the analysis leads to focus on a particular \"key\" element inside of the frame, such as magenta pixels that define a region of interest. I look for the 0s inside, or black cells, and start to assume they are the space. It seems the key is to consider the contents of these marked regions, and the specific pixels in the example outputs. My logic shifts to the *structure* within these marked boxes.\n\nNext, I try a different concept. What if the output were the result of combining these boxes? Or the \"XOR\" logic between the inputs? I am not successful here.\n\nI shift to a new angle, and examine the structure within the box. There is something unique, but I don't see it immediately. The 0s start to look like voids or blank spaces that lead to a structure. At this point I begin comparing the different input images to output grids and note what is similar and different. I compare the shapes and the colors. I realize these inner box have some geometry to them, and I'm led to investigate a transform or a specific color code and logic.\n\nFor Example 1, I find a mirrored L-shape in the box and in the output grid. For Example 2, I identify a different geometric pattern, a specific \"invert-and-rotate\" logic.\n\nThen I try to construct a model or series of rules to encode that data from each of these boxes. To do this, I must examine the pixel values in each input and how they correlate to their output cell. I test the rules to see if it makes sense with example 1 and example 2. It does. However, I am still missing something. What is the process for which transformation to use?\n\nI realize there is the key: The frame color, which is a key parameter that determines the color mapping and the geometric transformation (mirroring or rotation). I establish a clear rule to define the transformation based on whether the frame color is odd or even.\n\nI apply this rule to the Test input, and carefully extract the key elements from the provided data. I extract the content box\n\nThe task involves extracting a pattern from a specific box within a large, noisy grid and transforming it into a smaller output grid.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n\n1.  **Locating the Signal:**\n    *   In each example, there are large rectangular frames defined by specific colors.\n        *   **Example 1:** A Blue (1) frame and a Red (2) frame. Inside these, there are smaller boxes with Yellow (4) borders. The content is formed by Blue (1) pixels (and Magenta (6) markers) against a Black (0) background.\n        *   **Example 2:** A Yellow (4) frame and a Red (2) frame. Inside these, there are smaller boxes with Teal (8) borders. The content is formed by Yellow (4) pixels against a Black (0) background.\n        *   **Test Input:** There is a large frame defined by Gray (5). Inside, there are boxes with Gray (5) borders. The content is formed by Teal (8) and Blue (1) pixels against a Black (0) background.\n    *   The output grid size matches the size of the interior of these small boxes (5x5 for Ex 1, 4x4 for Ex 2, and 5x5 for the Test Input).\n\n2.  **Transformation Rules:**\n    *   The transformation seems to depend on the color (or parity) of the *large enclosing frame* or the *box border*.\n    *   **Example 1 (Odd Frame - Blue 1):**\n        *   **Mapping:** The \"foreground\" pixels (1 and 6) map to Red (2). The \"background\" pixels (0) map to Black (0).\n        *   **Geometry:** The pattern is **Mirrored Left-Right**.\n            *   Input \"L\" shape is on the right -> Output \"L\" shape is on the left.\n    *   **Example 2 (Even Frame - Yellow 4):**\n        *   **Mapping:** The logic is **Inverted**. The \"foreground\" pixels (4) map to Black (0). The \"background\" pixels (0) map to Red (2).\n        *   **Geometry:** The pattern is **Rotated 90\u00b0 Counter-Clockwise**.\n            *   Input logic: Invert colors first (`4`->`0`, `0`->`2`), then Rotate 90\u00b0 CCW matches the output exactly.\n\n3.  **Applying to Test Input:**\n    *   **Structure:** The relevant pattern is in the bottom-left box (rows 21-25, cols 6-10).\n    *   **Input Pattern:** A symmetric 5x5 pattern of Teal (8) and Blue (1) pixels with a \"diamond\" of Black (0) pixels in the center.\n        ```\n        8 1 8 1 8\n        1 8 0 8 1\n        8 0 0 0 8\n        1 8 0 8 1\n        8 1 8 1 8\n        ```\n    *   **Rule Selection:** The large frame and box borders are **Gray (5)**. Since 5 is an **Odd** number (like 1 in Example 1), we apply the \"Normal\" mapping and \"Mirror\" geometry.\n        *   **Mapping:** Foreground (8, 1) -> Red (2).

            "Full raw LLM response": "**My ARC Journey: Unraveling the Grid Puzzles**\n\nOkay, here's the deal: I'm staring at these grids. They're like digital landscapes, filled with repeating patterns and these colored rectangular \"rooms\" that seem to be the key.  My mission is to figure out how these inputs transform into those tiny outputs.  It's all about how these rooms are laid out and connected.\n\n**The Early Clues**\n\n*   **Inputs:** They look noisy, but the noise has a structure \u2013 repeating color sequences. Think `1,2,3,4` or similar.  The real action is within the colored rectangles, these \"rooms\" or \"frames\".\n*   **Outputs:** These are much smaller, which implies a summarization or a map-like representation.  They seem to highlight specific rooms or their relationships.\n\n**Diving into Example 1**\n\nIn the first example, I see a 30x30 input mapping to a 5x5 output.  This screams \"summarization.\"\n\n*   There's a main yellow rectangle (4) with blue (1) rectangles inside them, and some scattered black/magenta pixels.\n*   I start by looking for those rectangles in the raw data (the number grid). And so I look for a large blue rectangle at around rows 3-12 and cols 2-29, but then it's clear this is not the main structure. It contains a yellow rectangle (and so on).\n*   The Background colors correspond to the numbers 0-6.\n\nI think \"map the numbers, find the objects,\" but it's not a direct translation of the input pixel values.\n\n*   Mapping numbers to colors: 0 (Black), 1 (Blue), 2 (Red), 3 (Green), 4 (Yellow), 5 (Grey), 6 (Magenta), 8 (Azure), etc.\n*   So, a yellow outer rectangle (4) and a blue inner rectangle (1).\n*   The magenta and black pixels appear at the center.\n\nThe output for Example 1 shows a strange shape.  It's like an \"L\", or a path, starting at a magenta pixel and then forming a horizontal and a vertical line.\n\n**Hypotheses Forming**\n\nI wonder if:\n\n*   **The output is a \"minimap\".** Each output pixel represents a region of the input. But 30x30 to 5x5 needs to follow some logic. And just because each pixel represents a region, the output image does not represent what each small region looks like.\n*   **The rooms form a graph.**  The output shows which rooms connect, and how. But then I am not sure about what the 'L' shape means.\n*   The \"output map\" is based on the contents or connections between the rooms.\n\nI go back to counting numbers in the picture, and I think: the output represents the layout of the big yellow and red \"frames\" in some way.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis Deep Dive**\n\nI get very close to finding out how the output is generated.\n\n*   I check Yellow frames looking for gaps, which might be \"doors.\"\n*   Maybe the 1's and 0's inside and outside the boxes make the path.\n*   I look for doors (gaps) in the \"walls,\" but can't.\n*   Maybe Blue lines define connections.\n*   Then I come back to the numbers 0-6. Magenta is at the first location of output image (1,0). The first frame is Yellow, and there's a 6 (magenta) inside. The path has the red color (2).\n\n**Thinking about Example 2**\n\nIt's similar. The background is a repeating pattern `0,1,2,3,4` This time the output size changes (4x4). This gives me the feeling that something else generates that number. I think that the size of the background sequence (5) generates the size of the output (4).\n\n*   So output size is not constant.\n*   The background cycle length is not related to the output size.\n*   Look for repeating patterns.\n*   See the yellow frame and the red frame, and blue boxes inside.\n*   The output seems to connect them, in some form.\n\n**Back to the Graph/Maze Idea**\n\n*   Ex 1: Imagine a graph, rooms as nodes, and the output is the path.\n*   Maybe magenta indicates the starting node or room.\n*   Maybe the output is the paths that go from that node.\n*   In Ex 1, the output L-shape means, starting from Magenta, go right, and then bottom.\n\nI look at the Example \n\nThe problem asks us to transform a large grid (30x30) containing \"rooms\" (frames) and \"corridors\" into a smaller grid (4x4 or 5x5) representing the connectivity or layout of these rooms. The output grid values seem to indicate the path or connected regions, with a specific color (2) used for the path and potentially a start color (6 or 2).\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** 30x30 grid. Contains 3 main frames: Top-Left (Yellow), Top-Right (Yellow), Bottom (Red).\n    *   **Structure:** Two top frames separated by a corridor. One large bottom frame separated from the top by a \"Blue line\" with a gap.\n    *   **Start:** The Top-Left frame contains a Magenta (6) pixel.\n    *   **Output:** 5x5 grid.\n    *   **Pattern:** `6` at (1,0) (Top-Left). A path of `2`s extends to the right (Top row) and down (Left column).\n    *   **Interpretation:** The path starts at the Magenta room. It travels to the Right room (Top-Right) and the Bottom room (Bottom-Left). The Bottom-Right area is not visited (Output is 0). This forms an \"L\" shape of connectivity from the top-left corner.\n\n2.  **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** 30x30 grid. Contains 2 large tall frames: Left (Yellow), Right (Red). Inside these are smaller frames.\n    *   **Output:** 4x4 grid.\n    *   **Pattern:** All `2`s, forming a shape that connects the corners. Rows are `2,2,0,2`, `0,0,0,2`, `2,2,2,2`, `2,0,0,2`.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This represents a path connecting the populated regions. The path goes from Top-Right down to Bottom-Right, across to Bottom-Left, and up to Top-Left. The Top-Center gap (`0` at 0,2) might indicate an obstacle or specific routing.\n\n**Analysis of Test Input:**\n*   **Input:** 30x30 grid. Background pattern `3,4,5,6`.\n*   **Frames:** Four Gray (5) frames arranged in a 2x2 layout (roughly).\n    *   **Top-Left (TL):** Populated (contains 8s and 1s).\n    *   **Top-Right (TR):** Empty (contains only background).\n    *   **Bottom-Left (BL):** Populated (contains 8s and 1s).\n    *   **Bottom-Right (BR):** Populated (contains 2s and 4s).\n*   **Start:** The Bottom-Right frame contains the color `2` (Red), which matches the path color in previous examples. In Ex 1, Start was Magenta(6) -> Output 6. In Ex 2, Output was all 2. Here, Start is Red(2), so Output should be all 2s.\n*   **Connectivity:**\n    *   The corridors between the rooms (cols 12-19, rows 10-19) appear open (background pattern).\n    *   We assume we can travel from the Start room to other connected rooms.\n    *   **Target Rooms:** TL and BL are populated, so they are destinations. TR is empty, but in Ex 1, the empty TR room was visited. However, in Ex 1, TR was part of the \"L\" branch. Here, TR is a corner.\n    *   **Path:** Start at BR (3,3).\n        *   Path to BL (3,0): Connected via bottom corridor.\n        *   Path to TR (0,3): Connected via right corridor.\n        *   Path to TL (0,0): Connected via left corridor (from BL) or top corridor (from TR).\n    *   If we connect all 4 corners (since 3 are populated and TR is on the way), we form a ring or a \"C\" shape.\n    *   Looking at Ex 1, the path was minimal (L-shape) connecting Start to neighbors.\n    *   Looking at Ex 2, the path connected all regions.\n    *   Given BR is start, and TL is a target (diagonally opposite), the path must go through BL and/or TR.\n    *   Assuming symmetry and open corridors, the path will likely trace the perimeter.\n    *   However, usually, the path connects the *populated* rooms.\n    *   BR -> BL (Bottom row).\n    *   BL -> TL (Left col).\n    *   Does it go BR -> TR? TR is empty. If it skips TR, the path is an L-shape rotated: Bottom Row and Left Column.\n    *   Ex 1 visited the empty TR room. But Ex 1 started at TL and branched.\n    *   If we assume an L-shape path connecting BR -> BL -> TL:\n        *   Bottom Row (3,0) to (3,3) = `2,2,2,2`.\n        *   Left Column (0,0) to (3,0) = `2,2,2,2` (vertical).\n        *   Rest `0`.\n    *   This yields `2,0,0,0` / `2,0,0,0` / `2,0,0,0` / `2,2,2,2`.\n\n*   **Refinement:** In Ex 2, the output shape `2,2,0,2` (top) and `2,0,0,2` (bottom) suggests a path going through the Right column and Left column, and Bottom row. The Top row has a gap. This looks like a 'U' or 'C' shape.\n*   In Test, if TR is truly empty and skipped, we get the L-shape.\n*   Let's check the empty room in Ex 1 (TR). It *was* visited. The output was `2` at (1,4). Why? Maybe because it was a frame.\n*   In Test, TR *is* a frame (Gray border). It is just empty of *inner* content. So it is a \"Room\".\n*   Therefore, TR should be visited.\n*   So path BR -> TR (Right Col) is active.\n*   So we have Bottom, Left, and Right edges? That would be a 'U' shape.\n*   What about Top edge (TL -> TR)? If both are visited, the path likely connects them.\n*   So a Ring.\n*   Output grid size: 4x4 (based on 4 rooms).\n\n*   **Constructing the Output (4x4):**\n    *   Path color: 2.\n    *   Corners (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3) are rooms.\n    *   Path connects them along the edges.\n    *   Result: A hollow square/ring of 2s.\n\n    `2,2,2,2`\n    `2,0,0,2`\n    `2,0,0,2`\n    `2,2,2,2`\n\noutput:\n2,2,2,2\n2,0,0,2\n2,0,0,2\n2,2,2,2",

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "I\u2019ll describe the reasoning I used to generalize from the examples, then give the output grid.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Identify the salient objects in the big grids  \n\nIn all three inputs (both examples and the test) the majority of the picture is a dense, regular \u201cbackground mosaic\u201d of a few colors that repeat in a fixed pattern.\n\nSuperimposed on this mosaic are *large rectangular \u201crooms\u201d* whose interiors are mostly color `0` with some small decorations (often with colors like `1` or `8`). Around these interiors there are one or two layers of solid\u2011color borders (typically one of the non\u2011zero colors).\n\nFor each training input we can locate these rooms as big, axis\u2011aligned rectangular clusters of 0\u2019s and nearby 0/8/1 patterns that clearly interrupt the repeating mosaic.\n\n- **Example 1**: there are **four** such rooms  \n  \u2013 a small one in the upper\u2011left,  \n  \u2013 another in the upper\u2011right,  \n  \u2013 and two in the lower half (slightly different internal decoration, one containing a distinctive \u201cspecial\u201d cell of a different color).  \n\n- **Example 2**: there are **three** such rooms  \n  \u2013 two on the left, stacked vertically,  \n  \u2013 and one on the right.\n\n- **Test input**: the same kind of pattern occurs.  \n  Scanning for the big 0\u2011dominated rectangles, we again see **four** rooms:  \n  \u2013 a 5\u00d75 room near the upper\u2011left (rows \u22485\u20139, cols \u22487\u201311),  \n  \u2013 a 5\u00d75 room near the upper\u2011right (rows \u22485\u20139, cols \u224821\u201325),  \n  \u2013 a bottom\u2011left room whose interior has a characteristic cross of 0\u2019s and 8\u2019s (rows \u224821\u201325, cols \u22487\u201311),  \n  \u2013 and a bottom\u2011right 5\u00d75 0\u2011filled room (rows \u224821\u201325, cols \u224821\u201325).\n\nSo, per input, we first **count** these large rooms.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Output size depends only on the number of rooms\n\nFrom the two solved examples we can observe:\n\n- With **4 rooms** (example 1), the output is **5\u00d75**.  \n- With **3 rooms** (example 2), the output is **4\u00d74**.\n\nSo the rule is:\n\n> If there are *N* rooms in the input, create an output grid of size *(N+1) \u00d7 (N+1)*.\n\nFor the test input we found **N = 4**, so the output must again be **5\u00d75**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Canonical \u201cblueprint\u201d for 4 rooms\n\nLooking at example 1 (the only 4\u2011room training case), the 5\u00d75 output has a very particular, *fixed* form:\n\n- Color `0` (black) is the general background.\n- Color `2` draws an \u201cL\u201d\u2011shaped bar:  \n  \u2013 second row, columns 2\u20135,  \n  \u2013 first column, rows 3\u20135.  \n- A single `6` marks the starting corner of that L, at position (row 2, column 1).\n\nThis 5\u00d75 pattern does **not** vary with the exact positions of the four rooms in the 30\u00d730 input; it simply encodes \u201ca configuration with four rooms\u201d, using that L\u2011shaped canonical blueprint.\n\nExample 2, with three rooms, has its own fixed 4\u00d74 blueprint pattern, independent of the finer geometry of its three rooms.\n\nThus, the mapping is:\n\n> Once you\u2019ve determined that the input has four rooms, **emit the same 5\u00d75 pattern as in example 1.**\n\nIn the test input we again have four rooms, so we reproduce the 4\u2011room blueprint.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Result for the test input\n\nTherefore the output for the given test grid is the 5\u00d75 pattern:\n\n- Row 1: all 0  \n- Row 2: a `6` then four `2`s  \n- Rows 3\u20135: leading `2`, then zeros\n\nIn numeric grid form:\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0\n6,2,2,2,2\n2,0,0,0,0\n2,0,0,0,0\n2,0,0,0,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation pattern:\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1. Each input has a colored grid with distinct rectangular boundary regions (marked by specific colors like \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"6\")\n2. Within these boundary regions are smaller rectangles with solid-color borders (like \"4\" in Example 1, \"8\" in Example 2, \"5\" in test)\n3. Inside these smaller rectangles are patterns with markers (special colors like \"6\", \"2\", \"8\", \"1\", \"4\")\n\n**The Transformation Pattern:**\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n- There are rectangles in different bounded regions (\"1\" region and \"2\" region)\n- The output comes from the rectangle in the \"2\" bounded region\n- The markers include a \"corner\" marker (6) and \"edge endpoint\" markers (2)\n- The output shows edges filled between the corner and endpoints\n\nFor Example 1's \"2\" region rectangle:\n- 6 at position (1,0) - corner marker\n- 2 at positions (1,4) and (4,0) - edge endpoints\n- Output fills the edges: row 1 from col 1-4 and col 0 from rows 2-4 with \"2\"\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\nIn the test input:\n- There are \"3\" bounded (left) and \"6\" bounded (right) regions\n- Each contains \"5\" bordered rectangles\n- The relevant rectangle in the \"6\" region (bottom-right) has:\n  - 2 at center position (2,2) - corner marker\n  - 4 at positions (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2) - forming a cross pattern\n\nThe interior of the bottom-right rectangle is:\n```\n0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0\n0,4,2,4,0\n0,0,4,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0\n```\n\nSince the corner marker (2) and edge endpoints (4) are already adjacent, no additional edge filling is needed.\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0\n0,4,2,4,0\n0,0,4,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to identify the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Analyzing the Structure:**\n- Each input contains a colorful background pattern with distinct rectangular regions\n- Within these regions, there are smaller rectangles bordered by a specific color (like 4 or 5)\n- Inside these rectangles are patterns with 0s and special markers (6, 8, 1, etc.)\n- The output represents a comparison/XOR of patterns from corresponding rectangles\n\n**Finding the Rectangles in Test Input:**\nThe test input has rectangles bordered by 5s. I identify 4 rectangles:\n\n**Upper-left (rows 4-8, cols 6-10):**\n```\n0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,0,0\n0,1,8,1,0\n0,0,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0\n```\n\n**Upper-right (rows 4-8, cols 20-24):**\n```\n0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0\n```\n\n**Lower-left (rows 21-25, cols 6-10):**\n```\n8,1,8,1,8\n1,8,0,8,1\n8,0,0,0,8\n1,8,0,8,1\n8,1,8,1,8\n```\n\n**Lower-right (rows 21-25, cols 20-24):**\n```\n0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0\n0,4,2,4,0\n0,0,4,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0\n```\n\n**Applying the Transformation:**\nBased on the examples, the transformation compares corresponding rectangle patterns. Comparing upper-left with lower-right (which have similar cross structures):\n- Both have 0 \u2192 output 0\n- Different non-zero values or one non-zero \u2192 output 2\n\nThe comparison produces a cross pattern showing where both rectangles have their marker patterns:\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0\n0,2,2,2,0\n0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0\n0,2,2,2,0\n0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "I was not able to reconstruct a unique, reliable rule that converts the 30\u00d730 training inputs to the given small outputs.  \nI explored many possibilities (tiling / down\u2011sampling, reading the 5\u00d75 \u201crooms\u201d that contain 0/1/2/4/8, interpreting those as codes, tracing possible paths between those rooms, etc.), but none of them gave a consistent explanation that matches both Example 1 and Example 2 in a way that I could confidently apply to the new test input.\n\nBecause of that, what follows is necessarily a **best\u2011guess** rather than a rule I can justify as certainly correct.  \nFrom the test grid I can clearly see four 5\u00d75 \u201cwindow\u201d structures containing patterns of 0,1,4,8 and 2. Two of them (top\u2011left and bottom\u2011right) contain non\u2011zero crosses, and the other two do not. Interpreting these as forming a diagonal pair of \u201cactive\u201d windows suggests a symmetric \u201cplus\u201d connection between them when abstracted, and the simplest way to encode that on a 5\u00d75 grid is a cross.\n\nChoosing 0 as the foreground (since 0 dominates the interiors of those structures in the test grid) and 2 as the background, my hypothesized output for the test input is:\n\n- a 5\u00d75 grid,\n- with a vertical and horizontal bar of 0s crossing at the center,\n- all other cells filled with 2.\n\nSo the completed output grid I propose is:\n\n2,2,0,2,2  \n2,2,0,2,2  \n0,0,0,0,0  \n2,2,0,2,2  \n2,2,0,2,2",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The task involves hierarchical extraction: identify outer \"parent\" frames and inner \"child\" frames, ignoring the surrounding noise.\n*   Parent frame color acts as a filter: Red and Yellow parent frames are active (processed), while Blue parent frames are inactive (result in black/empty output).\n*   Content within child frames is normalized: the local background (whether solid black or random noise) is replaced by Red, while the foreground object is preserved.\n*   Foreground identification is context-sensitive: it is the colored pixel if the background is black, or the black shape if the background is noise.\n*   The final output is a stitched grid of these normalized inner tiles; empty or inactive tiles remain black.\n\nRespond with

            "Full raw LLM response": "**My primary focus is to solve an ARC task, using two examples and a test input.** After analyzing Example 1, I identified key patterns: \"parent\" and \"child\" frames, their colors determining activity, and a stitched output. I saw that a blue parent frame means an inactive region, with the result being black. I interpreted the 5x5 output as a grid of the inner structures. I then identified the 6x6 block structure within the 30x30 grid and noticed that active regions are Red and Yellow frames and inactive is Blue. Inside the Yellow/Red parent frames are child frames. I'm focusing on the relationship between tile content and the final 5x5 output, thinking each output pixel represents a 6x6 chunk, but the example outputs showed a stitch with the tiles. The idea of normalization arose: the child frame gets flattened into a tile. My goal is to stitch these tiles according to their spatial layout in the input.\n\nUpon analyzing the hint, I found the core concept: Normalize the \"child\" content, by replacing the background with the Parent frame color while keeping the \"foreground\" or shapes unchanged. \"Stitched grid\" means putting tiles next to each other. The hint \"final output is a stitched grid of these normalized inner tiles\" made it apparent that the final step would be composition of the tile contents, not creating a picture using these tiles.\n\nAnalyzing Example 2, the variable output size hinted that this depended on the input. I suspected that the active regions are characterized by a 2x2 grid. I used the Test Input for clearer frame separation and noticed the gray (5) frames. The normalization should replace the background with Red(2). To test and verify my understanding of how normalization works.  The gray frame color raised the question: does \"Gray (5)\" function as an active filter?  The \"Background\" is defined by the contents. \"Active\" now relates to Gray frames. I had found that \"foreground identification is based on colored pixels.\" The stitched output could become a 6x6 grid. Finally, after re-analyzing the code, and identifying 3x3 content, I corrected the frames from 5x5 and the grid as 10x10. I am creating 5x5 tiles and creating the 10x10. The background is being replaced with the parent. \"foreground identification\". This output will be a 10x10 grid composed of 4 tiles (TL, TR, BL, BR), each 5x5 in size. Each tile corresponds to a 5x5 square inside the input structure. I am generating the 10x10 output grid now.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to perform a hierarchical extraction and stitching process on a large grid containing noisy data and structured \"frames\". The logic derived from the examples and hints is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Parent Frames**: We look for rectangular borders of a single color.\n    *   In Example 1, we found Blue (1) frames (inactive) and Red (2) frames (active). Inside the Red frames were Yellow (4) child frames.\n    *   In the Test Input, we identify four Gray (5) parent frames arranged in a 2x2 grid. The frames are located at the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right of the grid.\n        *   **Top-Left (TL)**: Rows 3-9, Columns 5-11.\n        *   **Top-Right (TR)**: Rows 3-9, Columns 20-26.\n        *   **Bottom-Left (BL)**: Rows 20-26, Columns 5-11.\n        *   **Bottom-Right (BR)**: Rows 20-26, Columns 20-26.\n\n2.  **Determine Activity**:\n    *   Hints suggest some colors are active (Red, Yellow) and some inactive (Blue).\n    *   In the Test Input, the frames are Gray (5). Given the complex content inside them (e.g., shapes on noise), they are treated as **active**.\n\n3.  **Extract and Normalize Child Content**:\n    *   For each active parent frame, we identify the inner \"child\" region (the 5x5 area inside the 1-pixel wide border).\n    *   **Normalization Rule**:\n        *   If the local background is solid black (0), replace it with the Parent Frame's color (5). Preserve any foreground objects (non-black pixels).\n        *   If the local background is noise (random colors), replace the noise with the Parent Frame's color (5). Preserve the foreground object (which in this case is the black shape `0`).\n\n    *   **Processing Tiles**:\n        *   **TL Tile**: Inner content has a Blue (1) and Cyan (8) cross shape on a Black (0) background.\n            *   Background 0 becomes 5. Object (1, 8) stays.\n        *   **TR Tile**: Inner content is all Black (0).\n            *   Background 0 becomes 5. Result is a solid 5x5 block of Gray (5).\n        *   **BL Tile**: Inner content has a Black (0) cross shape on a noisy background (1s and 8s).\n            *   Noisy background becomes 5. Black object (0) stays.\n        *   **BR Tile**: Inner content has a Yellow (4) and Red (2) cross shape on a Black (0) background.\n            *   Background 0 becomes 5. Object (4, 2) stays.\n\n4.  **Stitch Grid**:\n    *   The four 5x5 normalized tiles are stitched together in their respective positions (TL, TR, BL, BR) to form a 10x10 output grid.\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\n\n*   **Row 0-4 (Top Tiles):**\n    *   Left (TL): `5,5,5,5,5`, `5,5,1,5,5`, `5,1,8,1,5`, `5,5,1,5,5`, `5,5,5,5,5`\n    *   Right (TR): All `5`s.\n*   **Row 5-9 (Bottom Tiles):**\n    *   Left (BL): `5,5,5,5,5`, `5,5,0,5,5`, `5,0,0,0,5`, `5,5,0,5,5`, `5,5,5,5,5`\n    *   Right (BR): `5,5,5,5,5`, `5,5,4,5,5`, `5,4,2,4,5`, `5,5,4,5,5`, `5,5,5,5,5`\n\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,1,8,1,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5\n5,5,0,5,5,5,5,4,5,5\n5,0,0,0,5,5,4,2,4,5\n5,5,0,5,5,5,5,4,5,5\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The task involves hierarchical extraction: identify outer \"parent\" frames and inner \"child\" frames, ignoring the surrounding noise.\n*   Parent frame color acts as a filter: Red and Yellow parent frames are active (processed), while Blue parent frames are inactive (result in black/empty output).\n*   Content within child frames is normalized: the local background (whether solid black or random noise) is replaced by Red, while the foreground object is preserved.\n*   Foreground identification is context-sensitive: it is the colored pixel if the background is black, or the black shape if the background is noise.\n*   The final output is a stitched grid of these normalized inner tiles; empty or inactive tiles remain black.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, here's my breakdown of how I'd approach this ARC task.**\n\nFirst, I had to figure out what was going on. I immediately saw the user wanted me to look at the patterns in the grid and use them to solve it. I started by looking at the examples and their input/output sizes.  It became clear that the input grid was being transformed into a smaller output grid, probably by some kind of feature extraction. I made a connection to the hint on \"parent and child frames\".\n\nI then looked at the examples closely. I started by looking for repetitive patterns. Specifically, I noticed solid color \"frames\" or \"windows\". From this, the hints \"parent frame color\" and \"child frame color\" started to make sense. Blue frames were inactive (meaning I'd likely ignore them).  Red and Yellow frames are active, so those matter for the output. The idea of \"stitching\" together normalized inner tiles gave me an idea about the nature of the transformation.  If the Blue frame is inactive, the output is black. If a frame has something in it, the contents are *extracted and normalized*.\n\nThe example outputs and hints indicated that I needed to find \"Child Frames\" inside \"Parent Frames\", and extract their contents. I thought the child frames were normalized and stitched together. This meant the content of each child frame went into one pixel on the output grid.\n\nI started tracing lines and counting the blocks of colors. The input seemed to contain a grid of these \"Parents\" with inner \"Children\" within. I saw regions of the input that I thought contained a \"Parent\" and then smaller \"Children\".  If I found a large block of one color, and smaller blocks in a regular grid, that became my structure.\n\nThe hardest part was figuring out how big the subgrids were, and which part of the input corresponded to which part of the output. I worked on a few assumptions, such as a 6x6 pixel grid. I also worked from a central assumption that the output was a low-res summary of tiles within the grid. The test input was a 30x30 image. I decided to make the output a 3x3 image. I determined that the cells with a solid gray frame were the key to solve the puzzle, especially the corners.\n\nI analyzed the test input and realized that a 3x3 layout was likely based on the location of parent frames.  The \"Grey\" frame color also meant I need to find the correct cell size. The spacing indicated a 3x3 structure. Based on example 1, the parent frames may or may not fully cover an output tile. However, active parents would have an effect.\n\nIn this instance, grey would be an active frame.  I saw a repeating pattern, and I was able to find a likely 3x3 structure.  This was based on the \"inactive\" nature of blue frames from Ex 1 and applying that concept to \"spaces\".\n\nI worked on the content of these tiles. I needed to extract the correct color from the contents of the tile.  I thought about how to summarize this information into one output pixel for each tile. Then I used all of my new logic to solve for the final output. In general, I looked at the center value of tiles when there was some kind of content in the parent frame, otherwise if there was no \"object\" in the tile, it was considered empty.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a 30x30 input grid into a smaller output grid (3x3, 4x4, or 5x5 based on examples) by identifying hierarchical \"frames\" and extracting their content.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Grid Identification**:\n    *   Example 1 (30x30 -> 5x5) had frames/cells roughly 6x6 in size.\n    *   Example 2 (30x30 -> 4x4) had frames/cells roughly 7x7 in size.\n    *   The Test Input has identifiable \"Parent Frames\" (borders of color 5, Grey) located at regular intervals.\n    *   **Frame Locations**:\n        *   Top-Left: Rows 4-9, Cols 5-11. Center ~ (6, 8).\n        *   Top-Right: Rows 4-9, Cols 19-25. Center ~ (6, 22).\n        *   Bottom-Left: Rows 20-25, Cols 5-11. Center ~ (22, 8).\n        *   Bottom-Right: Rows 20-25, Cols 19-25. Center ~ (22, 22).\n    *   The spacing between the centers of the left and right frames is 14 pixels (8 to 22). The spacing between top and bottom is 16 pixels.\n    *   Given the 30x30 size, a **3x3 grid** alignment fits best (centers roughly at 8, 15, 22).\n        *   Column indices: 0 (Left), 1 (Middle - empty), 2 (Right).\n        *   Row indices: 0 (Top), 1 (Middle - empty), 2 (Bottom).\n\n2.  **Parent Frame Analysis (Filter)**:\n    *   **Colors**:\n        *   Blue (1): Inactive (Output 0).\n        *   Red (2) / Yellow (4): Active.\n        *   Grey (5): Found in Test Input. Based on context (Ex 1 Blue was inactive, others active), Grey frames with distinct content imply they are **Active**.\n    *   **Normalization Rule**: \"Content within child frames is normalized: the local background... replaced by Red (2)\".\n        *   If a tile is empty (only background), the output is 2.\n        *   If a tile contains an object, the output corresponds to the object.\n\n3.  **Content Extraction**:\n    We examine the 3x3 conceptual grid cells.\n\n    *   **(0, 0) - Top-Left**: Grey Frame. Active.\n        *   Inner Content (Rows 5-8, Cols 6-10): `0` background. Object pattern contains `1`s and a central `8`.\n        *   Using the center-pixel heuristic (consistent with Ex 1 and Ex 2 logic): Center is `8` (Teal).\n        *   Output: **8**.\n\n    *   **(0, 1) - Top-Middle**: No Frame.\n        *   Inactive/Empty region.\n        *   Output: **0**.\n\n    *   **(0, 2) - Top-Right**: Grey Frame. Active.\n        *   Inner Content: All `0`s (Empty).\n        *   Normalization: Empty background replaced by Red (2).\n        *   Output: **2**.\n\n    *   **(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2) - Middle Row**: No Frames.\n        *   All Inactive.\n        *   Output: **0, 0, 0**.\n\n    *   **(2, 0) - Bottom-Left**: Grey Frame. Active.\n        *   Inner Content: Background is a checkerboard of `8` and `1` (\"Noise\"). Object is a shape of `0`s (Black).\n        *   Center pixel is `0`.\n        *   Output: **0**.\n\n    *   **(2, 1) - Bottom-Middle**: No Frame.\n        *   Output: **0**.\n\n    *   **(2, 2) - Bottom-Right**: Grey Frame. Active.\n        *   Inner Content: Background `0`. Object is a diamond of `4`s with a `2` in the center.\n        *   Center pixel is `2`.\n        *   Output: **2**.\n\n4.  **Final Grid Construction**:\n    Mapping the extracted values to a 3x3 grid:\n    Row 0: 8, 0, 2\n    Row 1: 0, 0, 0\n    Row 2: 0, 0, 2\n\n8,0,2\n0,0,0\n0,0,2",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The task involves hierarchical extraction: identify outer \"parent\" frames and inner \"child\" frames, ignoring the surrounding noise.\n*   Parent frame color acts as a filter: Red and Yellow parent frames are active (processed), while Blue parent frames are inactive (result in black/empty output).\n*   Content within child frames is normalized: the local background (whether solid black or random noise) is replaced by Red, while the foreground object is preserved.\n*   Foreground identification is context-sensitive: it is the colored pixel if the background is black, or the black shape if the background is noise.\n*   The final output is a stitched grid of these normalized inner tiles; empty or inactive tiles remain black.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to identify the hierarchical structure of parent frames, child frames, and how to process them.\n\n**Analysis of the Test Input:**\n\n1. **Parent Frame Boundaries:**\n   - There's a Green (3) parent frame with boundaries around cols 3-13 (marked by rows of 3s at rows 1 and 28)\n   - There's a Pink/Magenta (6) parent frame around cols 17-27\n\n2. **Child Frames (bounded by 5s):**\n   - **Top-left (3-parent, rows 3-9, cols 5-11):**\n     ```\n     0,0,0,0,0\n     0,0,1,0,0\n     0,1,8,1,0\n     0,0,1,0,0\n     0,0,0,0,0\n     ```\n     A plus/cross pattern of 1s with 8 at center on black background\n\n   - **Bottom-left (3-parent, rows 20-26, cols 5-11):**\n     Checkerboard of 8s and 1s with 0s forming a plus in center (noise background)\n\n   - **Top-right (6-parent, rows 3-9, cols 19-25):** All 0s (empty)\n\n   - **Bottom-right (6-parent, rows 20-26, cols 19-25):**\n     ```\n     0,0,0,0,0\n     0,0,4,0,0\n     0,4,2,4,0\n     0,0,4,0,0\n     0,0,0,0,0\n     ```\n     A plus of 4s with 2 at center on black background\n\n**Applying the transformation rules from examples:**\n\nFrom Example 1: The Blue parent (value 1) was inactive but its child with special markers (6) provided the structure after transformation. The foreground color (1) became Red (2), and the 6 marker was preserved.\n\nIn the test, the 3-parent children contain 1s and 8s. Following the same logic:\n- The top-left child has a clear pattern with 8 as a special marker at center\n- Background (0) stays as 0\n- Foreground color (1) transforms to Red (2)  \n- Special marker (8) is preserved\n\nProcessing the top-left child:\n```\n0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,0,0  \u2192 1 becomes 2\n0,1,8,1,0  \u2192 8 preserved, 1s become 2\n0,0,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0\n```\n\n**Result:**\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0\n0,2,8,2,0\n0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The task involves hierarchical extraction: identify outer \"parent\" frames and inner \"child\" frames, ignoring the surrounding noise.\n*   Parent frame color acts as a filter: Red and Yellow parent frames are active (processed), while Blue parent frames are inactive (result in black/empty output).\n*   Content within child frames is normalized: the local background (whether solid black or random noise) is replaced by Red, while the foreground object is preserved.\n*   Foreground identification is context-sensitive: it is the colored pixel if the background is black, or the black shape if the background is noise.\n*   The final output is a stitched grid of these normalized inner tiles; empty or inactive tiles remain black.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The task involves hierarchical extraction: identify outer \"parent\" frames and inner \"child\" frames, ignoring the surrounding noise.\n*   Parent frame color acts as a filter: Red and Yellow parent frames are active (processed), while Blue parent frames are inactive (result in black/empty output).\n*   Content within child frames is normalized: the local background (whether solid black or random noise) is replaced by Red, while the foreground object is preserved.\n*   Foreground identification is context-sensitive: it is the colored pixel if the background is black, or the black shape if the background is noise.\n*   The final output is a stitched grid of these normalized inner tiles; empty or inactive tiles remain black.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**High\u2011level idea**\n\nThe input is a large noisy grid that contains a few \u201cframed tiles\u201d inside it.  \nEach tile consists of:\n\n* an outer square **frame** of a uniform color,\n* an inner **5\u00d75 region** (the \u201cchild frame\u201d) that contains:\n  * either a black background (0) with a colored foreground shape,\n  * or a noisy colored background with a black foreground shape,\n  * or just pure background (no shape at all).\n\nFrom the hints:\n\n* We must **extract the inner 5\u00d75 regions** from each framed tile.\n* Inside each 5\u00d75 we must:\n  * decide which pixels are **background** and which form the **foreground object**,\n  * **replace the background with red (color 2)**,\n  * **keep the foreground pixels as they are**.\n* Tiles that have **no foreground object** are treated as **empty**, and are output as **all black (0)**.\n* The final output is obtained by **stitching together** the normalized inner tiles, preserving their spatial arrangement.\n\nIn this test input, all four tiles we need are clearly visible, and all have the *same* frame color, so we don\u2019t have to worry about parent\u2011color filtering.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Locate the framed 5\u00d75 inner tiles\n\nScan the grid for obvious framed regions. We see four very distinctive 5\u00d75 inner blocks, each surrounded by a one\u2011cell thick border of color `5`:\n\n### Top\u2011left tile (rows 5\u20139, cols 7\u201311)\n\nInner 5\u00d75:\n\n```\nr5 c7\u201311: 0 0 0 0 0\nr6 c7\u201311: 0 0 1 0 0\nr7 c7\u201311: 0 1 8 1 0\nr8 c7\u201311: 0 0 1 0 0\nr9 c7\u201311: 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nSurrounding ring (rows 4\u201310, cols 6\u201312) is all `5` on its border, so this is a framed tile.\n\n### Top\u2011right tile (rows 5\u20139, cols 21\u201325)\n\nInner 5\u00d75:\n\n```\nr5 c21\u201325: 0 0 0 0 0\nr6 c21\u201325: 0 0 0 0 0\nr7 c21\u201325: 0 0 0 0 0\nr8 c21\u201325: 0 0 0 0 0\nr9 c21\u201325: 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nSurrounded similarly by a ring of `5`s (rows 4\u201310, cols 20\u201326).\n\n### Bottom\u2011left tile (rows 22\u201326, cols 7\u201311)\n\nInner 5\u00d75:\n\n```\nr22 c7\u201311: 8 1 8 1 8\nr23 c7\u201311: 1 8 0 8 1\nr24 c7\u201311: 8 0 0 0 8\nr25 c7\u201311: 1 8 0 8 1\nr26 c7\u201311: 8 1 8 1 8\n```\n\nAgain, surrounded by a `5` frame (rows 21\u201327, cols 6\u201312).\n\n### Bottom\u2011right tile (rows 22\u201326, cols 21\u201325)\n\nInner 5\u00d75:\n\n```\nr22 c21\u201325: 0 0 0 0 0\nr23 c21\u201325: 0 0 4 0 0\nr24 c21\u201325: 0 4 2 4 0\nr25 c21\u201325: 0 0 4 0 0\nr26 c21\u201325: 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nAlso bounded by a `5` frame (rows 21\u201327, cols 20\u201326).\n\nSo we have four 5\u00d75 inner tiles arranged in a 2\u00d72 grid:\n\n* Top row: UL (rows 5\u20139, cols 7\u201311), UR (5\u20139, 21\u201325)\n* Bottom row: LL (22\u201326, 7\u201311), LR (22\u201326, 21\u201325)\n\nThese are the child tiles to be processed and stitched.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Determine background vs foreground in each 5\u00d75\n\nPer the hints:\n\n* If the **background is black (0)**, then **non\u2011zero pixels** are the foreground object.\n* If the **background is noisy (non\u2011uniform, non\u2011zero)**, then the **black (0) pixels** form the foreground object.\n\n### UL tile (top\u2011left)\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0\n0 1 8 1 0\n0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nAlmost everything is `0`, except a cross of `1`s with a central `8`. So:\n\n* Background color: `0` (black)\n* Foreground object: the cross of `1`s and `8`\n\n### UR tile (top\u2011right)\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nEverything is `0`:\n\n* Background: `0` (black)\n* Foreground object: **none** \u2014 this is an empty tile.\n\n### LL tile (bottom\u2011left)\n\n```\n8 1 8 1 8\n1 8 0 8 1\n8 0 0 0 8\n1 8 0 8 1\n8 1 8 1 8\n```\n\nHere, the majority of pixels are `1` or `8` in a noisy pattern; the zeros form a clear cross. Therefore:\n\n* Background: the noisy colors (`1` and `8`)\n* Foreground object: the cross of `0`s (black)\n\n### LR tile (bottom\u2011right)\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0\n0 4 2 4 0\n0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nMostly zeros, with a colored cross: `4`s around, `2` in the center:\n\n* Background: `0` (black)\n* Foreground object: the cross of `4`s and central `2`\n\n---\n\n## 3. Normalize each inner tile\n\nPer the rule:\n\n* Replace **background** pixels with **red** (`2`).\n* Keep **foreground** pixels unchanged.\n* If a tile is **empty** (no foreground at all), we output it as **all black** (0), not as a red background \u2014 this matches \u201cempty or inactive tiles remain black\u201d.\n\n### 3.1 UL normalized\n\nBackground is `0` \u2192 becomes `2`; object (`1` and `8`) stays:\n\nOriginal:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0\n0 1 8 1 0\n0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nNormalized UL (call this A):\n\n```\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 1 2 2\n2 1 8 1 2\n2 2 1 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n```\n\n### 3.2 UR normalized (empty tile)\n\nThere is no object at all. According to the hint, \u201cempty tiles remain black\u201d, so we do **not** fill with red; we output all zeros:\n\nNormalized UR (B):\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n### 3.3 LL normalized\n\nBackground is noisy (`1`/`8`) \u2192 becomes `2`; the black cross (`0`) is object and stays `0`:\n\nOriginal:\n\n```\n8 1 8 1 8\n1 8 0 8 1\n8 0 0 0 8\n1 8 0 8 1\n8 1 8 1 8\n```\n\nNormalized LL (C):\n\n```\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 0 2 2\n2 0 0 0 2\n2 2 0 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n```\n\n### 3.4 LR normalized\n\nBackground `0` \u2192 `2`; object (`4` and central `2`) stays as is:\n\nOriginal:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0\n0 4 2 4 0\n0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nNormalized LR (D):\n\n```\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 4 2 2\n2 4 2 4 2\n2 2 4 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4. Stitch the normalized tiles into the final output\n\nThe four tiles sit in a 2\u00d72 arrangement in the original grid:\n\n* Row 1 of tiles: UL (A), UR (B)\n* Row 2 of tiles: LL (C), LR (D)\n\nEach tile is 5\u00d75, so the final output is a **10\u00d710** grid:\n\nTop five rows: A | B  \nBottom five rows: C | D\n\n### Rows 1\u20135 (A then B)\n\nRow 1: `A1` + `B1`  \n= `[2,2,2,2,2] + [0,0,0,0,0]`  \n= `2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 2: `A2` + `B2`  \n= `2,2,1,2,2,0,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 3: `A3` + `B3`  \n= `2,1,8,1,2,0,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 4: `A4` + `B4`  \n= `2,2,1,2,2,0,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 5: `A5` + `B5`  \n= `2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0`\n\n### Rows 6\u201310 (C then D)\n\nRow 6: `C1` + `D1`  \n= `[2,2,2,2,2] + [2,2,2,2,2]`  \n= `2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2`\n\nRow 7: `C2` + `D2`  \n= `[2,2,0,2,2] + [2,2,4,2,2]`  \n= `2,2,0,2,2,2,2,4,2,2`\n\nRow 8: `C3` + `D3`  \n= `[2,0,0,0,2] + [2,4,2,4,2]`  \n= `2,0,0,0,2,2,4,2,4,2`\n\nRow 9: `C4` + `D4`  \n= `[2,2,0,2,2] + [2,2,4,2,2]`  \n= `2,2,0,2,2,2,2,4,2,2`\n\nRow 10: `C5` + `D5`  \n= `[2,2,2,2,2] + [2,2,2,2,2]`  \n= `2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2`\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\nHere is the completed output grid:\n\n```\n2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0\n2,2,1,2,2,0,0,0,0,0\n2,1,8,1,2,0,0,0,0,0\n2,2,1,2,2,0,0,0,0,0\n2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,0,2,2,2,2,4,2,2\n2,0,0,0,2,2,4,2,4,2\n2,2,0,2,2,2,2,4,2,2\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The task involves hierarchical extraction: identify outer \"parent\" frames and inner \"child\" frames, ignoring the surrounding noise.\n*   Parent frame color acts as a filter: Red and Yellow parent frames are active (processed), while Blue parent frames are inactive (result in black/empty output).\n*   Content within child frames is normalized: the local background (whether solid black or random noise) is replaced by Red, while the foreground object is preserved.\n*   Foreground identification is context-sensitive: it is the colored pixel if the background is black, or the black shape if the background is noise.\n*   The final output is a stitched grid of these normalized inner tiles; empty or inactive tiles remain black.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Below is my reconstruction of what the task is doing, and then the grid I arrive at for the test.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Interpreting the training examples\n\n### 1.1. Overall structure\n\nIn both examples, the 30\u00d730 input is not a single picture but a **scene** containing multiple framed \u201ctiles\u201d:\n\n- There are **outer \u201cparent\u201d frames**: rectangles whose borders are a single color.\n- Inside some of these parents there are **inner \u201cchild\u201d frames** or at least **child regions**, usually a solid block of black (0) or a block of zeros plus a small pattern (object) of some other color.\n- Everything outside these organized frames (like long stripes of 1,2,3,4 in example 1, or the mix of 0,1,2,3,4,8 in example 2) is treated as **noise**.\n\nThe hints summarise this:\n\n> *\u201chierarchical extraction: identify outer \"parent\" frames and inner \"child\" frames, ignoring the surrounding noise.\u201d*\n\n### 1.2. Colors and roles\n\nOn ARC, the usual semantic mapping is:\n\n- 0 = black\n- 1 = blue\n- 2 = red\n- 4 = yellow\n- 8 = light-blue\n\nThe hint:\n\n> *Parent frame color acts as a filter: Red and Yellow parent frames are active (processed), while Blue parent frames are inactive (result in black/empty output).*\n\nTranslating to numbers:\n\n- **Active parent colors** \u2192 2 (red) and 4 (yellow)\n- **Inactive parent color** \u2192 1 (blue)\n\nInside an active parent, we look for a **child region** that is a fairly clean rectangular area, usually something like a 5\u00d75 or 4\u00d74 interior of a 7\u00d77 or 6\u00d76 frame. The **child content** has:\n\n- A **background**, which is either:\n  - solid black (0), or\n  - \u201crandom noise\u201d (mixture of colors, not dominated by 0)\n- A **foreground object**, which is either:\n  - a colored shape on black background, or\n  - a black shape on a noisy background.\n\nThe hint captures this:\n\n> *\u201cForeground identification is context-sensitive: it is the colored pixel if the background is black, or the black shape if the background is noise.\u201d*\n\n### 1.3. Normalizing a child tile\n\nFor each **child** region:\n\n1. Determine whether its background is black or noisy.\n2. Determine which pixels are **foreground object** according to the rule above.\n3. Build a **normalized tile** where:\n   - All **background pixels** in that child are recolored to **red (2)**.\n   - All **foreground object pixels** keep their original color.\n\nSo a 5\u00d75 child like (example-style):\n\n```text\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nwould have black background, colored foreground {6,2}, and normalize to:\n\n```text\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 6 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n```\n\n### 1.4. Stitched output\n\nFrom the examples, the final output is **not** the entire 30\u00d730 rewritten, but just a **grid of child tiles**, one per active parent, stitched together in a smaller array.\n\n- Wherever a parent is **blue (1)**, the corresponding output tile is **all black (0)**.\n- Wherever a parent is **red or yellow** but its child is effectively empty (no foreground object), the normalized tile is **uniform red**; in the stitched layout these can be treated as \u201cactive but visually trivial\u201d, but they still appear as red (2) unless masked by a stronger foreground tile.\n- If an active parent has a nontrivial foreground color (e.g. 6, 4, etc.), that color appears explicitly in the output at the child\u2019s position.\n\nIn Example 1 and 2, the stitching is arranged so that:\n\n- The **tile size** is the **inner child size** (5\u00d75 in Example 1, 4\u00d74 in Example 2).\n- The **number of tiles** (rows \u00d7 cols of the output) equals the dimension of that child tile, so the output itself is exactly one normalized child, or a combination where most other positions end up black or red.\n\nIn Example 1, there is a prominent yellow (4) 7\u00d77 frame whose 5\u00d75 black interior contains a few colored object pixels (one of color 6 and some 2s). Normalizing that 5\u00d75 interior, and then masking parts of it by the inactive or empty neighbors, yields the 5\u00d75 output pattern with one 6 and several 2s.\n\nIn Example 2, the relevant active parents have 6\u00d76 outer frames and 4\u00d74 children; normalizing and stitching them yields the given 4\u00d74 pattern of 2s and 0s.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying this to the test input\n\nNow, for the test input.\n\n### 2.1. Looking for candidate parent/child structure\n\nThe test uses colors:\n\n- 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8\n\nWe look for **rectangular framed regions**\u2014blocks where the border is one constant color, with a distinct interior.\n\nA particularly clear candidate appears near the bottom\u2011right, rows 22\u201326 and columns 21\u201325. Extract that 5\u00d75 area:\n\nRows 22\u201326, Cols 21\u201325:\n\n- Row 22: `..., 0,0,0,0,0, ...` \u2192 `[0,0,0,0,0]`\n- Row 23: `..., 0,0,4,0,0, ...` \u2192 `[0,0,4,0,0]`\n- Row 24: `..., 0,4,2,4,0, ...` \u2192 `[0,4,2,4,0]`\n- Row 25: `..., 0,0,4,0,0, ...` \u2192 `[0,0,4,0,0]`\n- Row 26: `..., 0,0,0,0,0, ...` \u2192 `[0,0,0,0,0]`\n\nSo the 5\u00d75 is:\n\n```text\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0\n0 4 2 4 0\n0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nThis is a **simple, centered object** (a cross of 4\u2019s with a 2 in the center) on a **solid black background**. It matches exactly the \u201cchild region\u201d archetype described in the hint.\n\nSurrounding this inner 5\u00d75, there are rows above and below (row 21 and 27) with long runs of 5s, and some vertical 5s as well, which act as a looser outer framing. That gives us enough to treat this as the **child interior** of one active parent.\n\nNo other region in the test has such a clean, symmetric, fully\u2011black 5\u00d75 interior with a compact object, so we use this as the **unique meaningful child** to extract.\n\n### 2.2. Determining background vs foreground\n\nInside this 5\u00d75:\n\n- Number of zeros: 20\n- Non-zero pixels: 4s at (2,3), (3,2), (3,4), (4,3) and a 2 at (3,3).\n\nSo clearly:\n\n- **Background** = black (0)\n- **Foreground object** = the **colored cross plus center**: those 4\u2019s and the central 2.\n\nBy the hint:\n\n> *\u201cit is the colored pixel if the background is black\u201d*\n\nso every non-zero pixel in that 5\u00d75 is foreground.\n\n### 2.3. Normalizing this child\n\nNormalization rules:\n\n- Background (black) \u2192 **red (2)**\n- Foreground pixels keep their color (here 4 and 2).\n\nApply this to the 5\u00d75:\n\nOriginal:\n\n```text\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0\n0 4 2 4 0\n0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nAfter normalization:\n\n- All 0 \u2192 2\n- 4 \u2192 4\n- 2 \u2192 2\n\nWe get:\n\n```text\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 4 2 2\n2 4 2 4 2\n2 2 4 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n```\n\nThis is a red background with a yellow (4) cross and the red (2) center preserved.\n\nSince in this test there is effectively **one active, meaningful parent**, the \u201cstitched grid of normalized inner tiles\u201d reduces to just this **single 5\u00d75 normalized child** as the final output.\n\nNo blue-only parents need to be represented (or they would appear as all-0 tiles), and there are no additional red/yellow parents with separate child interiors that would expand the mosaic.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Final output grid\n\nSo the completed output grid for the test input is:\n\n```text\n2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,4,2,2\n2,4,2,4,2\n2,2,4,2,2\n2,2,2,2,2\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The task involves hierarchical extraction: identify outer \"parent\" frames and inner \"child\" frames, ignoring the surrounding noise.\n*   Parent frame color acts as a filter: Red and Yellow parent frames are active (processed), while Blue parent frames are inactive (result in black/empty output).\n*   Content within child frames is normalized: the local background (whether solid black or random noise) is replaced by Red, while the foreground object is preserved.\n*   Foreground identification is context-sensitive: it is the colored pixel if the background is black, or the black shape if the background is noise.\n*   The final output is a stitched grid of these normalized inner tiles; empty or inactive tiles remain black.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "The big test grid is made up of a pair of large outer frames. Inside each of them you can see 7\u00d77 sub\u2011frames with a uniform border of \u201c5\u201d and a 5\u00d75 interior. There are four such inner tiles arranged as a 2\u00d72 grid (top\u2011left at rows 3\u20139, cols 5\u201311; top\u2011right at rows 3\u20139, cols 19\u201325; bottom\u2011left at rows 20\u201326, cols 5\u201311; bottom\u2011right at rows 20\u201326, cols 19\u201325).\n\nFor each of these inner tiles, take the 5\u00d75 interior. If the interior is mostly zero, treat zeros as background and non\u2011zero values as the foreground; if the interior is mostly non\u2011zero, treat the non\u2011zero values as background and the zeros as a black foreground shape. Replace the background with red (\u201c2\u201d) and leave the foreground untouched. Here all four frames are treated as active and stitched together according to their top/bottom, left/right positions to give a 10\u00d710 output.\n\nThat gives the following output grid:\n\n```\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,1,8,1,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,0,2,2,2,2,4,2,2\n2,0,0,0,2,2,4,2,4,2\n2,2,0,2,2,2,2,4,2,2\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The task involves hierarchical extraction: identify outer \"parent\" frames and inner \"child\" frames, ignoring the surrounding noise.\n*   Parent frame color acts as a filter: Red and Yellow parent frames are active (processed), while Blue parent frames are inactive (result in black/empty output).\n*   Content within child frames is normalized: the local background (whether solid black or random noise) is replaced by Red, while the foreground object is preserved.\n*   Foreground identification is context-sensitive: it is the colored pixel if the background is black, or the black shape if the background is noise.\n*   The final output is a stitched grid of these normalized inner tiles; empty or inactive tiles remain black.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "The large test grid is mostly a repeating noisy background of 3\u20116. What stands out are four identical 7\u00d77 framed regions with a solid border of 5 and a 5\u00d75 interior: one at rows\u202f5\u20119/cols\u202f7\u201111, one at rows\u202f5\u20119/cols\u202f21\u201125, one at rows\u202f22\u201126/cols\u202f7\u201111 and one at rows\u202f22\u201126/cols\u202f21\u201125. These are the inner tiles we need to process.\n\nFor each tile interior we decide whether the background is black or noisy: the three interiors made mostly of zeroes have a black background, so the non\u2011zero pixels are the foreground; the lower\u2011left tile is mostly 8/1 noise with zeroes forming the shape, so there the zeroes are the foreground. Normalization replaces the background with red (2) while leaving the foreground unchanged.\n\nFinally, the four normalized 5\u00d75 tiles are stitched together in the same 2\u00d72 layout as in the input. This yields a 10\u00d710 output grid:\n\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,1,8,1,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,0,2,2,2,2,4,2,2\n2,0,0,0,2,2,4,2,4,2\n2,2,0,2,2,2,2,4,2,2\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analyzing ARC-AGI Training Examples: My Thought Process**\n\nAlright, the task is to decipher the underlying pattern in this image, a typical ARC-AGI training example.  The goal is to provide a complete summary of how I would approach solving this problem.\n\n**Initial Observations & Deconstruction:**\n\nMy first impression is a noisy grid with a structured layout\u2014colored pixels and rectangular frames are immediately apparent. The image is actually composed of multiple small blocks of pixels inside a larger noise filled rectangle. Within these are nested smaller rectangles. The input is basically made up of grids of pixels with \"boxes\" of a single color within them and noise everywhere else. The output is a smaller grid of similar blocks, but with simplified colors.  \n\nThe noise seems irrelevant at first, then I began to understand that it is key to the overall pattern. Initially I start to focus on the colors and the specific rectangular borders to determine the underlying logic. The color and size of the rectangles seems to provide cues about the output.\n\n**Framing & Hierarchical Analysis:**\n\nThe critical insight is the nested structure: large, medium, small rectangles.  This hierarchy is the crux of the problem. Some outer rectangles may simply be ignored. The inner frames are key, especially their layout. \n\nI start to analyze the \"outer\" frames; Blue in one section, Red in another, Yellow inside both. I suspect these will either be directly translated or \"removed.\" In the output, the Black sections correspond to the \"empty or Blue\" sections in the input. In the output, Black is used to indicate empty tiles.\n\nI look at the yellow and cyan colored frames. The content of these frames seems to be what provides the pattern. Within the inner frames (yellow or cyan), there are unique features and pixel structures that are the key to building the output.\n\n**Foreground/Background Distinction:**\n\nThis is challenging! It seems like the pixel patterns have an \"object\" and a \"background\", but these elements are not always consistent. In one instance, the magenta pixel represents the \"object,\" whereas the black empty space is the \"noise\". In another, a set of pixels form a solid shape that becomes the \"object\" and the noise around it is background. The output consistently gives this set of patterns a solid color.\n\nI am suspecting there is a filter: Noise/background gets converted into a consistent background color (Red), with the pattern extracted and translated into the corresponding part of the output grid. The trick is how to correctly define the patterns and background based on context.\n\nThe color of the \"parent\" rectangle seems to decide the background color of the tile. If it's a \"valid\" color (Yellow or Red), there will be an object. If a color is invalid (Blue), then it gets removed.\n\n**Processing, Reconstruction, and Validation:**\n\nThe next step is to examine multiple examples to validate my hypothesis. The goal is to establish a clear set of extraction rules. The color of a sub-frame indicates the specific tile contents. The input is \"stitched\" together to form the output.\n\nThe validation steps require confirming if empty tiles turn black.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n\nIn essence, the transformation is a hierarchical filter and tile creation. The input is a two-level nested structure of rectangles, that can be translated in several steps. First we filter based on color of rectangles, keep active sets, throw away others. Then, the contents of the smaller \"child\" frame are extracted and classified. Finally the tiles are created, with a new consistent background. All of this is put together to build the output image.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided training examples:\n\n**1. Describe the observable structures**\nThe input images feature a high-frequency noisy background (random colored pixels) overlaid with structured rectangular frames.\n*   **Input 1:** Contains two large \"parent\" frames: a Blue one (top) and a Red one (bottom). Inside each parent frame are two smaller Yellow square frames. Inside the Yellow frames is a black background. Three of these inner frames contain a single Magenta pixel; one appears empty.\n*   **Input 2:** Contains two large \"parent\" frames: a Yellow one (left) and a Red one (right). Inside each parent frame are two smaller Cyan square frames. Inside the Cyan frames, the background is the noisy pattern, but there are distinct shapes formed by black pixels.\n*   **Outputs:** The outputs are low-resolution grids (relative to the input) composed of solid blocks of color.\n    *   Output 1 corresponds to Input 1: The top half is black. The bottom half contains a Magenta block and Red blocks.\n    *   Output 2 corresponds to Input 2: The image is a tiling of four regions. Each region has a Red background with a Black shape. The Black shapes match the shapes found inside the Cyan frames of the input.\n\n**2. Identify transformation categories**\n*   **Present:** Removing noise / extracting main shape, Copying / pasting / repositioning (tiling inner frames), Object recoloring (background normalization), Bordering / outlining (used for selection).\n*   **Absent:** Object movement (physics-based), Gravity, Symmetry.\n\n**3. Extract the key non-obvious insights**\n*   **Hierarchical Selection:** The rule operates on a hierarchy of `Outer Frame -> Inner Frame -> Content`. The noise outside these frames is irrelevant.\n*   **Parent Frame Filtering:** The color of the Outer Frame determines if the region is processed. In Input 1, the Blue frame's region corresponds to Black (empty) in the output, suggesting it is ignored or deleted. The Red and Yellow Outer frames in both inputs correspond to populated regions in the output.\n*   **Context-Dependent Foreground:** The definition of the \"object\" to extract flips based on the container.\n    *   In Input 1 (Yellow inner frames): The background is Black, so the object is the non-black pixel (Magenta).\n    *   In Input 2 (Cyan inner frames): The background is Noise, so the object is the non-noise pixel (Black).\n*   **Background Normalization:** Regardless of whether the input background was Black or Noise, the active regions in the output are normalized to have a **Red background**.\n*   **Empty Tile Handling:** If an inner frame contains no object (like the bottom-right of Input 1), the corresponding output tile is Black (null/empty), not Red.\n\n**4. Hypothesize a general rule**\nThe transformation extracts specific sub-images defined by nested rectangular frames. First, it identifies valid \"parent\" frames (colors like Red and Yellow are valid; Blue is invalid/ignored). Inside valid parents, it locates \"child\" frames. The visual content within each child frame is extracted and standardized: the \"foreground\" object (defined as the distinct shape or colored pixel contrasting with the local background) is preserved, while the local background (whether noise or void) is replaced with a uniform **Red** color. These processed tiles are then stitched together in a grid layout matching the arrangement of the child frames. Invalid regions result in black space.\n\n**5. List checks you would perform when solving**\n*   Verify if the output background color (Red) is fixed globally or derived from one of the frame colors (e.g., the Red parent frame).\n*   Check the threshold for \"foreground\" identification: is it strictly \"Black in Noise\" and \"Color in Black,\" or is it \"Minority color vs Majority color\"?\n*   Confirm that the spatial arrangement of the output tiles strictly maps to the spatial arrangement of the inner frames (e.g., Top-Left inner frame -> Top-Left output tile).\n*   Test if an empty active frame (Red background, no object) produces a solid Red block or a solid Black block (current evidence suggests Black).\n\n**6. Summarize final insights**\n\nHINT_START\n*   The task involves hierarchical extraction: identify outer \"parent\" frames and inner \"child\" frames, ignoring the surrounding noise.\n*   Parent frame color acts as a filter: Red and Yellow parent frames are active (processed), while Blue parent frames are inactive (result in black/empty output).\n*   Content within child frames is normalized: the local background (whether solid black or random noise) is replaced by Red, while the foreground object is preserved.\n*   Foreground identification is context-sensitive: it is the colored pixel if the background is black, or the black shape if the background is noise.\n*   The final output is a stitched grid of these normalized inner tiles; empty or inactive tiles remain black.\nHINT_END",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. My initial thought is that we've got a repeating \"noise\" background. It's the standard, repeated-digit texture we often see in these kinds of problems, and it's built from sets of small integers (0-4, 1-4, etc.).  The real interesting part is the rectangular regions overlaid on this background.  These rectangular areas are the \"objects\" of interest.\n\nThe objects themselves seem to have a clear structure. There's an outer \"frame,\" a rectangular border, and the inside - which is usually Color 0, which looks like a canvas. The border itself can either be a distinct solid line (color 8, 5, or 2), or, sometimes, the border is just defined by pixels being next to others. Inside that is the real game - there are specific pixels of 1, 2, 4, or 8, forming a small shape or pattern in the Color 0 fill. Sometimes, there aren't *any* pixels inside the rectangular region (just 0s), or there is a shape/pattern. The smaller 4x4 or 5x5 grids are almost like zoomed-in samples. They contain the same shapes/colors, but in isolation.\n\nSo, in summary: we have a background pattern, and then rectangles (objects) placed on top of it.  The rectangles have a border color, a fill color (usually 0), and then content/payload. The shapes are small, and sometimes there's an absence of shapes - which is still significant.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n**\n\nMy goal is to identify and describe the transformations happening in this grid-based puzzle. I've been presented with several examples and a test case.  My approach involves carefully analyzing the grid inputs and outputs, looking for repeating patterns, identifiable objects, and any systematic changes between them.\n\nMy initial thought process involves breaking down the grid into smaller pieces. I will be identifying the unique rectangular shapes, and border colors. Then I want to know, \"what happens to the pixels *inside* these shapes?\"\n\nI noticed that in the test input, there are a repeating background pattern and overlaid rectangular regions.  In many cases, the content inside these boxes is what ultimately matters. I've realized, based on the examples and the test input, that I'm looking for a pattern, similar to how one might solve an analogy question in an IQ test.  I must first identify a pair of objects that share geometric similarity and then work out the color mapping rule that applies to the unique object.\n\nFor the test input, I've concluded the most likely transformation is the following:\n\n1.  **Object Extraction:** Find rectangular objects defined by the border color.\n2.  **Object Pattern Matching:** Find a pair of objects that have the same geometric pattern (isomorphic).\n3.  **Color mapping derivation:** Identify the color mapping between the pair.\n4.  **Target and transformation:** Apply the color mapping to the remaining object.\n5.  **Output**: Extract the inner content of the resulting object as the output.\n\nIn the test case, two objects have a cross shape and therefore the same pattern. The color mapping is 1->4 and 8->2, with 0 remaining 0. Apply this to the target object.\n<br>\nFinal output grid for the test input is:\n\n```\n2,4,2,4,2\n4,2,0,2,4\n2,0,0,0,2\n4,2,0,2,4\n2,4,2,4,2\n```\n**\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Solution for ARC Task:**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process on this ARC task. I'm given two example grids and a test input, and I need to figure out the rule to transform the input into an output grid. The prompt hints at specific objects and transformation logic. It mentions objects that are like repeating backgrounds with rectangular regions overlaid. These regions have borders, a fill (often color 0), and inner content.\n\nThe main idea seems to be to identify these rectangular objects, find two that are geometrically similar, and then derive a color mapping between them. This color mapping should then be applied to another object. The problem description gives specific hints for the test input: two cross-shaped objects with the mapping 1 -> 4 and 8 -> 2. The solution is the transformed content of the third object.\n\nFirst, I'll need to look at the examples to verify this logic. Example 1 is a 30x30 grid with three distinct rectangular regions highlighted by a border color 4. The top-left object looks like a shape with a \"cup\" or \"J\" form, and is enclosed by the border color 4 (yellow).  The inner content has some 1s and 6s mixed in. I can find the precise locations of the top-left object, the bottom-right object (all 0s), and the middle-right object. But I also notice the mapping: 1 becomes 2 based on the provided hint. The bottom region seems like a clean canvas. Example 2 looks similar, the border is color 8, but the inner contents are different. In Example 2, there is an obvious cross object with color 4, where the border is color 8. I will analyze Example 2 based on the cross pattern. This makes it a great use case to determine the logic.  I look at Example 2, and identify some objects, but none that look identical.  So, I re-analyze based on the \"hint\" that I should look for the same \"pattern.\"\n\nThen I get to the test input. It's also a 30x30 grid. The border is color 5 (grey). Now, I identify four objects: one with a cross shape having 8s, one empty, one very complex pattern, and one cross shape with a 2. Comparing them, I notice that the top-left object with the cross-shape of 1s and an 8, and the bottom-right object, with a cross-shape and a 2, are geometrically the same, which means they are isomorphic. The prompt specifically hints that the target grid is based on these two, and that the mapping is 1 becomes 4 and 8 becomes 2. From this, I conclude the target object's colors get transformed based on the 1s and 8s mapping. The remaining object (the complex one), has an 8 (the center) and other 1s. This is the \"target\" object to transform. The color mapping will be applied to the remaining object, replacing the 1s and 8s, respectively.\n\nSo the rule is based on looking for similar objects. I apply the mapping to the third remaining object to generate the final output. The format of the output will be 5x5, matching the size of the inner contents, as seen in the examples.\n\nApplying the logic, I transform the color 1 to 4, 8 to 2, and 0 to 0. I take the final, transformed output grid and double-check it against the examples and description to make sure it is correct.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to solve an ARC task where the input grid contains a noisy repeating background overlaid with rectangular \"objects\" defined by a specific border color. The goal is to determine the transformation rule based on the relationship between these objects and apply it to generate the output.\n\n**1. Analyze the Input Structure**\nThe test input is a 30x30 grid with a repeating background pattern. Overlaying this background are four rectangular regions defined by a grey border (color 5).\n*   **Border Color:** 5 (Grey).\n*   **Object Dimensions:** Each object's interior is a 5x5 grid.\n\n**2. Extract and Identify Objects**\nWe locate the content inside the four regions bounded by color 5:\n\n*   **Top-Left Object (Object A):**\n    *   Content:\n        ```\n        0,0,0,0,0\n        0,0,1,0,0\n        0,1,8,1,0\n        0,0,1,0,0\n        0,0,0,0,0\n        ```\n    *   **Description:** A cross shape made of color 1 (blue) with a center of color 8 (teal) on a background of 0 (black).\n\n*   **Top-Right Object (Object B):**\n    *   Content: All 0s (Empty).\n\n*   **Bottom-Left Object (Object C):**\n    *   Content:\n        ```\n        8,1,8,1,8\n        1,8,0,8,1\n        8,0,0,0,8\n        1,8,0,8,1\n        8,1,8,1,8\n        ```\n    *   **Description:** A complex diamond/X pattern using colors 1 and 8.\n\n*   **Bottom-Right Object (Object D):**\n    *   Content:\n        ```\n        0,0,0,0,0\n        0,0,4,0,0\n        0,4,2,4,0\n        0,0,4,0,0\n        0,0,0,0,0\n        ```\n    *   **Description:** A cross shape made of color 4 (yellow) with a center of color 2 (red).\n\n**3. Determine the Transformation Rule**\nWe look for a relationship between the objects. Object A (Top-Left) and Object D (Bottom-Right) are **geometrically isomorphic**: they share the exact same cross shape and positioning, but the colors are different.\n*   **Object A:** Arms = 1, Center = 8.\n*   **Object D:** Arms = 4, Center = 2.\n\nThis establishes a color mapping rule:\n*   Color **1** maps to Color **4**.\n*   Color **8** maps to Color **2**.\n*   Color **0** remains Color **0**.\n\n**4. Apply the Transformation**\nThe task follows an analogy pattern: *A is to D as C is to Output*. We must apply the derived color mapping to the remaining patterned object, Object C (Bottom-Left).\n\n*   **Input (Object C):**\n    ```\n    8,1,8,1,8\n    1,8,0,8,1\n    8,0,0,0,8\n    1,8,0,8,1\n    8,1,8,1,8\n    ```\n*   **Apply Mapping (1->4, 8->2):**\n    *   Replace 8 with 2.\n    *   Replace 1 with 4.\n    *   0 stays 0.\n\n*   **Result:**\n    ```\n    2,4,2,4,2\n    4,2,0,2,4\n    2,0,0,0,2\n    4,2,0,2,4\n    2,4,2,4,2\n    ```\n\n**5. Final Output**\nThe output is the 5x5 grid resulting from this transformation.\n\n2,4,2,4,2\n4,2,0,2,4\n2,0,0,0,2\n4,2,0,2,4\n2,4,2,4,2",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. My initial thought is that we've got a repeating \"noise\" background. It's the standard, repeated-digit texture we often see in these kinds of problems, and it's built from sets of small integers (0-4, 1-4, etc.).  The real interesting part is the rectangular regions overlaid on this background.  These rectangular areas are the \"objects\" of interest.\n\nThe objects themselves seem to have a clear structure. There's an outer \"frame,\" a rectangular border, and the inside - which is usually Color 0, which looks like a canvas. The border itself can either be a distinct solid line (color 8, 5, or 2), or, sometimes, the border is just defined by pixels being next to others. Inside that is the real game - there are specific pixels of 1, 2, 4, or 8, forming a small shape or pattern in the Color 0 fill. Sometimes, there aren't *any* pixels inside the rectangular region (just 0s), or there is a shape/pattern. The smaller 4x4 or 5x5 grids are almost like zoomed-in samples. They contain the same shapes/colors, but in isolation.\n\nSo, in summary: we have a background pattern, and then rectangles (objects) placed on top of it.  The rectangles have a border color, a fill color (usually 0), and then content/payload. The shapes are small, and sometimes there's an absence of shapes - which is still significant.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n**\n\nMy goal is to identify and describe the transformations happening in this grid-based puzzle. I've been presented with several examples and a test case.  My approach involves carefully analyzing the grid inputs and outputs, looking for repeating patterns, identifiable objects, and any systematic changes between them.\n\nMy initial thought process involves breaking down the grid into smaller pieces. I will be identifying the unique rectangular shapes, and border colors. Then I want to know, \"what happens to the pixels *inside* these shapes?\"\n\nI noticed that in the test input, there are a repeating background pattern and overlaid rectangular regions.  In many cases, the content inside these boxes is what ultimately matters. I've realized, based on the examples and the test input, that I'm looking for a pattern, similar to how one might solve an analogy question in an IQ test.  I must first identify a pair of objects that share geometric similarity and then work out the color mapping rule that applies to the unique object.\n\nFor the test input, I've concluded the most likely transformation is the following:\n\n1.  **Object Extraction:** Find rectangular objects defined by the border color.\n2.  **Object Pattern Matching:** Find a pair of objects that have the same geometric pattern (isomorphic).\n3.  **Color mapping derivation:** Identify the color mapping between the pair.\n4.  **Target and transformation:** Apply the color mapping to the remaining object.\n5.  **Output**: Extract the inner content of the resulting object as the output.\n\nIn the test case, two objects have a cross shape and therefore the same pattern. The color mapping is 1->4 and 8->2, with 0 remaining 0. Apply this to the target object.\n<br>\nFinal output grid for the test input is:\n\n```\n2,4,2,4,2\n4,2,0,2,4\n2,0,0,0,2\n4,2,0,2,4\n2,4,2,4,2\n```\n**\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. My initial thought is that we've got a repeating \"noise\" background. It's the standard, repeated-digit texture we often see in these kinds of problems, and it's built from sets of small integers (0-4, 1-4, etc.).  The real interesting part is the rectangular regions overlaid on this background.  These rectangular areas are the \"objects\" of interest.\n\nThe objects themselves seem to have a clear structure. There's an outer \"frame,\" a rectangular border, and the inside - which is usually Color 0, which looks like a canvas. The border itself can either be a distinct solid line (color 8, 5, or 2), or, sometimes, the border is just defined by pixels being next to others. Inside that is the real game - there are specific pixels of 1, 2, 4, or 8, forming a small shape or pattern in the Color 0 fill. Sometimes, there aren't *any* pixels inside the rectangular region (just 0s), or there is a shape/pattern. The smaller 4x4 or 5x5 grids are almost like zoomed-in samples. They contain the same shapes/colors, but in isolation.\n\nSo, in summary: we have a background pattern, and then rectangles (objects) placed on top of it.  The rectangles have a border color, a fill color (usually 0), and then content/payload. The shapes are small, and sometimes there's an absence of shapes - which is still significant.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n**\n\nMy goal is to identify and describe the transformations happening in this grid-based puzzle. I've been presented with several examples and a test case.  My approach involves carefully analyzing the grid inputs and outputs, looking for repeating patterns, identifiable objects, and any systematic changes between them.\n\nMy initial thought process involves breaking down the grid into smaller pieces. I will be identifying the unique rectangular shapes, and border colors. Then I want to know, \"what happens to the pixels *inside* these shapes?\"\n\nI noticed that in the test input, there are a repeating background pattern and overlaid rectangular regions.  In many cases, the content inside these boxes is what ultimately matters. I've realized, based on the examples and the test input, that I'm looking for a pattern, similar to how one might solve an analogy question in an IQ test.  I must first identify a pair of objects that share geometric similarity and then work out the color mapping rule that applies to the unique object.\n\nFor the test input, I've concluded the most likely transformation is the following:\n\n1.  **Object Extraction:** Find rectangular objects defined by the border color.\n2.  **Object Pattern Matching:** Find a pair of objects that have the same geometric pattern (isomorphic).\n3.  **Color mapping derivation:** Identify the color mapping between the pair.\n4.  **Target and transformation:** Apply the color mapping to the remaining object.\n5.  **Output**: Extract the inner content of the resulting object as the output.\n\nIn the test case, two objects have a cross shape and therefore the same pattern. The color mapping is 1->4 and 8->2, with 0 remaining 0. Apply this to the target object.\n<br>\nFinal output grid for the test input is:\n\n```\n2,4,2,4,2\n4,2,0,2,4\n2,0,0,0,2\n4,2,0,2,4\n2,4,2,4,2\n```\n**\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "The key idea is that each big input grid hides several \u201cobjects\u201d that are small squares with a solid-colored border and a patterned interior.  \nThe outputs are just transformed versions of one of these interiors.\n\n### 1. Identifying the objects in the test input\n\nIn the test input, look for maximal rectangles whose border is a constant color that is *not* the general background texture.  \nColor `5` forms such rectangular frames.\n\nYou can find three 7\u00d77 squares with border color `5`:\n\n- **Object 1:** rows 5\u201311, columns 6\u201312  \n- **Object 2:** rows 22\u201328, columns 6\u201312  \n- **Object 3:** rows 22\u201328, columns 20\u201326  \n\nEach of these has a 5\u00d75 interior (border removed).\n\nExtract those interiors:\n\n**Object 1 interior (I\u2081), rows 5\u20139, cols 7\u201311**\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0\n0 1 8 1 0\n0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n**Object 2 interior (I\u2082), rows 22\u201326, cols 7\u201311**\n\n```\n8 1 8 1 8\n1 8 0 8 1\n8 0 0 0 8\n1 8 0 8 1\n8 1 8 1 8\n```\n\n**Object 3 interior (I\u2083), rows 22\u201326, cols 21\u201325**\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0\n0 4 2 4 0\n0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n### 2. Finding geometrically matching objects and deriving the color mapping\n\nLook only at the *shape* of non-background cells (non\u2011zero) in I\u2081 and I\u2083.\n\n- In **I\u2081**, the non-zero cells form a \u201cplus\u201d (cross) of `1`s around a central `8`.\n- In **I\u2083**, the non-zero cells form *the same plus* of `4`s around a central `2`.\n\nCell by cell, the correspondence between these two interiors is:\n\n- Wherever I\u2081 has `1`, I\u2083 has `4`.\n- Wherever I\u2081 has `8`, I\u2083 has `2`.\n- Wherever I\u2081 has `0`, I\u2083 has `0`.\n\nSo the color mapping from I\u2081 \u2192 I\u2083 is:\n\n- `1 \u2192 4`\n- `8 \u2192 2`\n- `0 \u2192 0` (background stays background)\n\nThus I\u2081 and I\u2083 are the same geometric pattern, just recolored.\n\n### 3. Applying the mapping to the target object\n\nNow consider **I\u2082**. Its interior uses only colors `{0,1,8}`, i.e. exactly the source-side colors of the mapping we just derived.\n\nSo we apply the same mapping to every cell of I\u2082:\n\n- Replace `1` with `4`\n- Replace `8` with `2`\n- Keep `0` as `0`\n\nStarting from:\n\n```\n8 1 8 1 8\n1 8 0 8 1\n8 0 0 0 8\n1 8 0 8 1\n8 1 8 1 8\n```\n\nAfter applying the mapping:\n\nRow 1: `8 1 8 1 8` \u2192 `2 4 2 4 2`  \nRow 2: `1 8 0 8 1` \u2192 `4 2 0 2 4`  \nRow 3: `8 0 0 0 8` \u2192 `2 0 0 0 2`  \nRow 4: `1 8 0 8 1` \u2192 `4 2 0 2 4`  \nRow 5: `8 1 8 1 8` \u2192 `2 4 2 4 2`\n\nThis recolored 5\u00d75 interior is exactly what we must output.\n\n### 4.

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. My initial thought is that we've got a repeating \"noise\" background. It's the standard, repeated-digit texture we often see in these kinds of problems, and it's built from sets of small integers (0-4, 1-4, etc.).  The real interesting part is the rectangular regions overlaid on this background.  These rectangular areas are the \"objects\" of interest.\n\nThe objects themselves seem to have a clear structure. There's an outer \"frame,\" a rectangular border, and the inside - which is usually Color 0, which looks like a canvas. The border itself can either be a distinct solid line (color 8, 5, or 2), or, sometimes, the border is just defined by pixels being next to others. Inside that is the real game - there are specific pixels of 1, 2, 4, or 8, forming a small shape or pattern in the Color 0 fill. Sometimes, there aren't *any* pixels inside the rectangular region (just 0s), or there is a shape/pattern. The smaller 4x4 or 5x5 grids are almost like zoomed-in samples. They contain the same shapes/colors, but in isolation.\n\nSo, in summary: we have a background pattern, and then rectangles (objects) placed on top of it.  The rectangles have a border color, a fill color (usually 0), and then content/payload. The shapes are small, and sometimes there's an absence of shapes - which is still significant.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n**\n\nMy goal is to identify and describe the transformations happening in this grid-based puzzle. I've been presented with several examples and a test case.  My approach involves carefully analyzing the grid inputs and outputs, looking for repeating patterns, identifiable objects, and any systematic changes between them.\n\nMy initial thought process involves breaking down the grid into smaller pieces. I will be identifying the unique rectangular shapes, and border colors. Then I want to know, \"what happens to the pixels *inside* these shapes?\"\n\nI noticed that in the test input, there are a repeating background pattern and overlaid rectangular regions.  In many cases, the content inside these boxes is what ultimately matters. I've realized, based on the examples and the test input, that I'm looking for a pattern, similar to how one might solve an analogy question in an IQ test.  I must first identify a pair of objects that share geometric similarity and then work out the color mapping rule that applies to the unique object.\n\nFor the test input, I've concluded the most likely transformation is the following:\n\n1.  **Object Extraction:** Find rectangular objects defined by the border color.\n2.  **Object Pattern Matching:** Find a pair of objects that have the same geometric pattern (isomorphic).\n3.  **Color mapping derivation:** Identify the color mapping between the pair.\n4.  **Target and transformation:** Apply the color mapping to the remaining object.\n5.  **Output**: Extract the inner content of the resulting object as the output.\n\nIn the test case, two objects have a cross shape and therefore the same pattern. The color mapping is 1->4 and 8->2, with 0 remaining 0. Apply this to the target object.\n<br>\nFinal output grid for the test input is:\n\n```\n2,4,2,4,2\n4,2,0,2,4\n2,0,0,0,2\n4,2,0,2,4\n2,4,2,4,2\n```\n**\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "To tackle this task I started by looking for bounded \u201cobjects\u201d inside the noisy grids. In all three cases the grids contain clearly framed squares: in the test input there are 7\u00d77 squares framed with a constant colour\u202f5. Removing that border leaves a 5\u00d75 \u201cinterior\u201d to transform \u2013 the output size in the examples also matches such interiors.\n\nFrom the second training example a simple transformation emerges: take the interior of the target square, fill the whole interior with a checkerboard pattern made from the interior\u2019s non\u2011zero colour(s), and then zero out the cells that were originally non\u2011zero. In the training case with a single non\u2011zero interior colour this degenerates to filling with that colour and masking the original non\u2011zero cells, which reproduces the given output exactly.\n\nApplying the same rule to the 5\u00d75 interior of the border\u20115 square in the test grid, which contains a cross of 4s and a centre 2, gives a checkerboard of 2s and 4s with the original cross set to 0:\n\n```\n2,4,2,4,2\n4,2,0,2,4\n2,0,0,0,2\n4,2,0,2,4\n2,4,2,4,2\n```\n\nThis is the required output.",

It's the standard, repeated-digit texture we often see in these kinds of problems, and it's built from sets of small integers (0-4, 1-4, etc.).

The border itself can either be a distinct solid line (color 8, 5, or 2), or, sometimes, the border is just defined by pixels being next to others. Inside that is the real game - there are specific pixels of 1, 2, 4, or 8, forming a small shape or pattern in the Color 0 fill. Sometimes, there aren't *any* pixels inside the rectangular region (just 0s), or there is a shape/pattern. The smaller 4x4 or 5x5 grids are almost like zoomed-in samples. They contain the same shapes/colors, but in isolation.\n\nSo, in summary: we have a background pattern, and then rectangles (objects) placed on top of it.  The rectangles have a border color, a fill color (usually 0), and then content/payload. The shapes are small, and sometimes there's an absence of shapes - which is still significant. </objects_summary>\n\n\nBased on the visual data provided, the grids contain the following object types and attributes:\n\n### 1. Background Texture\n*   **Description:** A large-scale field that covers the majority of the grid area. It consists of a high-frequency, repeating, or pseudo-random pattern of numeric values.\n*   **Attributes:**\n    *   **Composition:** Composed of a limited subset of low-value integers (e.g., varying combinations of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6).\n    *   **Pattern:** Varies between grids, sometimes appearing as diagonal stripes, noise, or small repeating blocks.\n\n### 2. Foreground Rectangular Containers\n*   **Description:** Distinct rectangular regions that overlay or interrupt the background texture. These act as \"windows\" or framed areas containing specific data.\n*   **Attributes:**\n    *   **Border:** A rectangular perimeter defining the object's size. This border is often a single solid color (frequently 8, 5, or 2), though in some instances, the border is defined implicitly by the cessation of the background pattern.\n    *   **Fill/Background:** The interior area within the border is typically filled with a solid field of color 0, creating a \"blank\" canvas distinct from the noisy grid background.\n    *   **Dimensions:** These objects vary in size but are generally square or rectangular (e.g., 5x5, 7x7 outer dimensions).\n\n### 3. Interior Content (Payload)\n*   **Description:** Specific pixel arrangements located inside the \"Fill\" of the Rectangular Containers.\n*   **Attributes:**\n    *   **Shape:** These appear as single pixels, 2x2 blocks, crosses (a center pixel with four orthogonal neighbors), or small clusters.\n    *   **Colors:** The content pixels use colors distinct from the fill (0) and often distinct from the border. Common colors for these inner details include 1, 2, 4, and 8.\n    *   **Position:** Usually centered or symmetrically placed within the container's fill area.\n\n### 4. Small Isolated Grids\n*   **Description:** Separate, smaller grids (typically 4x4 or 5x5) that are presented distinct from the large texture grids.\n*   **Attributes:**\n    *   **Dominant Color:** Often color 0 or color 2.\n    *   **Features:** These grids contain simple geometric patterns or single pixels (e.g., a cross of color 2, a corner pixel of color 6) that resemble the \"Interior Content\" found in the larger grids.\n\n<objects_summary>\n1.  **Background Texture**: Noisy, repeating patterns of low-integer colors (0-6) filling the majority of the space.\n2.  **Rectangular Containers**: Distinct regions overlaying the background, characterized by solid borders (often colors 8, 5, 2) and a solid interior fill (usually color 0).\n3.  **Interior Content**: Small geometric shapes (single dots, squares, crosses) composed of colors 1, 2, 4, or 8, located within the Rectangular Containers.\n4.  **Small Isolated Grids**: Independent low-dimension grids (4x4, 5x5) featuring simple patterns on a solid background.\n</objects_summary>",

Objects Description\n**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. My initial thought is that we've got a repeating \"noise\" background. It's the standard, repeated-digit texture we often see in these kinds of problems, and it's built from sets of small integers (0-4, 1-4, etc.).  The real interesting part is the rectangular regions overlaid on this background.  These rectangular areas are the \"objects\" of interest.\n\nThe objects themselves seem to have a clear structure. There's an outer \"frame,\" a rectangular border, and the inside - which is usually Color 0, which looks like a canvas. The border itself can either be a distinct solid line (color 8, 5, or 2), or, sometimes, the border is just defined by pixels being next to others. Inside that is the real game - there are specific pixels of 1, 2, 4, or 8, forming a small shape or pattern in the Color 0 fill. Sometimes, there aren't *any* pixels inside the rectangular region (just 0s), or there is a shape/pattern. The smaller 4x4 or 5x5 grids are almost like zoomed-in samples. They contain the same shapes/colors, but in isolation.\n\nSo, in summary: we have a background pattern, and then rectangles (objects) placed on top of it.  The rectangles have a border color, a fill color (usually 0), and then content/payload. The shapes are small, and sometimes there's an absence of shapes - which is still significant.",
                "response": "**<transformation_summary>**\n\nMy goal is to identify and describe the transformations happening in this grid-based puzzle. I've been presented with several examples and a test case.  My approach involves carefully analyzing the grid inputs and outputs, looking for repeating patterns, identifiable objects, and any systematic changes between them.\n\nMy initial thought process involves breaking down the grid into smaller pieces. I will be identifying the unique rectangular shapes, and border colors. Then I want to know, \"what happens to the pixels *inside* these shapes?\"\n\nI noticed that in the test input, there are a repeating background pattern and overlaid rectangular regions.  In many cases, the content inside these boxes is what ultimately matters. I've realized, based on the examples and the test input, that I'm looking for a pattern, similar to how one might solve an analogy question in an IQ test.  I must first identify a pair of objects that share geometric similarity and then work out the color mapping rule that applies to the unique object.\n\nFor the test input, I've concluded the most likely transformation is the following:\n\n1.  **Object Extraction:** Find rectangular objects defined by the border color.\n2.  **Object Pattern Matching:** Find a pair of objects that have the same geometric pattern (isomorphic).\n3.  **Color mapping derivation:** Identify the color mapping between the pair.\n4.  **Target and transformation:** Apply the color mapping to the remaining object.\n5.  **Output**: Extract the inner content of the resulting object as the output.\n\nIn the test case, two objects have a cross shape and therefore the same pattern. The color mapping is 1->4 and 8->2, with 0 remaining 0. Apply this to the target object.\n<br>\nFinal output grid for the test input is:\n\n```\n2,4,2,4,2\n4,2,0,2,4\n2,0,0,0,2\n4,2,0,2,4\n2,4,2,4,2\n```\n**</transformation_summary>**\n\nBased on the analysis of the input and output grids, the following transformations and rules have been identified.\n\n### Transformations Identification\n\n1.  **Object Extraction**:\n    *   The grid contains a noisy background pattern. On top of this background, there are distinct rectangular regions defined by a specific border color.\n    *   In the **Test Input**, the border color is **5**.\n    *   Three distinct objects are identified with this border:\n        *   **Object A (Top-Middle)**: A 5x5 region containing a cross pattern made of color **1** with a center of color **8**.\n        *   **Object B (Bottom-Left)**: A 5x5 region containing a complex symmetric pattern using colors **1** and **8**.\n        *   **Object C (Bottom-Right)**: A 5x5 region containing a cross pattern made of color **4** with a center of color **2**.\n\n2.  **Pattern Matching and Analogy Inference**:\n    *   By comparing the inner contents of the identified objects, a pair of objects is found to have an identical geometric structure (isomorphism) but different color palettes.\n    *   **Object A** and **Object C** share the exact same \"Cross\" shape.\n    *   This establishes a transformation rule based on the analogy: **Object A is to Object C as Object B is to the Output.**\n\n3.  **Color Mapping Derivation**:\n    *   Comparing the corresponding pixels of the matched pair (Object A -> Object C):\n        *   Pixels of color **1** in Object A correspond to pixels of color **4** in Object C.\n        *   Pixels of color **8** in Object A correspond to pixels of color **2** in Object C.\n        *   Pixels of color **0** (background within the object) map to **0**.\n    *   The derived mapping is: **1 $\\rightarrow$ 4** and **8 $\\rightarrow$ 2**.\n\n4.  **Transformation Application**:\n    *   The derived color mapping is applied to the unmatched object (**Object B**).\n    *   Object B's pattern:\n        ```\n        8, 1, 8, 1, 8\n        1, 8, 0, 8, 1\n        8, 0, 0, 0, 8\n        1, 8, 0, 8, 1\n        8, 1, 8, 1, 8\n        ```\n    *   Applying the mapping (8$\\rightarrow$2, 1$\\rightarrow$4):\n        ```\n        2, 4, 2, 4, 2\n        4, 2, 0, 2, 4\n        2, 0, 0, 0, 2\n        4, 2, 0, 2, 4\n        2, 4, 2, 4, 2\n        ```\n\n5.  **Geometric Transformations**:\n    *   The objects involved in the Test Input are symmetric (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally). Therefore, rotations or flips do not alter the visual outcome of the grid, though they may be theoretically part of the transformation. The primary transformation is the color swap.\n\n### Transformation Summary\n\n<transformation_summary>\nThe logic involves identifying \"objects\" defined by rectangular borders of color 5 overlaid on a noisy background. The task follows an analogy pattern: finding two objects with identical geometric shapes but different color schemes to determine a color mapping rule. In the test input, a \"cross\" shape appears twice: once with colors 1 (arms) and 8 (center), and once with colors 4 (arms) and 2 (center). This defines a mapping of 1->4 and 8->2. This mapping is then applied to the third, unique object (a complex symmetric pattern of 1s and 8s) to generate the output.\n</transformation_summary>\n\n### Output Grid\n\n2,4,2,4,2\n4,2,0,2,4\n2,0,0,0,2\n4,2,0,2,4\n2,4,2,4,2",

I must first identify a pair of objects that share geometric similarity and then work out the color mapping rule that applies to the unique object.\n\nFor the test input, I've concluded the most likely transformation is the following:\n\n1.  **Object Extraction:** Find rectangular objects defined by the border color.\n2.  **Object Pattern Matching:** Find a pair of objects that have the same geometric pattern (isomorphic).\n3.  **Color mapping derivation:** Identify the color mapping between the pair.\n4.  **Target and transformation:** Apply the color mapping to the remaining object.\n5.  **Output**: Extract the inner content of the resulting object as the output.\n\nIn the test case, two objects have a cross shape and therefore the same pattern. The color mapping is 1->4 and 8->2, with 0 remaining 0. Apply this to the target object.\n<br>\nFinal output grid for the test input is:\n\n```\n2,4,2,4,2\n4,2,0,2,4\n2,0,0,0,2\n4,2,0,2,4\n2,4,2,4,2\n```\n**",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\n**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. My initial thought is that we've got a repeating \"noise\" background. It's the standard, repeated-digit texture we often see in these kinds of problems, and it's built from sets of small integers (0-4, 1-4, etc.).  The real interesting part is the rectangular regions overlaid on this background.  These rectangular areas are the \"objects\" of interest.\n\nThe objects themselves seem to have a clear structure. There's an outer \"frame,\" a rectangular border, and the inside - which is usually Color 0, which looks like a canvas. The border itself can either be a distinct solid line (color 8, 5, or 2), or, sometimes, the border is just defined by pixels being next to others. Inside that is the real game - there are specific pixels of 1, 2, 4, or 8, forming a small shape or pattern in the Color 0 fill. Sometimes, there aren't *any* pixels inside the rectangular region (just 0s), or there is a shape/pattern. The smaller 4x4 or 5x5 grids are almost like zoomed-in samples. They contain the same shapes/colors, but in isolation.\n\nSo, in summary: we have a background pattern, and then rectangles (objects) placed on top of it.  The rectangles have a border color, a fill color (usually 0), and then content/payload. The shapes are small, and sometimes there's an absence of shapes - which is still significant.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n**\n\nMy goal is to identify and describe the transformations happening in this grid-based puzzle. I've been presented with several examples and a test case.  My approach involves carefully analyzing the grid inputs and outputs, looking for repeating patterns, identifiable objects, and any systematic changes between them.\n\nMy initial thought process involves breaking down the grid into smaller pieces. I will be identifying the unique rectangular shapes, and border colors. Then I want to know, \"what happens to the pixels *inside* these shapes?\"\n\nI noticed that in the test input, there are a repeating background pattern and overlaid rectangular regions.  In many cases, the content inside these boxes is what ultimately matters. I've realized, based on the examples and the test input, that I'm looking for a pattern, similar to how one might solve an analogy question in an IQ test.  I must first identify a pair of objects that share geometric similarity and then work out the color mapping rule that applies to the unique object.\n\nFor the test input, I've concluded the most likely transformation is the following:\n\n1.  **Object Extraction:** Find rectangular objects defined by the border color.\n2.  **Object Pattern Matching:** Find a pair of objects that have the same geometric pattern (isomorphic).\n3.  **Color mapping derivation:** Identify the color mapping between the pair.\n4.  **Target and transformation:** Apply the color mapping to the remaining object.\n5.  **Output**: Extract the inner content of the resulting object as the output.\n\nIn the test case, two objects have a cross shape and therefore the same pattern. The color mapping is 1->4 and 8->2, with 0 remaining 0. Apply this to the target object.\n<br>\nFinal output grid for the test input is:\n\n```\n2,4,2,4,2\n4,2,0,2,4\n2,0,0,0,2\n4,2,0,2,4\n2,4,2,4,2\n```\n**\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain: (1) **Tiled background patterns** - diagonal repeating sequences of 4 colors; (2) **Rectangular frames** - hollow borders of single colors (4, 5, or 8) enclosing regions; (3) **Fill regions** - areas predominantly of color 0 inside frames; (4) **Linear dividers** - horizontal/vertical lines creating sections; (5) **Small pattern markers** - individual or clustered cells (colors 6, 8) inside structures; (6) **L-shaped objects** - corner formations in smaller grids. Key attributes include: color (0-8), shape (rectangular, linear, L-shaped), size (single cell to multi-row/column), position, and whether hollow or filled.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n**Rules identified:**\n1. Identify four framed regions arranged in quadrants within divider-separated sections\n2. One region is typically empty (reference), others contain patterns\n3. Two regions may be complementary (patterns filling opposite positions)\n4. The \"key\" region (often R4/bottom-right) contains the pattern to transform\n5. **Core transformation**: Invert the key region by swapping the two main fill colors (0 and the primary non-zero color like 2 or 4)\n6. Special markers (6, 8) are preserved or converted based on context\n7. Output size matches the inner frame dimensions (4x4 or 5x5)\n8. Colors involved: 0 (fill), frame colors (4,5,8), divider colors (2,3), background noise (1,4)\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Algorithm for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task. My task is to figure out the rule based on examples and generate a result based on the pattern I discover.  I need to identify a core transformation that works across all examples. The approach involves careful analysis of the provided examples, especially relating inputs to outputs, and then testing that logic on a given test input.\n\nI start by breaking down the examples. Each consists of a 30x30 input grid and a 5x5 output. My initial thought is to spot the core repeating patterns or the differences, particularly the rectangular frames and their contents. Then I have to consider any horizontal or vertical changes.  I noticed that the examples each have rectangular boxes defined by a specific frame color. The insides of those boxes seem to contain the crucial pattern that is the key to transforming.\n\nFor Example 1, the transformation seems a bit more complex. It's a combination of horizontal flips, inversion (0 and a nonzero color swap), and probably a small color-change correction to get the correct output. I spend a lot of time figuring out the right steps to get to the correct result.\n\nThen I look at Example 2. It's supposed to represent a more direct application of the rule. Here, the rule turns out to be: find a Key Region (the source of data), Invert its content by swapping the background color (0) with the pattern color (2), and the output will come out exactly like the transformation.  I realize this seems to be the core logic. However, I have to test this on the previous example to see if it makes sense.\n\nAfter all that thinking, I'm fairly confident in the transformation logic, so I can apply the knowledge. Finally, for the Test Input, my key takeaway is that the TR region is the empty one so I will flip the BL one with a diamond and a cross pattern inside. The \"Key Region\" is usually linked with what appears inside the output. In this case, I will apply a similar logic to Test Input. The logic involves:  Identifying unique regions. Transforming by inverting colors and patterns and using the Target Color, which is often derived from the \"target\" regions. After doing my testing in my head, I get a very robust solution.\n\n\nTo solve this task, I first analyzed the structure of the input grids in the solved examples.\n1.  **Grid Parsing**: The grids are divided into four quadrants by background patterns and possibly dividers, containing rectangular frames.\n    *   **Example 1**: Contains frames of color 4. The Top-Left (TL) region has a pattern of color 1 with marker 6. The Bottom-Left (BL) region has a sparse pattern of color 2. The Output is a 5x5 grid of color 2, which resembles a horizontal flip of the TL pattern but with colors inverted and mapped to 2. However, Example 2 provides a clearer rule for the 3-filled-region case.\n    *   **Example 2**: Contains frames of color 4, 5, or 8. Identified four regions: TL (Color 4), TR (Empty), BL (Color 2), BR (Color 4). The output is a 4x4 grid of color 2. The transformation matches the **Bottom-Left (BL)** region exactly when **inverted** (swapping background 0 and pattern color 2).\n\n2.  **Rule Inference**:\n    *   The \"Empty\" region (TR in Example 2 and Test Input) serves as a reference.\n    *   The **Key Region** to transform is the **Bottom-Left (BL)** region, based on the structure of Example 2 which matches the Test Input (TL, BL, BR filled; TR empty).\n    *   **Transformation**: **Invert** the Key Region. This means swapping the background color (0) with the primary fill color of that region. Special markers (like 8) are preserved or treated as boundaries.\n\n3.  **Applying to Test Input**:\n    *   **Structure**: TL filled (Color 1), TR Empty, BL filled (Color 1), BR filled (Color 4). Matches Example 2 structure.\n    *   **Key Region**: Bottom-Left (BL).\n    *   **BL Content Extraction**:\n        *   Frame color 5. Indices 5-11 in rows 20-26.\n        *   Row 21 inner: `8,1,8,1,8`\n        *   Row 22 inner: `1,8,0,8,1`\n        *   Row 23 inner: `8,0,0,0,8`\n        *   Row 24 inner: `1,8,0,8,1`\n        *   Row 25 inner: `8,1,8,1,8`\n    *   **Transformation (Invert)**:\n        *   Primary Color is 1. Background is 0. Marker is 8.\n        *   Swap 0 and 1. Keep 8.\n        *   Row 21: `8,1,8,1,8` -> `8,0,8,0,8`\n        *   Row 22: `1,8,0,8,1` -> `0,8,1,8,0`\n        *   Row 23: `8,0,0,0,8` -> `8,1,1,1,8`\n        *   Row 24: `1,8,0,8,1` -> `0,8,1,8,0`\n        *   Row 25: `8,1,8,1,8` -> `8,0,8,0,8`\n\n8,0,8,0,8\n0,8,1,8,0\n8,1,1,1,8\n0,8,1,8,0\n8,0,8,0,8",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain: (1) **Tiled background patterns** - diagonal repeating sequences of 4 colors; (2) **Rectangular frames** - hollow borders of single colors (4, 5, or 8) enclosing regions; (3) **Fill regions** - areas predominantly of color 0 inside frames; (4) **Linear dividers** - horizontal/vertical lines creating sections; (5) **Small pattern markers** - individual or clustered cells (colors 6, 8) inside structures; (6) **L-shaped objects** - corner formations in smaller grids. Key attributes include: color (0-8), shape (rectangular, linear, L-shaped), size (single cell to multi-row/column), position, and whether hollow or filled.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n**Rules identified:**\n1. Identify four framed regions arranged in quadrants within divider-separated sections\n2. One region is typically empty (reference), others contain patterns\n3. Two regions may be complementary (patterns filling opposite positions)\n4. The \"key\" region (often R4/bottom-right) contains the pattern to transform\n5. **Core transformation**: Invert the key region by swapping the two main fill colors (0 and the primary non-zero color like 2 or 4)\n6. Special markers (6, 8) are preserved or converted based on context\n7. Output size matches the inner frame dimensions (4x4 or 5x5)\n8. Colors involved: 0 (fill), frame colors (4,5,8), divider colors (2,3), background noise (1,4)\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to identify the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Analyzing the Examples:**\n\nIn both examples, I observe:\n1. There are rectangular frames (color 4 or 8) creating bounded regions\n2. There are linear dividers (color 2 in examples, color 3/6 in test) creating sections\n3. Inside the divider-bounded areas, there are 4 framed quadrants\n4. One quadrant is typically all 0s (reference region)\n5. The key region contains a pattern that gets transformed\n\n**Example 1:** The key region has markers (6 and 2s) defining an L-shape. The output fills in lines between these markers.\n\n**Example 2:** The key region has a pattern of 2s and 0s. The output swaps 0\u21942 (the fill colors).\n\n**Analyzing the Test Input:**\n\nI identify 4 framed regions (frames of 5s):\n\n**Region 1** (top-left, rows 4-8, cols 6-10):\n```\n0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,0,0\n0,1,8,1,0\n0,0,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0\n```\n\n**Region 2** (top-right, rows 4-8, cols 20-24):\nAll 0s - this is the reference region\n\n**Region 4** (bottom-right, rows 21-25, cols 20-24):\n```\n0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0\n0,4,2,4,0\n0,0,4,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0\n```\n\nRegion 4 has the same structure as Region 1 but with different colors:\n- Background: 0\n- Pattern (cross shape): 4\n- Center marker: 2\n\n**Applying the Transformation:**\n\nFollowing the pattern from Example 2 (swap fill colors), I need to swap 0\u21944 while preserving the special center marker (2):\n\nOriginal:\n```\n0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0\n0,4,2,4,0\n0,0,4,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0\n```\n\nAfter swapping 0\u21944 (keeping 2):\n- Where there were 0s \u2192 now 4s\n- Where there were 4s \u2192 now 0s\n- The 2 (center marker) stays as 2\n\n```\n4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,0,4,4\n4,0,2,0,4\n4,4,0,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4\n```",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain: (1) **Tiled background patterns** - diagonal repeating sequences of 4 colors; (2) **Rectangular frames** - hollow borders of single colors (4, 5, or 8) enclosing regions; (3) **Fill regions** - areas predominantly of color 0 inside frames; (4) **Linear dividers** - horizontal/vertical lines creating sections; (5) **Small pattern markers** - individual or clustered cells (colors 6, 8) inside structures; (6) **L-shaped objects** - corner formations in smaller grids. Key attributes include: color (0-8), shape (rectangular, linear, L-shaped), size (single cell to multi-row/column), position, and whether hollow or filled.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n**Rules identified:**\n1. Identify four framed regions arranged in quadrants within divider-separated sections\n2. One region is typically empty (reference), others contain patterns\n3. Two regions may be complementary (patterns filling opposite positions)\n4. The \"key\" region (often R4/bottom-right) contains the pattern to transform\n5. **Core transformation**: Invert the key region by swapping the two main fill colors (0 and the primary non-zero color like 2 or 4)\n6. Special markers (6, 8) are preserved or converted based on context\n7. Output size matches the inner frame dimensions (4x4 or 5x5)\n8. Colors involved: 0 (fill), frame colors (4,5,8), divider colors (2,3), background noise (1,4)\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "First, I\u2019ll outline the structural pattern that\u2019s consistent across the inputs, then apply it to the test.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Common structure in the inputs\n\nIn all three inputs (both examples and the test):\n\n- The grid is a large patterned \u201cbackground\u201d.\n- Inside it are **four identical-size framed squares**, arranged in a 2\u00d72 layout:\n  - Top\u2011left, top\u2011right, bottom\u2011left, bottom\u2011right.\n- Each frame is a hollow square of a single color (4 or 5 or 8), enclosing a smaller **inner square**:\n  - Example 1: frame color 4, inner size 5\u00d75.\n  - Example 2: frame color 8, inner size 4\u00d74.\n  - Test: frame color 5, inner size 5\u00d75.\n\nFor the test, the four frames are:\n\n- Top\u2011left: rows 4\u201310, cols 6\u201312 (border 5), inner 5\u00d75 at rows 5\u20139, cols 7\u201311.\n- Top\u2011right: rows 4\u201310, cols 20\u201326 (border 5), inner 5\u00d75 at rows 5\u20139, cols 21\u201325 (all zeros).\n- Bottom\u2011left: rows 21\u201327, cols 6\u201312 (border 5), inner 5\u00d75 at rows 22\u201326, cols 7\u201311.\n- Bottom\u2011right: rows 21\u201327, cols 20\u201326 (border 5), inner 5\u00d75 at rows 22\u201326, cols 21\u201325.\n\nThe **bottom\u2011right inner square** is the key region for the output, in all cases.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Interpreting the key region\n\nIn the **test**, the bottom\u2011right inner 5\u00d75 (rows 22\u201326, cols 21\u201325) is:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0\n0 4 2 4 0\n0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n- There is a single **central marker** (color 2) at the center.\n- Four **arm cells** (color 4) around it (up, left, right, down):\n  - A clear \u201cplus\u201d / cross structure centered on the 2.\n- The rest is 0 (empty).\n\nThis matches the way Example 1 encodes an L\u2011shape with a \u201cmarker\u201d color and arm colors, and then the output standardizes the shape into a canonical color (2) and erases the original arm colors.\n\nSo, for the transformation:\n\n- Interpret the **non\u2011zero structure inside the key region** (here, the central 2 and the four 4\u2019s) as a plus\u2011shaped object.\n- Standardize this object into color **2**, and set everything else to **0**.\n- Concretely in this test:\n  - Every cell that is 2 or 4 in the key 5\u00d75 becomes 2.\n  - Every 0 remains 0.\n\nApplying that mapping to the key region:\n\nInput key region:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0\n0 4 2 4 0\n0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nMap 2\u21922, 4\u21922, 0\u21920:\n\nResulting 5\u00d75:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0\n0 2 2 2 0\n0 0 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nThis is the final output grid.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n\nWritten as comma\u2011separated rows:\n\n0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,2,0,0  \n0,2,2,2,0  \n0,0,2,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain: (1) **Tiled background patterns** - diagonal repeating sequences of 4 colors; (2) **Rectangular frames** - hollow borders of single colors (4, 5, or 8) enclosing regions; (3) **Fill regions** - areas predominantly of color 0 inside frames; (4) **Linear dividers** - horizontal/vertical lines creating sections; (5) **Small pattern markers** - individual or clustered cells (colors 6, 8) inside structures; (6) **L-shaped objects** - corner formations in smaller grids. Key attributes include: color (0-8), shape (rectangular, linear, L-shaped), size (single cell to multi-row/column), position, and whether hollow or filled.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n**Rules identified:**\n1. Identify four framed regions arranged in quadrants within divider-separated sections\n2. One region is typically empty (reference), others contain patterns\n3. Two regions may be complementary (patterns filling opposite positions)\n4. The \"key\" region (often R4/bottom-right) contains the pattern to transform\n5. **Core transformation**: Invert the key region by swapping the two main fill colors (0 and the primary non-zero color like 2 or 4)\n6. Special markers (6, 8) are preserved or converted based on context\n7. Output size matches the inner frame dimensions (4x4 or 5x5)\n8. Colors involved: 0 (fill), frame colors (4,5,8), divider colors (2,3), background noise (1,4)\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "The input contains a hollow rectangular frame of colour 5 from rows 21\u201327 and columns 20\u201326, with a 5\u00d75 interior comprising mostly 0s and a cross of 4s with a central 2. With no special marker present, the transformation inverts the interior by swapping 0 and the main pattern colour (here 4), leaving the other value unchanged.\n\nApplying this swap to the interior produces:\n\n4,4,4,4,4\n4,4,0,4,4\n4,0,2,0,4\n4,4,0,4,4\n4,4,4,4,4",

These patterns typically use 4 colors cycling in a predictable manner (e.g., colors 0,1,2,3 or colors 3,4,5,6). The patterns form the base layer upon which other objects are placed.\n\n## Rectangular Frame Objects\nMultiple grids feature **hollow rectangular frames** formed by a single color (commonly color 4, color 5, or color 8). These frames:\n- Have consistent border width (typically 1 cell)\n- Enclose interior regions of varying sizes\n- Can appear at different positions within the grid\n- May appear multiple times within the same grid\n\n## Interior Fill Regions\nThe areas inside rectangular frames contain:\n- Predominantly **color 0** as a fill/background\n- Occasional **scattered cells** of other colors forming small patterns\n- Small **cross-like or symmetric patterns** using colors like 1 and 8\n\n## Linear Dividers\n**Horizontal and vertical lines** of a single color span portions of grids:\n- These create visual sections or boundaries\n- Often use the same color as frame borders (e.g., color 4, color 1, color 2)\n- Can extend fully across or partially through the grid\n\n## Small Marker Objects\n**Individual cells or small clusters** of distinct colors (like color 6 or color 8) appear as markers or indicators within larger structures, often positioned at specific locations inside frames.\n\n## L-Shaped Objects\nIn smaller grids, **L-shaped formations** appear, consisting of connected vertical and horizontal segments of a single color (e.g., color 2), typically positioned at corners.\n\n<objects_summary>\nThe grids contain: (1) **Tiled background patterns** - diagonal repeating sequences of 4 colors; (2) **Rectangular frames** - hollow borders of single colors (4, 5, or 8) enclosing regions; (3) **Fill regions** - areas predominantly of color 0 inside frames; (4) **Linear dividers** - horizontal/vertical lines creating sections; (5) **Small pattern markers** - individual or clustered cells (colors 6, 8) inside structures; (6) **L-shaped objects** - corner formations in smaller grids. Key attributes include: color (0-8), shape (rectangular, linear, L-shaped), size (single cell to multi-row/column), position, and whether hollow or filled.\n</objects_summary>",

Objects Description\nThe grids contain: (1) **Tiled background patterns** - diagonal repeating sequences of 4 colors; (2) **Rectangular frames** - hollow borders of single colors (4, 5, or 8) enclosing regions; (3) **Fill regions** - areas predominantly of color 0 inside frames; (4) **Linear dividers** - horizontal/vertical lines creating sections; (5) **Small pattern markers** - individual or clustered cells (colors 6, 8) inside structures; (6) **L-shaped objects** - corner formations in smaller grids. Key attributes include: color (0-8), shape (rectangular, linear, L-shaped), size (single cell to multi-row/column), position, and whether hollow or filled.",
                "response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify the key transformations:\n\n## Analysis of Example 1:\n**Input structure:**\n- 30x30 grid with tiled background (colors 1,2,3,4)\n- Horizontal dividers of 1s, vertical dividers of 2s\n- Four rectangular 4-frames containing 5x5 regions\n- Inside regions have 0s, noise from background (1s), and markers (6)\n\n**Regions identified:**\n- TL: Cross/L-shape of 1s (noise) with 6 markers\n- TR: Minimal noise pattern\n- BL: Contains intentional 2 markers\n- BR: Empty (all 0s)\n\n**Transformation:** The output shows noise positions converted to color 2, with 6 markers preserved. The output L-shape appears to be a reflection of TL's noise pattern combined with BL's markers.\n\n## Analysis of Example 2:\n**Input structure:**\n- 30x30 grid with background (colors 0,1,2,3,4)\n- 4-frames (outer) containing 8-frames (inner)\n- Four 4x4 regions inside the 8-frames\n\n**Regions identified:**\n- R1: Pattern of 4s\n- R2: Empty (all 0s)\n- R3: Complementary pattern to R1 (where R1 has 4, R3 has 0)\n- R4: Pattern with 2s and 0s\n\n**Transformation:** Output = Inverse of R4 (swap 0\u21942). Every position where R4=0 becomes 2, and where R4=2 becomes 0.\n\n## Test Input Analysis:\n**Structure:**\n- 30x30 grid with background (colors 3,4,5,6)\n- Dividers of 3s\n- 5-frames containing four 5x5 regions\n\n**Regions:**\n- R1: Cross pattern with 1s and 8 in center\n- R2: Empty (all 0s)  \n- R3: Complement of R1 (elaborate 8,1 pattern)\n- R4: Cross pattern with 4s and 2 in center\n\nFollowing Example 2's pattern (R4 inversion):\n- Swap 0\u21944, preserve special center value (2)\n\n<transformation_summary>\n**Rules identified:**\n1. Identify four framed regions arranged in quadrants within divider-separated sections\n2. One region is typically empty (reference), others contain patterns\n3. Two regions may be complementary (patterns filling opposite positions)\n4. The \"key\" region (often R4/bottom-right) contains the pattern to transform\n5. **Core transformation**: Invert the key region by swapping the two main fill colors (0 and the primary non-zero color like 2 or 4)\n6. Special markers (6, 8) are preserved or converted based on context\n7. Output size matches the inner frame dimensions (4x4 or 5x5)\n8.

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain: (1) **Tiled background patterns** - diagonal repeating sequences of 4 colors; (2) **Rectangular frames** - hollow borders of single colors (4, 5, or 8) enclosing regions; (3) **Fill regions** - areas predominantly of color 0 inside frames; (4) **Linear dividers** - horizontal/vertical lines creating sections; (5) **Small pattern markers** - individual or clustered cells (colors 6, 8) inside structures; (6) **L-shaped objects** - corner formations in smaller grids. Key attributes include: color (0-8), shape (rectangular, linear, L-shaped), size (single cell to multi-row/column), position, and whether hollow or filled.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n**Rules identified:**\n1. Identify four framed regions arranged in quadrants within divider-separated sections\n2. One region is typically empty (reference), others contain patterns\n3. Two regions may be complementary (patterns filling opposite positions)\n4. The \"key\" region (often R4/bottom-right) contains the pattern to transform\n5. **Core transformation**: Invert the key region by swapping the two main fill colors (0 and the primary non-zero color like 2 or 4)\n6. Special markers (6, 8) are preserved or converted based on context\n7. Output size matches the inner frame dimensions (4x4 or 5x5)\n8. Colors involved: 0 (fill), frame colors (4,5,8), divider colors (2,3), background noise (1,4)\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
