Each input contained three colours: a dominant background, a \u201cmain\u201d colour forming the bulk of the non\u2011background pattern, and a small horizontal block of a third accent colour.\n\nIn the outputs a new colour 3 was introduced. The accent block\u2019s horizontal span was used to define a set of columns. In the outputs those columns were overwritten with a repeating vertical stripe pattern: starting at the top row, on rows with index 1\u202f(mod\u202f6) they are filled with colour\u202f3, on rows with index 3 or 5\u202f(mod\u202f6) they are filled with the accent colour, and on even rows they are reset to background. In addition, on rows with index 1\u202f(mod\u202f6) every cell of the main colour in that row is recoloured to 3. All other cells remain as in the input unless they are overwritten by the stripes.\n\nApplying this to the test grid, the background is 8, the main colour is 6, the accent colour 4 spans columns 8\u201315.

I've broken down the rules based on the provided examples and descriptions. First, locate the marker bar. It defines the \"projection columns\" that extend vertically throughout the grid. Then, I need to iterate through each row.\n\nIf the row index is a multiple of 6 (0, 6, 12, etc.), the projection columns become color 3, and all blob cells within that row also become color 3. So, if there are blobs, they get merged into the projection.\n\nIf the row index is even (but not a multiple of 6), the projection columns become color 4, while blobs outside those columns stay as they are. This seems straightforward - just replace the projection cells with the appropriate color and preserve the blobs.\n\nIf the row index is odd, the projection columns get the background color (8), and blobs within those projection columns also become background color. Blobs that fall outside these ranges stay the same.\n\nIn summary, the core logic relies on the modular arithmetic to decide if the row is divisible by 6, even or odd, and the action to take. The logic is consistent, projection zone gets modified, blob cells get handled based on the overlap, and other cells stay the same.\n\n\nThe task requires transforming a grid of integers based on a specific vertical projection pattern defined by a \"marker bar\" of color 4 found in the input. The background color is 8, and blob regions are color 6.\n\n### Analysis of the Transformation Rules\n1.  **Identify Projection Columns**: The input grid contains a horizontal segment of 4s (marker bar). The columns occupied by these 4s define the \"projection zone\" for the entire grid height. In the test input, the marker bar is located at Row 0, spanning columns 7 through 14 (inclusive).\n\n2.  **Row-based Transformation**: The grid is processed row by row (index `y`), applying different rules based on the row index modulo 6 and modulo 2:\n    *   **Rule A: Every 6th row (`y % 6 == 0`)**:\n        *   The cells in the projection columns (7-14) become color 3.\n        *   Additionally, any \"blob\" cells (color 6) existing anywhere in this row also become color 3.\n        *   Background cells (8) outside the projection remain 8.\n    *   **Rule B: Other Even Rows (`y % 2 == 0` and `y % 6 != 0`)**:\n        *   The cells in the projection columns (7-14) become color 4.\n        *   Blob cells (6) located *outside* the projection columns remain color 6.\n        *   Blob cells (6) located *inside* the projection columns are overwritten by the 4s.\n        *   Background cells (8) outside the projection remain 8.\n    *   **Rule C: Odd Rows (`y % 2 != 0`)**:\n        *   The cells in the projection columns (7-14) become the background color (8). This effectively \"clears\" the projection zone.\n        *   Blob cells (6) located *outside* the projection columns remain color 6.\n        *   Blob cells (6) located *inside* the projection columns are cleared to background (8).\n\n### Step-by-Step Application to Test Input\nThe grid size is 25x25. Projection columns are 7-14.\n\n*   **Row 0 (`% 6 == 0`)**: Input contains the marker (4s).

Interpreting the training examples\n\nAcross both examples we see:\n\n- A **background color** (1 in example 1, 8 in example 2).\n- A **main figure color** (8 in example 1, 2 in example 2).\n- A **template color** 4, appearing only as a single horizontal bar in one row.\n- A **new color** 3, not present in the input, introduced in the output.\n\n### 1.1. The horizontal 4\u2011bar as a template\n\nIn both examples:\n\n- Color 4 appears as one contiguous horizontal bar in exactly one row.\n- In the output, that bar is *copied vertically* in the same columns, in a regular vertical pattern.\n- In those same columns a color 3 bar also appears periodically.\n\nIf you look only at the **columns where the original 4-bar lies**, in the outputs of both examples:\n\n- Along those columns you see a **vertical stripe** made of 4, 3 and background, independent of the shape of the main figure.\n- The pattern is periodic with respect to vertical distance from the original 4\u2011bar row.\n\nWe can describe this precisely:\n\nLet the row containing the template bar of 4s be `r_pat`. Let the bar occupy columns `c_start\u2026c_end`.\n\nFor any row `r`, consider the vertical distance `d = r - r_pat`.\n\n- If `d = 0`: keep the original 4s (the template row).\n- If `|d|` is **odd**: in columns `c_start\u2026c_end`, set the cells to the **background color**.\n- If `|d|` is **even**, let `k = |d| / 2`. Then in columns `c_start\u2026c_end`:\n  - If `k mod 3` is 0 or 1 \u2192 set color **4**.\n  - If `k mod 3` is 2 \u2192 set color **3**.\n\nSo as you go away from the template row in steps of two rows, the sequence of colors on those rows in the stripe is:\n\n> 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, \u2026\n\nRows at odd `|d|` positions get the background color in those columns.\n\nThis rule exactly reproduces the vertical pattern of 3s and 4s in the template columns in both training examples.\n\n### 1.2. Recoloring the main figure on the \u201c3-rows\u201d\n\nA second, independent effect:\n\n- On rows where the stripe (in the template columns) takes the value **3** (i.e. rows with `|d|` even and `k mod 3 = 2`), all cells of the **main figure color** are recolored to 3 across the entire row (all columns), not just in the stripe.\n- On the other rows, figure-colored cells remain as they are, except where they lie in the stripe and are overwritten by the stripe\u2019s color (3, 4 or background) as per the rule above.\n\nYou can see this in the examples:\n\n- Example 1: figure color is 8, background 1, template row at bottom. On rows 1, 7, 13, 19, 25 (which satisfy that `k mod 3 = 2` condition) all 8s are turned into 3, anywhere on the row.\n- Example 2: figure color is 2, background 8, template row at bottom. On rows 1, 7, 13, 19, 25 all 2s are turned into 3.\n\nThe stripe behavior and the row\u2011wide recoloring behavior together fully explain the training outputs.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying the rule to the test input\n\n### 2.1. Identify colors and the template\n\nTest input:\n\n- Dominant color is **8** \u2192 this is the **background**.\n- The other widely used color is **6** \u2192 this is the **main figure**.\n- The color **4** appears only as a contiguous bar in row 1, columns 8\u201315 \u2192 this is the **template bar**.\n\nSo:\n\n- Background `B = 8`\n- Figure `F = 6`\n- Template color `P = 4`\n- New color `N = 3`\n- `r_pat = 1`\n- Template columns: `c = 8\u202615` (8 through 15 inclusive).\n\n### 2.2. Compute the vertical stripe in columns 8\u201315\n\nFor each row `r` from 1 to 25:\n\n1. Compute `d = r - r_pat = r - 1`.\n2. If `d = 0`: keep the 4s in columns 8\u201315 (row 1 unchanged in those columns).\n3. If `|d|` is odd: set columns 8\u201315 to background 8.\n4. If `|d|` is even (`d >= 0` here, so `k = d / 2`):\n   - If `k mod 3` is 0 or 1: set columns 8\u201315 to 4.\n   - If `k mod 3` is 2: set columns 8\u201315 to 3.\n\nCompute the stripe color row by row:\n\n- r=1: d=0, k=0 \u2192 4\n- r=2: d=1 odd \u2192 8\n- r=3: d=2, k=1 \u2192 4\n- r=4: d=3 odd \u2192 8\n- r=5: d=4, k=2 \u2192 3\n- r=6: d=5 odd \u2192 8\n- r=7: d=6, k=3 \u2192 4\n- r=8: d=7 odd \u2192 8\n- r=9: d=8, k=4 \u2192 4\n- r=10: d=9 odd \u2192 8\n- r=11: d=10, k=5 \u2192 3\n- r=12: d=11 odd \u2192 8\n- r=13: d=12, k=6 \u2192 4\n- r=14: d=13 odd \u2192 8\n- r=15: d=14, k=7 \u2192 4\n- r=16: d=15 odd \u2192 8\n- r=17: d=16, k=8 \u2192 3\n- r=18: d=17 odd \u2192 8\n- r=19: d=18, k=9 \u2192 4\n- r=20: d=19 odd \u2192 8\n- r=21: d=20, k=10 \u2192 4\n- r=22: d=21 odd \u2192 8\n- r=23: d=22, k=11 \u2192 3\n- r=24: d=23 odd \u2192 8\n- r=25: d=24, k=12 \u2192 4\n\nThus the **stripe rows with color 3** (the \u201c3-rows\u201d) are: **5, 11, 17, 23**.\n\nOn every row we now overwrite columns 8\u201315 with the stripe color for that row.\n\nAdditionally, on rows 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24 the stripe color is 8, so any 6s that originally lay in columns 8\u201315 there are removed (turned to background).\n\n### 2.3. Recolor figure cells on the 3-rows\n\nOn each 3-row (rows 5, 11, 17, 23):\n\n- For all columns, any cell with color 6 is changed to color 3.\n\nThis is independent of the stripe (though in columns 8\u201315 the stripe is also 3 on those rows, so the two actions are consistent).\n\nApplying both steps to each row gives the final grid below.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

Call these **3-rows**.\n\n   On those 3-rows, we see:\n\n   - Example 1:\n     - Row 7, 13, 19, 25\u2026 are 3-rows.\n     - On those rows, **all cells of the shape color 8** are changed to 3 across the whole row.\n       - Row 7: 8s at columns 5\u20137 \u2192 3; plus the 4-columns (12\u201315) are already 3 by vertical pattern.\n       - Row 13: 8s at 10\u201318 \u2192 3.\n       - Row 19: 8s at 3\u201312 and 16\u201318 \u2192 3; plus 12\u201315 (4-columns) are 3, so net 3s from 3\u201318.\n       - Row 25: 8s at 3\u20137 and 12\u201319 \u2192 3.\n\n   - Example 2:\n     - 3-rows are rows 1,7,13,19,25.\n     - On those rows, **all 2s** are converted to 3, and the 4-columns are 3 by the vertical pattern:\n       - Row 7: 2s at 3\u201313 \u2192 3.\n       - Row 13: 2s at 2\u20136 \u2192 3.\n       - Row 19: 2s at 1\u20137 \u2192 3.\n       - Row 25: 2s at 7\u201311 and 18\u201320 \u2192 3.\n\n   Outside the 4-columns and outside these 3-rows, the shape color remains unchanged.\n\n   So the horizontal rule is:\n\n   > On each row where the vertical pattern places a **3** in the 4-columns, recolor **all cells of the shape color** on that row to 3. (And ensure the 4-columns on that row are 3, which the vertical pattern already does.)\n\n4. **Orientation and anchor detection**\n\n   In the training examples, the row with 4s is the **bottom row**, and the pattern is applied going upwards (towards smaller row indices).\n\n   In the test, the row of 4s is instead the **top row**. The natural generalization is:\n\n   - Find the unique row containing a horizontal run of 4s (this is the **anchor row**).\n   - Determine if it\u2019s at the top or bottom edge:\n     - If at the top, apply the vertical 6-cycle pattern **downwards**.\n     - If at the bottom, apply it **upwards**.\n   - For each column that has a 4 in the anchor row, apply the repeated [4, B, 4, B, 3, B] pattern along that column away from the edge.\n   - 3-rows are exactly those with offset 4 in this 6-cycle relative to the anchor row.\n   - On each 3-row, recolor all cells of the shape color to 3.\n\n5. **Identify colors in the test grid**\n\n   Test input has:\n\n   - Dominant color: **8** \u2192 background B.\n   - Special line color: **4** (only on row 1, columns 8\u201315) \u2192 anchor color.\n   - Remaining non-background color: **6** \u2192 shape color S.\n\n   Anchor row r\u2080 is **row 1**. The anchor columns are **8 through 15**.\n\n   Apply the vertical pattern downward from row 1:\n   - Let k = (row_index \u2013 r\u2080) mod 6.\n   - If k = 0 or 2 \u2192 color 4 in the anchor columns.\n   - If k = 1, 3, or 5 \u2192 background 8 in the anchor columns.\n   - If k = 4 \u2192 color 3 in the anchor columns (these rows are the 3-rows).\n\n   With r\u2080=1, the k-values per row are:\n\n   - k=0: rows 1,7,13,19,25 \u2192 4 in columns 8\u201315.\n   - k=1: rows 2,8,14,20 \u2192 8 in columns 8\u201315.\n   - k=2: rows 3,9,15,21 \u2192 4 in columns 8\u201315.\n   - k=3: rows 4,10,16,22 \u2192 8 in columns 8\u201315.\n   - k=4: rows **5,11,17,23** \u2192 3 in columns 8\u201315 (**3-rows**).\n   - k=5: rows 6,12,18,24 \u2192 8 in columns 8\u201315.\n\n   Then, on each 3-row (5,11,17,23), convert every 6 in that row to 3 (outside and inside the anchor columns).\n\n   All other cells remain as in the input, except where overwritten in anchor columns by the vertical pattern.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n\nApplying the above steps to the test input yields:\n\nRow 1 (anchor row, unchanged except it already has the 4s):\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 2:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 3:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 4:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 5 (3-row, all 6\u21923):\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 6:\n8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n\nRow 7:\n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n\nRow 8:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 9:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 10:\n8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 11 (3-row):\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 12:\n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 13:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 14:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n\nRow 15:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8\n\nRow 16:\n8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8\n\nRow 17 (3-row):\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8\n\nRow 18:\n8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n\nRow 19:\n8,8,8,8,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n\nRow 20:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n\nRow 21:\n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8\n\nRow 22:\n8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 23 (3-row):\n8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 24:\n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 25:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_B>\n<REASONING_MODEL_C model_id=\"gpt-5.1-high_5_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8\n8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8\n8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8\n8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_C>\n<REASONING_MODEL_D model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\nThe key steps are:\n\n- The dominant colour (8) is the background.

Cells outside the anchor columns on non\u2011green rows stay as they were.\n\nApplying this yields:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8\n8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8\n8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8\n8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_D>\n<REASONING_MODEL_E model_id=\"gpt-5.1-high_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\n**Step 1 \u2013 Identify the anchor**\n\nFrom the solved examples:\n\n- In both examples, the only occurrences of color `4` in the input are a horizontal block touching one edge of the grid.\n- That block of `4`s is unchanged in the output and acts as the **anchor**.\n- The new pattern (4s and 3s) radiates vertically from this anchor.\n\nFor the **test input**:\n\n- Color `4` appears only in the **top** row:\n  - Row 0: columns 7\u201314 are `4`.\n- So the anchor is this top row segment:\n  - Anchor row index `r_anchor = 0`\n  - Anchor columns `S = {7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14}`\n\nHere, the anchor is on the top edge instead of the bottom, so the pattern is projected **downwards** into the grid.\n\nBackground and shapes:\n\n- Background color is `8` (dominant everywhere).\n- Shape color is `6` (all non-background, non-anchor interior structures).\n- New color in examples is `3` (green); anchor color is `4`.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 The vertical \u201cladder\u201d pattern**\n\nFrom Examples 1 and 2:\n\n- At every column in `S`, a vertical \u201cladder\u201d is drawn away from the anchor, with:\n  - **Rungs every 2 rows**, i.e. rows at even distance from the anchor.\n  - **Gaps** (background) on the rows in between (odd distance).\n- The rung *colors* follow a repeating pattern along the ladder:\n\n  Let `d = |row - r_anchor|` be the vertical distance from the anchor row.\n\n  - If `d` is **odd**: no rung; the ladder cells at columns `S` are set to background.\n  - If `d` is **even**, define rung index `k = d / 2`.

It's like a visual logic problem, and the user wants me to do it \"silently,\" so everything is happening in my hidden scratchpad. I'm being asked to follow a \"protocol override,\" but essentially, it boils down to: figure out the pattern, explain my thinking, and then give the final answer grid.\n\nInitially, I had a bit of a hiccup because the instructions were slightly contradictory \u2013 saying to \"reveal only the final answer grid\" and also to \"respond with an explanation.\" But it's pretty clear they want the explanation, so that's what I'll do!\n\nI've carefully analyzed two example grids, noting the colors, shapes, and positions. The core pattern seems to be about how a \"seed\" shape, often a unique color bar at the bottom or top, projects and affects other shapes in the grid. Even and odd rows are handled differently. There's a rule that says even rows are modified, while odd rows stay the same. Every sixth even row triggers a special \"Green Mode\" (all \"foreground\" colors, as well as the seed-projection-area, in that row turn into Green). In all other even rows a \"Yellow Mode\" is triggered, where the projection is colored Yellow, and other foreground pixels remain unchanged. I've also figured out the specific columns the seed shape spans, that the \"transformation\" affects. I've broken down each example row-by-row, paying close attention to where colors change and how those changes are related to the seed.\n\nAfter analyzing the examples, I can now identify the pattern for this task, I've used this to generate a final answer grid for the test input.\n\n\nThe transformation rule is inferred as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the \"Seed\"**: In the input grid, there is a distinct horizontal bar of a unique color (4/Yellow in the examples and test input) that acts as a generator. In the test input, this seed bar `4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4` is located at Row 0, spanning columns 7 to 14.\n2.  **Identify the Modes**: The transformation applies only to rows with the same parity as the seed row (even rows in the test case). Odd rows remain unchanged.\n    *   Calculate the distance $d$ from the seed row ($d = |row - seed\\_row|$).\n    *   If $d \\mod 6 == 4$: The row is in **Green Mode**.\n    *   Otherwise (if $d$ is even and $d \\mod 6 \\neq 4$): The row is in **Yellow Mode**.\n3.  **Apply Transformation per Mode**:\n    *   **Yellow Mode**: The columns occupied by the seed (columns 7-14) are stamped with the seed color (4/Yellow). Existing foreground pixels (6/Pink) outside this projection remain unchanged. Foreground pixels inside the projection are overwritten by 4.\n    *   **Green Mode**: All foreground pixels (6/Pink) in the row are converted to Green (3). Additionally, the seed's projection area (columns 7-14) is filled with Green (3). This effectively merges the projection shape with the existing foreground shape and turns the result Green.\n4.  **Preserve Background**: The background color (8/Teal) is preserved unless overwritten by the projection or foreground transformation.\n\n**Application to Test Input (25x25 grid, Seed at Row 0):**\n*   **Rows 0, 2, 6, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24** are in **Yellow Mode**.

In all examples the grid has:\n     - a **background** color (Example1: `1`, Example2: `8`, Test: `8`);\n     - an **object** color (Example1: `8`, Example2: `2`, Test: `6`);\n     - a short horizontal bar of color **4** on one border row.\n   - That bar is always a single contiguous run of 4\u2019s and is the only 4 in the input.  \n     It acts as a \u201cseed\u201d from which a vertical pattern grows.\n\n2. **Vertical trunk**\n\n   - From the seed bar we build a vertical \u201ctrunk\u201d of width equal to the seed bar\n     and at the same columns.\n   - The trunk extends **into the interior of the grid**, i.e.:\n     - in the examples, the seed 4-bar is on the **bottom** row,\n       so the trunk grows **upwards**;\n     - in the test, the seed 4-bar is on the **top** row,\n       so the trunk must grow **downwards**.\n   - The trunk occupies **every other row**, starting from the seed row and\n     skipping one row in between.\n       - Let `r0` be the seed row index.\n       - Define rows `r(k) = r0 + 2\u00b7k\u00b7dir` where `dir = -1` when the seed is at\n         the bottom, `+1` when it is at the top.\n   - Along these trunk rows the color of the trunk follows a repeating pattern\n     (seen in both training pairs when indexed from the seed row):\n     \n     `4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, ...`   (period 3 over the sequence of trunk rows)\n\n     i.e. for trunk row number `k` (k = 0 at the seed row):\n\n     - if `k mod 3` is `0` or `1` \u2192 trunk color = `4`\n     - if `k mod 3` is `2`       \u2192 trunk color = `3`\n\n   - On those rows we overwrite all cells in the seed\u2019s column interval with\n     this trunk color, regardless of what was there.\n\n3. **Horizontal bars on \u201cgreen\u201d rows**\n\n   - In both examples, additional horizontal bars appear exactly on trunk rows\n     whose trunk color is **3** (green).\n   - Behaviour on such a row:\n     - Every cell of the **object color** in that row (any column) is recolored\n       to `3`.\n     - We do *not* recolor background cells (except where they already lie inside\n       the trunk columns).\n   - On trunk rows whose color is **4** we do nothing besides painting the trunk\n     strip itself.\n\n4. **Apply to the test grid**\n\n   - Background = `8`, object color = `6`.\n   - The only 4\u2019s are on **row 1**, columns 8\u201315.  \n     So:\n       - `r0 = 1`, `dir = +1` (grow downward),\n       - trunk columns = 8..15 (width 8).\n\n   - Trunk rows and colors, using `4,4,3` cycling:\n\n     - k=0 \u2192 row 1  \u2192 color 4\n     - k=1 \u2192 row 3  \u2192 color 4\n     - k=2 \u2192 row 5  \u2192 color 3   (horizontal recolor of 6\u2019s here)\n     - k=3 \u2192 row 7  \u2192 color 4\n     - k=4 \u2192 row 9  \u2192 color 4\n     - k=5 \u2192 row 11 \u2192 color 3   (horizontal recolor)\n     - k=6 \u2192 row 13 \u2192 color 4\n     - k=7 \u2192 row 15 \u2192 color 4\n     - k=8 \u2192 row 17 \u2192 color 3   (horizontal recolor)\n     - k=9 \u2192 row 19 \u2192 color 4\n     - k=10\u2192 row 21 \u2192 color 4\n     - k=11\u2192 row 23 \u2192 color 3   (horizontal recolor)\n     - k=12\u2192 row 25 \u2192 color 4\n\n   - On each of these rows we paint columns 8\u201315 with the given trunk color.\n   - Additionally, on rows 5, 11, 17, 23 we recolor all `6` cells in that row\n     to `3`.\n\n   All other cells remain as in the input.\n\n---\n\n**Resulting output grid**\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8\n8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8\n8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8\n8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_B>\n<REASONING_MODEL_C model_id=\"gpt-5.1-high_8_step_5_image\">\n**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Colors and objects**\n\n   Looking at the examples:\n\n   - There are three relevant colors:\n     - Background color \\(B\\) (blue in ex.1, light blue in ex.2).\n     - A single \u201cobject\u201d color \\(O\\) (8 in ex.1, 2 in ex.2) forming many blobs.\n     - A special horizontal bar color \\(P\\) (4) that appears as one contiguous bar on the border.\n\n   - In the outputs, color 3 (green) appears only in the transformed pattern; it never exists in the inputs.\n\n2. **Vertical stripe (\u201cladder\u201d)**\n\n   From both examples:\n\n   - The vertical stripe occupies exactly the same columns as the original bar \\(P\\).\n   - Its width equals the width of that bar.\n   - It extends from the bar across the grid, in the direction away from the border the bar touches (in the examples, up from a bottom bar).\n   - The stripe is only drawn on every second row (i.e., rows with the same parity as the bar\u2019s row).\n   - Along those rows, the stripe color follows a repeating pattern as you move away from the bar:\n\n     Let \\(R\\) be the row of the original bar and let a \u201cladder row\u201d be any row \\(r\\) with the same parity as \\(R\\).  \n     Define \\(n = \\frac{|r-R|}{2}\\) (0 for the bar row itself, then 1,2,3\u2026 as you move out in steps of 2 rows).\n\n     Then:\n     - If \\(n \\bmod 3 \\in \\{0,1\\}\\): stripe color is \\(P\\) (4).\n     - If \\(n \\bmod 3 = 2\\): stripe color is 3.\n\n     So along ladder rows, the colors go \\(4,4,3,4,4,3,\\dots\\) away from the bar.\n\n   - On \u201cnon\u2011ladder\u201d rows (other parity), nothing is drawn in the stripe columns.\n\n3. **Effect on the object color**\n\n   Compare inputs and outputs row by row:\n\n   - On ladder rows whose stripe color is 4:\n     - Only the stripe columns are changed (whatever was there becomes 4).\n     - All other object pixels \\(O\\) in that row remain \\(O\\).\n\n   - On ladder rows whose stripe color is 3:\n     - The stripe columns are set to 3.\n     - **Every** pixel of the object color \\(O\\) anywhere in that row is also changed to 3.\n       (This explains the long horizontal green bars in both training outputs.)\n     - Background pixels \\(B\\) outside the stripe are not touched.\n\n   This simple rule reproduces both example pairs exactly.\n\n4. **Identify parameters in the test input**\n\n   For the test grid:\n\n   - Background color \\(B = 8\\) (dominant, fills frame).\n   - The only other colors are 4 and 6.  \n     - Color 4 appears as a single horizontal bar on the **top** border (row 1), columns 8\u201315:\n       \u2192 this is the special bar color \\(P = 4\\).  \n     - Color 6 is the object color \\(O = 6\\).\n\n   - Height \\(H = 25\\) rows.\n   - Bar row: \\(R = 1\\) (top row), touching the top border.\n   - Bar columns (and thus stripe columns): \\(c = 8\\) through \\(d = 15\\) (width 8).\n\n   Since the bar touches the top, the stripe must extend **downwards** into the grid.\n\n5. **Compute ladder rows and stripe colors**\n\n   Ladder rows are rows with the same parity as \\(R = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   r \\in \\{1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25\\}\n   \\]\n\n   For each such \\(r\\), compute \\(n = (r-R)/2\\) and use the \\(4,4,3\\) cycle:\n\n   - \\(r=1\\): \\(n=0\\) \u2192 color 4\n   - \\(r=3\\): \\(n=1\\) \u2192 color 4\n   - \\(r=5\\): \\(n=2\\) \u2192 color 3\n   - \\(r=7\\): \\(n=3\\) \u2192 color 4\n   - \\(r=9\\): \\(n=4\\) \u2192 color 4\n   -

                "response": "**Alright, I'm diving into this ARC puzzle and its candidate solutions.** My task is to figure out how these algorithms are trying to solve the problem and, ultimately, decide which one is the best.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem itself. It looks like we have a pattern projection where a \"rung\" of color is projected down from an anchor. I see that this is a 29x22 grid with 8 shapes and a yellow 4 anchor bar at the bottom. The output shows that the anchor row stays yellow, some rows below are background, and certain rows are green. My initial thought is to analyze the relationship between the row offset and the output color. I start by tracing through example 1 and example 2, which helps me deduce the key variables: the anchor row index ($R$), the offset ($d$), and the ratio of $k=d/2$ using modular arithmetic. It turns out that a recurring pattern emerges where the even rows are the \"rung\" rows, and green is colored to $k \\pmod{3} == 2$ with global recolor, which is the crux of the program.\n\nWith this knowledge, I delve into the test case, which has a top anchor, and calculate the expected behavior from the top-down. The process confirms the pattern of even-odd coloring with the green rungs.\n\nNext comes the audit of the proposed candidate solutions. The first candidate, C2, uses columns 8-15 (a possible off-by-one issue), but then I notice that it treats the anchor row in an unexpected way. It sets the anchor row to green, which conflicts with what I see in the examples and the general rule in ARC where source or anchor is usually maintained. Upon inspecting the rule, they're using \"$index \\pmod{6} = 0$\" meaning the absolute position of the index on the grid, in contrast to the prior even/odd row and a modular count. This is a very different system to the prior analysis. I begin to suspect that C2 is flawed.\n\nI have to carefully assess if the candidate's core principle matches mine, the modular arithmetic, and what's happening to the row index. I find that C2 is essentially applying the pattern relative to the grid lines in an absolute manner (\"Index % 6 == 0 is Green\"), instead of relating it to the anchor row. However, in the examples, anchor rows 28 are never colored in the green range. So C2 is incorrect.\n\nI move onto Candidate 5 (C5), C16, and C21. C5 seems to calculate offsets, whereas C21 might use absolute indexes as well. Upon closer inspection, I see that C5 does a \"distance from source\" relative phase and that the result works out for examples 1 and 2. I note the importance of this phase being relative to the anchor, as opposed to the more confusing absolute view based on index. This aligns well with the intuition for a projection problem. C5 then ends up making its output consistent.\n\nC16 is next. At first, it has great insight. For example, the text describes the correct offset calculation, and C16's reasoning is, at first, pretty good, but then I see the phrase \"the only 4s are on Row 1.\" Upon inspecting, the input states that the first line is the source with the 4s. This is an off-by-one confusion or error in the text which means that, in a way, their algorithm treats row 1 as index 0, rather than the expected index 0 as row 1. I then find a more subtle flaw in the output where Row 16, which should be Green, is Yellow. So C16's reasoning has errors but the algorithm seems to execute the correct rule, apart from one specific row, Row 16. So C16 has a mixed record.\n\nThe next candidates are C21/C25, which operate according to the model: \"Mod 6\", with an exception for the anchor. I see that C21 does a \"Grid absolute phase with anchor exception\" with the 0 mod 6 rule, and that it executed this rule correctly, but with an exception for the anchor.\n\nHere, a critical point emerges in phase. The problem asks for a pattern from an anchor and it should be dependent on the \"source\" as a \"beam of light\". Therefore, the relative view \"from a source\" is generally preferred over a more mysterious absolute index-based rule (the Mod 6 rule). A phase relative to a Source (C5) is superior to the \"Grid relative with exception\" model.\n\nI evaluate \"Beam Projection\".\nCandidate 5 (C5) uses the \"relative\" model which is more intuitive, and C21 uses the absolute \"Mod 6\"\n\n<AUDIT_LOG>\n### PHASE 1: LOGIC SELECTION & CRYSTALLIZATION\n\n**Candidate 2:**\n- **Logic:** Identifies projection pattern. Claims \"rows with index 1 (mod 6) are filled with colour 3\". Note: It seems to treat the grid as 1-indexed or has an offset logic.\n- **Crystallization:** IF `row_index % 6 == 0` (based on grid observation), THEN fill projection cols with 3 and recolor all shapes to 3. ELSE IF `row_index % 2 == 0` (and not mod 6), fill projection with 4. ELSE clear projection to background.\n- **Note:** This candidate applies the \"Green\" rule to Row 0.\n\n**Candidate 5:**\n- **Logic:** Identifies \"Anchor\" row (Row 0). Pattern radiates from Anchor. Distance `d = |r - r_anchor|`.\n- **Crystallization:** IF `d % 2 != 0` (Odd distance), Clear projection. IF `d % 2 == 0`: Let `k = d/2`. IF `k % 3 == 2`, set projection to 3 AND recolor row shapes to 3. ELSE set projection to 4.\n- **Sequence:** 4 (Anchor), Gap, 4, Gap, 3 (Green), Gap...\n- **Test Application:** Anchor at 0. Green rows at 4, 10, 16, 22.\n\n**Candidate 16:**\n- **Logic:** Similar to C5, but reasoning text claims \"The only 4s are on row 1\" (Input error: 4s are on Row 0). It calculates Green rows as 4, 10, 16.\n- **Crystallization:** Same relative pattern as C5, but hampered by coordinate confusion in text.\n\n**Candidate 21/25:**\n- **Logic:** \"Even rows... (row/2) % 3 = 0 -> color 3\".\n- **Crystallization:** This implies Green rows are 0, 6, 12, 18, 24.\n- **Exception:** Anchor row (Row 0) is preserved as 4s in the grid, despite the rule implying 3.\n- **Test Application:** Green rows at 6, 12, 18, 24.\n\n### PHASE 2: THE GROUND TRUTH AUDIT\n\n**Test vs Example 1:**\n- Input: Anchor at Row 28.\n- Output Green Rows: 24, 18, 12, 6, 0.\n- **Candidate 5 (Relative):** Distance from 28 to 24 is 4. `4/2 = 2`. `2 % 3 = 2`. Predicts Green. **PASS.**\n- **Candidate 21 (Absolute):** Row 24. `24 % 6 == 0`. Predicts Green. **PASS.**\n- **Candidate 2 (Absolute+Overwrite):** Row 24 is Green. **PASS.**\n\n**Test vs Example 2:**\n- Input: Anchor at Row 28.\n- Output Green Rows: 24, 18, 12...\n- **Both Rules Pass.**\n\n**Differentiation on Test Input:**\n- Anchor is at Row 0.\n- **C5 Prediction:** Green at Offset 4 (Row 4).\n- **C21 Prediction:** Green at Modulo 0 (Row 0) and Modulo 6 (Row 6). Since Row 0 is Anchor, C21 makes Row 6 the first *visible* Green row.\n- **C2 Prediction:** Overwrite Row 0 with Green.\n\n**Logic Check:**\n- The pattern radiates *from* the anchor (Projection). A \"Relative\" rule (C5) implies the beam structure (4-gap-4-gap-3) is invariant.\n- An \"Absolute\" rule (C21) implies the grid coordinates dictate the color.\n- In ARC, causal projection usually respects relative distance. C5 is logically superior (Simpler, no exceptions). C21 requires an exception for Row 0. C2 destroys the source object, which is a strong heuristic violation.\n\n### PHASE 3: EXECUTION CONSISTENCY\n\n**Candidate 5:**\n- Text says Green at 4, 10, 16.\n- Grid at Row 4: Green (3s).\n- Grid at Row 16: Green (3s).\n- **Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n**Candidate 16:**\n- Text says Green at 16.\n- Grid at Row 16: Contains 4s (Yellow). Fails to recolor shapes.\n- **Verdict:** Internal Contradiction / Execution Failure.\n\n**Candidate 21:**\n- Text says Green at 6, 12.\n- Grid at Row 6: Green (3s).\n- **Verdict:** Consistent with its (likely inferior) rule.\n\n**Candidate 2:**\n- Grid Row 0 is 3s.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent with rule, but rule is destructive.\n\n### PHASE 4: STACK RANKING\n\n1.  **Candidate 5:** Gold. Correct Logic (Relative Phase), Perfect Execution.\n2.  **Candidate 21:** Silver. Plausible Logic (Absolute Phase), Perfect Execution. Less likely than C5 because it requires the pattern to start mid-cycle relative to the anchor to satisfy the grid alignment.\n3.  **Candidate 16:** Bronze. Correct Logic, but Failed Execution (Row 16) and Text Errors.\n4.  **Candidate 2:** Invalid. Destructive Rule.\n\n</AUDIT_LOG>\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 5,\n      \"score\": 9.5,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Perfectly deduces the relative phase of the projection beam (4-4-3) from the anchor.

given examples were transformed. Each input contained three colours: a dominant background, a \u201cmain\u201d colour forming the bulk of the non\u2011background pattern, and a small horizontal block of a third accent colour.\n\nIn the outputs a new colour 3 was introduced. The accent block\u2019s horizontal span was used to define a set of columns. In the outputs those columns were overwritten with a repeating vertical stripe pattern: starting at the top row, on rows with index 1\u202f(mod\u202f6) they are filled with colour\u202f3, on rows with index 3 or 5\u202f(mod\u202f6) they are filled with the accent colour, and on even rows they are reset to background. In addition, on rows with index 1\u202f(mod\u202f6) every cell of the main colour in that row is recoloured to 3. All other cells remain as in the input unless they are overwritten by the stripes.\n\nApplying this to the test grid, the background is 8, the main colour is 6, the accent colour 4 spans columns 8\u201315.

I've broken down the rules based on the provided examples and descriptions. First, locate the marker bar. It defines the \"projection columns\" that extend vertically throughout the grid. Then, I need to iterate through each row.\n\nIf the row index is a multiple of 6 (0, 6, 12, etc.), the projection columns become color 3, and all blob cells within that row also become color 3. So, if there are blobs, they get merged into the projection.\n\nIf the row index is even (but not a multiple of 6), the projection columns become color 4, while blobs outside those columns stay as they are. This seems straightforward - just replace the projection cells with the appropriate color and preserve the blobs.\n\nIf the row index is odd, the projection columns get the background color (8), and blobs within those projection columns also become background color. Blobs that fall outside these ranges stay the same.\n\nIn summary, the core logic relies on the modular arithmetic to decide if the row is divisible by 6, even or odd, and the action to take. The logic is consistent, projection zone gets modified, blob cells get handled based on the overlap, and other cells stay the same.\n\n\nThe task requires transforming a grid of integers based on a specific vertical projection pattern defined by a \"marker bar\" of color 4 found in the input. The background color is 8, and blob regions are color 6.\n\n### Analysis of the Transformation Rules\n1.  **Identify Projection Columns**: The input grid contains a horizontal segment of 4s (marker bar). The columns occupied by these 4s define the \"projection zone\" for the entire grid height. In the test input, the marker bar is located at Row 0, spanning columns 7 through 14 (inclusive).\n\n2.  **Row-based Transformation**: The grid is processed row by row (index `y`), applying different rules based on the row index modulo 6 and modulo 2:\n    *   **Rule A: Every 6th row (`y % 6 == 0`)**:\n        *   The cells in the projection columns (7-14) become color 3.\n        *   Additionally, any \"blob\" cells (color 6) existing anywhere in this row also become color 3.\n        *   Background cells (8) outside the projection remain 8.\n    *   **Rule B: Other Even Rows (`y % 2 == 0` and `y % 6 != 0`)**:\n        *   The cells in the projection columns (7-14) become color 4.\n        *   Blob cells (6) located *outside* the projection columns remain color 6.\n        *   Blob cells (6) located *inside* the projection columns are overwritten by the 4s.\n        *   Background cells (8) outside the projection remain 8.\n    *   **Rule C: Odd Rows (`y % 2 != 0`)**:\n        *   The cells in the projection columns (7-14) become the background color (8). This effectively \"clears\" the projection zone.\n        *   Blob cells (6) located *outside* the projection columns remain color 6.\n        *   Blob cells (6) located *inside* the projection columns are cleared to background (8).\n\n### Step-by-Step Application to Test Input\nThe grid size is 25x25. Projection columns are 7-14.\n\n*   **Row 0 (`% 6 == 0`)**: Input contains the marker (4s). The rule sets projection cols to 3.\n    *   Output: `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n*   **Row 1 (Odd)**: Projection cleared to 8. Input was all 8s.\n    *   Output: All 8s.\n*   **Row 2 (Even)**: Projection set to 4. Input was all 8s.\n    *   Output: `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n*   **Row 3 (Odd)**: Projection cleared to 8. Input blobs at 7-10 are inside projection, so they are cleared.\n    *   Output: All 8s.\n*   **Row 4 (Even)**: Projection set to 4. Input blobs at 3-10, 15-19.\n    *   Inside blobs (7-10) overwritten by 4. Outside blobs (3-6, 15-19) kept.\n    *   Output: `8,8,8,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8`\n*   **Row 5 (Odd)**: Projection cleared to 8. Input blobs at 4-9, 13-21.\n    *   Inside blobs (7-9, 13-14) cleared.

Interpreting the training examples\n\nAcross both examples we see:\n\n- A **background color** (1 in example 1, 8 in example 2).\n- A **main figure color** (8 in example 1, 2 in example 2).\n- A **template color** 4, appearing only as a single horizontal bar in one row.\n- A **new color** 3, not present in the input, introduced in the output.\n\n### 1.1. The horizontal 4\u2011bar as a template\n\nIn both examples:\n\n- Color 4 appears as one contiguous horizontal bar in exactly one row.\n- In the output, that bar is *copied vertically* in the same columns, in a regular vertical pattern.\n- In those same columns a color 3 bar also appears periodically.\n\nIf you look only at the **columns where the original 4-bar lies**, in the outputs of both examples:\n\n- Along those columns you see a **vertical stripe** made of 4, 3 and background, independent of the shape of the main figure.\n- The pattern is periodic with respect to vertical distance from the original 4\u2011bar row.\n\nWe can describe this precisely:\n\nLet the row containing the template bar of 4s be `r_pat`. Let the bar occupy columns `c_start\u2026c_end`.\n\nFor any row `r`, consider the vertical distance `d = r - r_pat`.\n\n- If `d = 0`: keep the original 4s (the template row).\n- If `|d|` is **odd**: in columns `c_start\u2026c_end`, set the cells to the **background color**.\n- If `|d|` is **even**, let `k = |d| / 2`. Then in columns `c_start\u2026c_end`:\n  - If `k mod 3` is 0 or 1 \u2192 set color **4**.\n  - If `k mod 3` is 2 \u2192 set color **3**.\n\nSo as you go away from the template row in steps of two rows, the sequence of colors on those rows in the stripe is:\n\n> 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, \u2026\n\nRows at odd `|d|` positions get the background color in those columns.\n\nThis rule exactly reproduces the vertical pattern of 3s and 4s in the template columns in both training examples.\n\n### 1.2. Recoloring the main figure on the \u201c3-rows\u201d\n\nA second, independent effect:\n\n- On rows where the stripe (in the template columns) takes the value **3** (i.e. rows with `|d|` even and `k mod 3 = 2`), all cells of the **main figure color** are recolored to 3 across the entire row (all columns), not just in the stripe.\n- On the other rows, figure-colored cells remain as they are, except where they lie in the stripe and are overwritten by the stripe\u2019s color (3, 4 or background) as per the rule above.\n\nYou can see this in the examples:\n\n- Example 1: figure color is 8, background 1, template row at bottom. On rows 1, 7, 13, 19, 25 (which satisfy that `k mod 3 = 2` condition) all 8s are turned into 3, anywhere on the row.\n- Example 2: figure color is 2, background 8, template row at bottom. On rows 1, 7, 13, 19, 25 all 2s are turned into 3.\n\nThe stripe behavior and the row\u2011wide recoloring behavior together fully explain the training outputs.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying the rule to the test input\n\n### 2.1. Identify colors and the template\n\nTest input:\n\n- Dominant color is **8** \u2192 this is the **background**.\n- The other widely used color is **6** \u2192 this is the **main figure**.\n- The color **4** appears only as a contiguous bar in row 1, columns 8\u201315 \u2192 this is the **template bar**.\n\nSo:\n\n- Background `B = 8`\n- Figure `F = 6`\n- Template color `P = 4`\n- New color `N = 3`\n- `r_pat = 1`\n- Template columns: `c = 8\u202615` (8 through 15 inclusive).\n\n### 2.2. Compute the vertical stripe in columns 8\u201315\n\nFor each row `r` from 1 to 25:\n\n1. Compute `d = r - r_pat = r - 1`.\n2. If `d = 0`: keep the 4s in columns 8\u201315 (row 1 unchanged in those columns).\n3. If `|d|` is odd: set columns 8\u201315 to background 8.\n4. If `|d|` is even (`d >= 0` here, so `k = d / 2`):\n   - If `k mod 3` is 0 or 1: set columns 8\u201315 to 4.\n   - If `k mod 3` is 2: set columns 8\u201315 to 3.\n\nCompute the stripe color row by row:\n\n- r=1: d=0, k=0 \u2192 4\n- r=2: d=1 odd \u2192 8\n- r=3: d=2, k=1 \u2192 4\n- r=4: d=3 odd \u2192 8\n- r=5: d=4, k=2 \u2192 3\n- r=6: d=5 odd \u2192 8\n- r=7: d=6, k=3 \u2192 4\n- r=8: d=7 odd \u2192 8\n- r=9: d=8, k=4 \u2192 4\n- r=10: d=9 odd \u2192 8\n- r=11: d=10, k=5 \u2192 3\n- r=12: d=11 odd \u2192 8\n- r=13: d=12, k=6 \u2192 4\n- r=14: d=13 odd \u2192 8\n- r=15: d=14, k=7 \u2192 4\n- r=16: d=15 odd \u2192 8\n- r=17: d=16, k=8 \u2192 3\n- r=18: d=17 odd \u2192 8\n- r=19: d=18, k=9 \u2192 4\n- r=20: d=19 odd \u2192 8\n- r=21: d=20, k=10 \u2192 4\n- r=22: d=21 odd \u2192 8\n- r=23: d=22, k=11 \u2192 3\n- r=24: d=23 odd \u2192 8\n- r=25: d=24, k=12 \u2192 4\n\nThus the **stripe rows with color 3** (the \u201c3-rows\u201d) are: **5, 11, 17, 23**.\n\nOn every row we now overwrite columns 8\u201315 with the stripe color for that row.\n\nAdditionally, on rows 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24 the stripe color is 8, so any 6s that originally lay in columns 8\u201315 there are removed (turned to background).\n\n### 2.3. Recolor figure cells on the 3-rows\n\nOn each 3-row (rows 5, 11, 17, 23):\n\n- For all columns, any cell with color 6 is changed to color 3.\n\nThis is independent of the stripe (though in columns 8\u201315 the stripe is also 3 on those rows, so the two actions are consistent).\n\nApplying both steps to each row gives the final grid below.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

In both examples there is a dominant background color:\n     - Example 1: background = 1\n     - Example 2: background = 8\n   - There is a special small horizontal segment of color **4** in exactly one row (in both examples it is on the bottom row).\n   - There is a \u201cshape\u201d color different from background and 4:\n     - Example 1: shape color = 8\n     - Example 2: shape color = 2\n   - The **output introduces color 3**, which did not occur in the input.\n\n2. **Vertical behavior over the columns with 4**\n\n   Look at an example column that has a 4 in the \u201c4-row\u201d:\n\n   - Example 1, column 13 (background = 1, 4-row = row 29):\n     Going **upwards** from row 29 the output colors on that column are:\n     ```\n     row29: 4\n     row28: 1\n     row27: 4\n     row26: 1\n     row25: 3\n     row24: 1\n     row23: 4\n     row22: 1\n     row21: 4\n     row20: 1\n     row19: 3\n     row18: 1\n     ...\n     ```\n     This repeats every 6 rows as: **[4, 1, 4, 1, 3, 1]**.\n\n   - Example 2, column 3 (background = 8, 4-row = row 29):\n     Going **upwards**:\n     ```\n     row29: 4\n     row28: 8\n     row27: 4\n     row26: 8\n     row25: 3\n     row24: 8\n     row23: 4\n     row22: 8\n     ...\n     ```\n     This is **[4, 8, 4, 8, 3, 8]**, i.e. `[4, B, 4, B, 3, B]`.\n\n   This pattern holds **for every column that had a 4** in the special row:\n   - Start from the row with the original 4s.\n   - Moving into the grid (upward in the examples), each cell in those columns cycles:\n     **4, background, 4, background, 3, background, \u2026** every 6 rows.\n\n   The original input values in those positions (8, 2, etc.) are simply overwritten by this vertical pattern.\n\n3. **Horizontal behavior on the \u201c3-rows\u201d**\n\n   From the vertical pattern, every 6th row (relative to the 4-row) gets color **3** in the 4-columns. Call these **3-rows**.\n\n   On those 3-rows, we see:\n\n   - Example 1:\n     - Row 7, 13, 19, 25\u2026 are 3-rows.\n     - On those rows, **all cells of the shape color 8** are changed to 3 across the whole row.\n       - Row 7: 8s at columns 5\u20137 \u2192 3; plus the 4-columns (12\u201315) are already 3 by vertical pattern.\n       - Row 13: 8s at 10\u201318 \u2192 3.\n       - Row 19: 8s at 3\u201312 and 16\u201318 \u2192 3; plus 12\u201315 (4-columns) are 3, so net 3s from 3\u201318.\n       - Row 25: 8s at 3\u20137 and 12\u201319 \u2192 3.\n\n   - Example 2:\n     - 3-rows are rows 1,7,13,19,25.\n     - On those rows, **all 2s** are converted to 3, and the 4-columns are 3 by the vertical pattern:\n       - Row 7: 2s at 3\u201313 \u2192 3.\n       - Row 13: 2s at 2\u20136 \u2192 3.\n       - Row 19: 2s at 1\u20137 \u2192 3.\n       - Row 25: 2s at 7\u201311 and 18\u201320 \u2192 3.\n\n   Outside the 4-columns and outside these 3-rows, the shape color remains unchanged.\n\n   So the horizontal rule is:\n\n   > On each row where the vertical pattern places a **3** in the 4-columns, recolor **all cells of the shape color** on that row to 3. (And ensure the 4-columns on that row are 3, which the vertical pattern already does.)\n\n4. **Orientation and anchor detection**\n\n   In the training examples, the row with 4s is the **bottom row**, and the pattern is applied going upwards (towards smaller row indices).\n\n   In the test, the row of 4s is instead the **top row**. The natural generalization is:\n\n   - Find the unique row containing a horizontal run of 4s (this is the **anchor row**).\n   - Determine if it\u2019s at the top or bottom edge:\n     - If at the top, apply the vertical 6-cycle pattern **downwards**.\n     - If at the bottom, apply it **upwards**.\n   - For each column that has a 4 in the anchor row, apply the repeated [4, B, 4, B, 3, B] pattern along that column away from the edge.\n   - 3-rows are exactly those with offset 4 in this 6-cycle relative to the anchor row.\n   - On each 3-row, recolor all cells of the shape color to 3.\n\n5. **Identify colors in the test grid**\n\n   Test input has:\n\n   - Dominant color: **8** \u2192 background B.\n   - Special line color: **4** (only on row 1, columns 8\u201315) \u2192 anchor color.\n   - Remaining non-background color: **6** \u2192 shape color S.\n\n   Anchor row r\u2080 is **row 1**. The anchor columns are **8 through 15**.\n\n   Apply the vertical pattern downward from row 1:\n   - Let k = (row_index \u2013 r\u2080) mod 6.\n   - If k = 0 or 2 \u2192 color 4 in the anchor columns.\n   - If k = 1, 3, or 5 \u2192 background 8 in the anchor columns.\n   - If k = 4 \u2192 color 3 in the anchor columns (these rows are the 3-rows).\n\n   With r\u2080=1, the k-values per row are:\n\n   - k=0: rows 1,7,13,19,25 \u2192 4 in columns 8\u201315.\n   - k=1: rows 2,8,14,20 \u2192 8 in columns 8\u201315.\n   - k=2: rows 3,9,15,21 \u2192 4 in columns 8\u201315.\n   - k=3: rows 4,10,16,22 \u2192 8 in columns 8\u201315.\n   - k=4: rows **5,11,17,23** \u2192 3 in columns 8\u201315 (**3-rows**).\n   - k=5: rows 6,12,18,24 \u2192 8 in columns 8\u201315.\n\n   Then, on each 3-row (5,11,17,23), convert every 6 in that row to 3 (outside and inside the anchor columns).\n\n   All other cells remain as in the input, except where overwritten in anchor columns by the vertical pattern.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n\nApplying the above steps to the test input yields:\n\nRow 1 (anchor row, unchanged except it already has the

Colours 6 are the existing shapes. The only distinct object on an edge is the run of 4\u2019s along the top; that is the anchor and its columns are 8\u201315.\n- Starting from the anchor row and moving downwards, apply a repeating six\u2013row \u201cladder\u201d pattern: offset\u202f0 and 2 rows from the anchor are rungs in the anchor colour; offset\u202f4 rows is a green rung; the other offsets clear the anchor columns to background. The pattern then repeats every six rows.\n- On red rung rows, set the anchor columns to the anchor colour and leave the rest unchanged. On blank rows, set the anchor columns to background.

Then:\n    - If `k % 3 == 2` \u2192 rung color is `3` (green).\n    - Else \u2192 rung color is `4` (anchor color).\n\nEquivalently, the vertical pattern at each anchor column is periodic of length 6 in `d`:\n\n- `d mod 6 = 0 \u2192 4`\n- `d mod 6 = 1 \u2192 8` (no rung)\n- `d mod 6 = 2 \u2192 4`\n- `d mod 6 = 3 \u2192 8` (no rung)\n- `d mod 6 = 4 \u2192 3`\n- `d mod 6 = 5 \u2192 8` (no rung)\n\nThis matches exactly both training examples when you track the 4\u2019s and 3\u2019s above/below the anchor.\n\nSo for the test (`r_anchor = 0`), the rows are:\n\n- `r = 0`  \u2192 d=0  \u2192 k=0 \u2192 rung color 4  \n- `r = 1`  \u2192 d=1  \u2192 gap\n- `r = 2`  \u2192 d=2  \u2192 k=1 \u2192 rung color 4  \n- `r = 3`  \u2192 d=3  \u2192 gap\n- `r = 4`  \u2192 d=4  \u2192 k=2 \u2192 rung color 3  \n- `r = 5`  \u2192 d=5  \u2192 gap\n- `r = 6`  \u2192 d=6  \u2192 k=3 \u2192 rung color 4  \n- `r = 7`  \u2192 gap  \n- `r = 8`  \u2192 rung 4  \n- `r = 9`  \u2192 gap  \n- `r = 10` \u2192 rung 3  \n- `r = 11` \u2192 gap  \n- `r = 12` \u2192 rung 4  \n- `r = 13` \u2192 gap  \n- `r = 14` \u2192 rung 4  \n- `r = 15` \u2192 gap  \n- `r = 16` \u2192 rung 3  \n- `r = 17` \u2192 gap  \n- `r = 18` \u2192 rung 4  \n- `r = 19` \u2192 gap  \n- `r = 20` \u2192 rung 4  \n- `r = 21` \u2192 gap  \n- `r = 22` \u2192 rung 3  \n- `r = 23` \u2192 gap  \n- `r = 24` \u2192 rung 4  \n\nOn each **rung row** we overwrite cells at columns `S` with the rung color (3 or 4).  \nOn each **gap row** we overwrite cells at columns `S` with background color (8).\n\nThis alone matches the vertical bar behavior from the examples (and in the test).\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Effect on shapes (color 6) on \u201cgreen\u201d rungs**\n\nFrom Example 1 and 2:\n\n- Inspect rows where the rung color = `3`:\n  - Example 2 rows: 4, 10, 16, 22, 28 above the anchor (appropriately shifted),  \n    all shape cells (color 2) on those rows turn into 3.\n  - Example 1 rows where rung is 3 (e.g., rows 1,7,13,19,25 counting from top) have **all** 8-shape cells on that row recolored to 3.\n- Rows where rung color = `4` do **not** recolor whole shapes; they change only the ladder columns.\n\nSo the rule is:\n\n- On a rung row with ladder color `3`:\n  - For every cell on that row that was originally a **shape** (color 6 in the test), change it to `3`.\n  - Also set cells at anchor columns `S` to `3` (ladder itself).\n- On a rung row with ladder color `4`:\n  - Only cells at columns `S` are changed to `4`.\n  - Shape cells elsewhere stay as they were.\n- On a gap row:\n  - Cells at `S` are set to background `8`, erasing any shape that happens to lie directly under the ladder at that row.\n\nThis matches all detailed behaviors seen in both provided examples (including the \u201choles\u201d carved through shapes at gap rows and the green-tinted rows of shapes at every third rung).\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apply to the test grid**\n\nWe now apply the above rules to the test input:\n\n- Background: `8`\n- Shapes: `6`\n- Anchor color: `4`\n- New color for special rungs: `3`\n- Anchor row: 0\n- Anchor columns `S = {7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14}`\n- Rung rows and colors (as computed):\n\n  - Rungs with **4**: rows `0,2,6,8,12,14,18,20,24`\n  - Rungs with **3**: rows `4,10,16,22`\n  - Gaps: `1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23`\n\nFor each row:\n\n- Start from the original row.\n- If it\u2019s a gap row: set columns 7\u201314 to 8.\n- If it\u2019s a rung-4 row: set columns 7\u201314 to 4.\n- If it\u2019s a rung-3 row: set columns 7\u201314 to 3, and **also** turn all 6\u2019s on that row into 3\u2019s.\n\nCarrying this out row by row yields:\n\n**Final output grid:**\n\nRow 0  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 1  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 2  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 3  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 4  \n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 5  \n8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8  \n\nRow 6  \n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8  \n\nRow 7  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 9  \n8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 10  \n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 11  \n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 12  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 13  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8  \n\nRow 14  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8  \n\nRow 15  \n8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8  \n\nRow 16  \n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8  \n\nRow 17  \n8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n\nRow 18  \n8,8,8,8,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n\nRow 19  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n\nRow 20  \n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8  \n\nRow 21  \n8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 22  \n8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 23  \n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 24  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8\n      8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      8,8,8,8,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      8,8,8,8,8,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8\n      8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"16\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_6_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Solving an ARC Logic Puzzle with Hidden Reasoning**\n\nOkay, I've got this ARC puzzle to solve.

I'm being asked to follow a \"protocol override,\" but essentially, it boils down to: figure out the pattern, explain my thinking, and then give the final answer grid.\n\nInitially, I had a bit of a hiccup because the instructions were slightly contradictory \u2013 saying to \"reveal only the final answer grid\" and also to \"respond with an explanation.\" But it's pretty clear they want the explanation, so that's what I'll do!\n\nI've carefully analyzed two example grids, noting the colors, shapes, and positions. The core pattern seems to be about how a \"seed\" shape, often a unique color bar at the bottom or top, projects and affects other shapes in the grid. Even and odd rows are handled differently. There's a rule that says even rows are modified, while odd rows stay the same. Every sixth even row triggers a special \"Green Mode\" (all \"foreground\" colors, as well as the seed-projection-area, in that row turn into Green). In all other even rows a \"Yellow Mode\" is triggered, where the projection is colored Yellow, and other foreground pixels remain unchanged. I've also figured out the specific columns the seed shape spans, that the \"transformation\" affects. I've broken down each example row-by-row, paying close attention to where colors change and how those changes are related to the seed.\n\nAfter analyzing the examples, I can now identify the pattern for this task, I've used this to generate a final answer grid for the test input.\n\n\nThe transformation rule is inferred as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the \"Seed\"**: In the input grid, there is a distinct horizontal bar of a unique color (4/Yellow in the examples and test input) that acts as a generator. In the test input, this seed bar `4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4` is located at Row 0, spanning columns 7 to 14.\n2.  **Identify the Modes**: The transformation applies only to rows with the same parity as the seed row (even rows in the test case). Odd rows remain unchanged.\n    *   Calculate the distance $d$ from the seed row ($d = |row - seed\\_row|$).\n    *   If $d \\mod 6 == 4$: The row is in **Green Mode**.\n    *   Otherwise (if $d$ is even and $d \\mod 6 \\neq 4$): The row is in **Yellow Mode**.\n3.  **Apply Transformation per Mode**:\n    *   **Yellow Mode**: The columns occupied by the seed (columns 7-14) are stamped with the seed color (4/Yellow). Existing foreground pixels (6/Pink) outside this projection remain unchanged. Foreground pixels inside the projection are overwritten by 4.\n    *   **Green Mode**: All foreground pixels (6/Pink) in the row are converted to Green (3). Additionally, the seed's projection area (columns 7-14) is filled with Green (3). This effectively merges the projection shape with the existing foreground shape and turns the result Green.\n4.  **Preserve Background**: The background color (8/Teal) is preserved unless overwritten by the projection or foreground transformation.\n\n**Application to Test Input (25x25 grid, Seed at Row 0):**\n*   **Rows 0, 2, 6, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24** are in **Yellow Mode**. The bar `4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4` is stamped at columns 7-14. Any Pink (6) pixels overlapping are overwritten; those outside remain Pink.\n*   **Rows 4, 10, 16, 22** are in **Green Mode**. All Pink (6) pixels become Green (3). The bar columns 7-14 also become Green (3).\n*   **Odd Rows (1, 3, 5, ...)** are unchanged.\n\noutput:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8\n8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8\n8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8\n8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8\n      8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      8,8,8,8,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      8,8,8,8,8,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8\n      8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"B\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-high_7_step_5_image\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Identify colors and special segment**\n\n   - In all examples the grid has:\n     - a **background** color (Example1: `1`, Example2: `8`, Test: `8`);\n     - an **object** color (Example1: `8`, Example2: `2`, Test: `6`);\n     - a short horizontal bar of color **4** on one border row.\n   - That bar is always a single contiguous run of 4\u2019s and is the only 4 in the input.  \n     It acts as a \u201cseed\u201d from which a vertical pattern grows.\n\n2. **Vertical trunk**\n\n   - From the seed bar we build a vertical \u201ctrunk\u201d of width equal to the seed bar\n     and at the same columns.\n   - The trunk extends **into the interior of the grid**, i.e.:\n     - in the examples, the seed 4-bar is on the **bottom** row,\n       so the trunk grows **upwards**;\n     - in the test, the seed 4-bar is on the **top** row,\n       so the trunk must grow **downwards**.\n   - The trunk occupies **every other row**, starting from the seed row and\n     skipping one row in between.\n       - Let `r0` be the seed row index.\n       - Define rows `r(k) = r0 + 2\u00b7k\u00b7dir` where `dir = -1` when the seed is at\n         the bottom, `+1` when it is at the top.\n   - Along these trunk rows the color of the trunk follows a repeating pattern\n     (seen in both training pairs when indexed from the seed row):\n     \n     `4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, ...`   (period 3 over the sequence of trunk rows)\n\n     i.e. for trunk row number `k` (k = 0 at the seed row):\n\n     - if `k mod 3` is `0` or `1` \u2192 trunk color = `4`\n     - if `k mod 3` is `2`       \u2192 trunk color = `3`\n\n   - On those rows we overwrite all cells in the seed\u2019s column interval with\n     this trunk color, regardless of what was there.\n\n3. **Horizontal bars on \u201cgreen\u201d rows**\n\n   - In both examples, additional horizontal bars appear exactly on trunk rows\n     whose trunk color is **3** (green).\n   - Behaviour on such a row:\n     - Every cell of the **object color** in that row (any column) is recolored\n       to `3`.\n     - We do *not* recolor background cells (except where they already lie inside\n       the trunk columns).\n   - On trunk rows whose color is **4** we do nothing besides painting the trunk\n     strip itself.\n\n4. **Apply to the test grid**\n\n   - Background = `8`, object color = `6`.\n   - The only 4\u2019s are on **row 1**, columns 8\u201315.  \n     So:\n       - `r0 = 1`, `dir = +1` (grow downward),\n       - trunk columns = 8..15 (width 8).\n\n   - Trunk rows and colors, using `4,4,3` cycling:\n\n     - k=0 \u2192 row 1  \u2192 color 4\n     - k=1 \u2192 row 3  \u2192 color 4\n     - k=2 \u2192 row 5  \u2192 color 3   (horizontal recolor of 6\u2019s here)\n     - k=3 \u2192 row 7  \u2192 color 4\n     - k=4 \u2192 row 9  \u2192 color 4\n     - k=5 \u2192 row 11 \u2192 color 3   (horizontal recolor)\n     - k=6 \u2192 row 13 \u2192 color 4\n     - k=7 \u2192 row 15 \u2192 color 4\n     - k=8 \u2192 row 17 \u2192 color 3   (horizontal recolor)\n     - k=9 \u2192 row 19 \u2192 color 4\n     - k=10\u2192 row 21 \u2192 color 4\n     - k=11\u2192 row 23 \u2192 color 3   (horizontal recolor)\n     - k=12\u2192 row 25 \u2192 color 4\n\n   - On each of these rows we paint columns 8\u201315 with the given trunk color.\n   - Additionally, on rows 5, 11, 17, 23 we recolor all `6` cells in that row\n     to `3`.\n\n   All other cells remain as in the input.\n\n---\n\n**Resulting output grid**\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8\n8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8\n8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8\n8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8\n      8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      8,8,8,8,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      8,8,8,8,8,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8\n      8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"C\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-high_8_step_5_image\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Colors and objects**\n\n   Looking at the examples:\n\n   - There are three relevant colors:\n     - Background color \\(B\\) (blue in ex.1, light blue in ex.2).\n     - A single \u201cobject\u201d color \\(O\\) (8 in ex.1, 2 in ex.2) forming many blobs.\n     - A special horizontal bar color \\(P\\) (4) that appears as one contiguous bar on the border.\n\n   - In the outputs, color 3 (green) appears only in the transformed pattern; it never exists in the inputs.\n\n2. **Vertical stripe (\u201cladder\u201d)**\n\n   From both examples:\n\n   - The vertical stripe occupies exactly the same columns as the original bar \\(P\\).\n   - Its width equals the width of that bar.\n   - It extends from the bar across the grid, in the direction away from the border the bar touches (in the examples, up from a bottom bar).\n   - The stripe is only drawn on every second row (i.e., rows with the same parity as the bar\u2019s row).\n   - Along those rows, the stripe color follows a repeating pattern as you move away from the bar:\n\n     Let \\(R\\) be the row of the original bar and let a \u201cladder row\u201d be any row \\(r\\) with the same parity as \\(R\\).  \n     Define \\(n = \\frac{|r-R|}{2}\\) (0 for the bar row itself, then 1,2,3\u2026 as you move out in steps of 2 rows).\n\n     Then:\n     - If \\(n \\bmod 3 \\in \\{0,1\\}\\): stripe color is \\(P\\) (4).\n     - If \\(n \\bmod 3 = 2\\): stripe color is 3.\n\n     So along ladder rows, the colors go \\(4,4,3,4,4,3,\\dots\\) away from the bar.\n\n   - On \u201cnon\u2011ladder\u201d rows (other parity), nothing is drawn in the stripe columns.\n\n3. **Effect on the object color**\n\n   Compare inputs and outputs row by row:\n\n   - On ladder rows whose stripe color is 4:\n     - Only the stripe columns are changed (whatever was there becomes 4).\n     - All other object pixels \\(O\\) in that row remain \\(O\\).\n\n   - On ladder rows whose stripe color is 3:\n     - The stripe columns are set to 3.\n     - **Every** pixel of the object color \\(O\\) anywhere in that row is also changed to 3.\n       (This explains the long horizontal green bars in both training outputs.)\n     - Background pixels \\(B\\) outside the stripe are not touched.\n\n   This simple rule reproduces both example pairs exactly.\n\n4. **Identify parameters in the test input**\n\n   For the test grid:\n\n   - Background color \\(B = 8\\) (dominant, fills frame).\n   - The only other colors are 4 and 6.  \n     - Color 4 appears as a single horizontal bar on the **top** border (row 1), columns 8\u201315:\n       \u2192 this is the special bar color \\(P = 4\\).  \n     - Color 6 is the object color \\(O = 6\\).\n\n   - Height \\(H = 25\\) rows.\n   - Bar row: \\(R = 1\\) (top row), touching the top border.\n   - Bar columns (and thus stripe columns): \\(c = 8\\) through \\(d = 15\\) (width 8).\n\n   Since the bar touches the top, the stripe must extend **downwards** into the grid.\n\n5. **Compute ladder rows and stripe colors**\n\n   Ladder rows are rows with the same parity as \\(R = 1\\):\n   \\[\n   r \\in \\{1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25\\}\n   \\]\n\n   For each such \\(r\\), compute \\(n = (r-R)/2\\) and use the \\(4,4,3\\) cycle:\n\n   - \\(r=1\\): \\(n=0\\) \u2192 color 4\n   - \\(r=3\\): \\(n=1\\) \u2192 color 4\n   - \\(r=5\\): \\(n=2\\) \u2192 color 3\n   - \\(r=7\\): \\(n=3\\) \u2192 color 4\n   - \\(r=9\\): \\(n=4\\) \u2192 color 4\n   -

There's a yellow (4) marker that defines a vertical strip spanning its column width\n2. The strip gets modified based on row index:\n   - **Odd rows**: Strip becomes background color (8 in this case)\n   - **Even rows**: Follow a repeating 3-row cycle: 3, 4, 4 (based on (row/2) % 3)\n3.

                "response": "**My Evaluation of the ARC Task Solutions**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown of my thinking as I evaluate these candidate solutions for the ARC task:\n\nI start by thoroughly analyzing the input and output examples provided. I'm looking for the underlying patterns and how they relate to the marker. It's a key observation that the pattern repeats, with a specific color (green) occurring a fixed distance from the marker. I also note the grid dimensions to make sure I count properly.\n\nI then focus on the test input, noting the change in marker position from the bottom to the top. This hints that the pattern might be projected downwards.\n\nWith a clear understanding of the pattern, I begin auditing the candidates. I'm focusing on the logic used to generate the output, checking if it aligns with the training examples and the test input's new marker position. I am scrutinizing the Candidate's logic regarding the anchor point: the location of the yellow marker. A key observation is that many candidates start the pattern from the first row index. \n\nCandidate 2 initially seems promising, but I get a bad feeling. It uses a \"global modulo 6\" rule, which fits the training data. This means it predicts the pattern based on the absolute row number. This contradicts my ARC intuition and the other training data: It's object-centric (relative distance to anchor). This also means it changes the value of the anchor, which I am not a fan of!\n\nCandidate 5 and 16 seem much better. They employ a \"relative distance\" rule. They predict the pattern based on how far a row is from the anchor row. I like that the pattern stays the same relative to the yellow marker: it gets Green every 4 and then starts again, like in the other examples! This matches my expectation that the solution should be translation-invariant. I audit their details, checking the numerical rules and the example grids. I see no issues, so this seems really good.\n\nThen, I turn to candidate 21. It looks like it forces the output pattern at the first row, rather than being relative to the anchor. Bad. Finally, Candidate 25 looks similar to 21, but a bit better, but still with the wrong pattern.\n\nI then go for the final scores, based on my observations. I give Candidate 5 and 16 a high score because their rules and patterns match the observations. I give Candidate 2 a lower score because of the global rule and the odd explanation. I give Candidate 25 a middle score because it's slightly better, but also wrong! Finally, I give candidate 21 a low score because it contains a contradiction and is the least correct.\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 5,\n      \"score\": 10.0,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"The candidate correctly identifies the 'relative distance' rule (pattern 4, 4, 3 repeating from the anchor).
