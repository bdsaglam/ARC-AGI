It's about modifying 16x16 grids. There are three examples and a test case. The objective seems to involve transforming the grid based on patterns or objects.\n\n*   **Initial Observations:** I see a constant background color (orange/7). The task is to \"solve\" a transformation, which suggests that there is a rule. The examples each follow a specific input to output structure. I need to figure out this transformation.\n\n*   **Example 1 Analysis:** Let's focus on this. I'm noting the positions of all non-background pixels (color 9). The input grid and output have a pattern. It starts at a specific position and \"moves\" down.  I notice that pixels from one part of the input are \"copied\" into the output but with a change in color (9 becomes 1). I must map this movement pattern or \"shift\" and any accompanying rules.\n\n*   **Identifying the Transformation:** It looks like a copy operation. But where? And why is one pixel different? I test my guess that the transformation involves copying a pattern from one row to a new row, changing color, or adding colors.\n\n*   **Example 2 and the Shift:** I think the example is an evolution from the first. It features a new object (color 0). The same copy and color change is apparent. I confirm that a shift (upward) is involved here too.\n\n*   **Ex 3:** I'm seeing multiple patterns or \"objects\". Now I'm starting to visualize a \"shift\" or copy operation with a color change. I trace this across the entire grid and note it is happening again. It looks like the same copy operation with changes in pixel color!\n\n*   **Generalizing the Rule:** It seems the rule always is to \"shift up 5 rows\". I analyze what happens when objects overlap with copies - there's a color hierarchy involved, I think. Then, if an object lands on the same position as the shift, there's a specific action.\n\n*   **Rule Refinement:** I think I have it: Non-background objects (a connected set of non-7s) are shifted up by 5 rows. The shifted copy has all of its non-7 pixels changed to 9. The original pixels, if there's a match, get overridden based on a hierarchy.\n\n*   **The Problematic \"1\":**  The one issue is the color change of \"9\" to \"1\". Is there a hidden rule? Maybe intersection? Or a center thing?\n\n*   **Test Input:** The test input reveals a new challenge: there are two objects. Let's see if the same rule of Shift and merge apply.\n\n*   **Shift, Shift, Shift...** Does it always shift up? It's key now to verify that shift direction. \n\n*   **Reconciling the Shift:** Ah, it appears that the horizontal shift amount is dependent on *where* the object is. \n*   **A \"Shift (-5, 0)\" Transformation:** It looks like for some colors, the shift rule is a simple vertical upward shift of five and no horizontal displacement.\n*   **The Overlap Problem:**  I also have the rule for what happens when a copied element lands on top of an existing one. And this appears to be the most complex portion to generalize.\n*   **Focus, the Shift is the key:** I'm not giving up on my shift plan.  For some cases, objects \"align\" to the left? Perhaps the rule is the shift + some horizontal adjustment.  The colors appear to be playing a role in the correct shift rules. I will try to verify.\n*   **Re-evaluating Overlap (and 6 in particular):** I get it!  The new color rules in an overlap state are the tricky part. For test input, I try to assume what the overlap is and how it behaves.  I'll work it out for the color 6 pixels to generalize.\n*   **Test: I have the general framework!** Now, I am testing to write a robust model based on my learnings in the examples and Test Input and the 9 (shift-5 color) behavior.\n*   **Applying the rules to create a matrix:**  I've come up with a rule! It involves a shift in the position of colors. It appears to be based on the general pattern and color type. I will construct the rules using all input pixels on new grid positions.\n*   **Applying the rules:**  I'm trying it out. Applying the model.\n*   **Final Verification:** Almost there, just a few quick checks before I can confidently produce the answer. Looks good!\n\n\nThe transformation rule inferred from the examples is as follows:\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all non-background (non-7) pixels in the grid.\n2.  **Shift and Copy:** For every identified pixel at position $(r, c)$, create a \"copy\" at position $(r-5, c)$. In other words, shift the pattern upwards by 5 rows.\n    *   Note: In Example 3 (Red/2 pixels), the shift was $(-5, -5)$, likely because the pattern was on the right and required centering or a specific alignment. However, in Examples 1 (Maroon/9) and 2 (Black/0), the shift was $(-5, 0)$. The Test Input (Magenta/6) shares the vertical alignment characteristics of Example 2 (the bottom object is directly below the top object), so a shift of $(-5, 0)$ is applied.\n3.  **Apply Color Change:** The copied pixels take the color 9 (Maroon), regardless of the source color (unless the source was 0, where in Ex 2 the copies were 9).\n4.  **Merge with Existing Grid:**\n    *   If the target position $(r-5, c)$ contains the background color (7), replace it with the copy color (9).\n    *   If the target position contains an existing object pixel (6 in this case):\n        *   Based on Example 3, the incoming copy (9) overwrites the existing mutable color (2). We assume 6 behaves like 2, so the intersection becomes 9.\n        *   Example 2 showed 0 was immutable, but 6 is likely mutable like 2.\n    *   If the source pixel is out of bounds after shifting (i.e., $r < 5$), it is discarded.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Top Object (Rows 2-8):**\n    *   Pixels from Row 5 shift to Row 0.\n    *   Pixels from Row 6 shift to Row 1.\n    *   Pixels from Row 7 shift to Row 2. (Overlap with existing R2).\n    *   Pixels from Row 8 shift to Row 3. (Overlap with existing R3).\n    *   Pixels from R2, R3, R4 shift off-grid (rows -3, -2, -1) and are lost.\n\n*   **Bottom Object (Rows 13-15):**\n    *   Pixels from Row 13 shift to Row 8. (Overlap with existing R8).\n    *   Pixels from Row 14 shift to Row 9.\n    *   Pixels from Row 15 shift to Row 10.\n\n*   **Detailed Row Changes:**\n    *   **Row 0:** Receives copy of R5 (6s at 9, 14). Becomes `...9...9...`.\n    *   **Row 1:** Receives copy of R6 (6s at 8, 10). Becomes `...9...9...`.\n    *   **Row 2:** Existing `...6...` (at 2) and `...6...6...` (at 8, 10). Receives copy of R7 (6 at 2). Intersection at 2 becomes 9. Result: 9 at 2; 6 at 8, 10.\n    *   **Row 3:** Existing `...6,6...` (at 1, 2) and `...6...6...` (at 9, 14). Receives copy of R8 (6s at 1, 3). Intersection at 1 becomes 9. New 9 at 3. Existing 6 at 2, 9, 14 remains. Result: 9 at 1; 6 at 2; 9 at 3; 6 at 9, 14.\n    *   **Row 8:** Existing `...6...6...` (at 1, 3). Receives copy of R13 (6 at 4). Result: 6 at 1, 3; 9 at 4.\n    *   **Row 9:** Existing empty. Receives copy of R14 (6s at 3, 5, 8, 9, 14). Result: 9s at those positions.\n    *   **Row 10:** Existing empty. Receives copy of R15 (6s at 9, 13, 15). Result: 9s at those positions.\n\noutput:\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,9,7,9\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 0>\n<CANDIDATE 1>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 16x16\n7777777779777777\n7777777777777777\n7797777767677777\n7667777776777767\n7777777777777677\n7777777776777767\n7777777767677777\n7767777777777777\n7676977777777777\n7777777777777797\n7777777777777777\n7777777777777777\n7777777777777777\n7777677777777777\n7776767766777767\n7777777776777676\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_2_step_1\">\n**Final Thoughts on ARC Task Solution**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The goal is to solve this ARC problem by analyzing the examples and figuring out the rule for transforming the input grid into the output. It looks like we're dealing with 16x16 grids, predominantly orange (7) with these patterns of other colors. My job is to figure out the rule.\n\n**Initial Assessment:**\n\nThe examples are key. Let's see. The first example (Ex 1) gives us a background and these 'V' or triangle shapes made of maroon (9). The pattern at the bottom is definitely key.  I looked for repeating patterns there. I focused on tracing the non-orange pixels, the 'V' shapes at the bottom. The output has *mostly* the same pattern. But wait, new non-background pixels show up on one row.\n\n**Deep Dive on Example 1:**\n\nIn Example 1, I saw an \"L\" shape too, but, mostly the V pattern. I noted that these new pixels in the output are actually 5 rows up from parts of the V shape. I noticed that for Example 1, there was a shift pattern (-5, 0) -- it's 5 rows up. Also, the output shows a different color in the new spot. So there's a shift and a *color change* happening here. It's not just moving the pattern, but moving key parts of the original pattern. Also, it's not simply moving a row up because it does not copy the entire \"V\". I thought about what could be at the new row and, the \"peak\" of the V. In Example 1, The L shape at the top seemed to cause the change of color, but that hypothesis didn't hold.\n\n**Key Observation: Peak Movement**\n\nOkay, then I started to think that the shift pattern is key. And, maybe, the new color depends on the old color? Also, maybe, there's a *shift* in the original pattern. Okay, now I have to figure out the rule of the shift vector and color change.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis**\n\nMoving to Example 2, there was the same format. In Ex 2 I had an input full of black 'V's. The output had a *similar* pattern made of maroon (9). The same -5 rows shift was happening. But, in this example, the background was all 7s, so, where's the overlap? In Example 2 it seemed like the shift was also (-5, 0) for these upside-down 'V's at the bottom of the grid. It looks like it follows the same process, copy the peak/top and shift up five rows. So, maybe that's it!\n\n**Example 3 Analysis**\n\nMoving to Example 3, there's a different input shape. Now the colors are red and there's a repetitive pattern. But it's not 'V's anymore! What's key is the shift vector is no longer (-5, 0), it's now (-5, -5). Aha! The new shapes are shifted diagonally, 5 rows and 5 columns!\n\n**Shift Vector Hypothesis and Pattern Analysis**\n\nI spent a lot of time trying to understand the vector shift and why it varied. Was there a special shape, an outlier? Is it because the shapes are different in Examples 3? Or, is it just about symmetry? And, the *colour* change? So maybe all that's important is *the key point* of each pattern. Maybe it's about the shape of the patterns!\n\n**The General Rule Emerges**\n\nBased on the three examples, I have the key rule. To transform the input to the output:\n\n*   **1. Identify key points/patterns in the input.**\n*   **2. Figure out the *shape* of key patterns.**\n*   **3. Determine a shift vector** and change colors of the new pixel. The color change *is not always the same!*\n\n*   The \"shift\" is (-5, 0), *if* the dominant shape is symmetric!\n*   The \"shift\" is (-5, -5), *if* the shape is not symmetric!\n\nSo, I had to find a rule! The shift, it seems, has to do with how the pattern looks (e.g. Is it symmetric? Is there a key coordinate, etc). It's all about how these key points move.\n\n**Test Input Application**\n\nOkay, now let's go! Time to apply this to the test input. It's magenta (6), but, I have to find the pattern. I looked at the magenta pixels and identified V shapes! And, there are a lot of V's. I used\n\nThe objective is to identify the transformation rule from the input to the output grids based on the provided examples and apply it to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of Solved Examples:**\n\n1.  **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** Background is Orange (7). There are Maroon (9) shapes at the bottom (rows 14-16) and one \"L\" shape at the top (rows 3-4). The bottom shapes are three \"V\" patterns (inverted triangles). The peaks of these \"V\"s are at (14,1), (14,7), and (14,14).\n    *   **Output:** New pixels appear in row 9. Specifically at (9,1), (9,7), and (9,14). The pixel at (9,7) is Blue (1), while others are Maroon (9). These positions correspond exactly to shifting the peaks of the \"V\" shapes **up by 5 rows** (Row 14 -> Row 9). The \"L\" shape does not appear to generate a corresponding output in the grid (likely because shifting it up would place it out of bounds).\n    *   **Rule inferred:** Identify \"V\" shapes, take their peak coordinate $(r, c)$, and mark the output at $(r-5, c)$ with Maroon (9) (with a special case for the middle one becoming Blue in this symmetric arrangement).\n\n2.  **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** Background is Orange (7). Black (0) shapes are scattered in the bottom half. These are \"V\" shapes (peaks at 10,1; 12,4; 13,11; 14,1; 14,7) and one at (11,8).\n    *   **Output:** New Maroon (9) pixels appear exactly 5 rows above the peaks of the Black \"V\" shapes. For instance, the peak at (10,1) results in a Maroon pixel at (5,1). The peak at (11,8) results in a Maroon pixel at (6,8).\n    *   **Rule confirmation:** Identify \"V\" shapes, shift their peaks **up by 5 rows** ($r-5$), and place a Maroon (9) pixel.\n\n3.  **Example 3:**\n    *   **Input:** Background is Orange (7). Red (2) \"Gamma\" shapes (2x2 block missing bottom-right).\n    *   **Output:** New Maroon (9) pixels appear. The transformation here is a shift **Up 5 and Left 5** ($r-5, c-5$). For example, a shape at (6,5) produces a pixel at (1,0).\n    *   **Synthesis:** The shift vector depends on the shape type. Symmetric \"V\" shapes pointing up use a vector of $(-5, 0)$. Asymmetric \"Gamma\" shapes pointing top-left use $(-5, -5)$.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Shapes:** The test input contains Magenta (6) shapes on an Orange (7) background. We look for the dominant shape type, which matches the \"V\" shapes from Examples 1 and 2 (a peak pixel on top, with two 'leg' pixels diagonally below).\n    *   Scanning the grid, we find 4 such \"V\" shapes:\n        1.  Peak at **(5, 9)**. Legs at (6,8), (6,10).\n        2.  Peak at **(7, 2)**. Legs at (8,1), (8,3).\n        3.  Peak at **(13, 4)**. Legs at (14,3), (14,5).\n        4.  Peak at **(14, 14)**. Legs at (15,13), (15,15).\n    *   There are other fragments (e.g., at (2,2), (2,8), (14,8)), but they form different shapes (Triangles, Inverted Vs, Gammas) which are singular instances and likely ignored in favor of the repeated \"V\" pattern, or simply don't fit the \"Upright V\" rule established in Ex 1 and 2.\n\n2.  **Apply Transformation:**\n    *   The shape is the symmetric \"Upright V\".\n    *   The shift rule for this shape is **Up 5 rows** ($r \\to r-5, c \\to c$).\n    *   The marker color is **Maroon (9)**.\n\n3.  **Calculate Destinations:**\n    *   (5, 9) $\\to$ **(0, 9)**\n    *   (7, 2) $\\to$ **(2, 2)**\n    *   (13, 4) $\\to$ **(8, 4)**\n    *   (14, 14) $\\to$ **(9, 14)**\n\n4.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   Copy the input grid.\n    *   Place a Maroon (9) pixel at the calculated destinations.\n    *   Note: At (2,2), the input has a Magenta (6) pixel. The new Maroon (9) pixel will overwrite it (consistent with Example 3 where overlap occurred).\n    *   No Blue (1) pixels are generated because there is no symmetric central arrangement of shapes as in Example 1.\n\n**Output Grid Details:**\n*   Row 0, Col 9 becomes 9.\n*   Row 2, Col 2 becomes 9.\n*   Row 8, Col 4 becomes 9.\n*   Row 9, Col 14 becomes 9.\n*   All other pixels remain identical to the input.\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n<REASONING_MODEL_B model_id=\"gpt-5.1-high_1_step_1\">\nFirst I'll describe the pattern I inferred from the examples, then apply it to the test grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Inferring the rule from the examples\n\nAll examples have:\n\n- Background color 7\n- One \u201cobject\u201d color (9, 0, or 2)\n- New 9s (and once a 1) being added in otherwise empty areas\n\n### 1.1. The key shape: a \u201cV\u201d of the object color\n\nIn Examples 1 and 2, if you look at the non\u20117 cells, there is a recurring 3\u2011cell pattern shaped like a downward \u201cV\u201d:\n\nPattern (object color `X`):\n\n- Apex at `(r, c)` is `X`\n- Two diagonal neighbors one row below are `X`:\n  - `(r+1, c-1)` = `X`\n  - `(r+1, c+1)` = `X`\n\nExample 2 (color 0):\n\n- At `(10,1)`: `(11,0)` and `(11,2)` are 0 \u21d2 a V\n- At `(11,8)`: `(12,7)` and `(12,9)` are 0 \u21d2 a V\n- At `(12,4)`: `(13,3)` and `(13,5)` are 0 \u21d2 a V\n- At `(13,11)`: `(14,10)` and `(14,12)` are 0 \u21d2 a V\n- At `(14,1)`: `(15,0)` and `(15,2)` are 0 \u21d2 a V\n- At `(14,7)`: `(15,6)` and `(15,8)` are 0 \u21d2 a V\n\nExample 1 (color 9, bottom rows):\n\n- At `(14,1)`: `(15,0)` and `(15,2)` are 9 \u21d2 V\n- At `(14,7)`: `(15,6)` and `(15,8)` are 9 \u21d2 V\n- At `(14,14)`: `(15,13)` and `(15,15)` are 9 \u21d2 V\n\n### 1.2. What happens to each V\n\nFor each such V apex at `(r, c)` in Examples 1 and 2:\n\n- The output places a 9 exactly 5 rows above, same column: at `(r-5, c)`\n\nCheck example 2:\n\n- V at `(10,1)` \u2192 output has 9 at `(5,1)`\n- V at `(11,8)` \u2192 9 at `(6,8)`\n- V at `(12,4)` \u2192 9 at `(7,4)`\n- V at `(13,11)` \u2192 9 at `(8,11)`\n- V at `(14,1)` \u2192 9 at `(9,1)`\n- V at `(14,7)` \u2192 9 at `(9,7)`\n\nEverything else is unchanged.\n\nExample 1:\n\n- V at `(14,1)` \u2192 9 at `(9,1)`\n- V at `(14,7)` \u2192 marker at `(9,7)` (shown as 1 in the example, but structurally it is exactly where a 9 would go)\n- V at `(14,14)` \u2192 9 at `(9,14)`\n\nAgain, all other cells (object cells included) remain as in the input.\n\n### 1.3. Example 3\n\nExample 3 has no such V\u2011patterns of the object color (2); instead it has a different 3\u2011cell \u201cL\u201d pattern, and another layer of behavior. But:\n\n- Our test grid clearly contains V\u2011patterns,\n- And wherever Vs appear in the training set (Examples 1 & 2), they are the motif used for placing 9s, leaving the original object cells unchanged.\n\nSo for the test, we follow the V\u2011pattern rule.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying the rule to the test input\n\n### 2.1. Find all Vs of color 6\n\nObject color in the test is 6. We look for apexes `(r, c)` such that:\n\n- `grid[r][c] == 6`\n- `grid[r+1][c-1] == 6`\n- `grid[r+1][c+1] == 6`\n\nScanning the grid yields these apexes:\n\n1. `(5, 9)`:\n   - `(6,8) = 6` and `(6,10) = 6` \u21d2 V\n2. `(7, 2)`:\n   - `(8,1) = 6` and `(8,3) = 6` \u21d2 V\n3. `(13, 4)`:\n   - `(14,3) = 6` and `(14,5) = 6` \u21d2 V\n4. `(14, 14)`:\n   - `(15,13) = 6` and `(15,15) = 6` \u21d2 V\n\nNo other 6 satisfies the V condition.\n\n### 2.2. Place 9s 5 rows above each V\n\nFor each V apex at `(r, c)`, set output cell `(r-5, c)` to 9:\n\n1. `(5, 9)` \u2192 `(0, 9)` becomes 9\n2. `(7, 2)` \u2192 `(2, 2)` becomes 9\n3. `(13, 4)` \u2192 `(8, 4)` becomes 9\n4. `(14, 14)` \u2192 `(9, 14)` becomes 9\n\nAll other cells are copied from the input unchanged.\n\nNote: In this task, one of the projected positions `(2,2)` was originally 6; by analogy with the training Vs (where there was no overlap constraint given), we still overwrite with 9.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

Observed pattern from the examples\n\n### a. Background and signal colors\nIn all examples:\n\n- The grid is 16\u00d716, with **7 as background**.\n- There is **one other \u201csignal\u201d color** in each input:\n  - Example 1: signal = 9\n  - Example 2: signal = 0\n  - Example 3: signal = 2\n- The output introduces a **new marking color**:\n  - If 9 is *not* used as a signal, the new markings are 9.\n  - If 9 *is* the signal color (example 1), a different color (1) is used for at least some of the markings, so as not to confuse old vs. new.\n\n### b. What gets moved / marked?\n\nLooking at examples 1 and 2 (the vertical case):\n\n- For the signal color cells, only **some** of them are used to produce new marks.\n- These \u201cused\u201d signal cells have a clear local property:\n\n> A signal-color cell is a \u201ctip\u201d if, in the **previous row**, neither of its two diagonal neighbors (up-left and up-right) are signal-colored.\n\nFormally, cell at (r, c) is a tip if:\n- grid[r][c] == signalColor, and\n- grid[r-1][c-1] != signalColor (or c == 1), and\n- grid[r-1][c+1] != signalColor (or c == 16).\n\nCheck this on example 2 (signal = 0):\n- The zeros at:\n  - (11,2), (12,9), (13,5), (14,12), (15,2), (15,8)\n  - are exactly those with **no diagonal-zero neighbors above**.\n- These are exactly the ones that produce 9\u2019s in the output.\n\nCheck on example 1 (signal = 9):\n- Among the 9\u2019s, the \u201ctip\u201d ones are:\n  - (4,13), (5,13), (15,2), (15,8), (15,15).\n- Of those, only the ones with r > 5 give in-bounds targets when moved 5 up:\n  - (15,2) \u2192 (10,2)\n  - (15,8) \u2192 (10,8)\n  - (15,15) \u2192 (10,15)\n- These are exactly the three new marks in row 10.\n\n(In example 3 there is also a diagonal variant, but in the test input there are *no* signal-color pairs separated by (5,5), so we only need the **vertical** behavior for this test.)\n\n### c. How are the tips moved?\n\nIn the vertical examples (1 and 2), each chosen \u201ctip\u201d cell at (r, c):\n\n- is mapped to a new mark at **(r - 5, c)** (5 rows upward, same column),\n- as long as r - 5 \u2265 1 (inside the grid).\n\nColor of the new mark:\n- If 9 is not already used as a signal color, use 9 for the marks.\n- In the test, signal color = 6, so we\u2019ll use 9.\n\nWe also allow overwriting existing colors at the target (example 3 shows overwriting of signal color by 9; there is nothing in the training that forbids overwriting).\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Two distinct mechanisms show up:\n\n* New `9` markers are inserted a fixed 5 rows above certain source rows. The source rows are determined by adjacency in the input: in examples\u202f1 and\u202f2 the marked source cells are those that have a diagonally adjacent cell of the same colour in the following row. In example\u202f3 there are horizontal runs of the same colour; in that case markers are placed for the horizontal run instead, shifted 5 rows up and 5 columns left. If a row contains multiple runs only the left\u2013hand start of each run is marked; if it contains a single run of length 2 both endpoints are marked. Rows that receive such horizontal markers are flagged, and diagonal markers into a flagged row are suppressed.\n\n* The markers do not overwrite existing non\u2011background cells: a candidate diagonal marker is skipped if the target cell is not background. For the horizontal markers we also propagate down one cell: if a horizontal marker lands above an input non\u2011background cell, that cell is turned into a `9` as well.\n\nApplying this combined rule to the test grid, there is one horizontal run at row\u202f14, columns\u202f8\u20139, so we place horizontal markers at row\u202f9, columns\u202f3 and\u202f4. Diagonal adjacencies produce candidates at (0,9), (2,2), (8,4), (9,8) and (9,14); the row\u202f9 candidates are suppressed because row\u202f9 already has horizontal markers, and (2,2) is skipped because it is not background. The remaining diagonal markers go to (0,9) and (8,4). Propagation does not add anything further.\n\nThe final output is therefore the input grid with `9`s inserted at (0,9), (8,4), (9,3) and (9,4):\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 6>\n<CANDIDATE 7>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 16x16\n7777777779777777\n7777777777777777\n7797777767677777\n7997777776777767\n7777777797777677\n7777777776777767\n7777777767677777\n7767777777777777\n7676977979777777\n7777777777777717\n7777777777777777\n7777777777777777\n7777777777777777\n7777677777777777\n7776767766777767\n7777777776777676\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_3_step_3\">\n**ARC Task: Shape Interaction Simulation**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I'm essentially simulating interactions between shapes within a grid.  It seems the user wants me to derive the rules based on examples, and then apply those rules to a test input. I'm focusing on the geometric features and how they relate to the transformation of the grid.  The core idea I'm latching onto is that different shapes act as \"launchers,\" projecting \"projectiles\" that can interact with the grid and other objects.  Shapes also appear to \"fire\" these projectiles by altering some other part of the grid.\n\nAnalyzing the examples, I can see that the grid initially contains a background color (7), some initial objects (the \"launchers\"), and then the output shows the results of these shapes' actions. The shapes come in various forms - Carets, Flags, L-shapes, and some new variants in the test input. Their positions relative to one another in the output can be attributed to each shapes' action - projecting projectiles. Each shape seems to have a predefined \"firing vector\" or direction that determines where its projectile lands. Based on the examples, and my observations, the firing direction seems related to the shape's orientation or asymmetry.\n\nMy current understanding is that each \"launcher\" launches a projectile in a certain direction, based on its shape's defining geometry. This is the core mechanic.  If the projectile lands on an empty space, it leaves a \"projectile\" pixel (color 9). If it hits another object, the object is changed. And if two projectiles collide in the air, a collision event (color 1) is registered. However, the interactions aren't completely direct. There's a 5-row separation that is involved for the most part. Each launcher projects a pixel that will impact at -5 rows and a specific offset based on the launching shape. \n\nIn Example 1, I identified a core pattern: \"caret\" shapes generate an upward-shooting projectile that turns into an altered pixel (9). These shapes don't shift horizontally (their column remains the same), unless there are overlapping projectiles from other shapes. Example 2 demonstrated the same upward firing projectiles. In Example 3, I dealt with flag shapes, which introduced a horizontal displacement (-5 columns) to the projectile's trajectory, leading to a new \"shooting\" pattern. The test input has given me a lot more shapes that behave in a similar fashion.\n\nThe rules I've deduced are:\n1. **Shape Types** The launchers are detected based on the configuration of their base pixels:\n   - Caret (pointy top): shoot straight upwards.\n   - V-Shape: shoot downwards.\n   - Flag (top-left filled): shoot upward-left.\n   - Mirror L (group 1): Shoot bottom-right.\n   - Reverse Flag. Shoot up to the right.\n   - ZigZag: point to the left and shoot in that direction.\n   - L-Shape (Ex 1): points downwards to the left and shoots there.\n2. **Target Calculation:** Determine the projectile's target coordinate based on the launching shape's properties by adding specific row and column offsets.\n3. **Collision & Transformation:** Simulate the \"projectiles\" landing by adding the pixels at the target. This leads to the generation of 9 pixels on all empty spaces. Projectiles can lead to transformations and collisions:\n   - A hit pixel object will become 9\n   - A mid-air collision between two projectiles will become a pixel 1.\n\nI'm confident I can now analyze the test input to find the shapes, generate their respective targets and construct the output grid based on these interactions and the 5 row difference from the source pixels. Let's see if this plays out.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid based on rules inferred from three solved examples. The grids contain various small shapes (objects) made of colors on a background of orange (7).\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification & Classification**: We identify small connected components (\"shapes\") in the grid. Based on their geometry, we classify them as specific types of \"launchers\" that fire projectiles in a specific direction. The offset for all projectiles is 5 steps in the respective cardinal or diagonal direction.\n    *   **Caret (Up-Shooter)**: Shape `^` (e.g., center top, legs bottom). Fires **Up** (row -5, col 0).\n    *   **V-Shape (Down-Shooter)**: Shape `v` (inverted Caret). Fires **Down** (row +5, col 0).\n    *   **Flag (Diagonal-Shooter)**: A 2x2 block with one corner missing.\n        *   If Top-Left filled (Ex 3): Fires **Up-Left** (row -5, col -5).\n        *   If Top-Right filled (Test Input, Group 7): Fires **Up-Right** (row -5, col +5).\n    *   **L-Shape / J-Shape (Diagonal-Shooter)**: A 2x2 block with one corner filled and its two neighbors.\n        *   If L-shaped (Bottom-Left corner): Fires **Down-Left** (row +5, col -5).\n        *   If J-shaped (Bottom-Right corner, Test Input Group 1): Fires **Down-Right** (row +5, col +5).\n    *   **ZigZag (Lateral-Shooter)**: A vertical zig-zag line.\n        *   If pointing Left (`<`): Fires **Left** (row 0, col -5).\n\n2.  **Projectile Logic**:\n    *   For each shape, determine the \"source\" pixel (usually the tip or corner in the direction of fire) and calculate the \"target\" pixel using the offset.\n    *   **Empty Target**: If the target pixel is empty (background 7), a projectile lands there. The color is **Maroon (9)**.\n    *   **Collision**: If two projectiles land on the same empty target pixel, they collide and form a **Blue (1)** pixel.\n    *   **Object Hit**: If a projectile's target lands on an existing object, that object is \"hit\". The entire object changes its color to **Maroon (9)**.\n\n**Application to Test Input**:\n\n*   **Shape 1 (J-Shape)** at `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)`. Fires Down-Right (+5, +5) from `(3,2)` to target **(8,7)**.\n*   **Shape 2 (V-Shape)** at `(2,8), (2,10), (3,9)`. Fires Down (+5, 0) from `(3,9)` to target **(8,9)**.\n*   **Shape 3 (ZigZag)** at `(3,14), (4,13), (5,14)`. Points Left. Fires Left (0, -5) from `(4,13)` to target **(4,8)**.\n*   **Shape 4 (Caret)** at `(5,9), (6,8), (6,10)`. Fires Up (-5, 0) from `(5,9)` to target **(0,9)**.\n*   **Shape 5 (Caret)** at `(7,2), (8,1), (8,3)`. Fires Up (-5, 0) from `(7,2)` to target **(2,2)**.\n    *   Target `(2,2)` is part of Shape 1. **Hit!** Shape 1 turns Maroon (9).\n*   **Shape 6 (Caret)** at `(13,4), (14,3), (14,5)`. Fires Up (-5, 0) from `(13,4)` to target **(8,4)**.\n*   **Shape 7 (Flag-TR)** at `(14,8), (14,9), (15,9)`.

The goal is to predict the output grid based on the input and some solved examples. It looks like it's all about identifying shapes and transforming them somehow.  The background color is pretty consistently orange (7), so that\u2019s my baseline.\n\n**Initial Exploration: Example 1**\n\nFirst, I looked at Example 1. I started by noticing two key non-orange patterns: a small \u201cV\u201d shaped triangle and an \u201cL\u201d shape in the grid.  I spent a good amount of time analyzing the coordinates and structure of these shapes, trying to understand how they related to the output. The output grid was tricky because it seemed to add in an extra color, blue (1), that wasn't in the input. And I was stumped as to *why* a given pixel changed to blue or not. At first, I thought there was a -5 offset, which didn't feel right.\n\n**From Triangle Count to Offsets**\n\nThen, I jumped to Example 2. Here, there are triangles and the output seemed consistent, adding a new color. I went through the coordinate analysis here again. I took special care to record the locations of these triangles. Once I was sure that there were shapes, I looked at the output and started noticing a consistent *distance* between the shape and the added color. A -5 offset (upward) was the key.\n\n**Example 3: A Different Shape**\n\nExample 3 was a curveball. The shapes looked different from Example 1, like L-shapes but inverted. The output didn't follow the pattern I initially thought. I spent a long time retracing the logic and trying to find the correspondence between shapes and generated pixels. The addition and offset were still present. I needed a clear way to encode them.\n\n**Refinement: Triangle vs. L-Shape**\n\nLooking at all the examples, I realized there were different \"shapes\" within the grids. It became clear that there were two types of shapes: triangles, which always led to one kind of transformation. Then the L-shapes, with an offset to the left and a color transformation. I had to distinguish each type of shape. It finally started to click: the key was not just identifying the *type* of shape, but also where it was located within the grid. Different shapes, and their orientations, had different offsets, and the pixel creation was based on offset location.\n\n**Decomposing Transformations and Validating**\n\nThe logic boiled down to this: Identify shapes. Then apply the appropriate offset to each shape. The offset depended on the *type* and orientation of the shape. If the projection overlapped an existing shape, that shape changed color!\n\n**Applying the Rules to the Test Input**\n\nWith my rules in place, I moved to the Test Input. First thing I did was re-index my locations to ensure I am using the proper location. I identified the shapes.  I carefully analyzed the Test Input, finding triangles and L-shapes (of different orientations).  I had to pay attention to coordinates very carefully. I applied the transformation rules I derived. I calculated each projected coordinate and marked the change. The shape at (2,2) got hit. The algorithm generated these new pixels, changing certain values in the grid, and drawing new ones.\n\n**Final Touches**\n\nIn the end, all that was left was applying my transformation rules to generate the output, which was a simple matter of going through the input and changing the appropriate values based on my calculations. The final output became clear and I was satisfied.\n\n\nBased on the solved examples, the transformation involves identifying specific shapes in the grid and projecting a \"shadow\" or marker pixel 5 units away in a direction determined by the shape's orientation. If a projection lands on an existing shape, that shape changes color to Maroon (9). If it lands on an empty space, a Maroon (9) pixel is created.\n\n**Rules:**\n1.  **Triangle (Up)**: A symmetric triangle shape pointing up (Tip at top).\n    *   **Projection**: 5 rows UP from the tip. `(r - 5, c)`.\n2.  **Triangle (Left)**: A triangle shape pointing left (Tip at left).\n    *   **Projection**: 5 columns LEFT from the tip. `(r, c - 5)`.\n3.  **L-Shapes (2x2 with one corner missing)**:\n    *   **Missing Top-Right**: Projects **Down-Left**. `(BottomRow + 5, LeftCol - 5)`. (Seen in Ex 1).\n    *   **Missing Bottom-Right**: Projects **Up-Left**. `(TopRow - 5, LeftCol - 5)`. (Seen in Ex 3).\n    *   **Missing Bottom-Left**: Projects **Up-Right**. `(TopRow - 5, LeftCol + 5)`.\n    *   **Missing Top-Left**: Projects **Down-Right**. `(BottomRow + 5, LeftCol + 5)`.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Triangle Up** at `(5, 9)` (Tip).\n    *   Target: `(5 - 5, 9)` = **`(0, 9)`**.\n2.  **Triangle Up** at `(7, 2)` (Tip).\n    *   Target: `(7 - 5, 2)` = **`(2, 2)`**.\n    *   Note: `(2, 2)` is occupied by the L-shape described below. This collision causes the L-shape to turn Maroon (9).\n3.  **Triangle Up** at `(13, 4)` (Tip).\n    *   Target: `(13 - 5, 4)` = **`(8, 4)`**.\n4.  **Triangle Up** at `(14, 14)` (Tip).\n    *   Target: `(14 - 5, 14)` = **`(9, 14)`**.\n5.  **Triangle Left** at `(4, 13)` (Tip). (Base at `(3,14), (5,14)`).\n    *   Target: `(4, 13 - 5)` = **`(4, 8)`**.\n6.  **L-Shape (Missing Top-Left)** at Rows 2-3, Cols 1-2.\n    *   Occupies `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)`.\n    *   Projects Down-Right. Bottom row is 3. Left col is 1.\n    *   Target: `(3 + 5, 1 + 5)` = **`(8, 6)`**.\n    *   **Effect**: This shape is hit by the projection from the Triangle at `(7,2)`.

                "response": "**The ARC Puzzle's Logic Unraveled**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this ARC puzzle. My mission: decipher the rules behind these shape transformations. I\u2019m seeing these 16x16 grids with a 7 background \u2013 orange, I suppose. There are three key examples to work with.\n\nIn the first example, I see these maroon shapes, like an inverted V and an L at the top. The output has markers \u2013 that's what I'm calling them, the new, colored pixels \u2013 showing up five rows above the bottom row of the V. In this case, there are three Vs and three new markers - one is blue, one is 9 and one is 9. It seems that the row index of an output marker is equal to the apex of the bottom V - 5. The blue marker is interesting; it looks like the top L has something to do with that, but I need to figure out exactly how.\n\nThe second example is similar. Black Vs pointing up now. It all creates these maroon 9s - again, with the same \"apex row - 5\" rule. All the markers are 9s this time. No blue.\n\nThe third example throws a curveball: red \"Gamma\" shapes. I see this color shift from red to maroon. After closer inspection, I see that for every shape, a marker (9) is placed at a \"top-left to marker\" shift of (-5, -5). It looks like when a marker lands on an existing shape, it just overwrites it. That's good to know.\n\nNow, putting it all together, I\u2019ve got these rules:\n\n1.  Identify \"actionable shapes.\" It looks like Vs are one type and these Gamma shapes are another.\n\n2.  If the shape is a V, the action is to place a 9 at the marker coordinate, 5 rows below. If the top of the V has the index r, the marker shows up at r-5. The horizontal component stays the same.\n\n3.  If it is a gamma, the action is to place a 9 at (r-5, c-5) from the shape's top-left origin.\n\n4.  If a new marker lands on an existing pixel, it becomes a 9.\n\nThen, there is the matter of the blue marker in Ex 1. I think it is an interaction or an anomaly related to proximity to the top L shape, as it's the middle V.\n\nFor our test input, let\u2019s see what we have. It\u2019s a magenta color (6) with a 7 background. I'm seeing upright Vs, an L shape, and another shape that looks like a flag or a Gamma.\n\nI have to apply the rules. The V-shapes are the same. Now, I have to figure out how the L shape acts. Based on Ex 1 and Ex 3, it should involve a shift.\n\nThe L shape seems to shoot \"Down-Left\" and the gamma seems to shoot \"Up-Left\".\n\nLet\u2019s apply these rules to the shapes in the test input.\n\nI think:\n\n*   The upright V shifts \"Down\" (-5, 0).\n\n*   The Gamma shapes will shift \"Up-Left\" (-5, -5).\n\nThe L shape at the top-left looks like it will shoot \"Down-Right\" (+5, +5) based on the geometry, and the L shape at the bottom looks like it will shoot \"Up-Right\" (-5, +5).\n\nI need to check for collisions \u2013 where the shifts overlap. One of the L-shapes \"shoots\" right over the upright V, so there will be a collision! Based on Example 1, I believe that collision will result in a 1 (blue).\n\nLet's look at the outputs and compare them.\n\n*   **Candidate 1:** This is too simple. It just takes the Vs into consideration. It misses the shift/collision.\n\n*   **Candidate 0, 2:** Looks like it's trying, but too many things are wrong.\n\n*   **Candidate 3:** Makes some random assumptions.\n\n*   **Candidate 4:** Confusing \"tip\" logic, not relevant.\n\n*   **Candidate 7/8:** These are the key candidates!\n\n*   **Candidate 7**: It can take on the shape and the geometry and correctly shifts them. Its a good attempt.\n\n*   **Candidate 8**: It's really close!\n\nI have a winner: Candidate 7! This one correctly identifies the shape-shifting rules and explains the blue pixel in Example 1, which stems from a collision.\n\nCandidate 7 seems to have cracked the code:\n\n*   **Identify**: Vs (shoot up or down). L\n\n<AUDIT_LOG>\n1.  **Selection:** I have selected Candidate 7 as the primary candidate to audit. It offers the most detailed and comprehensive logic (\"Shape Interaction Simulation\"), breaking down the problem into specific shape classifications (Caret, V-Shape, Flag, L-Shape, ZigZag) and their corresponding \"firing\" rules (Up, Down, Diagonal, Cardinal), explicitly accounting for collisions (Blue/1) and overwrites (Maroon/9).\n\n2.  **Crystallization:**\n    *   **IF** Shape is \"Up-V\" (Apex Top), **THEN** project 9 to $(r-5, c)$.\n    *   **IF** Shape is \"Down-V\" (Apex Bottom), **THEN** project 9 to $(r+5, c)$.\n    *   **IF** Shape is \"L/Gamma\" (2x2 missing one corner), **THEN** project 9 diagonally 5 steps away from the *existing* corner that opposes the missing one (e.g., missing TR $\\rightarrow$ shoot DL; missing BL $\\rightarrow$ shoot UR). Shift is $(\\pm 5, \\pm 5)$.\n    *   **IF** Shape is \"ZigZag\" (pointing Left), **THEN** project 9 to $(r, c-5)$.\n    *   **IF** Projectile lands on Empty (7), set to 9.\n    *   **IF** Projectile lands on Object, set to 9.\n    *   **IF** Two Projectiles land on same cell, set to 1.\n\n3.  **Phase 2: Ground Truth Audit (Solved Examples):**\n    *   **Example 1:**\n        *   Input: Up-Vs at bottom (Apex top). Logic: Shoot Up (-5).\n        *   Input: L-Shape at top (Missing TR). Logic: Shoot Down-Left (+5, -5).\n        *   Observation: Up-Vs create 9s at row 9. One Up-V is at Col 7. The L-Shape is at ~Col 12. $12-5=7$. L-Shape shoots to Col 7.\n        *   Collision: Up-V (at Col 7) and L-Shape (shooting to Col 7) collide at (9,7).\n        *   Result: Cell (9,7) is Blue (1).\n        *   Verdict: **Pass**. The logic perfectly explains the anomaly (Blue pixel) in Example 1.\n    *   **Example 2:**\n        *   Input: Up-Vs only.\n        *   Observation: All output markers are 9s at $(r-5, c)$. No collisions.\n        *   Verdict: **Pass**.\n    *   **Example 3:**\n        *   Input: Gamma Shapes (Missing BR).\n        *   Logic: Shoot Up-Left (-5, -5).\n        *   Observation: Markers appear at $(r-5, c-5)$.\n        *   Verdict: **Pass**.\n\n4.  **Phase 3: Execution Consistency (Test Input):**\n    *   **Shapes Identified by Candidate 7:**\n        *   Up-Vs at (5,9), (7,2), (13,4), (14,14). Logic: Shoot Up (-5, 0). Targets: (0,9), (2,2), (8,4), (9,14).\n        *   Down-V at (3,9). Logic: Shoot Down (+5, 0). Target: (8,9). (Note: Other candidates missed this).\n        *   L-Shape (Missing TL) at (2,2). Logic: Shoot Down-Right (+5, +5). Target: (8,7).\n        *   L-Shape (Missing BL) at (14,9). Logic: Shoot Up-Right (-5, +5). Target: (9,14).\n        *   ZigZag (Left) at (4,13). Logic: Shoot Left (0, -5). Target: (4,8).\n    *   **Interactions:**\n        *   Target (2,2) lands on existing object. Result: Overwrite to 9.\n        *   Target (9,14) is hit by Up-V (14,14) and L-Shape (14,9). Result: Collision -> 1.\n    *   **Grid Check:**\n        *   Proposed grid shows 9s at (0,9), (2,2), (4,8), (8,4), (8,7), (8,9).\n        *   Proposed grid shows 1 at (9,14).\n    *   **Verdict:** The execution is completely consistent with the crystallized logic. The logic is robust and derived directly from the geometric properties observed in the examples (especially the symmetry of the L-shapes and the collision rule from Ex 1).\n\n5.  **Phase 4: Ranking:**\n    *   **Candidate 7** is the only candidate to correctly identify all shape types (including the Down-V and ZigZag) and correctly predict the collision at (9,14) based on the Example 1 precedent.\n    *   **Candidate 8** has similar \"Shooter\" logic but uses bounding-box calculations that are slightly off for the diagonal shapes, causing it to miss the collision at (9,14) and the Down-V shape entirely.\n    *   **Candidate 1/10** only identify the basic Up-Vs, missing the complexity of the task.\n\n</AUDIT_LOG>\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 7,\n      \"score\": 9.8,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Perfectly reverse-engineered the 'Shooter' mechanic, including directionality (Up/Down/Diagonal/Cardinal) and collision rules (Blue pixel) derived from Example 1.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Consistent\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Objects act as turrets firing 5 steps in a direction determined by their shape; collisions create Blue pixels, hits on empty/occupied space create Maroon pixels.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 8,\n      \"score\": 7.5,\n      \"tier\": \"SILVER\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Strong geometric logic, but 'Bounding Box' calculation for diagonals was less precise than Pixel-based logic, leading to execution errors on the Test Input.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Minor Execution Error\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Similar to Candidate 7 but failed to predict the collision at (9,14) and missed the Down-V shape.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 10,\n      \"score\": 4.0,\n      \"tier\": \"BRONZE\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Partial\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Fail\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Identified the basic vertical shift but ignored the complex diagonal interactions and collision rules.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Consistent with simplified rule\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Simple vertical shift of V-shapes only.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 1,\n      \"score\": 3.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Partial\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Fail\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Too simplistic; misses L-shapes and collision logic entirely.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Consistent with simplified rule\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Vertical shift of V-shapes.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

process:**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task. It's about modifying 16x16 grids. There are three examples and a test case. The objective seems to involve transforming the grid based on patterns or objects.\n\n*   **Initial Observations:** I see a constant background color (orange/7). The task is to \"solve\" a transformation, which suggests that there is a rule. The examples each follow a specific input to output structure. I need to figure out this transformation.\n\n*   **Example 1 Analysis:** Let's focus on this. I'm noting the positions of all non-background pixels (color 9). The input grid and output have a pattern. It starts at a specific position and \"moves\" down.  I notice that pixels from one part of the input are \"copied\" into the output but with a change in color (9 becomes 1). I must map this movement pattern or \"shift\" and any accompanying rules.\n\n*   **Identifying the Transformation:** It looks like a copy operation. But where? And why is one pixel different? I test my guess that the transformation involves copying a pattern from one row to a new row, changing color, or adding colors.\n\n*   **Example 2 and the Shift:** I think the example is an evolution from the first. It features a new object (color 0). The same copy and color change is apparent. I confirm that a shift (upward) is involved here too.\n\n*   **Ex 3:** I'm seeing multiple patterns or \"objects\". Now I'm starting to visualize a \"shift\" or copy operation with a color change. I trace this across the entire grid and note it is happening again. It looks like the same copy operation with changes in pixel color!\n\n*   **Generalizing the Rule:** It seems the rule always is to \"shift up 5 rows\". I analyze what happens when objects overlap with copies - there's a color hierarchy involved, I think. Then, if an object lands on the same position as the shift, there's a specific action.\n\n*   **Rule Refinement:** I think I have it: Non-background objects (a connected set of non-7s) are shifted up by 5 rows. The shifted copy has all of its non-7 pixels changed to 9. The original pixels, if there's a match, get overridden based on a hierarchy.\n\n*   **The Problematic \"1\":**  The one issue is the color change of \"9\" to \"1\". Is there a hidden rule? Maybe intersection? Or a center thing?\n\n*   **Test Input:** The test input reveals a new challenge: there are two objects. Let's see if the same rule of Shift and merge apply.\n\n*   **Shift, Shift, Shift...** Does it always shift up? It's key now to verify that shift direction. \n\n*   **Reconciling the Shift:** Ah, it appears that the horizontal shift amount is dependent on *where* the object is. \n*   **A \"Shift (-5, 0)\" Transformation:** It looks like for some colors, the shift rule is a simple vertical upward shift of five and no horizontal displacement.\n*   **The Overlap Problem:**  I also have the rule for what happens when a copied element lands on top of an existing one. And this appears to be the most complex portion to generalize.\n*   **Focus, the Shift is the key:** I'm not giving up on my shift plan.  For some cases, objects \"align\" to the left? Perhaps the rule is the shift + some horizontal adjustment.  The colors appear to be playing a role in the correct shift rules. I will try to verify.\n*   **Re-evaluating Overlap (and 6 in particular):** I get it!  The new color rules in an overlap state are the tricky part. For test input, I try to assume what the overlap is and how it behaves.  I'll work it out for the color 6 pixels to generalize.\n*   **Test: I have the general framework!** Now, I am testing to write a robust model based on my learnings in the examples and Test Input and the 9 (shift-5 color) behavior.\n*   **Applying the rules to create a matrix:**  I've come up with a rule! It involves a shift in the position of colors. It appears to be based on the general pattern and color type. I will construct the rules using all input pixels on new grid positions.\n*   **Applying the rules:**  I'm trying it out. Applying the model.\n*   **Final Verification:** Almost there, just a few quick checks before I can confidently produce the answer. Looks good!\n\n\nThe transformation rule inferred from the examples is as follows:\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all non-background (non-7) pixels in the grid.\n2.  **Shift and Copy:** For every identified pixel at position $(r, c)$, create a \"copy\" at position $(r-5, c)$. In other words, shift the pattern upwards by 5 rows.\n    *   Note: In Example 3 (Red/2 pixels), the shift was $(-5, -5)$, likely because the pattern was on the right and required centering or a specific alignment. However, in Examples 1 (Maroon/9) and 2 (Black/0), the shift was $(-5, 0)$. The Test Input (Magenta/6) shares the vertical alignment characteristics of Example 2 (the bottom object is directly below the top object), so a shift of $(-5, 0)$ is applied.\n3.  **Apply Color Change:** The copied pixels take the color 9 (Maroon), regardless of the source color (unless the source was 0, where in Ex 2 the copies were 9).\n4.  **Merge with Existing Grid:**\n    *   If the target position $(r-5, c)$ contains the background color (7), replace it with the copy color (9).\n    *   If the target position contains an existing object pixel (6 in this case):\n        *   Based on Example 3, the incoming copy (9) overwrites the existing mutable color (2). We assume 6 behaves like 2, so the intersection becomes 9.\n        *   Example 2 showed 0 was immutable, but 6 is likely mutable like 2.\n    *   If the source pixel is out of bounds after shifting (i.e., $r < 5$), it is discarded.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Top Object (Rows 2-8):**\n    *   Pixels from Row 5 shift to Row 0.\n    *   Pixels from Row 6 shift to Row 1.\n    *   Pixels from Row 7 shift to Row 2. (Overlap with existing R2).\n    *   Pixels from Row 8 shift to Row 3. (Overlap with existing R3).\n    *   Pixels from R2, R3, R4 shift off-grid (rows -3, -2, -1) and are lost.\n\n*   **Bottom Object (Rows 13-15):**\n    *   Pixels from Row 13 shift to Row 8. (Overlap with existing R8).\n    *   Pixels from Row 14 shift to Row 9.\n    *   Pixels from Row 15 shift to Row 10.\n\n*   **Detailed Row Changes:**\n    *   **Row 0:** Receives copy of R5 (6s at 9, 14). Becomes `...9...9...`.\n    *   **Row 1:** Receives copy of R6 (6s at 8, 10). Becomes `...9...9...`.\n    *   **Row 2:** Existing `...6...` (at 2) and `...6...6...` (at 8, 10). Receives copy of R7 (6 at 2). Intersection at 2 becomes 9. Result: 9 at 2; 6 at 8, 10.\n    *   **Row 3:** Existing `...6,6...` (at 1, 2) and `...6...6...` (at 9, 14). Receives copy of R8 (6s at 1, 3). Intersection at 1 becomes 9. New 9 at 3. Existing 6 at 2, 9, 14 remains. Result: 9 at 1; 6 at 2; 9 at 3; 6 at 9, 14.\n    *   **Row 8:** Existing `...6...6...` (at 1, 3). Receives copy of R13 (6 at 4). Result: 6 at 1, 3; 9 at 4.\n    *   **Row 9:** Existing empty. Receives copy of R14 (6s at 3, 5, 8, 9, 14). Result: 9s at those positions.\n    *   **Row 10:** Existing empty. Receives copy of R15 (6s at 9, 13, 15). Result: 9s at those positions.\n\noutput:\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,9,7,9\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,9,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,9,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,9,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,9,7,9\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"1\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_2_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Final Thoughts on ARC Task Solution**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The goal is to solve this ARC problem by analyzing the examples and figuring out the rule for transforming the input grid into the output. It looks like we're dealing with 16x16 grids, predominantly orange (7) with these patterns of other colors. My job is to figure out the rule.\n\n**Initial Assessment:**\n\nThe examples are key. Let's see. The first example (Ex 1) gives us a background and these 'V' or triangle shapes made of maroon (9). The pattern at the bottom is definitely key.  I looked for repeating patterns there. I focused on tracing the non-orange pixels, the 'V' shapes at the bottom. The output has *mostly* the same pattern. But wait, new non-background pixels show up on one row.\n\n**Deep Dive on Example 1:**\n\nIn Example 1, I saw an \"L\" shape too, but, mostly the V pattern. I noted that these new pixels in the output are actually 5 rows up from parts of the V shape. I noticed that for Example 1, there was a shift pattern (-5, 0) -- it's 5 rows up. Also, the output shows a different color in the new spot. So there's a shift and a *color change* happening here. It's not just moving the pattern, but moving key parts of the original pattern. Also, it's not simply moving a row up because it does not copy the entire \"V\". I thought about what could be at the new row and, the \"peak\" of the V. In Example 1, The L shape at the top seemed to cause the change of color, but that hypothesis didn't hold.\n\n**Key Observation: Peak Movement**\n\nOkay, then I started to think that the shift pattern is key. And, maybe, the new color depends on the old color? Also, maybe, there's a *shift* in the original pattern. Okay, now I have to figure out the rule of the shift vector and color change.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis**\n\nMoving to Example 2, there was the same format. In Ex 2 I had an input full of black 'V's. The output had a *similar* pattern made of maroon (9). The same -5 rows shift was happening. But, in this example, the background was all 7s, so, where's the overlap? In Example 2 it seemed like the shift was also (-5, 0) for these upside-down 'V's at the bottom of the grid. It looks like it follows the same process, copy the peak/top and shift up five rows. So, maybe that's it!\n\n**Example 3 Analysis**\n\nMoving to Example 3, there's a different input shape. Now the colors are red and there's a repetitive pattern. But it's not 'V's anymore! What's key is the shift vector is no longer (-5, 0), it's now (-5, -5). Aha! The new shapes are shifted diagonally, 5 rows and 5 columns!\n\n**Shift Vector Hypothesis and Pattern Analysis**\n\nI spent a lot of time trying to understand the vector shift and why it varied. Was there a special shape, an outlier? Is it because the shapes are different in Examples 3? Or, is it just about symmetry? And, the *colour* change? So maybe all that's important is *the key point* of each pattern. Maybe it's about the shape of the patterns!\n\n**The General Rule Emerges**\n\nBased on the three examples, I have the key rule. To transform the input to the output:\n\n*   **1. Identify key points/patterns in the input.**\n*   **2. Figure out the *shape* of key patterns.**\n*   **3. Determine a shift vector** and change colors of the new pixel. The color change *is not always the same!*\n\n*   The \"shift\" is (-5, 0), *if* the dominant shape is symmetric!\n*   The \"shift\" is (-5, -5), *if* the shape is not symmetric!\n\nSo, I had to find a rule! The shift, it seems, has to do with how the pattern looks (e.g. Is it symmetric? Is there a key coordinate, etc). It's all about how these key points move.\n\n**Test Input Application**\n\nOkay, now let's go! Time to apply this to the test input. It's magenta (6), but, I have to find the pattern. I looked at the magenta pixels and identified V shapes! And, there are a lot of V's. I used\n\nThe objective is to identify the transformation rule from the input to the output grids based on the provided examples and apply it to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of Solved Examples:**\n\n1.  **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** Background is Orange (7). There are Maroon (9) shapes at the bottom (rows 14-16) and one \"L\" shape at the top (rows 3-4). The bottom shapes are three \"V\" patterns (inverted triangles). The peaks of these \"V\"s are at (14,1), (14,7), and (14,14).\n    *   **Output:** New pixels appear in row 9. Specifically at (9,1), (9,7), and (9,14). The pixel at (9,7) is Blue (1), while others are Maroon (9). These positions correspond exactly to shifting the peaks of the \"V\" shapes **up by 5 rows** (Row 14 -> Row 9). The \"L\" shape does not appear to generate a corresponding output in the grid (likely because shifting it up would place it out of bounds).\n    *   **Rule inferred:** Identify \"V\" shapes, take their peak coordinate $(r, c)$, and mark the output at $(r-5, c)$ with Maroon (9) (with a special case for the middle one becoming Blue in this symmetric arrangement).\n\n2.  **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** Background is Orange (7). Black (0) shapes are scattered in the bottom half. These are \"V\" shapes (peaks at 10,1; 12,4; 13,11; 14,1; 14,7) and one at (11,8).\n    *   **Output:** New Maroon (9) pixels appear exactly 5 rows above the peaks of the Black \"V\" shapes. For instance, the peak at (10,1) results in a Maroon pixel at (5,1). The peak at (11,8) results in a Maroon pixel at (6,8).\n    *   **Rule confirmation:** Identify \"V\" shapes, shift their peaks **up by 5 rows** ($r-5$), and place a Maroon (9) pixel.\n\n3.  **Example 3:**\n    *   **Input:** Background is Orange (7). Red (2) \"Gamma\" shapes (2x2 block missing bottom-right).\n    *   **Output:** New Maroon (9) pixels appear. The transformation here is a shift **Up 5 and Left 5** ($r-5, c-5$). For example, a shape at (6,5) produces a pixel at (1,0).\n    *   **Synthesis:** The shift vector depends on the shape type. Symmetric \"V\" shapes pointing up use a vector of $(-5, 0)$. Asymmetric \"Gamma\" shapes pointing top-left use $(-5, -5)$.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Shapes:** The test input contains Magenta (6) shapes on an Orange (7) background. We look for the dominant shape type, which matches the \"V\" shapes from Examples 1 and 2 (a peak pixel on top, with two 'leg' pixels diagonally below).\n    *   Scanning the grid, we find 4 such \"V\" shapes:\n        1.

Inferring the rule from the examples\n\nAll examples have:\n\n- Background color 7\n- One \u201cobject\u201d color (9, 0, or 2)\n- New 9s (and once a 1) being added in otherwise empty areas\n\n### 1.1. The key shape: a \u201cV\u201d of the object color\n\nIn Examples 1 and 2, if you look at the non\u20117 cells, there is a recurring 3\u2011cell pattern shaped like a downward \u201cV\u201d:\n\nPattern (object color `X`):\n\n- Apex at `(r, c)` is `X`\n- Two diagonal neighbors one row below are `X`:\n  - `(r+1, c-1)` = `X`\n  - `(r+1, c+1)` = `X`\n\nExample 2 (color 0):\n\n- At `(10,1)`: `(11,0)` and `(11,2)` are 0 \u21d2 a V\n- At `(11,8)`: `(12,7)` and `(12,9)` are 0 \u21d2 a V\n- At `(12,4)`: `(13,3)` and `(13,5)` are 0 \u21d2 a V\n- At `(13,11)`: `(14,10)` and `(14,12)` are 0 \u21d2 a V\n- At `(14,1)`: `(15,0)` and `(15,2)` are 0 \u21d2 a V\n- At `(14,7)`: `(15,6)` and `(15,8)` are 0 \u21d2 a V\n\nExample 1 (color 9, bottom rows):\n\n- At `(14,1)`: `(15,0)` and `(15,2)` are 9 \u21d2 V\n- At `(14,7)`: `(15,6)` and `(15,8)` are 9 \u21d2 V\n- At `(14,14)`: `(15,13)` and `(15,15)` are 9 \u21d2 V\n\n### 1.2. What happens to each V\n\nFor each such V apex at `(r, c)` in Examples 1 and 2:\n\n- The output places a 9 exactly 5 rows above, same column: at `(r-5, c)`\n\nCheck example 2:\n\n- V at `(10,1)` \u2192 output has 9 at `(5,1)`\n- V at `(11,8)` \u2192 9 at `(6,8)`\n- V at `(12,4)` \u2192 9 at `(7,4)`\n- V at `(13,11)` \u2192 9 at `(8,11)`\n- V at `(14,1)` \u2192 9 at `(9,1)`\n- V at `(14,7)` \u2192 9 at `(9,7)`\n\nEverything else is unchanged.\n\nExample 1:\n\n- V at `(14,1)` \u2192 9 at `(9,1)`\n- V at `(14,7)` \u2192 marker at `(9,7)` (shown as 1 in the example, but structurally it is exactly where a 9 would go)\n- V at `(14,14)` \u2192 9 at `(9,14)`\n\nAgain, all other cells (object cells included) remain as in the input.\n\n### 1.3. Example 3\n\nExample 3 has no such V\u2011patterns of the object color (2); instead it has a different 3\u2011cell \u201cL\u201d pattern, and another layer of behavior. But:\n\n- Our test grid clearly contains V\u2011patterns,\n- And wherever Vs appear in the training set (Examples 1 & 2), they are the motif used for placing 9s, leaving the original object cells unchanged.\n\nSo for the test, we follow the V\u2011pattern rule.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying the rule to the test input\n\n### 2.1. Find all Vs of color 6\n\nObject color in the test is 6. We look for apexes `(r, c)` such that:\n\n- `grid[r][c] == 6`\n- `grid[r+1][c-1] == 6`\n- `grid[r+1][c+1] == 6`\n\nScanning the grid yields these apexes:\n\n1. `(5, 9)`:\n   - `(6,8) = 6` and `(6,10) = 6` \u21d2 V\n2. `(7, 2)`:\n   - `(8,1) = 6` and `(8,3) = 6` \u21d2 V\n3. `(13, 4)`:\n   - `(14,3) = 6` and `(14,5) = 6` \u21d2 V\n4. `(14, 14)`:\n   - `(15,13) = 6` and `(15,15) = 6` \u21d2 V\n\nNo other 6 satisfies the V condition.\n\n### 2.2. Place 9s 5 rows above each V\n\nFor each V apex at `(r, c)`, set output cell `(r-5, c)` to 9:\n\n1. `(5, 9)` \u2192 `(0, 9)` becomes 9\n2. `(7, 2)` \u2192 `(2, 2)` becomes 9\n3. `(13, 4)` \u2192 `(8, 4)` becomes 9\n4. `(14, 14)` \u2192 `(9, 14)` becomes 9\n\nAll other cells are copied from the input unchanged.\n\nNote: In this task, one of the projected positions `(2,2)` was originally 6; by analogy with the training Vs (where there was no overlap constraint given), we still overwrite with 9.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

If an entire L\u2011shape appears again exactly 5 rows down and 5 columns to the right, the upper instance is recoloured to 9 where it overlaps, but that situation does not occur in the test.\n\nScanning the test grid for these patterns, only inverted\u2011V apices are found at (5,9), (7,2), (13,4) and (14,14). Placing 9s five rows above in the same columns yields new 9s at (0,9), (2,2), (8,4) and (9,14). There are no L\u2011corners of the observed orientation, so no other changes are made.

What gets moved / marked?\n\nLooking at examples 1 and 2 (the vertical case):\n\n- For the signal color cells, only **some** of them are used to produce new marks.\n- These \u201cused\u201d signal cells have a clear local property:\n\n> A signal-color cell is a \u201ctip\u201d if, in the **previous row**, neither of its two diagonal neighbors (up-left and up-right) are signal-colored.\n\nFormally, cell at (r, c) is a tip if:\n- grid[r][c] == signalColor, and\n- grid[r-1][c-1] != signalColor (or c == 1), and\n- grid[r-1][c+1] != signalColor (or c == 16).\n\nCheck this on example 2 (signal = 0):\n- The zeros at:\n  - (11,2), (12,9), (13,5), (14,12), (15,2), (15,8)\n  - are exactly those with **no diagonal-zero neighbors above**.\n- These are exactly the ones that produce 9\u2019s in the output.\n\nCheck on example 1 (signal = 9):\n- Among the 9\u2019s, the \u201ctip\u201d ones are:\n  - (4,13), (5,13), (15,2), (15,8), (15,15).\n- Of those, only the ones with r > 5 give in-bounds targets when moved 5 up:\n  - (15,2) \u2192 (10,2)\n  - (15,8) \u2192 (10,8)\n  - (15,15) \u2192 (10,15)\n- These are exactly the three new marks in row 10.\n\n(In example 3 there is also a diagonal variant, but in the test input there are *no* signal-color pairs separated by (5,5), so we only need the **vertical** behavior for this test.)\n\n### c. How are the tips moved?\n\nIn the vertical examples (1 and 2), each chosen \u201ctip\u201d cell at (r, c):\n\n- is mapped to a new mark at **(r - 5, c)** (5 rows upward, same column),\n- as long as r - 5 \u2265 1 (inside the grid).\n\nColor of the new mark:\n- If 9 is not already used as a signal color, use 9 for the marks.\n- In the test, signal color = 6, so we\u2019ll use 9.\n\nWe also allow overwriting existing colors at the target (example 3 shows overwriting of signal color by 9; there is nothing in the training that forbids overwriting).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Apply to the test input (signal color = 6)\n\n### a.

Let's walk through the pattern and apply it to the test case:\n\n**Understanding the Rules:**\n\n1. The rule checks whether there are any rows from row 5 onward (0-indexed) that contain horizontally adjacent non-background cells. If there are none (as in our test), then the transformation is applied with no horizontal shift.\n   \n2. For rows with non-adjacent non-background cells:\n   - If the row is even-numbered: select the first run of non-background cells, then continue selecting runs as long as the gap between consecutive runs is at least 5 columns. Stop if the gap is smaller.\n   - If the row is odd-numbered: select only the rightmost run of non-background cells in that row.\n   - Each selected run is copied upward by 5 rows, in the same column, changing its value to 9.\n   \n3. The bottom row (row 15) isn't involved in the transformation.\n\n**Applying the Rules:**\n\nHere are the runs in the test input and the results after applying the rule:\n\n- **Row 5 (odd):** runs at 9 and 14 \u2192 select 14 \u2192 copy to row 0, col 14.\n- **Row 6 (even):** runs at 8 and 10 \u2192 select 8 \u2192 copy to row 1, col 8.\n- **Row 7 (odd):** run at 2 \u2192 select 2 \u2192 copy to row 2, col 2.\n- **Row 8 (even):** runs at 1 and 3 \u2192 select 1 \u2192 copy to row 3, col 1.\n- **Row 13 (odd):** run at 4 \u2192 select 4 \u2192 copy to row 8, col 4.\n- **Row 14 (even):** runs at 3,5,8,9,14 \u2192 select 3 \u2192 copy to row 9, col 3.\n\nAll copied values are set to 9.\n\n**Final Output Grid:**\n\n```\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"6\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_1_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nTo solve this task we look at how the training examples differ from their inputs. Two distinct mechanisms show up:\n\n* New `9` markers are inserted a fixed 5 rows above certain source rows. The source rows are determined by adjacency in the input: in examples\u202f1 and\u202f2 the marked source cells are those that have a diagonally adjacent cell of the same colour in the following row. In example\u202f3 there are horizontal runs of the same colour; in that case markers are placed for the horizontal run instead, shifted 5 rows up and 5 columns left. If a row contains multiple runs only the left\u2013hand start of each run is marked; if it contains a single run of length 2 both endpoints are marked. Rows that receive such horizontal markers are flagged, and diagonal markers into a flagged row are suppressed.\n\n* The markers do not overwrite existing non\u2011background cells: a candidate diagonal marker is skipped if the target cell is not background. For the horizontal markers we also propagate down one cell: if a horizontal marker lands above an input non\u2011background cell, that cell is turned into a `9` as well.\n\nApplying this combined rule to the test grid, there is one horizontal run at row\u202f14, columns\u202f8\u20139, so we place horizontal markers at row\u202f9, columns\u202f3 and\u202f4. Diagonal adjacencies produce candidates at (0,9), (2,2), (8,4), (9,8) and (9,14); the row\u202f9 candidates are suppressed because row\u202f9 already has horizontal markers, and (2,2) is skipped because it is not background. The remaining diagonal markers go to (0,9) and (8,4). Propagation does not add anything further.\n\nThe final output is therefore the input grid with `9`s inserted at (0,9), (8,4), (9,3) and (9,4):\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"7\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_3_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**ARC Task: Shape Interaction Simulation**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I'm essentially simulating interactions between shapes within a grid.  It seems the user wants me to derive the rules based on examples, and then apply those rules to a test input. I'm focusing on the geometric features and how they relate to the transformation of the grid.  The core idea I'm latching onto is that different shapes act as \"launchers,\" projecting \"projectiles\" that can interact with the grid and other objects.  Shapes also appear to \"fire\" these projectiles by altering some other part of the grid.\n\nAnalyzing the examples, I can see that the grid initially contains a background color (7), some initial objects (the \"launchers\"), and then the output shows the results of these shapes' actions. The shapes come in various forms - Carets, Flags, L-shapes, and some new variants in the test input. Their positions relative to one another in the output can be attributed to each shapes' action - projecting projectiles. Each shape seems to have a predefined \"firing vector\" or direction that determines where its projectile lands. Based on the examples, and my observations, the firing direction seems related to the shape's orientation or asymmetry.\n\nMy current understanding is that each \"launcher\" launches a projectile in a certain direction, based on its shape's defining geometry. This is the core mechanic.  If the projectile lands on an empty space, it leaves a \"projectile\" pixel (color 9). If it hits another object, the object is changed. And if two projectiles collide in the air, a collision event (color 1) is registered. However, the interactions aren't completely direct. There's a 5-row separation that is involved for the most part. Each launcher projects a pixel that will impact at -5 rows and a specific offset based on the launching shape. \n\nIn Example 1, I identified a core pattern: \"caret\" shapes generate an upward-shooting projectile that turns into an altered pixel (9). These shapes don't shift horizontally (their column remains the same), unless there are overlapping projectiles from other shapes. Example 2 demonstrated the same upward firing projectiles. In Example 3, I dealt with flag shapes, which introduced a horizontal displacement (-5 columns) to the projectile's trajectory, leading to a new \"shooting\" pattern. The test input has given me a lot more shapes that behave in a similar fashion.\n\nThe rules I've deduced are:\n1. **Shape Types** The launchers are detected based on the configuration of their base pixels:\n   - Caret (pointy top): shoot straight upwards.\n   - V-Shape: shoot downwards.\n   - Flag (top-left filled): shoot upward-left.\n   - Mirror L (group 1): Shoot bottom-right.\n   - Reverse Flag. Shoot up to the right.\n   - ZigZag: point to the left and shoot in that direction.\n   - L-Shape (Ex 1): points downwards to the left and shoots there.\n2. **Target Calculation:** Determine the projectile's target coordinate based on the launching shape's properties by adding specific row and column offsets.\n3. **Collision & Transformation:** Simulate the \"projectiles\" landing by adding the pixels at the target. This leads to the generation of 9 pixels on all empty spaces. Projectiles can lead to transformations and collisions:\n   - A hit pixel object will become 9\n   - A mid-air collision between two projectiles will become a pixel 1.\n\nI'm confident I can now analyze the test input to find the shapes, generate their respective targets and construct the output grid based on these interactions and the 5 row difference from the source pixels. Let's see if this plays out.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid based on rules inferred from three solved examples. The grids contain various small shapes (objects) made of colors on a background of orange (7).\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification & Classification**: We identify small connected components (\"shapes\") in the grid. Based on their geometry, we classify them as specific types of \"launchers\" that fire projectiles in a specific direction. The offset for all projectiles is 5 steps in the respective cardinal or diagonal direction.\n    *   **Caret (Up-Shooter)**: Shape `^` (e.g., center top, legs bottom). Fires **Up** (row -5, col 0).\n    *   **V-Shape (Down-Shooter)**: Shape `v` (inverted Caret). Fires **Down** (row +5, col 0).\n    *   **Flag (Diagonal-Shooter)**: A 2x2 block with one corner missing.\n        *   If Top-Left filled (Ex 3): Fires **Up-Left** (row -5, col -5).\n        *   If Top-Right filled (Test Input, Group 7): Fires **Up-Right** (row -5, col +5).\n    *   **L-Shape / J-Shape (Diagonal-Shooter)**: A 2x2 block with one corner filled and its two neighbors.\n        *   If L-shaped (Bottom-Left corner): Fires **Down-Left** (row +5, col -5).\n        *   If J-shaped (Bottom-Right corner, Test Input Group 1): Fires **Down-Right** (row +5, col +5).\n    *   **ZigZag (Lateral-Shooter)**: A vertical zig-zag line.\n        *   If pointing Left (`<`): Fires **Left** (row 0, col -5).\n\n2.  **Projectile Logic**:\n    *   For each shape, determine the \"source\" pixel (usually the tip or corner in the direction of fire) and calculate the \"target\" pixel using the offset.\n    *   **Empty Target**: If the target pixel is empty (background 7), a projectile lands there. The color is **Maroon (9)**.\n    *   **Collision**: If two projectiles land on the same empty target pixel, they collide and form a **Blue (1)** pixel.\n    *   **Object Hit**: If a projectile's target lands on an existing object, that object is \"hit\". The entire object changes its color to **Maroon (9)**.\n\n**Application to Test Input**:\n\n*   **Shape 1 (J-Shape)** at `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)`. Fires Down-Right (+5, +5) from `(3,2)` to target **(8,7)**.\n*   **Shape 2 (V-Shape)** at `(2,8), (2,10), (3,9)`. Fires Down (+5, 0) from `(3,9)` to target **(8,9)**.\n*   **Shape 3 (ZigZag)** at `(3,14), (4,13), (5,14)`. Points Left. Fires Left (0, -5) from `(4,13)` to target **(4,8)**.\n*   **Shape 4 (Caret)** at `(5,9), (6,8), (6,10)`. Fires Up (-5, 0) from `(5,9)` to target **(0,9)**.\n*   **Shape 5 (Caret)** at `(7,2), (8,1), (8,3)`. Fires Up (-5, 0) from `(7,2)` to target **(2,2)**.\n    *   Target `(2,2)` is part of Shape 1. **Hit!** Shape 1 turns Maroon (9).\n*   **Shape 6 (Caret)** at `(13,4), (14,3), (14,5)`. Fires Up (-5, 0) from `(13,4)` to target **(8,4)**.\n*   **Shape 7 (Flag-TR)** at `(14,8), (14,9), (15,9)`. Fires Up-Right (-5, +5) from `(14,9)` to target **(9,14)**.\n*   **Shape 8 (Caret)** at `(14,14), (15,13), (15,15)`. Fires Up (-5, 0) from `(14,14)` to target **(9,14)**.\n    *   Shapes 7 and 8 both target `(9,14)`. **Collision!** The pixel at `(9,14)` becomes Blue (1).\n\n**Final Grid Construction**:\n*   Background: 7.\n*   Original Shapes: 6 (Magenta), except Shape 1 which becomes 9 (Maroon).\n*   New Pixels:\n    *   (0,9): 9\n    *   (4,8): 9\n    *   (8,4): 9\n    *   (8,7): 9\n    *   (8,9): 9\n    *   (9,14): 1\n\noutput:\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,6,7,6,9,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"8\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_4_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Problem Decomposition and Pattern Identification**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this ARC problem. The goal is to predict the output grid based on the input and some solved examples. It looks like it's all about identifying shapes and transforming them somehow.  The background color is pretty consistently orange (7), so that\u2019s my baseline.\n\n**Initial Exploration: Example 1**\n\nFirst, I looked at Example 1. I started by noticing two key non-orange patterns: a small \u201cV\u201d shaped triangle and an \u201cL\u201d shape in the grid.  I spent a good amount of time analyzing the coordinates and structure of these shapes, trying to understand how they related to the output. The output grid was tricky because it seemed to add in an extra color, blue (1), that wasn't in the input. And I was stumped as to *why* a given pixel changed to blue or not. At first, I thought there was a -5 offset, which didn't feel right.\n\n**From Triangle Count to Offsets**\n\nThen, I jumped to Example 2. Here, there are triangles and the output seemed consistent, adding a new color. I went through the coordinate analysis here again. I took special care to record the locations of these triangles. Once I was sure that there were shapes, I looked at the output and started noticing a consistent *distance* between the shape and the added color. A -5 offset (upward) was the key.\n\n**Example 3: A Different Shape**\n\nExample 3 was a curveball. The shapes looked different from Example 1, like L-shapes but inverted. The output didn't follow the pattern I initially thought. I spent a long time retracing the logic and trying to find the correspondence between shapes and generated pixels. The addition and offset were still present. I needed a clear way to encode them.\n\n**Refinement: Triangle vs. L-Shape**\n\nLooking at all the examples, I realized there were different \"shapes\" within the grids. It became clear that there were two types of shapes: triangles, which always led to one kind of transformation. Then the L-shapes, with an offset to the left and a color transformation. I had to distinguish each type of shape. It finally started to click: the key was not just identifying the *type* of shape, but also where it was located within the grid. Different shapes, and their orientations, had different offsets, and the pixel creation was based on offset location.\n\n**Decomposing Transformations and Validating**\n\nThe logic boiled down to this: Identify shapes. Then apply the appropriate offset to each shape. The offset depended on the *type* and orientation of the shape. If the projection overlapped an existing shape, that shape changed color!\n\n**Applying the Rules to the Test Input**\n\nWith my rules in place, I moved to the Test Input. First thing I did was re-index my locations to ensure I am using the proper location. I identified the shapes.  I carefully analyzed the Test Input, finding triangles and L-shapes (of different orientations).  I had to pay attention to coordinates very carefully. I applied the transformation rules I derived. I calculated each projected coordinate and marked the change. The shape at (2,2) got hit. The algorithm generated these new pixels, changing certain values in the grid, and drawing new ones.\n\n**Final Touches**\n\nIn the end, all that was left was applying my transformation rules to generate the output, which was a simple matter of going through the input and changing the appropriate values based on my calculations. The final output became clear and I was satisfied.\n\n\nBased on the solved examples, the transformation involves identifying specific shapes in the grid and projecting a \"shadow\" or marker pixel 5 units away in a direction determined by the shape's orientation. If a projection lands on an existing shape, that shape changes color to Maroon (9). If it lands on an empty space, a Maroon (9) pixel is created.\n\n**Rules:**\n1.  **Triangle (Up)**: A symmetric triangle shape pointing up (Tip at top).\n    *   **Projection**: 5 rows UP from the tip. `(r - 5, c)`.\n2.  **Triangle (Left)**: A triangle shape pointing left (Tip at left).\n    *   **Projection**: 5 columns LEFT from the tip. `(r, c - 5)`.\n3.  **L-Shapes (2x2 with one corner missing)**:\n    *   **Missing Top-Right**: Projects **Down-Left**. `(BottomRow + 5, LeftCol - 5)`. (Seen in Ex 1).\n    *   **Missing Bottom-Right**: Projects **Up-Left**. `(TopRow - 5, LeftCol - 5)`. (Seen in Ex 3).\n    *   **Missing Bottom-Left**: Projects **Up-Right**. `(TopRow - 5, LeftCol + 5)`.\n    *   **Missing Top-Left**: Projects **Down-Right**. `(BottomRow + 5, LeftCol + 5)`.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Triangle Up** at `(5, 9)` (Tip).\n    *   Target: `(5 - 5, 9)` = **`(0, 9)`**.\n2.  **Triangle Up** at `(7, 2)` (Tip).\n    *   Target: `(7 - 5, 2)` = **`(2, 2)`**.\n    *   Note: `(2, 2)` is occupied by the L-shape described below. This collision causes the L-shape to turn Maroon (9).\n3.  **Triangle Up** at `(13, 4)` (Tip).\n    *   Target: `(13 - 5, 4)` = **`(8, 4)`**.\n4.  **Triangle Up** at `(14, 14)` (Tip).\n    *   Target: `(14 - 5, 14)` = **`(9, 14)`**.\n5.  **Triangle Left** at `(4, 13)` (Tip). (Base at `(3,14), (5,14)`).\n    *   Target: `(4, 13 - 5)` = **`(4, 8)`**.\n6.  **L-Shape (Missing Top-Left)** at Rows 2-3, Cols 1-2.\n    *   Occupies `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)`.\n    *   Projects Down-Right. Bottom row is 3. Left col is 1.\n    *   Target: `(3 + 5, 1 + 5)` = **`(8, 6)`**.\n    *   **Effect**: This shape is hit by the projection from the Triangle at `(7,2)`. Its pixels `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)` change to **9**.\n7.  **L-Shape (Missing Bottom-Left)** at Rows 14-15, Cols 8-9.\n    *   Occupies `(14,8), (14,9), (15,9)`.\n    *   Projects Up-Right. Top row is 14. Left col is 8.\n    *   Target: `(14 - 5, 8 + 5)` = **`(9, 13)`**.\n\n**Final Changes to Input Grid:**\n*   Pixels at `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)` become **9**.\n*   New pixel **9** at `(0, 9)`.\n*   New pixel **9** at `(4, 8)`.\n*   New pixel **9** at `(8, 4)`.\n*   New pixel **9** at `(8, 6)`.\n*   New pixel **9** at `(9, 13)`.\n*   New pixel **9** at `(9, 14)`.\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,9,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"9\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_3_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n**Example Analysis:**\n\n1. **Example 1**: V-shapes (color 9) at rows 14-15 get markers placed 5 rows above (row 9).

A single L at rows 11-12 (the \"odd\" shape) causes the L-shape at column 8 (13-5=8) to change to color 9.\n\n**Key Rules:**\n- Markers are placed 5 rows above each shape at the shape's center/tip column\n- If there's an \"odd\" shape (different type/orientation), the shape at (odd_col - 5) gets marked differently\n- Original color not 9 \u2192 affected shape changes to 9\n- Original color 9 \u2192 affected marker becomes color 1\n- When a marker position overlaps an existing shape, that shape changes to 9\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n- V-shapes pointing up at rows 5-6 (col 9), 7-8 (col 2), 13-14 (col 4), 14-15 (col 14)\n- V-shape pointing DOWN at rows 2-3 (col 9) - this is the \"odd\" shape\n- L-shapes at rows 2-3 (cols 1-2) and 14-15 (cols 8-9)\n\n**Applying transformation:**\n- V at rows 5-6: marker at (0, 9)\n- V at rows 7-8: marker at (2, 2) \u2192 overlaps with L, so L changes to 9\n- V at rows 13-14: affected by odd V at col 9 (9-5=4), changes to 9\n- V at rows 14-15: marker at (9, 14)\n- L at rows 14-15: marker at (9, 9)\n\n```\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,9,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"10\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_4_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Example 1**: V-shapes at the bottom get markers (9s) placed 5 rows above their tips.

To decide which cells to copy we work in \u201cbands\u201d of five rows directly above the bottommost non\u2011background row, then repeat upward.\n\nWithin a band we take 8\u2011connected components of non\u2011background cells. For each component we decide what to copy up by five rows and left by the global minimum column of any non\u2011background cell:\n\n- If the component occupies only one row in the band, copy only its leftmost cell.\n- If the component spans multiple rows in the band, compare the cell counts in its top row and the next row: if the top row has more cells, copy the whole component; otherwise copy only the top row.\n\nWe then look above the band start to find the next bottommost row with colour and process the next band similarly. New cells are coloured 9 and overwrite existing values.\n\nApplying this to the test grid (global min\u2011col\u202f=\u202f1) yields new 9s at (0,8), (2,1), (8,3), (9,7) and (9,13).

                "response": "**Comprehensive Analysis of ARC Task Candidate Solutions**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown. The task is to audit solutions for an ARC problem. The input is 16x16 grids with an orange background (7). The core seems to be about identifying specific shapes and applying transformations to them. I'm focusing on how each candidate approaches shape identification, the transformation logic, and their overall consistency with the training examples and the test input.\n\nFirst, I established the lay of the land, understanding the task.\n\n**Example Set Analysis:**\nI drilled down into the training data:\n*   **Example 1**: \"V\" shapes shift down. The '1' in the output, I thought, might be crucial. I tried to figure out why one 'V' gets a '1' and other 9s. There's also an L shape.\n*   **Example 2**: More \"V\"s, all 9s in the output. Easy.\n*   **Example 3**: \"Gamma\" shapes shift diagonally up-left. This is where it gets interesting, with all pixels 9.\n\n**Shape Rules:**\nIt looks like \"V\" shapes shift down, but \"Gamma\" shapes have a diagonal shift, but I was unsure why they were different.\n\n**Test Input Analysis**:\nThe key is to use a magenta background this time.\nNow, the test input has these shapes:\n*   \"L\" shape on the top-left (gamma, the missing element to close).\n*   Inverted \"V\" shape.\n*   Regular \"V\" shape.\n*   Another regular \"V\" shape.\n*   More regular \"V\" shape.\n\n**Candidate 0:**\nThis one shifts everything up without paying attention to the shapes. Pretty basic, and it doesn't align with the training data. The main problem is how it treats the diagonal shift.\n\n**Candidate 1:**\nIt's much better. It identifies only the \"V\" shapes and applies the down-shift. It correctly ignores the other ones, but that's potentially too restrictive. It's solid but might miss things.\n\n**Candidate 7 (The Gold Standard):**\nThis is where it gets impressive. This candidate proposes a *simulation* approach. It identifies all of the different shapes and assigns different vectors to them and applies the movement in the Test input to the shapes from the training input. It gets the '1' in Example 1 by postulating an interaction (collision). This candidate is the most general and robust. It's a risk, but it seems well-founded. It can correctly model a new \"flag\" or new shapes.\n\n**Candidate 8:**\nIt tried to generalize, too, but its rule for the flags is slightly off.\n\n**Candidate 1**:\nIt's more conservative than Candidate 7; it maps the easier shapes.\n\n**Re-evaluating the '1':**\nIt's a huge deal. It looks like the interaction (collision) is the correct explanation.\n\n**The \"1\" Problem:**\nHere, I had to really dig into why there's a 1 in example one; I had to go back to the training data.\n\n**Shape Vectors**\n\nShape 7 does:\n\nShape 7 correctly models the shapes in a comprehensive way: It will make the appropriate prediction by including the different features of the test input.\n\n***Candidate 8*** is also good.\n\nThis process highlights the significance of the \"collision\" principle for explaining the number '1' in Example 1. It helps in the generalizability of the solution across the ARC problem. This method provides a clear, rational justification for selecting Candidate 7.\n\n**My rankings:**\n\n1.  Candidate 7: The best, very robust\n2.  Candidate 8: Is an improvement, even with a minor error.\n3.  Candidate 1: Safe and right (but partial).\n4.  Candidate 2: Like Candidate 1.\n5.  Candidate 9: 5.5.\n6.  Candidate 10: 5.0.\n7.  Candidate 0: 3.5.\n8.  Others.\n\nI'm confident in saying that Candidate 7 is a winner.\n\nI was pleased with my analysis, and it shows the importance of careful evaluation for this ARC task, which involves generalizing from examples!\n\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 7,\n      \"score\": 10.0,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"This is the most comprehensive solution.
