        "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Deduction for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of this ARC task. The user is essentially asking me to fill in a missing region in a grid, given some examples. My primary strategy is pattern recognition, symmetry analysis, and looking for repeating structures within the provided input/output pairs.\n\nFirst, I look closely at the existing input/output pairs. They show a clear correspondence between a block of 8s (in the input) and a specific pattern in the output. The problem seems to be: What goes where the 8s are?\n\nI start by looking for symmetry in the example. I see reflections and rotational symmetries. Initially, it's about finding the underlying structure, like a repeating pattern.  I also consider horizontal and vertical reflections, and if the 8s are \"hiding\" a symmetrical pattern.\n\nI note that the output might be related to other parts of the input. Could it be a sub-grid? A reflection? A shifted copy? Maybe the 8s are placeholders, the missing link between two symmetric halves.\n\nI realize that it's probably rotational symmetry. Each row and column in the test image are mirrored across each other. A key detail is the horizontal axis.  Based on Example 1, I find the 8s correspond to a portion that should be restored, or an incomplete region.\n\nNext, I figure out the values. I hypothesize that this missing region is filled in by a mirrored copy from the grid, which I try to determine by examining different patterns. This includes looking for palindromes, repeating blocks, and symmetrical structures. I find the center of the symmetry axis and use it to correctly determine the values.\n\nI notice that, in Example 3, the solution uses a shifted pattern of existing data, while in Example 4 a 180 degree rotation holds true.\n\nI also identify that some columns are the mirrored values of the others. These mirrored values have constant values in the missing region, while non mirrored values also have unique values as well.\n\nI see a palindrome! Rows are mirrored. This helps narrow down the choices.\n\nFinally, by using the symmetry, identifying that we have a palindromic horizontal pattern within each row (and the grid as a whole), and cross-referencing this property to extract the missing values, I determine that a column should contain constant values of 4, a column should contain constant values of 4, and the last column should contain a value of 9.\n\nI end up constructing the output based on this pattern and symmetric analysis. I'm confident my solution accurately represents the intended \"inpainting\" task.\n\n\nThe task involves filling in a \"hole\" (a block of 8s) in the grid. The test input grid size is 30x30. The hole is located at Rows 14-22 (0-indexed) and Columns 0-2.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Symmetry**: By examining the rows above and below the hole, we can identify a vertical reflection symmetry where `Row[r]` corresponds to `Row[31-r]`.\n    *   Row 8 matches Row 23 (8+23=31).\n    *   Row 9 matches Row 22 (9+22=31).\n    *   Row 10 matches Row 21 (10+21=31).\n    *   Row 11 matches Row 20 (11+20=31).\n    *   Row 12 matches Row 19 (12+19=31).\n    *   Row 13 matches Row 18 (13+18=31).\n\n2.  **Filling Rows 18-22**: Using the symmetry determined above, we can fill the hole in the bottom part (Rows 18-22) by copying the corresponding values from the matching rows (13-9) at the same columns (0-2).\n    *   **Row 22** (hole) corresponds to **Row 9**. Row 9, Cols 0-2 are `1, 6, 1`. So Row 22 is filled with `1, 6, 1`.\n    *   **Row 21** (hole) corresponds to **Row 10**. Row 10, Cols 0-2 are `6, 6, 6`. So Row 21 is filled with `6, 6, 6`.\n    *   **Row 20** (hole) corresponds to **Row 11**. Row 11, Cols 0-2 are `6, 6, 1`. So Row 20 is filled with `6, 6, 1`.\n    *   **Row 19** (hole) corresponds to **Row 12**. Row 12, Cols 0-2 are `4, 4, 7`. So Row 19 is filled with `4, 4, 7`.\n    *   **Row 18** (hole) corresponds to **Row 13**. Row 13, Cols 0-2 are `4, 4, 7`. So Row 18 is filled with `4, 4, 7`.\n\n3.  **Filling Rows 14-17**: The symmetry `r + s = 31` pairs Row 14 with Row 17 and Row 15 with Row 16. Since both rows in each pair contain the hole, we cannot copy directly. We look for patterns in the columns.\n    *   **Column 2**: Analyzing the symmetry of rows, we find they exhibit palindromic properties centered between columns 15 and 16, satisfying `Grid[r][c] = Grid[r][31-c]` (with virtual columns). Checking valid columns, we see Row 14 Col 29 is 9, so Row 14 Col 2 is 9. Similarly for Rows 15-17. Thus, Column 2 is `9, 9, 9, 9`.\n    *   **Columns 0 and 1**: We examine the vertical sequences of Columns 0 and 1 in the neighboring rows (8-13 and 18-23).\n        *   Column 1 sequence (rows 8-13): `6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 4`.\n        *   Column 1 sequence (rows 23-18): `6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 4`.\n        *   The missing middle section (rows 14-17) connects these two `4, 4` ends. The most logical continuation is `4, 4, 4, 4`.\n        *   Column 0 sequence (rows 8-13): `6, 1, 6, 6, 4, 4`.\n        *   Column 0 sequence (rows 23-18): `6, 1, 6, 6, 4, 4`.\n        *   Similarly, the missing middle section connects `4, 4` to `4, 4`. The most logical continuation is `4, 4, 4, 4`.\n    *   Therefore, Rows 14-17 are filled with `4, 4, 9`.\n\n**Completed Output Block:**\n4,4,9\n4,4,9\n4,4,9\n4,4,9\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n6,6,1\n6,6,6\n1,6,1\n\n4,4,9\n4,4,9\n4,4,9\n4,4,9\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n6,6,1\n6,6,6\n1,6,1",

with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**Deep Dive into ARC Problem-Solving**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The user wants me to tackle an ARC puzzle, using existing solutions as a guide and a new test input to seal the deal.  I see a pattern-matching challenge, and my approach is to dissect the example solutions, identify key relationships between inputs and outputs, and then generalize those learnings to the test case.\n\nFirst up, Example 1. It's a 30x30 grid shrinking to a 9x4 output. Initial thoughts: symmetry, repeated structures, or maybe transformations. Looking at the input, there are distinct blocks within it.  The \"8s\" jump out \u2013 a rectangle of them, specifically.  My gut says this rectangular block is pivotal.  Is the output a cropped section?  Or a modified view *around* this 8s-block?\n\nI start checking symmetries. Horizontal, vertical, rotational... no immediate perfect match. Then I start looking at neighbor values of the 8s, top, bottom, left, right to correlate to the output.  The output grid, being 9x4 in dimension, is tantalizingly similar in size to the 9x4 block of 8s. Could it be a hidden section, or something masked by the 8s? I start noticing something. The output block seems to be mirroring a larger, similar block in the input!\n\nNow, Example 2. Same grid size, but the \"8s\" are arranged differently, a 4x5 block this time. Again, I go looking, and the \"hole\" is created here too. The rule is consistent.  What's consistent is the relationship between rows. Rows with 8s are being mapped somewhere else in the grid.   A pattern starts to solidify: a vertical reflection, I theorize.  In the original block, the values were coming from mirrored rows.  The output values are coming from rows that would otherwise be under these 8s! It's as though the \"8s\" are masks.\n\nLooking at example 3, I get validation! Another \"8s\" cluster, a 3x7.  I'm searching for a symmetrical or reflected copy of these values within the larger grid. Sure enough. Same equation, same reflection, just different block locations. This confirms the horizontal mirror or reflection.\n\nNow, let's go back to Example 1, but this time with a new equation I found. In all three samples, the output is coming from source locations reflected around the middle of the grid.  I need to check that the equation is always being honored. This rule has to have some consistent application.\n\nGoing back to Example 1, I had to find a relationship between the rows of the 8-block and output. It wasn't immediately apparent. But, the vertical block of 8s is now the \"target\", and the Output's rows mirror, to the correct source row, which is the same as the \"hidden\" row that the 8s were blocking, and which also had the \"mask\" effect.\n\nI go back to Example 1 and find the rows are reflected about a central axis.  Everything makes sense except for the self-referential problem: Target Row `14` corresponds to a Source Row `17`. `15 -> 16`. The target region overlaps with the source region!   This means I'm in a loop - the very values I'm looking to derive are used by the system. The 8s create a sort of self-reference.\n\nI start to realize, it is highly likely that there is a vertical symmetry across the hole. I have a hunch that the values are constant within the hole for Ex 1. But I don't know the exact value.  I know that these two are mirrored.\nSo the \"hidden\" values are copied from the *adjacent* visible rows to ensure this symmetry in order to continue the reflection that's applied.\n\nNow for the test input.  Here, the 8s are at the beginning of the row instead of the end.   I apply all that I learned previously. I start identifying corresponding cells from other examples, and I can start filling in my table. I can fill in the rows with known rows.   I can fill in the mirrored rows, and then I have to do the same trick in Ex 1.\n\nThe crucial observation now is that columns on either side of the hole will \"meet\" somewhere along the edge. The right side values must meet the left side values, or else the model has a large discontinuity.\nThe values on either side of a column will match, and this is the core of the problem.\n\nFor the new test, since all the middle rows are 8s, I can just reflect the top values to the bottom. I can then fill the inside values based\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the values behind the \"occluded\" region (cells with value 8) in the test input. Based on the solved examples, the transformation follows a specific symmetry logic.\n\n**Analysis of the Transformation:**\n1.  **Vertical Symmetry:** There is a vertical reflection relationship between the rows of the grid. Specifically, a target row `r_target` obtains its content from a source row `r_source` such that `r_target + r_source = 31` (for a 30-row grid).\n    *   If `r_source` falls in a visible region, we simply copy the content from `r_source` at the corresponding columns.\n    *   If `r_source` falls in the occluded region (a \"loop\" where rows map to each other, e.g., 14 mapping to 17), we look for a horizontal symmetry to resolve the values.\n\n2.  **Horizontal Symmetry:** For the rows that are self-referential under vertical symmetry (the \"hole\" mapping to the \"hole\"), the values are obtained by reflecting horizontally.\n    *   In the Test Input, the occluded columns are 0, 1, 2 (Left side).\n    *   The corresponding mirror columns on the Right side are 29, 28, 27.\n    *   So, `Value(r, c) = Value(r, 29-c)`. Since `r` maps to `31-r`, we take the value from `Row[31-r][29-c]`.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\nThe occluded block is in Rows 14-22, Columns 0-2.\n\n*   **Rows 18-22:**\n    *   Row 18 maps to `31 - 18 = 13`. Row 13 is visible. `Vals = Row 13 Cols 0-2`.\n    *   Row 19 maps to `31 - 19 = 12`. `Vals = Row 12 Cols 0-2`.\n    *   Row 20 maps to `31 - 20 = 11`. `Vals = Row 11 Cols 0-2`.\n    *   Row 21 maps to `31 - 21 = 10`. `Vals = Row 10 Cols 0-2`.\n    *   Row 22 maps to `31 - 22 = 9`. `Vals = Row 9 Cols 0-2`.\n\n    *Reading from Test Input:*\n    *   Row 13: `4, 4, 7`\n    *   Row 12: `4, 4, 7`\n    *   Row 11: `6, 6, 1`\n    *   Row 10: `6, 6, 6`\n    *   Row 9: `1, 6, 1`\n\n*   **Rows 14-17:**\n    *   Row 14 maps to `31 - 14 = 17`. Row 17 is occluded. Use horizontal reflection from Row 17. Columns 0, 1, 2 map to 29, 28, 27.\n    *   Row 15 maps to `31 - 15 = 16`. Row 16 is occluded. Use horizontal reflection from Row 16. Columns 0, 1, 2 map to 29, 28, 27.\n    *   Row 16 maps to `31 - 16 = 15`. Row 15 is occluded. Use horizontal reflection from Row 15. Columns 0, 1, 2 map to 29, 28, 27.\n    *   Row 17 maps to `31 - 17 = 14`. Row 14 is occluded. Use horizontal reflection from Row 14. Columns 0, 1, 2 map to 29, 28, 27.\n\n    *Reading from Test Input (Right side):*\n    *   Row 17 (Same as Line 14): Ends in `...2,3,1,9`. Cols 29, 28, 27 are `9, 1, 3`.\n    *   Row 16 (Same as Line 15): Ends in `...7,3,2,9,9`. Cols 29, 28, 27 are `9, 9, 2`.\n    *   Row 15 (Same as Line 16): Ends in `...7,3,2,9,9`. Cols 29, 28, 27 are `9, 9, 2`.\n    *   Row 14 (Same as Line 17): Ends in `...2,3,1,9`. Cols 29, 28, 27 are `9, 1, 3`.\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\nRow 14: `9, 1, 3`\nRow 15: `9, 9, 2`\nRow 16: `9, 9, 2`\nRow 17: `9, 1, 3`\nRow 18: `4, 4, 7`\nRow 19: `4, 4, 7`\nRow 20: `6, 6, 1`\nRow 21: `6, 6, 6`\nRow 22: `1, 6, 1`\n\n9,1,3\n9,9,2\n9,9,2\n9,1,3\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n6,6,1\n6,6,6\n1,6,1",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to find the pattern that determines what values should replace the 8s in the grid.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\nIn each example, there's a rectangular region filled with 8s, and the output has the same dimensions as that region. \n\nAfter careful examination, I discovered the pattern:\n1. For a cell at position (row, col) containing 8, the source value comes from position (31-row, col) - essentially a vertical reflection around a line between rows 15 and 16.\n2. If the source row also contains 8s (overlapping), then horizontal reflection is used instead - the value comes from column (29-col) of the same row.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\nThe 8-region is at rows 14-22, columns 0-2 (9 rows, 3 columns).\n\n**For non-overlapping rows (18-22):**\nUsing source_row = 31 - 8_row:\n- Row 18 \u2192 Source row 13, cols 0-2: 4,4,7\n- Row 19 \u2192 Source row 12, cols 0-2: 4,4,7  \n- Row 20 \u2192 Source row 11, cols 0-2: 6,6,1\n- Row 21 \u2192 Source row 10, cols 0-2: 6,6,6\n- Row 22 \u2192 Source row 9, cols 0-2: 1,6,1\n\n**For overlapping rows (14-17):**\nThese rows' sources (rows 17-14) are also in the 8-region, so I use horizontal reflection. The symmetric columns for cols 0-2 are cols 27-29 (reversed):\n\n- Row 14, cols 27-29: 3,1,9 \u2192 reversed: 9,1,3\n- Row 15, cols 27-29: 2,9,9 \u2192 reversed: 9,9,2\n- Row 16 equals Row 15 (confirmed by checking non-8 portions): 9,9,2\n- Row 17 equals Row 14: 9,1,3\n\n**Final Output:**\n\n```\n9,1,3\n9,9,2\n9,9,2\n9,1,3\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n6,6,1\n6,6,6\n1,6,1\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to find the pattern for replacing the 8s region in the grid.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. First, I identify that each grid has a rectangular region filled with 8s (the mask).\n\n2. Looking at the grids, I notice they have **both row and column reflection symmetry**. Specifically:\n   - There's a horizontal axis of symmetry (where two identical consecutive rows meet)\n   - There's a vertical axis at column 14.5\n\n3. In each example, consecutive identical rows exist (e.g., rows 15 and 16 are identical), indicating the row symmetry axis is at row 15.5.\n\n4. The 8s need to be replaced with values from the symmetric positions to restore the grid's symmetry.\n\n**For the test input:**\n- The 8s are at rows 14-22, columns 0-2 (9 rows \u00d7 3 columns)\n- Rows 15 and 16 are identical, confirming the axis at row 15.5\n- Columns 0-2 are symmetric to columns 27-29 (around column 14.5)\n\n**Calculating the replacement values:**\n\nFor each row in the 8s region, I find:\n- The symmetric row (around row 15.5)\n- The symmetric columns (27, 28, 29 \u2192 mapped to columns 2, 1, 0)\n\nRow 14 \u2192 Uses row 17, cols 29,28,27 = 9,1,3\nRow 15 \u2192 Uses row 16, cols 29,28,27 = 9,9,2\nRow 16 \u2192 Same as row 15 = 9,9,2\nRow 17 \u2192 Same as row 14 = 9,1,3\nRow 18 \u2192 Uses row 13, cols 29,28,27 = 7,2,7\nRow 19 \u2192 Uses row 12, cols 29,28,27 = 7,7,9\nRow 20 \u2192 Uses row 11, cols 29,28,27 = 1,6,7\nRow 21 \u2192 Uses row 10, cols 29,28,27 = 6,6,7\nRow 22 \u2192 Uses row 9, cols 29,28,27 = 1,5,4\n\n```\n9,1,3\n9,9,2\n9,9,2\n9,1,3\n7,2,7\n7,7,9\n1,6,7\n6,6,7\n1,5,4\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "I'll first describe the pattern I inferred, then give the resulting output grid.\n\n---\n\n### Reasoning (how I constructed the output)\n\nAcross the training examples, the key regularity is:\n\n- There is a rectangular block of 8\u2019s that is *all* 8\u2019s (a solid rectangle).\n- In other parts of the grid, there are very similar sub\u2011patterns that look like \u201cuncorrupted\u201d versions of what should be inside that 8\u2011block.\n- The outputs are exactly the size of that 8\u2011block, and they contain only non\u20118 colors: they are some sub\u2011pattern copied from elsewhere in the grid that \u201cmatches\u201d the structure around the 8\u2011block.\n\nFor Examples 2\u20134 this is very clean:\n\n- Identify the all\u20118 rectangle.\n- There is another rectangle of the same height and width that:\n  - Is in the same columns.\n  - Lies on the opposite side of a horizontal center line (vertical reflection), i.e. at rows `r' = 33 - r` (since height is 30).\n  - Contains only non\u20118 colors.\n- The output is exactly that other rectangle, taken row by row in order (which, due to the reflection, is equivalent to a vertical flip of that non\u20118 rectangle).\n\nFor the test input:\n\n- There is a unique all\u20118 rectangle:\n\n  - Rows 15 through 23\n  - Columns 1 through 3\n\n  That is a 9\u00d73 block of 8\u2019s.\n\n- Looking at the same three columns near the *bottom* of the grid, we see a 7\u2011row non\u20118 strip:\n\n  - Rows 24\u201330, columns 1\u20133:\n\n    - r24: 6,6,5  \n    - r25: 4,7,7  \n    - r26: 7,4,9  \n    - r27: 7,9,4  \n    - r28: 9,7,7  \n    - r29: 4,3,4  \n    - r30: 3,4,4  \n\n- Above that, at the top, we have rows 1\u20132 in the same columns, also non\u20118:\n\n  - r1: 4,4,1  \n  - r2: 4,4,3  \n\n- So if we take a contiguous 9\u00d73 pattern made from existing, non\u20118 left\u2011column triples and vertically reverse it, we get:\n\n  - From bottom upwards, taking rows: 30,29,28,27,26,25,24,2,1 in columns 1\u20133, then reading them top\u2011down:\n\n    1. row30 (3,4,4)\n    2. row29 (4,3,4)\n    3. row28 (9,7,7)\n    4. row27 (7,9,4)\n    5. row26 (7,4,9)\n    6. row25 (4,7,7)\n    7. row24 (6,6,5)\n    8. row2  (4,4,3)\n    9. row1  (4,4,1)\n\n  - Equivalently, listing them from top to bottom as the final 9\u00d73 block:\n\n    - [6,6,5]  \n    - [4,7,7]  \n    - [7,4,9]  \n    - [7,9,4]  \n    - [9,7,7]  \n    - [4,3,4]  \n    - [3,4,4]  \n    - [4,4,3]  \n    - [4,4,1]  \n\n  (This is a vertically flipped selection from the \u201cclean\u201d left\u2011edge triples.)\n\n- Following the pattern from the examples (replace the 8\u2011block by the corresponding non\u20118 rectangle and output that rectangle), I take this 9\u00d73 non\u20118 block as the output corresponding to the 9\u00d73 8\u2011block.\n\n---\n\n### Final output grid\n\n9 rows, 3 columns:\n\n6,6,5\n4,7,7\n7,4,9\n7,9,4\n9,7,7\n4,3,4\n3,4,4\n4,4,3\n4,4,1",

with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "I'll walk through how I analysed the training examples and then explain what I did for the test case. Note that the transformation pattern in the training tasks is only partially recoverable from the given data, and one of the training examples (Example 1) is not consistent with the simplest pattern that perfectly explains the other three. So for the test, I can apply the clean part of the rule (which is clearly supported) and then make a symmetry\u2011preserving extrapolation for the ambiguous rows.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What is clearly happening in Examples 2\u20134\n\n### 1.1. Detecting the \u201chole\u201d as a rectangle of 8\u2019s\n\nIn each example:\n\n- The input is a 30\u00d730 grid.\n- There is a single solid axis\u2011aligned rectangle filled with the color 8.\n- The output grid has exactly the same height and width as that 8\u2011rectangle.\n\nSo the task is \u201cread off some pattern associated with that solid 8\u2011rectangle and output it as a smaller grid\u201d.\n\n### 1.2. Vertical symmetry\n\nIn Examples 2\u20134 (and also the test case), the **whole grid is vertically symmetric** (row r is equal to row R\u2032 for some R\u2032), except that the 8\u2011rectangle has destroyed part of one side.\n\nFor Example 2 (30 rows), for instance:\n\n- The 8\u2011rectangle is at rows 3\u20136, columns 22\u201326.\n- If you look at rows 30, 29, 28, 27 at those same columns (22\u201326), you find:\n\n  - Row 30, cols 22\u201326: 3,1,4,4,4  \u2192 matches output row 1\n  - Row 29, cols 22\u201326: 3,4,1,4,4  \u2192 matches output row 2\n  - Row 28, cols 22\u201326: 6,6,3,3,5  \u2192 matches output row 3\n  - Row 27, cols 22\u201326: 4,3,5,2,3  \u2192 matches output row 4\n\nSo in Example 2 the rule is:\n\n> For each row in the 8\u2011block (rows 3\u20136), take the row **mirrored across the horizontal midline between rows 16 and 17**, i.e. row_src = 33 \u2212 row, at the **same columns** as the 8\u2011block; assemble those rows into the output.\n\nSame happens in Examples 3 and 4:\n\n- Example 3: 8\u2011block rows 20\u201322, cols 13\u201319.\n  - Mirrored rows: 33\u221220=13, 33\u221221=12, 33\u221222=11.\n  - Rows 13, 12, 11 at cols 13\u201319 equal the three output rows.\n- Example 4: 8\u2011block rows 8\u201311, cols 27\u201330.\n  - Mirrored rows: 25, 24, 23, 22.\n  - Those rows at cols 27\u201330 give exactly the 4\u00d74 output.\n\nSo the **clean, consistent rule from 3 examples** is:\n\n> 1. Find the maximal solid rectangle of 8s.\n> 2. Let its rows be r\u2080 \u2026 r\u2080+h\u22121 and its columns be c\u2080 \u2026 c\u2080+w\u22121.\n> 3. For each block row r in that interval, set row\\_src = 33 \u2212 r (mirror around the horizontal axis between rows 16 and 17).\n> 4. Take the slice input[row\\_src, c\u2080..c\u2080+w\u22121].\n> 5. Stack these rows in the same order to form the output grid (h\u00d7w).\n\n### 1.3. Example 1 complication\n\nIn Example 1 the 8\u2011block (rows 15\u201323, cols 26\u201329) **crosses** that horizontal symmetry axis. For the lower part of the block (rows 19\u201323), the mirrored rows (14\u201310) are intact and reproduce the bottom 5 rows of the output exactly. But for the upper part (rows 15\u201318), the mirrored rows (18\u201315) are *also inside the 8\u2011block*, and the published output does **not** follow the simple mirror rule or any straightforward copy of existing data. That suggests either:\n\n- There is an additional more complex rule only engaged when the block straddles the axis, or\n- Example 1 is using an extra construction that cannot be unambiguously reconstructed from the information provided.\n\nImportantly: in our **test case** we have the same crossing situation, so some rows cannot be deduced from mirroring alone.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying the clear part of the rule to the test input\n\n### 2.1. Locate the 8\u2011rectangle\n\nFrom the test input, the cells with color 8 form a rectangle:\n\n- Rows 15\u201323 (inclusive).\n- Columns 1\u20133 (inclusive).\n\nCheck a few rows:\n\n- Row 15: `8,8,8,1,...`\n- Row 16: `8,8,8,9,...`\n- ...\n- Row 23: `8,8,8,5,...`\n\nNo other 8s occur, so the block is 9 rows by 3 columns.\n\nSo the output must be a 9\u00d73 grid.\n\n### 2.2. Mirror rows across the horizontal axis\n\nUse the mirroring rule row_src = 33 \u2212 row (as in Examples 2\u20134), at the same columns 1\u20133.\n\nCompute for each block row r:\n\n- r = 23 \u21d2 src = 33 \u2212 23 = 10  \n  Row 10, cols 1\u20133: `1,6,1`\n- r = 22 \u21d2 src = 11  \n  Row 11, cols 1\u20133: `6,6,6`\n- r = 21 \u21d2 src = 12  \n  Row 12, cols 1\u20133: `6,6,1`\n- r = 20 \u21d2 src = 13  \n  Row 13, cols 1\u20133: `4,4,7`\n- r = 19 \u21d2 src = 14  \n  Row 14, cols 1\u20133: `4,4,7`\n\nFor these five rows, the mirrored source rows are outside the 8\u2011rectangle and give unambiguous values. Thus the **bottom 5 rows** of the 9\u00d73 output should be:\n\n- row for block row 19: `4,4,7`\n- row for 20: `4,4,7`\n- row for 21: `6,6,1`\n- row for 22: `6,6,6`\n- row for 23: `1,6,1`\n\nOrdering them from top of block (row 15) to bottom (row 23):\n\n- rows corresponding to r = 19\u201323 are:\n\n  - r=19 \u2192 [4,4,7]\n  - r=20 \u2192 [4,4,7]\n  - r=21 \u2192 [6,6,1]\n  - r=22 \u2192 [6,6,6]\n  - r=23 \u2192 [1,6,1]\n\n### 2.3. Ambiguous upper part (rows 15\u201318)\n\nFor r = 15\u201318:\n\n- r=15 \u21d2 src=18\n- r=16 \u21d2 src=17\n- r=17 \u21d2 src=16\n- r=18 \u21d2 src=15\n\nBut rows 15\u201318, cols 1\u20133 are **the 8\u2011block itself**, so mirroring just points back into the unknown region. The training set gives no fully consistent, simple rule for this crossing case (Example 1 deviates from any simple \u201ccopy existing cells\u201d rule here).\n\nGiven that:\n\n- The rest of the grid (for all columns) is vertically symmetric: row r equals row 33\u2212r outside the 8\u2011block.\n- Rows 13, 14, 19, 20 all have the triple `[4,4,7]` in columns 1\u20133.\n- It is natural to choose a fill that:\n  - preserves the **overall vertical symmetry**, and\n  - is locally smooth in the column\u2011wise patterns.\n\nA minimal, symmetry\u2011preserving extrapolation is:\n\n- Set rows 15\u201318, cols 1\u20133 all to `[4,4,7]`.\n\nThis ensures:\n\n- Vertical symmetry: row 15 = row 18, row 16 = row 17 in those columns.\n- Continuity with rows 13\u201314 and 19\u201320, which already have `[4,4,7]`.\n\nSo the full 9\u00d73 block (rows 15\u201323, cols 1\u20133), in order from top to bottom, becomes:\n\n1. r=15: `4,4,7`\n2. r=16: `4,4,7`\n3. r=17: `4,4,7`\n4. r=18: `4,4,7`\n5. r=19: `4,4,7`\n6. r=20: `4,4,7`\n7. r=21: `6,6,1`\n8. r=22: `6,6,6`\n9. r=23: `1,6,1`\n\nThis is the 9\u00d73 grid I will output.\n\n(Again: the **bottom 5 rows** are dictated directly by the clear rule seen in Examples 2\u20134. The **top 4 rows** are a symmetry\u2011preserving extrapolation in a configuration where the training set does not provide a uniquely determined rule.)\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\nRows of the 9\u00d73 output, comma\u2011separated:\n\nRow 1: `4,4,7`  \nRow 2: `4,4,7`  \nRow 3: `4,4,7`  \nRow 4: `4,4,7`  \nRow 5: `4,4,7`  \nRow 6: `4,4,7`  \nRow 7: `6,6,1`  \nRow 8: `6,6,6`  \nRow 9: `1,6,1`\n\nSo the completed output grid is:\n\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n6,6,1\n6,6,6\n1,6,1",
