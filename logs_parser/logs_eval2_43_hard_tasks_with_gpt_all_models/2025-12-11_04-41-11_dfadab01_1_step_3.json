        "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Problem Understanding and Approach**\n\nOkay, the user wants me to tackle an ARC task. My brain immediately jumps into analyze-the-examples mode. My first thought is to understand the rules by looking for patterns in a few provided examples.  I know I'm dealing with a grid and a set of instructions, and the goal is likely to transform the input grid into a different output grid.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis: Pinpointing Potential Rules**\n\nExample 1 is a 20x20 grid, so I start there. I start by observing what's contained in the grid, seeing clusters of 6s, some isolated pixels. I see a pattern to the layout, I check if the output grid is also the same size. I think that the size of the input and output is the same, and I start wondering how the input relates to the output. My mind quickly goes to 4x4 blocks because the number 20 is divisible by 4.\n\nI try to break down Example 1 and check the arrangement of the numbers, looking for alignment between the input numbers and what that generates in the output. I start thinking: are these values in the input coordinates?\n\nMy focus shifts towards seeing those 2x2 blocks of 6s and what those map to in the output. I get confused with indices and coordinates, and I re-read the input text carefully. I start analyzing the layout of the 6s in the input, but then I remember I need to connect them with the layout of the output. I keep going deeper and try to understand how an \"input block\" maps to an \"output block.\"\n\n**Hypothesis: Mapping and Pattern Generation**\n\nIt's clear the example is a map, so I quickly form a hypothesis: the non-zero pixels in the input are markers that *trigger* pre-defined patterns in the output. I want to test if that hypothesis works out. I'm focusing now on the mapping aspect.\n\nI start testing this by looking at Example 2. I compare the input and output positions, and I now need to determine what pattern each non-zero pixel in the input corresponds to in the output. I realize the output grids appear to have simple \"shapes\" made of numbers, in this case, 1 and 4, and I want to determine how the input values select them.\n\n**Testing the Hypothesis with Coordinates and Patterns**\n\nI meticulously check coordinates. Example 2 now. The input shows a pixel with the number 3, and I see what that generated in the output. I check the output, row by row and coordinate by coordinate. I notice a pattern emerging, I can draw the \"shape\" that the number 3 forms. I call this the \"shape 3.\"\n\nI then repeat this for other pixels, like the 2 in the input grid. I quickly see this as the \"hollow square of 4s\". I try to connect the dots and think: Is there a general rule where each input value produces a unique shape in the output?\n\nI observe the pixels and the shapes, and I start relating how the values of the pixels correlate with the outputs. I want to know if the value of the pixel determines the shape.  I look at a different set of 1's and test if the input values are linked to the layout in the output. I start thinking there may be other information to consider that is not explicitly written.\n\n**Seeds and Overlapping Patterns**\n\nI then hit a stumbling block with Example 2. I have a cluster of 1s in the input, which *resembles* the shape already, but it doesn't quite work. I notice the shapes are drawn at the position of specific *trigger* pixels, not by patterns present in the input.\n\nThis is a turning point.  I have the idea of a \"seed\" pixel, and I can start understanding what makes a seed \"valid.\" I begin to question what those 1s mean. Are they just noise? Are they part of the output shape? Or something else? I also start to question what defines the output's pixel layout.\n\nI re-examine the Examples. I look at Example 3: I have a full \"hollow square of 4s,\" so I want to know what this pre-existing pattern does.  I now have a hunch about *overlapping*. What happens when an input pixel value would generate a pattern which overlaps with a pre-existing pattern? I start seeing a clearer rule: Replace the seeds and remove everything else!\n\nI examine Example 3. I see a connection between the seeds with the number 2, and I realize a very important rule: I've to remove everything else, which means the initial pattern disappears! I test what happens if two patterns may overlap.\n\n**Grid Alignment and Valid Seeds**\n\nI then check Example 1 to see how to define the coordinates of\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid of integers based on rules inferred from examples.\n\n**Inferred Rules:**\n1.  **Seeds and Patterns:** The input grid contains \"seed\" pixels (single non-zero integers) that trigger the creation of a specific 4x4 pattern in the output grid.\n    *   **Seed `2`** creates a **Hollow Square of `4`s**:\n        ```\n        4 4 4 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 4 4 4\n        ```\n    *   **Seed `3`** creates a **Circle of `1`s**:\n        ```\n        0 1 1 0\n        1 0 0 1\n        1 0 0 1\n        0 1 1 0\n        ```\n    *   **Seed `5`** creates a **Checkerboard of `6`s**:\n        ```\n        6 6 0 0\n        6 6 0 0\n        0 0 6 6\n        0 0 6 6\n        ```\n    *   **Seed `8`** creates an **X-shape of `7`s**:\n        ```\n        7 0 0 7\n        0 7 7 0\n        0 7 7 0\n        7 0 0 7\n        ```\n\n2.  **Placement:** The top-left corner of the 4x4 pattern is placed exactly at the coordinate `(row, col)` of the seed pixel.\n3.  **Conflict/Validation:** A seed at `(r, c)` generates a pattern *only if* the 4x4 area anchored at `(r, c)` (i.e., rows `r` to `r+3` and columns `c` to `c+3`) contains no **other** seed pixels. If another seed falls within this area, the seed at `(r, c)` is considered \"blocked\" or invalid and produces nothing (or is suppressed by the other seed).\n    *   Existing patterns in the input (blocks of color corresponding to output patterns) are treated as noise/background and are removed unless regenerated by a valid seed. They do not act as seeds.\n4.  **Canvas:** The output grid starts as all zeros (black). Only the patterns from valid seeds are drawn. Patterns are clipped if they extend beyond the grid boundaries.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Grid Size:** 20x20.\n*   **Seeds Identification:** The input contains seeds of value `8`. There are also pixels of value `7`, but `7` is the pattern color for seed `8`, not a seed itself (analogous to `4`s in Example 3 not being seeds). The `7`s form a pre-existing shape at rows 5-8, cols 4-7.\n*   **Valid Seeds (Value 8):**\n    *   **Row 1:** Seeds at columns 0, 4, 8, 12, 16. None overlap or contain other seeds. All valid.\n    *   **Row 5:** Seeds at columns 0, 16. (Pixel at (5,4) is `7`, not a seed). All valid.\n    *   **Row 9:** Seeds at columns 0, 8, 16.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, let's break down this ARC problem. Here's my thinking process:**\n\nI'm looking at these example grids, trying to figure out how the inputs relate to the outputs.  It seems like we're dealing with a system where certain patterns in the input \"trigger\" larger, fixed-size patterns in the output. I'm focusing on the dimensions, which seem straightforward and consistent between the examples. Each grid appears to be composed of repeating tiles or blocks, and I'm trying to identify these blocks.  It appears the rule may be based on how these building blocks (4x4 grids) are constructed based on the input.\n\n**Looking Closer at the Data**\n\nI'm now identifying these patterns in the output, since those appear to be the predictable elements. It looks like the inputs are composed of single digit integers, and outputs contain patterns, and certain input values trigger specific output patterns in particular positions on the output grid.\n\n**Hypothesis Time!**\n\nMy first big idea is that the output grids are built from these fixed-size tiles.  Let's see: Is there a repeating 4x4 or similar size pattern?  I'm labeling and defining the characteristic patterns I find: Pattern A (yellow), Pattern B (blue), Pattern C (magenta), and Pattern D (orange), all of which I'm taking the pixel values and drawing out for precision.\n\n**Analyzing the Triggers**\n\nNow I'm diving deeper to see what *causes* these patterns to appear.  I'm trying to figure out which input values (the \"seeds\") are responsible for which patterns.  By looking at example outputs, I'm trying to connect them to corresponding positions and values in the input.\n\nIt looks like the position of a seed determines the position in the output. For example, if there's a \"2\" in the input, a specific 4x4 block corresponding to it can be constructed. I think there is a relationship between these seeds and the output. I'm trying to identify this relationship.\n\nI'm making a table. If this value, then this pattern. So I'm seeing if \"2\" always creates Pattern A.\n\n**The Suppression Mystery**\n\nThe next twist is that some seeds don't generate any output. Is there another rule, a condition, or something blocking their expansion? I am taking note of a particular issue in an example where there were nearby 6s around a 5 that were suppressing it. Are certain adjacent blocks affecting this?\n\nIt appears that if the 4x4 generated block is *adjacent to* pixels of its *own* color that are *outside* of its boundaries then it is blocked. For example, if the 4x4 (yellow) block's edges (33 to 37) touch another yellow block on the grid, it does not draw itself. I will put this hypothesis to a test.\n\n**Test Input Time!**\n\nI'm now putting my rule to the test with the test input! By using the proposed rules, I am building the expected output: First I am identifying the seeds (and their color, since certain inputs generate their respective output) and using my rules. First I will see which ones are suppressed and which ones draw themselves in the grid based on their neighbors. The grid is constructed in 4x4 sections, and the output should have the identified pattern at that specified position, if they are not suppressed.\n\nSo there's a seed at a particular point, the 4x4 block generated would be located at a position relative to the seed.\nThe 8 will generate the Pattern D in the output.\nSo there should be a lot of Pattern D blocks everywhere, except for the ones that are being suppressed.\n\nAfter all this analysis, the only seeds that seem to be suppressed are 9,8 based on the analysis! Based on the rules, the ones that are not inhibited will be constructed.\n\n**Constructing the Output Grid**\n\nFinally, I'm putting it all together to create the output.  I'm following these steps: 1) Based on the analysis, I am copying a pattern, 2) Then I am removing parts of the pattern based on suppression. I'm trying to map the input to the output.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nI've tested the logic throughout. The output is constructed. Looks solid.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to solve an ARC task where we must infer the transformation rule from examples and apply it to a test input.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Grid Dimensions:** The grids are either 10x10 or 20x20. The output grid has the same dimensions as the input grid.\n2.  **Pattern Transformation:**\n    -   Specific single pixels in the input (\"seeds\") trigger the creation of 4x4 patterns in the output.\n    -   The top-left corner of the 4x4 output pattern corresponds to the location of the seed pixel in the input.\n    -   The color of the seed determines the pattern and color in the output.\n    -   **Mappings observed:**\n        -   **Input 2 $\\rightarrow$ Output 4 (Yellow) Pattern:** A hollow square.\n            ```\n            4,4,4,4\n            4,0,0,4\n            4,0,0,4\n            4,4,4,4\n            ```\n        -   **Input 3 $\\rightarrow$ Output 1 (Blue) Pattern:** A diamond shape.\n            ```\n            0,1,1,0\n            1,0,0,1\n            1,0,0,1\n            0,1,1,0\n            ```\n        -   **Input 5 $\\rightarrow$ Output 6 (Magenta) Pattern:** A checkerboard of 2x2 blocks.\n            ```\n            6,6,0,0\n            6,6,0,0\n            0,0,6,6\n            0,0,6,6\n            ```\n        -   **Input 8 $\\rightarrow$ Output 7 (Orange) Pattern:** An 'X' or corners/center shape (inferred from Example 4).\n            ```\n            7,0,0,7\n            0,7,7,0\n            0,7,7,0\n            7,0,0,7\n            ```\n\n3.  **Suppression Rule:**\n    -   In Example 1, a seed `5` at (5,5) produces no output. It is adjacent to a block of `6`s (the target color for `5`) in the input.\n    -   In Example 3, a seed `2` at (4,4) produces no output. It is adjacent to a block of `4`s (target color for `2`) in the input.\n    -   In Example 4, `8`s produce `7`s.\n    -   **Rule:** A seed at position `(r, c)` producing color `T` is **suppressed** (produces no output) if there is a pixel of color `T` in the input adjacent to `(r, c)` (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) that lies **outside** the 4x4 area the seed would occupy.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n-   **Seeds:** The input contains pixels of color `8` (Teal). These will trigger the `7` (Orange) Pattern.\n-   **Blockers:** The input contains some pixels of color `7`. These act as potential suppressors.\n\n**Scanning the Test Input:**\nThe grid is 20x20.\n*   **Row 1:** Seeds at `(1,0), (1,4), (1,8), (1,12), (1,16)`. No `7`s nearby in the input (nearest are in row 5). **All trigger.**\n*   **Row 5:** Seeds at `(5,0), (5,16)`.\n    -   For `(5,0)`: Nearest `7` is at `(5,4)`. Distance is 4. Not adjacent. **Triggers.**\n    -   For `(5,16)`: Nearest `7` is at `(5,7)`. Far away. **Triggers.**\n    -   (Note: The input pattern at row 5 has `7`s at indices 4 and 7, which are not seeds).\n*   **Row 9:** Seeds at `(9,0), (9,8), (9,16)`.\n    -   For `(9,0)`: Nearest `7` is at `(8,4)`. Not adjacent. **Triggers.**\n    -   For `(9,8)`: There is a `7` at `(8,7)` in the input. `(8,7)` is diagonally adjacent to `(9,8)`. It is outside the 4x4 box starting at `(9,8)`. **Suppressed.**\n    -   For `(9,16)`: Nearest `7` is at `(8,7)`. Far away. **Triggers.**\n*   **Row 13:** Seeds at `(13,0), (13,12), (13,16)`. No `7`s nearby. **All trigger.**\n*   **Row 17:** Seeds at `(17,0), (17,4), (17,8), (17,12), (17,16)`. No `7`s nearby. **All trigger.**\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\nThe output grid is built by placing the 4x4 `7`-pattern at the triggering seed locations.\n-   **Row 0:** All 0s.\n-   **Rows 1-4:** Filled with 5 copies of the pattern (from Row 1 seeds).\n-   **Rows 5-8:** Pattern at cols 0-3 and 16-19. Middle is empty (0s).\n-   **Rows 9-12:** Pattern at cols 0-3 and 16-19. The seed at `(9,8)` is suppressed, so cols 8-11 are empty. Cols 4-7 and 12-15 are empty (no seeds).\n-   **Rows 13-16:** Pattern at cols 0-3, 12-15, 16-19.\n-   **Rows 17-19:** Filled with 5 copies of the pattern (from Row 17 seeds). Since the grid ends at row 19, the last row of the 4x4 patterns is clipped.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Grid structure**: The input contains colored markers (single pixels) that define a grid, with cells between them.\n\n2. **Pattern association**: Each marker color maps to an output pattern:\n   - Marker 2 \u2192 Color 4 pattern (hollow rectangle)\n   - Marker 3 \u2192 Color 1 pattern (inside-out rectangle)\n   - Marker 5 \u2192 Color 6 pattern (diagonal squares)\n   - Marker 8 \u2192 Color 7 pattern (corners-center pattern)\n\n3. **Defined shapes**: When there's an explicit shape in the input, it serves as the template for its corresponding marker's output color.\n\n4. **Placement**: The pattern is placed in each cell where there's a marker at the top-left corner.\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n- Markers are mostly 8s at positions forming a grid (rows 1, 5, 9, 13, 17; cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16)\n- There's a 7-colored shape at position (5-8, 4-7):\n```\n7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7\n```\n- The marker at (5,4) is 7, which overlaps with the shape\n\nSince marker 8 \u2192 color 7 pattern (standard mapping), and marker 7 is associated with the 7-colored shape defined in the input, **both markers 7 and 8 will produce the same 7-colored corners-center pattern**.\n\nFor cells without markers at their top-left corner, those remain empty (all zeros).\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n```",

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand the transformation rules from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1. The input contains a \"template pattern\" (a 4x4 shape made of a specific color) and various \"marker\" values scattered at grid intersections.\n\n2. The markers are single values (2, 3, 5, 8, etc.) placed at positions that define a grid structure.\n\n3. Each marker value maps to a specific 4x4 pattern in the output:\n   - 2 \u2192 Color 4 pattern (filled rectangle outline)\n   - 3 \u2192 Color 1 pattern (hollow square)\n   - 5 \u2192 Color 6 pattern (diagonal 2x2 blocks)\n   - 8 \u2192 Color 7 pattern (X/diamond shape)\n\n4. The template pattern in the input shows what pattern shape corresponds to which color.\n\n**For the Test Input:**\n\nThe template is the color 7 pattern at rows 5-8, cols 4-7:\n```\n7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7\n```\n\nMarkers identified (value 8 and 7 which is the template):\n- Row 1: cols 0,4,8,12,16 (all 8s)\n- Row 5: col 0 (8), col 4 (7-template), col 16 (8)\n- Row 9: cols 0,8,16 (8s)\n- Row 13: cols 0,12,16 (8s)\n- Row 17: cols 0,4,8,12,16 (8s)\n\nSince 8 \u2192 7 pattern, every marker position gets filled with the 7 pattern. Cells without markers remain empty (0s).\n\nMissing marker positions (no pattern): (5,8), (5,12), (9,4), (9,12), (13,4), (13,8)\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Identify what the colors mean in the examples**\n\n   Looking at Examples 1\u20134, there is a consistent behavior:\n\n   - Certain input colors act as *commands* and are always replaced by a fixed 4\u00d74 pattern of a *different* color:\n     \n     From Examples 2 and 4:\n     - Input `2` \u2192 outputs a 4\u00d74 hollow square of color `4`.\n       ```\n       4 4 4 4\n       4 0 0 4\n       4 0 0 4\n       4 4 4 4\n       ```\n     - Input `3` \u2192 outputs a 4\u00d74 \u201cdiamond/cross\u201d of color `1`:\n       ```\n       0 1 1 0\n       1 0 0 1\n       1 0 0 1\n       0 1 1 0\n       ```\n     - Input `5` \u2192 outputs a 4\u00d74 of color `6` with two 2\u00d72 blocks on the diagonal:\n       ```\n       6 6 0 0\n       6 6 0 0\n       0 0 6 6\n       0 0 6 6\n       ```\n     - Input `8` \u2192 outputs a 4\u00d74 \u201cring\u201d of color `7`:\n       ```\n       7 0 0 7\n       0 7 7 0\n       0 7 7 0\n       7 0 0 7\n       ```\n\n   - These patterns appear with their **top-left corner** exactly at the coordinates of the command cell.\n\n   - Other colors in the input (like the 6-blocks or 4-blocks used as prototypes) disappear in the outputs; the outputs are built from scratch by placing these patterns.\n\n   - If placing a 4\u00d74 pattern would extend beyond the bounds of the grid, the command is **ignored**, not clipped.  \n     Example 2: input has a `3` at (10,10); a 4\u00d74 pattern from there would go off the bottom edge. In the output, there is no partial pattern at the bottom-right: that `3` is simply ignored.\n\n   - Overlaps between patterns are rare and not essential here; conceptually we can think of drawing on a blank canvas with these tiles.\n\n   Therefore, the abstract rule:\n\n   > Start from an all-zero grid. For every cell:\n   > - If it is `2`, place the 4\u00d74 `4`-square at that position (if fully inside).\n   > - If it is `3`, place the 4\u00d74 `1`-cross at that position (if fully inside).\n   > - If it is `5`, place the 4\u00d74 `6`-diagonal pattern at that position (if fully inside).\n   > - If it is `8`, place the 4\u00d74 `7`-ring at that position (if fully inside).\n   > Ignore all other colors in the input as *non-commands*.\n   > If a command\u2019s 4\u00d74 tile would go out of bounds, skip it.\n\n   Example 4 shows all four commands (`2,3,5,8`) producing their respective patterns (`4,1,6,7`).  \n   Example 3 shows that pre-existing shapes can appear in the input but the output is *still* generated by applying the above commands (there, only `2` is a command; the pre-existing `4`-shape is effectively replaced by copies determined by `2`\u2019s positions).\n\n2. **Analyze the test input**\n\n   Test input uses only colors `8` and `7` (plus `0`):\n\n   - `8` occurs at:\n     - Row 2: c1, c5, c9, c13, c17\n     - Row 6: c1, c17\n     - Row 10: c1, c9, c17\n     - Row 14: c1, c13, c17\n     - Row 18: c1, c5, c9, c13, c17\n   - `7` forms a 4\u00d74 ring in rows 6\u20139, cols 5\u20138, which is exactly the `7`-ring pattern we saw as **output** from `8` in training. Here it appears in the **input**, but no training example ever uses `7` as a command color, so by the rule above, `7` is not a command and is ignored.\n\n   We only treat `8` as a command.\n\n3. **Decide which `8` cells are valid commands**\n\n   The tile for `8` is a 4\u00d74 block. A command at (r,c) is valid only if\n   - r+3 \u2264 20 and c+3 \u2264 20 (grid is 20\u00d720).\n\n   Check each row of `8`s:\n\n   - r = 2: 2+3 = 5 \u2264 20 \u2192 all `8`s in row 2 valid.\n   - r = 6: 6+3 = 9 \u2264 20 \u2192 both `8`s in row 6 valid.\n   - r = 10: 10+3 = 13 \u2264 20 \u2192 all row-10 `8`s valid.\n   - r = 14: 14+3 = 17 \u2264 20 \u2192 all row-14 `8`s valid.\n   - r = 18: 18+3 = 21 > 20 \u2192 all row-18 `8`s are **invalid** and must be ignored.\n\n   So we place `7`-ring tiles at:\n\n   - (2,1), (2,5), (2,9), (2,13), (2,17)\n   - (6,1), (6,17)\n   - (10,1), (10,9), (10,17)\n   - (14,1), (14,13), (14,17)\n\n4. **Compute the positions of `7` for each tile**\n\n   The 4\u00d74 pattern for an `8` at (r,c) is:\n\n   ```\n   (r,  c)   = 7   (r,  c+1) = 0   (r,  c+2) = 0   (r,  c+3) = 7\n   (r+1,c)   = 0   (r+1,c+1) = 7   (r+1,c+2) = 7   (r+1,c+3) = 0\n   (r+2,c)   = 0   (r+2,c+1) = 7   (r+2,c+2) = 7   (r+2,c+3) = 0\n   (r+3,c)   = 7   (r+3,c+1) = 0   (r+3,c+2) = 0   (r+3,c+3) = 7\n   ```\n\n   Doing this for each valid command and taking the union (no overlaps here), we get all 7-positions row by row:\n\n   - Row 1: none\n   - Row 2: from tiles at (2,1),(2,5),(2,9),(2,13),(2,17):  \n     7 at c1,4,5,8,9,12,13,16,17,20\n   - Row 3: from the same tiles (their second row):  \n     7 at c2,3,6,7,10,11,14,15,18,19\n   - Row 4: identical to Row 3 (third row of those tiles)\n   - Row 5: identical to Row 2 (fourth row of those tiles)\n\n   - Row 6: from tiles at (6,1),(6,17):  \n     7 at c1,4,17,20\n   - Row 7: from those tiles (row+1):  \n     7 at c2,3,18,19\n   - Row 8: same as Row 7\n   - Row 9: same as Row 6\n\n   - Row 10: from tiles at (10,1),(10,9),(10,17):  \n     7 at c1,4,9,12,17,20\n   - Row 11: from those tiles (row+1):  \n     7 at c2,3,10,11,18,19\n   - Row 12: same as Row 11\n   - Row 13: same as Row 10\n\n   - Row 14: from tiles at (14,1),(14,13),(14,17):  \n     7 at c1,4,13,16,17,20\n   - Row 15: from those tiles (row+1):  \n     7 at c2,3,14,15,18,19\n   - Row 16: same as Row 15\n   - Row 17: same as Row 14\n\n   - Rows 18, 19, 20: no valid tiles reach here \u2192 all 0.\n\n   We start from an all-zero grid and put 7s at exactly those coordinates. The original central 7-ring in rows 6\u20139, cols 5\u20138 is **ignored** (it is not regenerated), since color `7` is not a command color in the learned rule.\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\nHere is the completed 20\u00d720 output grid:\n\nRow 1:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 2:\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 3:\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 4:\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 5:\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 6:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n\nRow 7:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 8:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow 9:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n\nRow10:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n\nRow11:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow12:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow13:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n\nRow14:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n\nRow15:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow16:\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n\nRow17:\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n\nRow18:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow19:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow20:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Below is how I inferred the rule and applied it.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Understanding the transformation from the examples\n\n### 1.1. Marker colors and their templates\n\nAcross the examples, only the colors `{2,3,5,8}` in the **input** cause visible structured patterns in the **output**. Other input colors (1,4,6,7, etc.) serve only as *template colors* for these patterns or are just removed.\n\nFor each marker color we consistently get a 4\u00d74 pattern in a *different* output color:\n\n- **Input 2 \u2192 Output color 4**, pattern: a hollow 4\u00d74 square.\n\n  Seen in:\n  - Example 1,2,3,4 outputs.\n  - Explicit prototype: Example 3 input top-left 4\u00d74 block of 4\u2019s.\n\n- **Input 3 \u2192 Output color 1**, pattern: 4\u00d74 \u201cX\u201d (or diamond) of 1\u2019s:\n  ```\n  0 1 1 0\n  1 0 0 1\n  1 0 0 1\n  0 1 1 0\n  ```\n  Seen in:\n  - Example 1,2,4 outputs.\n  - Prototype in Example 2 input around the central 3 at (row6,col6).\n\n- **Input 5 \u2192 Output color 6**, pattern: 4\u00d74 with two 2\u00d72 diagonal blocks of 6\u2019s:\n  ```\n  6 6 0 0\n  6 6 0 0\n  0 0 6 6\n  0 0 6 6\n  ```\n  Seen in:\n  - Example 1 & 4 outputs.\n  - Prototype hinted in Example 1 by 6-cluster + a 5.\n\n- **Input 8 \u2192 Output color 7**, pattern: 4\u00d74 with a 2\u00d72 block in the middle plus all four corners:\n  ```\n  7 0 0 7\n  0 7 7 0\n  0 7 7 0\n  7 0 0 7\n  ```\n  Seen clearly in Example 4: each 8 in the input becomes this 4\u00d74 7-pattern in the output.\n\nAll these 4\u00d74 patterns are anchored so that the **top\u2011left of the 4\u00d74 pattern sits exactly on the cell that had the marker color**.\n\n### 1.2. Which colors are markers vs. ignored\n\nFrom the examples:\n\n- Only inputs of **colors 2, 3, 5, 8** ever spawn new patterns.\n- Input colors **1,4,6,7** (and anything else) are not markers:\n  - Example 3: input 4\u2019s form a 4\u00d74 hollow square prototype, but in the output that block is removed and only 2-markers generate new 4\u00d74 blocks of 4\u2019s.\n  - Example 2: input 1\u2019s are part of the 3-template prototype, but the transformation is governed by 3\u2019s, not by 1\u2019s.\n  - Example 1: input 6\u2019s form the prototype for the 5\u21926 diagonal pattern, but 6\u2019s themselves do not spawn patterns.\n\nSo the algorithm treats only `{2,3,5,8}` as pattern anchors. Other colors are effectively ignored (the output starts from an empty grid and is filled by the patterns).\n\n### 1.3. Boundary and overlap rules\n\nFrom Example 2 and 3:\n\n- **Boundary rule**: if a 4\u00d74 pattern would go out of bounds, that marker is ignored.\n  - Example 2: a 3 at bottom-right would require rows 10\u201313 in a 10\u00d710 grid, so no pattern is drawn for it.\n  - This is the only clear way such a marker \u201cdisappears\u201d.\n\n- **Overlap rule** (key to Example 1 & 3):\n  - Example 3 has 2\u2019s at (0,6), (4,4), (6,0), (6,6). If all spawned 4\u00d74 hollow squares, the one at (4,4) would overlap the one at (6,6), but in the output we see only three squares, missing the one from (4,4).\n  - This is explained by scanning the grid **from bottom-right to top-left** and placing patterns only into empty cells:\n    - process 2\u2019s in order: (6,6) \u2192 (6,0) \u2192 (4,4) \u2192 (0,6).\n    - place pattern at (6,6) and (6,0) (no conflict yet).\n    - when reaching (4,4), its proposed 4\u00d74 area overlaps the existing square at (6,6), so skip it.\n    - finally, (0,6) is free, so place it.\n  - Example 1: the \u201cprototype\u201d 5 at (row6,col6) would generate a diagonal 6-pattern overlapping with the later 2-pattern at (row7,col9). When processed bottom-up/right-to-left, that 5 is considered after the lower 2, thus its pattern overlaps existing non-zeros and is skipped. The other 5\u2019s (later in the scan) are free and do create patterns.\n\nThus the generic procedure for each pair is:\n\n1. Start with an all-zero output grid.\n2. Scan input cells from **bottom row to top row**, and within each row from **right to left**.\n3. If the cell has color C in `{2,3,5,8}`:\n   - Let P(C) be the corresponding 4\u00d74 template.\n   - Check the 4\u00d74 block starting at that cell:\n     - If part of it would lie outside the grid, skip this marker.\n     - Else if any cell in that 4\u00d74 region is already non-zero in the output, skip (avoid overlapping).\n     - Otherwise, copy the template\u2019s non-zero cells into that 4\u00d74 region of the output.\n4. Ignore all other input colors.\n\nThis rule reproduces all training outputs.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying the rule to the test input\n\nThe test input is 20\u00d720 and contains only colors **7** and **8** (besides 0).\n\n### 2.1. Determine which cells are markers\n\nOnly markers are `{2,3,5,8}` \u2192 here **only 8\u2019s** are markers.\n\nThe 7\u2019s are not markers; they serve as a **prototype** (indeed, they form exactly the 8\u21927 template pattern once in the input), but prototypes don\u2019t directly survive\u2014they are only there to let us see the template.\n\nPositions of 8\u2019s (1-based row, col):\n\n- Row 2: (2,1), (2,5), (2,9), (2,13), (2,17)\n- Row 6: (6,1), (6,17)\n- Row 10: (10,1), (10,9), (10,17)\n- Row 14: (14,1), (14,13), (14,17)\n- Row 18: (18,1), (18,5), (18,9), (18,13), (18,17)\n\n### 2.2. Apply boundary rule\n\nFor a 4\u00d74 pattern anchored at (r,c) to fit in a 20\u00d720 grid, we need:\n\n- `r \u2264 17` and `c \u2264 17`.\n\nAll our c\u2019s (1,5,9,13,17) are \u2264 17, so fine horizontally.\n\nBut for rows:\n\n- Anchors at row 18 would need rows 18\u201321 \u2192 out of bounds \u2192 **ignore all 8\u2019s on row 18**.\n\nSo valid anchors are:\n\n- (2,1), (2,5), (2,9), (2,13), (2,17)\n- (6,1), (6,17)\n- (10,1), (10,9), (10,17)\n- (14,1), (14,13), (14,17)\n\n### 2.3. Check overlap\n\nEach 8 spawns a 4\u00d74 block `[r..r+3] \u00d7 [c..c+3]`. Differences between row coordinates are multiples of 4 (2,6,10,14) and column coordinates differ by 4 or more, so these 4\u00d74 blocks only **touch at edges** but do not overlap. Therefore, with the bottom-right \u2192 top-left scan, **no pattern is skipped for overlap**.\n\n### 2.4. Template for 8\n\nFrom Example 4 (and also clearly visible as the 7-block in the test input itself), the pattern for an 8 at (r,c) is:\n\nWithin the 4\u00d74 starting at (r,c):\n\n- Row r:       7 at (r, c), (r, c+3)\n- Row r+1:     7 at (r+1, c+1), (r+1, c+2)\n- Row r+2:     7 at (r+2, c+1), (r+2, c+2)\n- Row r+3:     7 at (r+3, c), (r+3, c+3)\n\nEverything else stays 0.\n\nWe apply that at each of the 13 valid anchors.\n\n### 2.5. Resulting rows\n\nConstructing row by row (1-based rows, 1\u201320):\n\n- Rows 1, 18, 19, 20: no pattern covers them \u2192 all 0.\n\n- **Row 2** (anchors at (2,1),(2,5),(2,9),(2,13),(2,17), top row of template):\n  7 at columns 1,4,5,8,9,12,13,16,17,20.\n\n- **Row 3** (second row of those templates):\n  7 at columns 2,3,6,7,10,11,14,15,18,19.\n\n- **Row 4** (third row, same as row 3):\n  7 at columns 2,3,6,7,10,11,14,15,18,19.\n\n- **Row 5** (fourth row of those templates, like row 2):\n  7 at columns 1,4,5,8,9,12,13,16,17,20.\n\n- **Row 6** (top of templates from (6,1) and (6,17)):\n  7 at columns 1,4,17,20.\n\n- **Row 7** (second row of those templates):\n  7 at columns 2,3,18,19.\n\n- **Row 8** (third row of those templates):\n  7 at columns 2,3,18,19.\n\n- **Row 9** (fourth row of those templates):\n  7 at columns 1,4,17,20.\n\n- **Row 10** (top of templates from (10,1),(10,9),(10,17)):\n  7 at columns 1,4,9,12,17,20.\n\n- **Row 11** (second row of those templates):\n  7 at columns 2,3,10,11,18,19.\n\n- **Row 12** (third row of those templates):\n  7 at columns 2,3,10,11,18,19.\n\n- **Row 13** (fourth row of those templates):\n  7 at columns 1,4,9,12,17,20.\n\n- **Row 14** (top of templates from (14,1),(14,13),(14,17)):\n  7 at columns 1,4,13,16,17,20.\n\n- **Row 15** (second row of those templates):\n  7 at columns 2,3,14,15,18,19.\n\n- **Row 16** (third row of those templates, same as row 15):\n  7 at columns 2,3,14,15,18,19.\n\n- **Row 17** (fourth row of those templates, same shape as row 14):\n  7 at columns 1,4,13,16,17,20.\n\nThe original 7-block in rows 6\u20139, cols 5\u20138 (the prototype) is *not* reproduced unless there is an 8 marker there (there isn\u2019t), so it disappears in the output.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

        "Full raw LLM response": "To solve this family of tasks I looked at the four worked pairs and found that the input is not carried through to the output. Instead, certain marker values cause a fixed 4\u00d74 template to be stamped into the output, with all other cells set to zero.\n\nThe templates are:\n\n- for an input\u202f2: a 4\u00d74 hollow square of colour\u202f4;\n- for an input\u202f3: a 4\u00d74 \u201cborder without corners\u201d of colour\u202f1;\n- for an input\u202f5: a 4\u00d74 with the two diagonal 2\u00d72 quadrants filled, colour\u202f6;\n- for an input\u202f8: a 4\u00d74 with the four corner cells and the central 2\u00d72 filled, colour\u202f7.\n\nMarkers are treated as the top\u2011left corner of the 4\u00d74 block; if the 4\u00d74 would run off the grid it is skipped. Other input values are ignored.\n\nIn the test case the only recognised markers are the 8s. Placing the \u201ccorners+centre\u201d pattern of colour\u202f7 at each 8 that fits yields:\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "The transformation replaces certain isolated marker colours in the input with predefined 4\u00d74 motifs in the output. Only the marker values 2,\u202f3,\u202f5 and 8 are active; all other input colours are ignored. For each active marker at position (r,c), if the 4\u00d74 tile starting there would run off the grid it is skipped. A marker is also skipped if another active marker lies within its 4\u00d74 area, so only the \u201clowest/rightmost\u201d of a potentially overlapping pair is kept. Otherwise, a 4\u00d74 motif of a specific colour is drawn with its top\u2011left at (r,c):\n\n- 2 \u2192 colour\u202f4, hollow square border,\n- 3 \u2192 colour\u202f1, hollow square with missing corners,\n- 5 \u2192 colour\u202f6, two 2\u00d72 blocks on the main diagonal,\n- 8 \u2192 colour\u202f7, four corners and centre 2\u00d72 block.\n\nIn the test grid the only active markers are the 8s. They all fit except those on row\u202f17, which would run off the bottom. The input 7s are ignored.
