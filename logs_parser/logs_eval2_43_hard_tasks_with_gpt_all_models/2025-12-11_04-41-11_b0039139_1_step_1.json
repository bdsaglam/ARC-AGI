        "Full raw LLM response": "**Algorithm for ARC Problem: A Pattern Matching Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this ARC task, and my job is to take a look at a bunch of solved examples and figure out the pattern. The core of this seems to be about identifying a \"tile\" or \"stencil\" and then using another pattern to \"place\" these tiles in a specific arrangement. The input is broken into sections by these horizontal or vertical lines of 1s.\n\n**Core Idea**\nI figure there are two key parts to each example: a \"tile\" and a \"layout\".\n1.  **The Tile:** This is derived from one section of the input (let's call it P1, the first pattern). It's a small grid with a specific arrangement of colors.\n2.  **The Layout:** Another section (P2, the second pattern) contains the instructions on how to use the tile to create the output.\n\n**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**\n\n*   **1.  Identify the Tile (P1):** I need to look at P1 and construct a basic unit, a tile. It looks like each color in the P1 pattern should map to a color from the output. The pixels in P1 are represented as bits, with each bit mapping to either C1 or C2 colors from the solid blocks.\n*   **2.  Determine the Layout (P2):** P2's structure dictates how to repeat the tile. In most of the examples, the P2 pattern defines a layout (like a horizontal or vertical sequence). But the direction of the layout is determined by the separators (Horizontal lines means Vertical output, Vertical lines means Horizontal output).\n*   **3.  Build the Output:** I will combine the P1 tile and the P2 layout to build the output. I take a look at the dimensions of the P1 and if we stack either horizontally or vertically in the output to construct the pattern.\n\n**How to get Tile & Layout**\n\n*   **Tile Construction:** I map the colors of P1 to the colors available in the \"solid color blocks\" of the input.\n*   **Layout Interpretation:** P2 provides a sequence (1s or 0s which map to tile or space). And here's the tricky part: P2's pattern provides an ordering of instructions about how to place or modify the tile.\n\n**The Test Case**\nI need to crack this Test Input. So I'll apply the algorithm and see how it works.\n1.  **P1 Tile:**\n    *   The tile is constructed using the first section's shape.\n    *   I'll map the color 4s to 8 and the 0s to 7, resulting in a 3x5 tile.\n2.  **P2 Layout:** I'll look at the second section and convert that to the layout instruction.  Since the separator lines are horizontal, the layout will be Vertical\n    *   I'll check the structure of P2 columns.\n    *   I check if specific rows are active in certain columns to interpret the layout.\n3.  **Output Construction:** I am going to stack the tiles vertically, in the pattern. I'll get an initial tile, and the next one will be this \"vertically shifted\" or right shifted pattern, and I'll keep repeating that.  The Test Output will look like: 5 vertical tiles where the pattern goes \"Tile A\", \"Shifted Tile\", \"Tile A\", \"Shifted Tile\", \"Tile A\".\n\nAfter filling in the details with the actual numbers, I have the final pattern!\n\nThe problem requires us to generate an output grid based on patterns and colors defined in the input grid. We can identify the transformation rules by analyzing the provided examples.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\n1.  **Structure Identification**: The input grid is divided into sections by lines of 1s (either horizontal or vertical).\n    *   **Section 1 (P1)**: Defines the base \"Tile\" shape.\n    *   **Section 2 (P2)**: Defines the \"Layout\" and modification of the tiles.\n    *   **Section 3 (C1)**: A solid block defining the \"Active Color\" (replacing the pattern color from P1).\n    *   **Section 4 (C2)**: A solid block defining the \"Background Color\" (replacing the background color from P1).\n\n2.  **Output Orientation**:\n    *   If the separators are horizontal lines of 1s, the output is a **Vertical Stack** of tiles.\n    *   If the separators are vertical columns of 1s, the output is a **Horizontal Stack** of tiles.\n\n3.  **Tile Construction (T)**:\n    *   Take the shape from P1.\n    *   Replace non-zero pixels with C1.\n    *   Replace zero pixels with C2.\n    *   This forms the base Tile **T**.\n\n4.  **Layout and Modification**:\n    *   P2 is analyzed to determine the sequence of tiles. The sequence corresponds to the \"active columns\" in P2 (columns containing any non-zero value).\n    *   In Example 3 and the Test Input, P2 defines a sequence of 5 slots corresponding to columns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n    *   The content of the rows in P2 determines the variation of the tile.\n        *   Row index corresponding to the \"top\" row of P2 (e.g., Row 1 in Ex 3, Row 7 in Test) indicates the Standard Tile (**A**).\n        *   Row index corresponding to the \"bottom\" row of P2 (e.g., Row 4 in Ex 3, Row 10 in Test) combined with the absence of the top row indicates a Shifted Tile (**B**).\n        *   The pattern observed is alternating: **A, B, A, B, A**.\n    *   **Tile A** is the base Tile **T**.\n    *   **Tile B** is **T** subjected to a **Logical Shift** by 1 unit along the stacking axis.\n        *   For Horizontal Stacking (Ex 3), it's a Logical Shift Right (fill left with background C2).\n        *   For Vertical Stacking (Test Input), it's a **Logical Shift Down** (fill top with background C2).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Separators**: Horizontal lines of 1s -> **Vertical Output**.\n*   **Colors**: Section 3 has 8s, Section 4 has 7s. **C1 = 8, C2 = 7**.\n*   **P1 (Shape)**:\n    ```\n    0 4 4 0 4 4 0\n    0 4 0 0 0 4 0\n    0 4 4 4 4 4 0\n    ```\n    Bounding box is 3 rows x 5 columns.\n    Mapping 4->8 and 0->7, we get Tile **T** (A):\n    ```\n    8 8 7 8 8\n    8 7 7 7 8\n    8 8 8 8 8\n    ```\n*   **P2 (Layout)**:\n    Columns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are active. Pattern is A, B, A, B, A.\n*   **Tile B (Shifted T)**:\n    Perform Logical Shift Down on T.\n    Row 0 becomes: `7 7 7 7 7` (Background)\n    Row 1 becomes: `8 8 7 8 8` (Old Row 0)\n    Row 2 becomes: `8 7 7 7 8` (Old Row 1)\n    Tile B:\n    ```\n    7 7 7 7 7\n    8 8 7 8 8\n    8 7 7 7 8\n    ```\n*   **Final Assembly**:\n    Stack 5 tiles vertically: T, B, T, B, T.\n    Total dimensions: (3x5) rows x 5 columns = 15 x 5.\n\n**Constructed Output:**\nRows 0-2 (T):\n8,8,7,8,8\n8,7,7,7,8\n8,8,8,8,8\n\nRows 3-5 (B):\n7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,7,8,8\n8,7,7,7,8\n\nRows 6-8 (T):\n8,8,7,8,8\n8,7,7,7,8\n8,8,8,8,8\n\nRows 9-11 (B):\n7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,7,8,8\n8,7,7,7,8\n\nRows 12-14 (T):\n8,8,7,8,8\n8,7,7,7,8\n8,8,8,8,8\n\n8,8,7,8,8\n8,7,7,7,8\n8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,7,8,8\n8,7,7,7,8\n8,8,7,8,8\n8,7,7,7,8\n8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,7,8,8\n8,7,7,7,8\n8,8,7,8,8\n8,7,7,7,8\n8,8,8,8,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Algorithm for Solving the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to crack this ARC puzzle. The input is a 2D grid of numbers from 0-9, and there are four solved examples to guide me. The input has separators and the separator's shape is key.\n\nMy analysis started by breaking down the input format. Grids are 2D arrays, and they use separators\u2014horizontal rows of '1's or vertical columns. The test input uses horizontal separators, meaning we have to be vertically aligned.\n\nLet\u2019s use Example 1. It stacks the grid into sections defined by separators. These sections contain simple patterns that are 4x4. Each contains a specific pattern with '0' as a background. I initially looked at this as math blocks with different dimensions but was mistaken. The first few tries looked at a matrix type structure that overlapped and expanded but that was a failure. Looking at Example 1, I noted the 5x2 output was the transpose of the input layout (stacked horizontally) and the key hint.\n\nIn Example 1, the output had two colors, and these colors were related to the two sections after the separator. If the colors are the final output of the pixels, that helped a lot. These sections were used to define the \"masking\" and \"coloring\" processes. The numbers inside were related to the actual pixel values in the output. The output grid is small in relation to the input. The patterns are what needs to be solved.\n\nFor instance, in Example 2, the pattern shapes are defined by how many times we see color 3 or color 4. In Example 2, the grid dimensions are larger than in Example 1. Example 3 has a different pattern, and so on. At one point, I thought about the first section being a \"template\" and the second one, \"the rule\".\n\nMy logic led to a working system that had: identifying patterns in each section, defining the direction of growth, horizontal versus vertical, by checking for what the separators were, horizontal versus vertical.\n\nIt turns out that the key to unlocking this puzzle is that you have two parts - a Tile, and a Layout, with a Sep (separator). One defines a smaller pattern, and the other dictates where the tile needs to be repeated in the output. The layout also has a role to expand it to the correct width of the output, for example, in Horizontal expansion. The output's dimensions are determined by the Tile's height, and we use the layout to determine the number of times we repeat the \"tile.\"\n\n1.  Input sections are parsed. If separators are rows, sections are stacked. If separators are columns, they stack horizontally.\n2.  Components are identified. A, B, C, D (for the sake of the exercise). A is the Tile. B is the Layout. C and D are FG and BG colors.\n3.  We figure out the expansion direction which is either horizontal (if separators are vertical) or vertical (if separators are horizontal).\n4.  Patterns: The tile and layout are trimmed to bounding boxes, converted to 0s and 1s.\n5.  Construction of the output has a separate process for horizontal versus vertical:\n    *   **Horizontal:**\n\n        *   Output height is the height of Tile A.\n        *   Layout sequence = Row 0 of Layout (Pattern B), counting the number of non-zero pixels.\n        *   Then we repeat the Tile based on the number of non-zero pixels in B.\n\n    *   **Vertical:**\n        *   The count is how many columns in B have pixels. (Horizontal)\n        *   The rule is simple, to count the number of repeated tiles by a pattern.\n        *   Output height is Height(A) * N + (N-1) with N being the max of the values in the pattern B.\n        *   For the test input, we need to build the \"Output\" grid:\n            *   Tile A = 1 1 0 1 1, 1 0 0 0 1, 1 1 1 1 1 is identified.\n            *   We apply a projection of the image from B onto the vertical axis.\n            *   If the row count is 3 we expand the rows by 3 from the given Tile pattern.\n            *   This gives us the Final Output.\n\nAfter this complete analysis, I am finally confident I have nailed down a valid solution strategy.\n\n\nThe task requires analyzing the input grid to identify patterns and constructing an output grid based on those patterns. The input is divided into four sections by separator lines (either rows or columns of 1s).\n\n**Step 1: Identify Structure and Expansion Mode**\nThe input contains horizontal separators (rows of 1s) at lines 5, 12, and 19.\n- **Horizontal Separators** indicate **Vertical Expansion**. The output grid will be formed by stacking tiles vertically.\n\n**Step 2: Parse Sections**\nBased on the separators:\n- **Section 1 (Pattern A - Tile):** Rows 0-4.\n  Contains a pattern of 4s.\n  ```\n  0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n  0,4,4,0,4,4,0\n  0,4,0,0,0,4,0\n  0,4,4,4,4,4,0\n  0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n  ```\n  Trimming to the bounding box of the 4s:\n  Rows 1-3, Columns 1-5.\n  Shape (3x5):\n  ```\n  4 4 0 4 4\n  4 0 0 0 4\n  4 4 4 4 4\n  ```\n\n- **Section 2 (Pattern B - Layout):** Rows 6-11.\n  Contains a pattern of 3s.\n  Rows 7, 8, 10 contain 3s. Row 9 is empty.\n  - Row 7: `0,3,0,3,0,3,0` (Active)\n  - Row 8: `0,3,0,3,0,3,0` (Active)\n  - Row 9: `0,0,0,0,0,0,0` (Inactive)\n  - Row 10: `0,3,3,0,3,3,0` (Active)\n  For Vertical Expansion, we count the number of rows in this section that contain the pattern color (3).\n  There are **3 active rows** (7, 8, 10). This determines that the Tile will be repeated **3 times** vertically.\n\n- **Section 3 (Foreground Color):** Rows 13-18.\n  Block of 8s. The foreground color is **8**.\n\n- **Section 4 (Background Color):** Rows 20-25.\n  Block of 7s. The background color is **7**.\n\n**Step 3: Construct Output**\n- **Tile:** Map the shape from Section 1 to the output colors.\n  - 4 (Pattern) -> 8 (Foreground)\n  - 0 (Empty) -> 7 (Background)\n  Resulting Tile (3x5):\n  ```\n  8 8 7 8 8\n  8 7 7 7 8\n  8 8 8 8 8\n  ```\n\n- **Arrangement:** Stack the Tile **3 times** (determined by Section 2), separated by **1 row** of Background color (7).\n  The separators are uniform regardless of the spacing in the layout section (as inferred from Example 2 and 3).\n\n  Structure:\n  1. Tile\n  2. Separator Row\n  3. Tile\n  4. Separator Row\n  5. Tile\n\n  Total Height: 3 (Tile) + 1 (Sep) + 3 (Tile) + 1 (Sep) + 3 (Tile) = 11 rows.\n  Total Width: 5 columns.\n\n**Step 4: Generate Grid**\nRow 0-2: Tile 1\nRow 3: Separator (7,7,7,7,7)\nRow 4-6: Tile 2\nRow 7: Separator (7,7,7,7,7)\nRow 8-10: Tile 3\n\n8,8,7,8,8\n8,7,7,7,8\n8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,7,8,8\n8,7,7,7,8\n8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,7,8,8\n8,7,7,7,8\n8,8,8,8,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Below is my reasoning process; it is exploratory and reflects that I was not able to infer a reliable, consistent rule from the examples. I will still propose an output for the test case at the end, but you should treat it as a guess rather than a confidently derived solution.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Structural observations from the examples\n\nAcross all four solved examples and the test:\n\n- The grids are divided into **four regions** separated by lines of color `1`.\n- The first two non\u20111 regions (call them A and B) contain **structured shapes** in colors `4` and `3`.\n- The last two regions (call them C and D) are **solid blocks** of uniform colors, e.g.:\n  - Example 1: C is all `2`, D is all `9`\n  - Example 2: C is all `8`, D is all `3`\n  - Example 3: C is all `6`, D is all `4`\n  - Example 4: C is all `2`, D is all `8`\n  - Test:   C is all `8`, D is all `7`\n\nThe outputs:\n\n- Always use **only the two colors from C and D**.\n- The shapes in colors `4` and `3` never appear directly in the output.\n- The grid is **much smaller** than the input and appears to encode some abstract relationship between A and B, using the palette from C and D.\n\nOrientation:\n\n- Example 1 and the test input: the four regions are stacked **vertically** (separated by horizontal lines of 1s).\n- Examples 2\u20134: the four regions are arranged **horizontally** (separated by vertical lines of 1s).\n\nSo the transformation depends on panel structure, not on absolute positions.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Inferring output size\n\nOne dimension of the output is relatively consistent:\n\n- For **horizontal** layouts (Examples 2\u20134):\n  - Count how many **rows in region A** contain color `4`.\n  - That count equals the **output height**.\n  - Example 2: A has 4s in 3 rows \u2192 output is 3 rows tall.\n  - Example 3: A has 4s in 4 rows \u2192 output is 4 rows tall.\n  - Example 4: A has 4s in 2 rows \u2192 output is 2 rows tall.\n\n- For **vertical** layouts (Example 1 and the test):\n  - Count how many **columns in region A** contain color `4`.\n  - That count equals the **output width**.\n  - Example 1: A uses columns 2 and 3 \u2192 output is 2 columns wide.\n\nFor the **test input**, which is vertical:\n\n- Region A (rows 1\u20135) is:\n\n  ```\n  0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n  0 4 4 0 4 4 0\n  0 4 0 0 0 4 0\n  0 4 4 4 4 4 0\n  0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n  ```\n\n- Columns containing `4` are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \u2192 **5 columns**.\n- So I infer the **output width = 5**.\n\nNow, the other dimension of the output seems related to the \u201cheight\u201d of the `3`\u2011shape (region B). For most examples:\n\n- Let region B\u2019s **bounding box along the stacking axis** (rows for vertical, columns for horizontal) have size `h_B`.\n- Often the output size along that axis \u2248 `2*h_B + 1`:\n  - Example 1: B\u2019s non\u2011zero rows = 2 \u2192 2*2 + 1 = 5 \u2192 output height 5 (matches).\n  - Example 2: B spans 5 columns with 3s (in terms of a minimal band), 2*5 + 1 = 11 \u2192 output width 11 (matches).\n  - Example 4: B spans 3 columns with 3s \u2192 2*3 + 1 = 7 \u2192 output width 7 (matches).\n\nExample 3 did not fit this cleanly and seems to behave differently, so the rule is not fully consistent, but for the **test** the vertical case is analogous to Example 1.\n\nFor the **test**, region B is rows 7\u201312:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 3 0 3 0\n0 3 0 3 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 0 3 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nThe non\u2011zero rows are 8, 9, 11 \u2192 bounding box rows 8\u201311 \u21d2 **height 4**.\n\nApplying the \u201c2*h_B + 1\u201d heuristic from Example 1:\n\n- `2 * 4 + 1 = 9`, so I infer the **output height = 9**.\n\nThus I conclude the test output should be a **9\u00d75** grid.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Inferring the internal pattern\n\nHere, unfortunately, the examples don\u2019t yield a clear, consistent construction:\n\n- In Examples 2\u20134, for a fixed height, each row is a patterned sequence of the two colors from C and D, with period 4 in columns, e.g.:\n  - Example 2 (C=8, D=3) row patterns look like repetitions of a 4\u2011column motif `[C, C, C, D]`, `[D, C, D, D]`, etc.\n  - Example 4 (C=2, D=8) has a motif `[C, C, C, D]` on row1 and `[C, D, C, D]` on row2.\n- In Example 3, a 4\u2011column motif of column types repeats, but I could not find a consistent way to derive that motif from the shapes A and B that is compatible with the other examples.\n- For the **vertical** case (Example 1), the pattern in the 5\u00d72 output depends in some way on both A and B, but the internal logic of the colors is not transparent, and I could not derive a rule that generalizes to the test.\n\nBecause of this, while I am reasonably confident about the **output size (9\u00d75)** and the **palette (8 and 7)**, I am **not** able to infer a trustworthy rule for the exact arrangement of 8s and 7s inside that 9\u00d75 grid.\n\nWhat follows is therefore a **constructed guess**, not a derivation backed by a solid rule.\n\nTo keep the guess at least structurally reminiscent of the patterns seen (striped / repeating motifs with both colors), I propose:\n\n- Use color `8` for the role analogous to C (first solid block).\n- Use color `7` for the role analogous to D (second solid block).\n- Make a simple repetitive motif with a \u201ccentral\u201d `7` column and more `7`s in every third row, which loosely echoes the idea of a structured but narrow pattern.\n\nConcretely, I\u2019ll use this 9\u00d75 pattern:\n\n- Rows 1, 4, 7: `8,8,7,8,8`\n- Rows 2, 5, 8: `8,7,7,7,8`\n- Rows 3, 6, 9: `7,7,7,7,7`\n\nAgain, this is **not** deduced from a robust formula; it is an educated but speculative guess.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Final guessed output grid\n\nHere is the 9\u00d75 grid I propose as the output for the test input:\n\nRow 1: 8,8,7,8,8  \nRow 2: 8,7,7,7,8  \nRow 3: 7,7,7,7,7  \nRow 4: 8,8,7,8,8  \nRow 5: 8,7,7,7,8  \nRow 6: 7,7,7,7,7  \nRow 7: 8,8,7,8,8  \nRow 8: 8,7,7,7,8  \nRow 9: 7,7,7,7,7\n\nIn CSV form:\n\n```\n8,8,7,8,8\n8,7,7,7,8\n7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,7,8,8\n8,7,7,7,8\n7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,7,8,8\n8,7,7,7,8\n7,7,7,7,7\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "First I'll explain the rule that fits all the training examples, then apply it to the test input.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Understanding the structure of the tasks\n\nIn every example (including the test) the input grid is structured into **four regions**, separated by lines of `1`s (and possibly zeros):\n\n1. A region containing a shape of color `4` (top or left).\n2. A region containing one or more shapes of color `3` (adjacent to region 1, but separated by `1`s).\n3. A solid rectangular block of some color `P` (the first \u201cpalette\u201d color).\n4. A solid rectangular block of another color `Q` (the second \u201cpalette\u201d color).\n\nThe output uses **only** the two palette colors `P` and `Q`.\n\nThe transformation can be described as:\n\n- Use the **shape of color 4** as a template (a binary pattern).\n- Count how many **connected components** (4\u2011connected) of color `3` exist in its region. Call this number `N`.\n- Replicate the 4\u2011shape template `N` times in one direction (horizontally or vertically, depending on orientation), with a single line/column of the background palette color `Q` inserted between each copy.\n- Within each copy, color each template cell:\n  - `P` if the corresponding cell in the 4\u2011shape is `4`.\n  - `Q` if the corresponding cell in the 4\u2011shape is background (`0`).\n\nThe only role of the **3\u2011shapes** is to determine **how many components there are (N)**; their detailed geometry is ignored.\n\nOrientation:\n\n- **Horizontal examples (2, 3, 4)**: the 4 and 3 shapes are side\u2011by\u2011side.\n  - Let:\n    - `R4` = set of rows containing any `4` in the 4\u2011shape region.\n    - `C4` = set of columns containing any `4` in the 4\u2011shape region.\n    - `N` = number of connected components of `3` in the 3\u2011shape region.\n  - Output:\n    - Height = `|R4|`\n    - Width  = `N * |C4| + (N - 1)`\n    - For each 3\u2011component, left to right:\n      - Add a block of width `|C4|` which is just the 4\u2011shape restricted to `R4 \u00d7 C4`, recolored (`4 \u2192 P`, background \u2192 `Q`).\n      - Between successive components, insert one separator column of all `Q`.\n\n- **Vertical examples (1 and the test)**: the 4 and 3 shapes are stacked vertically.\n  - Let:\n    - `R4` = rows with any `4`.\n    - `C4` = columns with any `4`.\n    - `N` = # of connected components of `3` in the 3\u2011shape region.\n  - Output:\n    - Width  = `|R4|`\n    - Height = `N * |C4| + (N - 1)`\n    - For each 3\u2011component, top to bottom:\n      - Add a block of height `|C4|` which is the 4\u2011shape restricted to `R4 \u00d7 C4`, but this time **transposed:**\n        - rows of the block correspond to `C4` (columns of the 4\u2011shape),\n        - columns of the block correspond to `R4` (rows of the 4\u2011shape),\n        - recolor `4 \u2192 P`, background \u2192 `Q`.\n      - Between successive components, insert one separator row of all `Q`.\n\nExample 1 fits this vertical rule exactly:\n- 4\u2011shape rows with `4`: `{2,3}` \u2192 `|R4| = 2`.\n- 4\u2011shape columns with `4`: `{2,3}` \u2192 `|C4| = 2`.\n- 3\u2011shape (two vertical bars) has `N = 2` connected components.\n- Height = `N * |C4| + (N - 1) = 2*2 + 1 = 5`.\n- Width  = `|R4| = 2`.\n- The 4\u2011shape restricted to rows 2\u20133, cols 2\u20133 is:\n  - row2: `4 4` \u2192 `[1,1]`\n  - row3: `4 0` \u2192 `[1,0]`\n- Palette colors are `P = 2`, `Q = 9`.\n- Block (height 2, width 2) after transposition and recolor gives:\n  - row over col2: `[P,P] = [2,2]`\n  - row over col3: `[P,Q] = [2,9]`\n- Two such blocks with a separator `[Q,Q]` row in between give:\n\n  ```\n  2 2\n  2 9\n  9 9\n  2 2\n  2 9\n  ```\n\nwhich matches the provided output.\n\nThe horizontal examples (2,3,4) all match the same idea, just in horizontal direction, with the separator as a column of `Q` between N copies.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Apply the rule to the test input\n\n### 2.1. Identify the regions and palette colors\n\nTest input (row\u2011grouped):\n\n- Rows 1\u20135: 4\u2011shape region.\n- Row 6: all `1` (separator).\n- Rows 7\u201312: 3\u2011shape region.\n- Row 13: all `1` (separator).\n- Rows 14\u201319: solid `8` block \u2192 palette color `P = 8`.\n- Row 20: all `1` (separator).\n- Rows 21\u201326: solid `7` block \u2192 palette color `Q = 7`.\n\nSo:\n\n- 4\u2011shape color: `4`\n- 3\u2011shape color: `3`\n- Palette: `P = 8`, `Q = 7`.\n\n### 2.2. Extract the 4\u2011shape template\n\nRows 1\u20135:\n\nRow1: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0`  \nRow2: `0 4 4 0 4 4 0`  \nRow3: `0 4 0 0 0 4 0`  \nRow4: `0 4 4 4 4 4 0`  \nRow5: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n\nRows with any `4`: rows 2,3,4 \u2192 `R4 = {2,3,4}`, so `|R4| = 3`.  \nColumns with any `4`: cols 2,3,4,5,6 \u2192 `C4 = {2,3,4,5,6}`, so `|C4| = 5`.\n\nRestrict the 4\u2011shape to `R4 \u00d7 C4` (rows 2\u20134, cols 2\u20136):\n\n- Row2, cols 2\u20136: `4 4 0 4 4` \u2192 `[1,1,0,1,1]`\n- Row3, cols 2\u20136: `4 0 0 0 4` \u2192 `[1,0,0,0,1]`\n- Row4, cols 2\u20136: `4 4 4 4 4` \u2192 `[1,1,1,1,1]`\n\nLet\u2019s store this as a 3\u00d75 binary matrix `A` with rows indexed by `R4` and columns by `C4`:\n\n- A[1,*] (row2): `[1,1,0,1,1]`\n- A[2,*] (row3): `[1,0,0,0,1]`\n- A[3,*] (row4): `[1,1,1,1,1]`\n\n### 2.3. Count connected components of 3\u2011shapes\n\n3\u2011region is rows 7\u201312:\n\nRow7:  `0 0 0 0 0 0 0`  \nRow8:  `0 3 0 3 0 3 0`  \nRow9:  `0 3 0 3 0 3 0`  \nRow10: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0`  \nRow11: `0 3 3 0 3 3 0`  \nRow12: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n\nCoordinates of `3` cells:\n\n- (8,2), (8,4), (8,6)\n- (9,2), (9,4), (9,6)\n- (11,2), (11,3), (11,5), (11,6)\n\nUsing 4\u2011connected adjacency:\n\n- Component 1: (8,2)\u2013(9,2)\n- Component 2: (8,4)\u2013(9,4)\n- Component 3: (8,6)\u2013(9,6)\n- Component 4: (11,2)\u2013(11,3)\n- Component 5: (11,5)\u2013(11,6)\n\nSo `N = 5` connected components of `3`.\n\n### 2.4. Determine output size (vertical case)\n\nBecause this is a **vertical** layout (4\u2011shape stack above 3\u2011shape), we use the vertical rule:\n\n- Width  = `|R4|` = 3\n- Height = `N * |C4| + (N - 1)` = `5 * 5 + 4` = 25 + 4 = 29\n\nSo the output is a **29\u00d73** grid.\n\n### 2.5. Build the 4\u2011shape block in palette colors\n\nFor a vertical case:\n\n- Each block has **height `|C4|`** (5 rows) and **width `|R4|`** (3 columns).\n- Row index inside a block corresponds to a column in `C4` (i.e., index `t = 1..5`).\n- Column index corresponds to a row in `R4` (`k = 1..3`).\n- Cell (t, k) is:\n  - `P` (8) if `A[k,t] = 1`,\n  - `Q` (7) if `A[k,t] = 0`.\n\nCompute rows of a single block:\n\nWe need `A[k,t]` with `k` = row index (1..3), `t` = column index (1..5):\n\n- t = 1 (col2): A[*,1] = [1,1,1] \u2192 row = `[8,8,8]`\n- t = 2 (col3): A[*,2] = [1,0,1] \u2192 row = `[8,7,8]`\n- t = 3 (col4): A[*,3] = [0,0,1] \u2192 row = `[7,7,8]`\n- t = 4 (col5): A[*,4] = [1,0,1] \u2192 row = `[8,7,8]`\n- t = 5 (col6): A[*,5] = [1,1,1] \u2192 row = `[8,8,8]`\n\nSo **one block** (for one 3\u2011component) is:\n\n1. `8 8 8`\n2. `8 7 8`\n3. `7 7 8`\n4. `8 7 8`\n5. `8 8 8`\n\nBetween each pair of consecutive components we insert one **separator row** of all `Q`:\n\n- Separator row: `7 7 7`\n\n### 2.6. Stack 5 blocks with separators\n\nWe have `N = 5` components, so we stack:\n\n- Block\n- Separator\n- Block\n- Separator\n- Block\n- Separator\n- Block\n- Separator\n- Block\n\nThat is 5\u00d75 block rows + 4 separator rows = 25 + 4 = 29 rows.\n\nWrite them explicitly:\n\nBlock pattern:\n\n- B1: `8 8 8`\n- B2: `8 7 8`\n- B3: `7 7 8`\n- B4: `8 7 8`\n- B5: `8 8 8`\n\nSeparator: S = `7 7 7`\n\nSo the full 29\u00d73 output grid is:\n\n1.  `8 8 8`\n2.  `8 7 8`\n3.  `7 7 8`\n4.  `8 7 8`\n5.  `8 8 8`\n6.  `7 7 7`\n7.  `8 8 8`\n8.  `8 7 8`\n9.  `7 7 8`\n10. `8 7 8`\n11. `8 8 8`\n12. `7 7 7`\n13. `8 8 8`\n14. `8 7 8`\n15. `7 7 8`\n16. `8 7 8`\n17. `8 8 8`\n18. `7 7 7`\n19. `8 8 8`\n20. `8 7 8`\n21. `7 7 8`\n22. `8 7 8`\n23. `8 8 8`\n24. `7 7 7`\n25. `8 8 8`\n26. `8 7 8`\n27. `7 7 8`\n28. `8 7 8`\n29. `8 8 8`\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\nHere is the output in the required comma\u2011separated row format:\n\n```\n8,8,8\n8,7,8\n7,7,8\n8,7,8\n8,8,8\n7,7,7\n8,8,8\n8,7,8\n7,7,8\n8,7,8\n8,8,8\n7,7,7\n8,8,8\n8,7,8\n7,7,8\n8,7,8\n8,8,8\n7,7,7\n8,8,8\n8,7,8\n7,7,8\n8,7,8\n8,8,8\n7,7,7\n8,8,8\n8,7,8\n7,7,8\n8,7,8\n8,8,8\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "We have four panels separated by all\u20101 rows.  The first two contain the patterned shapes, the third and fourth are solid and supply the two colours for the output.\n\nFor all the solved tasks the following procedure works:\n\n- Take the first panel and crop it to the rows and columns that contain non\u2011zero cells.  This gives a binary template \\(M\\) of height \\(H\\) and width \\(W\\).\n- Map 1s in \\(M\\) to the colour of the third panel, and 0s to the colour of the fourth panel; this is the block \\(T\\).\n- If the panels are stacked vertically (as here), compute \\(b\\) as the maximum number of non\u2011zero cells in any column of the second panel.  The output width is \\(W\\), the output height is \\(b\\cdot H+(b-1)\\).\n- Build the output by stacking \\(b\\) copies of \\(T\\) vertically with a single gap row of the fourth\u2011panel colour between copies.\n\nFor the test input, the cropped first panel has \\(H=3\\), \\(W=5\\) and template\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{ccccc}\n8&8&7&8&8\\\\\n8&7&7&7&8\\\\\n8&8&8&8&8\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nThe second panel has a maximum of three non\u2011zeros in any column, so \\(b=3\\).
