        "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, here's the game plan:** I've been tasked with cracking an ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) puzzle. The core concept seems to revolve around a green \"path\" (represented by color 3), navigating through a grid populated with obstacles (represented by patterns of colors 1 and 2, which I\u2019m calling the \"switches\"). My objective is to predict the final grid state, given an input grid with a green starting point and some \"switches.\"\n\n**The Big Picture:**\n\n*   **Goal:**  I need to figure out how to trace a green path from its starting point, going around the 1/2 \"switches\" (which always get \"fixed\" to a uniform 2 color, like \"red\"), and accurately predicting how the final grid will look.\n*   **Key Observations**:\n    *   Obstacles (the 1/2 patterns) always turn to a solid color 2.\n    *   The Green \"Path\" is like a wire connecting points.\n    *   The path *avoids* the 1/2 obstacles, generally by taking vertical or horizontal moves.\n\n**The Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Obstacle Detection:** I'll first locate all of the 1/2 structures. These are the \"obstacles.\"\n2.  **Obstacle \"Repair\":** I assume that all the \"1\" colors in those obstacles will become \"2s\" in the solution. This is a crucial first step.\n3.  **Path Tracing:** The core logic lies in figuring out where the Green Path \"turns\" to circumvent obstacles.\n\n**Pathfinding Rules (Refined):**\n\n*   **Starting Point:** Green pixel (3).\n*   **Movement Direction:** Determine if to move \"down\" or \"right\" based on the obstacles. Obstacles that are wider than taller, move down. Vertical obstacles, move right.\n*   **\"Lanes\":** The path will generally keep going in the starting direction until it needs to move around an obstacle.\n*   **Horizontal or Vertical Turns:** If there's an obstacle in its path, it moves left/right or up/down\n*   **Horizontal Moves**: If the path encounters a horizontal obstacle (rows), the main movement is vertical (down), with sidestepping horizontal (rows).\n*   **Vertical Moves**: If the path encounters a vertical obstacle (columns), the main movement is horizontal (right), with sidestepping horizontal (rows).\n*   **Turning logic (Most Important)**: If an obstacle blocks the path:\n    *   **The path turns based on the proximity of obstacles.** The turns seem to be linked to something called a \"lane.\"\n    *   The ideal turn is at the maximum possible location that doesn't intersect other obstacles.\n\n**Specific Implementation:**\n\n1.  **Grid Setup:** I will create the output grid the same dimensions of the input.\n2.  **Obstacle Repair:** In the output grid, I will replace all the \"1\" values with \"2\" (the color red).\n3.  **Determine Green Path:** I start at the known green pixel and draw segments as it goes.\n4.  **Turns:** Based on analyzing some patterns, it's clear the path turns horizontally to avoid a specific obstacle.\n5.  **Output:** Return the complete, updated grid.\n\nThat's the basic plan. I'll need to double-check my logic against the test cases, but I think I've got a solid framework for solving this kind of puzzle.\n\n\nThe transformation involves two main components: repairing the \"obstacle\" lines and generating a green path that navigates around these obstacles.\n\n**1. Repairing Obstacles:**\nIn the input grid, there are horizontal lines (rows) composed of `1`s (blue) and `2`s (red). These act as obstacles. The first step is to convert all `1`s in these lines to `2`s, making them solid red lines.\n\n**2. Path Generation:**\nA green path (color `3`) starts from the single green pixel in the input (at `(0, 8)`). It extends downwards (increasing row index) to the bottom of the grid. When the path encounters an obstacle that blocks its current column, it must move horizontally to a \"safe\" column before hitting the obstacle.\n\n*Strategy for Pathfinding:*\n- **Direction:** Vertical (Down).\n- **Turn Logic:** The path turns at a row determined by `Obstacle_Row - 2` (leaving a 1-row gap between the horizontal path segment and the obstacle).\n- **Lane Selection:** The path prefers specific columns (Lanes) to travel in. Based on the examples, the preference order is: `Current_Column` (if clear) > `Column 1` > `Column 8` > `Column 15` (following a `1, 8, 15...` spacing pattern).\n- **Segments:**\n    - **Start:** `(0, 8)`.\n    - **Obstacle 1** is at Row 3 (occupying cols 4-15). It blocks column 8.\n        - **Turn:** At Row `3 - 2 = 1`.\n        - **Target:** Column 1 is clear (0-3 is free).\n        - **Path:** Down to `(1, 8)`, Left to `(1, 1)`.\n    - **Obstacle 2** is at Row 9 (occupying cols 0-6). It blocks column 1.\n        - **Turn:** At Row `9 - 2 = 7`.\n        - **Target:** Column 8 is clear (7-15 is free).\n        - **Path:** Down to `(7, 1)`, Right to `(7, 8)`.\n    - **Obstacle 3** is at Row 17 (occupying cols 6-15).

with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**The Pathfinding Puzzle**\n\nOkay, so the task at hand is to solve these ARC puzzles. I'm seeing a pattern here. We have a grid of numbers, and the goal is to transform it based on some rule. The grid is filled with numbers, 0 through 9, but two numbers, 1 and 2, seem especially important. They are often in \"walls,\" which are lines of alternating or specific patterns. The primary goal is that somehow, the grid is altered in such a way that the walls are modified.\n\nLet me think of it this way - the 3s are \"light beams\", and the 1s and 2s are \"mirrors\" and \"mirrors in the process of forming.\"\n\nThe \"Light Beam\" follows this process:\n\n1.  Identify the location of a '3'.\n\n2.  Cast a \"beam\" from the 3 in a straight line.\n\n3.  When a wall (a line of 1s and 2s) intersects the beam, the beam doesn't pass through, it \"turns\" to go around it.\n\n4.  Calculate a \"Buffer\" distance based on the number of 1s in the wall (Buffer = Count(1s) + 1).\n\n5.  The Beam moves that buffer amount before hitting the wall, and the \"detour\" occurs.\n\n6.  Turn 90 degrees to move *around* the wall. Which way? Toward the closest wall endpoint. If it would go out of bounds, change direction.\n\n7.  Once at the clear area, resume initial direction of movement.\n\n8.  Continue until it hits another wall or grid edge.\n\n9.  Finally, after the path of the beam is determined, convert all 1s in the grid to 2s.\n\nOkay, let's look at the Test Input, which has a 3 at (0,8) at the very top. So, the beam will be travelling down the column.\n\n**Path 1:** The beam begins at (0,8). It moves down col 8, and will eventually hit a wall at row 3. The wall at row 3 starts at column 4 and goes to column 15. Count the 1s in the sequence from 4 to 15: there is only 1. Buffer = 1 + 1 = 2. It will have to turn. So, it should stop 2 units before the wall, at row 1. From (1,8), it will have to go left or right. It goes left to (1,2) due to not going out of bounds.\n\n**Path 2:**  Next, it turns at (1,2). It moves downwards from (1,2), to the next wall at row 9 (cols 0 to 6). It will have to avoid it by going right, as 0 will cause out of bounds issues, so the detour goes right. Stop 3 units before the wall. That is, it will stop at row 6, and go right, at col 9 to detour.\n\n**Path 3:** The beam turns at (6,9) downwards and gets blocked by the next wall, Row 17 (cols 6-15). It stops 4 before 17, at (13, 9) and detours around the wall going left.\n\n**Path 4:** The beam continues down towards the bottom (27, 2) until reaching Row 27. It turns to avoid the wall (cols 0-8) and detours at (22, 2) going right to continue downward.\n\n**Path 5:** The path is unobstructed, it continues downwards until it meets the edge of the grid at (28, 13).\n\nIn the final grid, I need to place 3 at (0,8) and follow the paths through the detours based on the calculated logic. Once finished, I can also turn all 1's into 2's.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to simulate a \"light beam\" (represented by color 3) traveling through a grid, interacting with \"walls\" (lines of 1s and 2s).\n\n**Logic Breakdown:**\n\n1.  **The Agent:** The single cell of color `3` is the starting point of a path.\n2.  **Initial Direction:** The path starts moving from the `3` into the open grid area (perpendicular to the edge it is on). In the test case, the `3` is at `(0, 8)` (top edge), so it moves **Down**.\n3.  **Interaction with Walls:** The path moves in a straight line until it encounters a \"wall\" (a horizontal or vertical sequence of `1`s and `2`s).\n4.  **Buffer Distance Calculation:** When the path is blocked by a wall, it must divert. The distance at which it stops before the wall, and the distance it extends past the wall to go around, is determined by the **number of `1`s** in that specific wall segment.\n    *   **Rule:** `Buffer = (Count of '1's in the wall) + 1`.\n5.  **Detour Logic:**\n    *   **Stop:** The path stops `Buffer` units *before* hitting the wall's row or column.\n    *   **Turn:** It turns 90 degrees to move parallel to the wall.\n    *   **Direction:** It chooses the direction towards the **closest endpoint** of the wall.\n        *   *Exception:* If turning towards the closest endpoint would take the path out of bounds, it turns the other way.\n    *   **Pass:** It travels sideways until it is `Buffer` units past the wall's endpoint.\n    *   **Resume:** It turns 90 degrees back to the original direction (e.g., Down) and continues until the next obstacle.\n6.  **Wall Transformation:** In the final output, all `1`s in the walls are converted to `2`s.\n\n**Step-by-Step Trace for Test Input:**\n\n*   **Start:** `(0, 8)`, moving **Down**.\n*   **Obstacle 1:** Wall at Row 3 (Cols 4-15).\n    *   Content: `2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1`.\n    *   Count of `1`s = 1. **Buffer = 2**.\n    *   Path intersects at Col 8. Wall edges are 4 (dist 4) and 15 (dist 7). Closest is Left (4).\n    *   **Action:** Stop 2 units before Row 3 (at Row 1). travel Left to 2 units past Col 4 (Target Col 2).\n    *   **Segment:** `(0,8)` down to `(1,8)`, then `(1,8)` left to `(1,2)`.\n    *   **New State:** At `(1, 2)`, moving **Down**.\n\n*   **Obstacle 2:** Wall at Row 9 (Cols 0-6).\n    *   Content: `1,2,1,2,2,2,2`.\n    *   Count of `1`s = 2. **Buffer = 3**.\n    *   Path intersects at Col 2.

What the transformation does\n\nFrom all four examples, two clear operations appear:\n\n### (A) Normalize the 1/2 patterns\n\nWherever colors 1 and 2 appear in a contiguous line (row or column), all the 1s are turned into 2s, leaving pure 2\u2011segments:\n\n- Example 1: row 8 input `1,2,1,2,1,2,1` \u2192 output `2,2,2,2,2,2,2`.\n- Example 2: vertical columns with `1,2,1,2,2,2,\u2026` \u2192 output: all 2s.\n- Example 3: all mixed `1,2,...` rows become entirely 2s.\n- Example 4: similarly, mixed vertical stacks become all 2s.\n\nSo rule (A): **every 1 becomes 2** (since in the given tasks, 1 only appears as part of these mixed patterns).\n\nI apply that globally in the test.\n\n---\n\n### (B) Build a path of 3s that weaves around the 2\u2011segments\n\nThere is always at least one 3 already present in the input. The output adds more 3s forming a single orthogonal polyline that:\n\n- Starts from the original 3.\n- Moves predominantly in the direction orthogonal to the 2\u2011segments:\n  - When the 2\u2011segments are vertical (examples 2 and 4), the 3\u2011path travels mainly horizontally.\n  - When the 2\u2011segments are horizontal (examples 1 and 3), the 3\u2011path travels mainly vertically.\n- Never overwrites any 2s; the 3s are always drawn only on background 8 cells.\n- Passes **on the opposite horizontal side of each 2\u2011segment** relative to the grid center:\n  - In Example 3, clusters whose centers are left of the grid center get the 3\u2011path on their right side (x > max_x of that cluster) and vice versa.\n- Turns at rows that are approximately midpoints between successive special rows:\n  - Special rows = starting 3\u2019s row and the rows containing 2\u2011segments.\n  - Example 3 has 2\u2011rows at 5, 11, 17, with start at row 1. The 3\u2011horizontals land at 3, 8, 14, which are midpoints between (1,5), (5,11), (11,17).\n\nIn the test, all non\u2011background patterns (other than the one 3) are horizontal rows of 1/2, so we are in the \u201chorizontal 2\u2011segments \u2192 vertical 3\u2011path\u201d case like Example 3.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Analyze the test input\n\nThe grid is 28 rows \u00d7 16 columns.\n\n### 2.1. Starting 3\n\n- There is a single 3 at (row 1, col 9).\n\n### 2.2. 1/2 patterns, then normalize them\n\nFirst convert every 1 to 2:\n\n- Row 4:  \n  Input: `8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1`  \n  \u2192 After normalization:  \n  `8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2`  \n  (2\u2011segment from c5..c16)\n\n- Row 10:  \n  Input: `1,2,1,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \n  \u2192 `2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \n  (2\u2011segment from c1..c7)\n\n- Row 18:  \n  Input: `8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,1,2,1`  \n  \u2192 `8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2`  \n  (2\u2011segment from c7..c16)\n\n- Row 27:  \n  Input: `1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \n  \u2192 `2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \n  (2\u2011segment from c1..c9)\n\nSo we have horizontal 2\u2011rows at:\n\n- R4: cols 5\u201316\n- R10: cols 1\u20137\n- R18: cols 7\u201316\n- R27: cols 1\u20139\n\nThese are the rows we want to \u201cthread\u201d a 3\u2011path around.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Construct the 3\u2011path\n\n### 3.1. Choose turning rows (vertical progression)\n\nWe treat:\n\n- Start row: 1\n- 2\u2011rows: 4, 10, 18, 27\n- Final boundary: 28\n\nFor the path we create turning rows that approximately bisect each gap between:\n\n- Start and row 4\n- Row 4 and row 10\n- Row 10 and row 18\n- Row 18 and row 27\n\nUsing integer midpoints (floor):\n\n- Between 1 and 4: (1+4)//2 = 2 \u2192 row 2\n- Between 4 and 10: (4+10)//2 = 7 \u2192 row 7\n- Between 10 and 18: (10+18)//2 = 14 \u2192 row 14\n- Between 18 and 27: (18+27)//2 = 22 \u2192 row 22\n\nSo the vertical structure is:\n\n- Start at (1,9) \u2192 down to row 2\n- Later down to 7, 14, 22, and finally to 28.\n\nThe vertical segments between these rows are each responsible for passing by exactly one 2\u2011row.\n\n### 3.2. Choose safe corridor columns\n\nWe want the path to pass:\n\n- On the **horizontal opposite side** of each 2\u2011row relative to the grid\u2019s horizontal center, and\n- Only through background (8) cells.\n\nGrid width is 16; center is at column 8.5.\n\nApproximate centers of each 2\u2011row:\n\n- R4 (c5..16): center \u2248 10.5 \u2192 right\u2011of\u2011center\n- R10 (c1..7): center \u2248 4   \u2192 left\u2011of\u2011center\n- R18 (c7..16): center \u2248 11.5 \u2192 right\u2011of\u2011center\n- R27 (c1..9): center \u2248 5 \u2192 left\u2011of\u2011center\n\nSo desired sides:\n\n- R4: path on the **left** side of that 2\u2011run.\n- R10: path on the **right**.\n- R18: path left.\n- R27: path right.\n\nA simple consistent choice of corridors that achieves this and avoids all 2s:\n\n- **Left corridor column**: c2 (far enough left of every right\u2011leaning 2\u2011row when we\u2019re at its height).\n- **Right corridor column**: c13 (far enough right of every left\u2011leaning 2\u2011row we cross).\n\nNow we string these together so that:\n\n- Near row 4 we\u2019re on the left corridor (c2),\n- Near row 10 on right corridor (c13),\n- Near row 18 on left corridor (c2),\n- Near row 27 on right corridor (c13).\n\n### 3.3. Actual path steps\n\nStarting from the original 3 at (1,9):\n\n1. **Down to the first turning row:**\n   - From (1,9) down to (2,9).\n\n2. **Step to left corridor before R4:**\n   - Row 2: horizontal from col 9 to col 2.\n   - So row 2, cols 2\u20139 become 3.\n\n3. **Down left corridor until just before the second turning row (between R4 and R10):**\n   - Column 2: vertical from row 2 down to row 7 (rows 2\u20137, col 2).\n\n   (This vertical segment \u201cpasses by\u201d row 4 (2\u2011segment 5\u201316) at col 2, which is safely left of it.)\n\n4. **Cross over to the right corridor before R10:**\n   - Row 7: horizontal from col 2 to col 13.\n\n5. **Down the right corridor to row 14 (between R10 and R18):**\n   - Column 13: vertical from row 7 down to row 14.\n\n   (This vertical passes row 10, whose 2\u2011segment is 1\u20137; at col 13 we are safely to the right.)\n\n6. **Cross back to the left side before R18:**\n   - Row 14: horizontal from col 13 to col 2.\n\n7. **Down the left corridor to row 22 (between R18 and R27):**\n   - Column 2: vertical from row 14 down to row 22.\n\n   (Here we pass row 18\u2019s 2\u2011segment 7\u201316 safely on the left.)\n\n8. **Final cross to the right side before R27 and then down to bottom:**\n   - Row 22: horizontal from col 2 to col 13.\n   - Column 13: vertical from row 22 down to row 28.\n\n   (This vertical passes row 27\u2019s 2\u2011segment 1\u20139 safely on the right.)\n\nBecause we only ever painted 3s on cells that were 8, and never on the 2\u2011cells, the 2\u2011rows are preserved and the path is continuous.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Apply both steps to get the final grid\n\nNow combine:\n\n- Normalized 1\u21922 everywhere,\n- Plus the 3\u2011path just described.\n\nThe final output grid is:\n\nRow 1:  `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow 2:  `8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow 3:  `8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow 4:  `8,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2`  \nRow 5:  `8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow 6:  `8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow 7:  `8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8`  \nRow 8:  `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8`  \nRow 9:  `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8`  \nRow10: `2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8`  \nRow11: `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8`  \nRow12: `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8`  \nRow13: `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8`  \nRow14: `8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8`  \nRow15: `8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow16: `8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow17: `8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow18: `8,3,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2`  \nRow19: `8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow20: `8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow21: `8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \nRow22: `8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8`  \nRow23: `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8`  \nRow24: `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8`  \nRow25: `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8`  \nRow26: `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8`  \nRow27: `2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8`  \nRow28: `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8`  \n\nSo the **completed output grid** is:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8  \n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8  \n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8  \n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,3,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "To transform the grids I first replace every `1` with `2`, leaving other non\u2011background colours unchanged. Then I take the single `3` in the input as the start of a path.\n\nIn the provided examples with horizontal bands of 2s, the path runs mostly downward in a zig\u2011zag that stays in empty (8) cells, avoiding the spans of 2s. For each horizontal band of 2s I choose a free column on the available side (left if there is no room on the right, right if there is no room on the left, alternating sides when both are available); the first choices are taken one cell inside the free region and then reused if still free. The first horizontal segment of the path is drawn two rows below the seed. Subsequent horizontal segments are drawn roughly midway between successive obstacle rows, connecting from the column used for the previous band to the column chosen for the next. Vertical segments connect these horizontal runs. The path then continues vertically past the last band to the bottom of the grid, always leaving existing 2s intact.\n\nApplying this to the test grid (with 1\u21922 applied) gives the following output:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Below I\u2019ll describe the transformation I inferred from the examples and then apply it step\u2011by\u2011step to the test input. At the end I\u2019ll give the full output grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the transformation does\n\nFrom the four solved examples, there are two distinct operations:\n\n1. **Normalize the 1/2 segments.**\n2. **Draw a continuous \u201csnake\u201d of 3s that starts at the original 3 and weaves around the 2\u2011segments on otherwise\u2011empty (8) cells.**\n\n### 1.1. Normalizing 1 and 2\n\nIn all examples:\n\n- Wherever you have a **maximal contiguous segment** (either horizontal or vertical) consisting only of **1s and/or 2s**, the output replaces that entire segment with **2s**.\n\nExamples:\n\n- Example 1:  \n  Input row: `...,1,2,1,2,1,2,1` \u2192 Output: `...,2,2,2,2,2,2,2`.\n- Example 2:  \n  Column with pattern `1,2,2,2,...,1,2,1` \u2192 Output column all 2s.\n- Example 3 and 4: all mixed runs of 1s and 2s become solid 2s.\n\nSo for each grid you:\n- Find every maximal run of cells `{1,2}` (in our test these runs are horizontal).\n- Recolor that whole run to `2`.\n\n### 1.2. Drawing the 3\u2011path (\u201csnake\u201d)\n\nFrom the examples:\n\n- There is a **single starting 3** in the input.\n- In the output you see a **single connected polyline** of 3s that:\n  - Starts from that original 3.\n  - Only travels through background cells (8) in the input (it never overwrites 1 or 2).\n  - Bends at right angles.\n  - Weaves between the 2\u2011segments, roughly changing direction halfway between them in the vertical direction.\n- The examples with horizontal 1/2 segments (Examples 1 and 3) show a vertical-downward snake that:\n  - Goes down from the seed 3.\n  - For each horizontal 2\u2011bar below, if the current column would hit that bar, it:\n    - Chooses a \u201csafe\u201d column on the left or on the right that does not intersect that bar.\n    - Switches columns via a horizontal segment at a row roughly halfway between the last turn and the bar.\n  - Continues downward in the new column.\n- This yields a staircase/zig\u2011zag path of 3s.\n\nFor the **test case**, we are in that same \u201chorizontal\u2011bar\u201d regime:\n\n- Single 3 at the top.\n- Several horizontal 1/2 bars below.\n- So we build one continuous vertical snake of 3s that:\n  - Starts at the top 3.\n  - Goes down.\n  - At each horizontal bar, we detour sideways at a midpoint row so that the vertical segment never passes through the bar\u2019s interval.\n\nConcretely for the test:\n\n- We\u2019ll use **column 2** as our safe **left** column.\n- We\u2019ll use **column 13** as our safe **right** column (seed column 9 plus an offset, staying clear of all 2\u2011bars).\n- We compute \u201cmidpoint rows\u201d between the last turn and each bar\u2019s row and place horizontal 3 segments there when we need to switch columns.\n- All these 3s live on cells that were 8 in the input, so they do not overwrite any 2.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying the transformation to the test input\n\nThe test grid is 28\u00d716.\n\n### 2.1. Identify and normalize 1/2 segments\n\nScan each row for maximal contiguous runs made of 1 or 2:\n\n- **Row 4**:  \n  `8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1`  \n  \u2192 segment from columns 5\u201316 (values 2..2,1)  \n  \u2192 in output, columns 5\u201316 all become 2.\n\n- **Row 10**:  \n  `1,2,1,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \n  \u2192 segment from columns 1\u20137  \n  \u2192 in output, columns 1\u20137 all become 2.\n\n- **Row 18**:  \n  `8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,1,2,1`  \n  \u2192 segment from columns 7\u201316  \n  \u2192 in output, columns 7\u201316 all become 2.\n\n- **Row 27**:  \n  `1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`  \n  \u2192 segment from columns 1\u20139  \n  \u2192 in output, columns 1\u20139 all become 2.\n\nAll other rows have no non\u2011trivial 1/2 segments.\n\nSo **after this step**, the affected rows are:\n\n- Row 4: cols 5\u201316 = 2.\n- Row 10: cols 1\u20137 = 2.\n- Row 18: cols 7\u201316 = 2.\n- Row 27: cols 1\u20139 = 2.\n\nEverything else stays as in the input (8\u2019s and the single 3 at (1,9)).\n\n### 2.2. Horizontal 2\u2011bars (\u201cobstacles\u201d)\n\nWe now treat the normalized 2\u2011runs as horizontal \u201cbars\u201d we must not cross with the 3\u2011snake. We record their row and column intervals:\n\n- Bar A: row 4, columns 5\u201316.\n- Bar B: row 10, columns 1\u20137.\n- Bar C: row 18, columns 7\u201316.\n- Bar D: row 27, columns 1\u20139.\n\n### 2.3. Seed for the 3\u2011snake\n\n- Unique 3 in the input is at **(row 1, col 9)**.\n- We start the path at (1,9).\n\nWe build a continuous path of 3s that moves downward, and at each bar we **change column** at a **midpoint row** so our vertical segment stays clear of that bar\u2019s [L,R].\n\nWe fix:\n\n- Safe left column: **2**.\n- Safe right column: **13** (9 + 4, still within width 16 and off all bars\u2019 intervals when used).\n\nWe process the bars in order of increasing row: A (r=4), B (r=10), C (r=18), D (r=27).\n\nWe maintain:\n\n- `prev_turn_row`: the row where we last made a horizontal turn.\n- `c_cur`: the column of current vertical segment.\n\nInitialize:\n\n- `prev_turn_row = 1`  (the seed\u2019s row),\n- `c_cur = 9`.\n\n---\n\n### 2.4. Detours around each bar\n\n#### Bar A at row 4, interval [5,16]\n\nCurrent vertical column: `c_cur = 9`.  \nCheck: 9 \u2208 [5,16] \u2192 this vertical would hit Bar A, so we must detour.\n\n1. Midpoint row between last turn (row 1) and bar row (4):  \n   \\( h_1 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1 + 4}{2} \\right\\rfloor = 2 \\).\n\n2. Go vertically from row 1 to row 2 in column 9:  \n   - (1,9) already 3 from input,  \n   - set (2,9) = 3.\n\n3. Choose side: Bar A covers [5,16], so only **left** side is safe (cols 1\u20134).  \n   We choose left safe column `c_new = 2`.\n\n4. At row 2, draw a horizontal 3\u2011segment from column 9 to column 2:  \n   - row 2, cols 2\u20139 all become 3.\n\n5. Update state:  \n   - `prev_turn_row = 2`,  \n   - `c_cur = 2`.\n\nNow the vertical of the snake is in column 2 below row 2, which does not intersect Bar A at [5\u201316].\n\n#### Bar B at row 10, interval [1,7]\n\nCheck: current column `c_cur = 2` lies in [1,7] \u2192 would hit Bar B.\n\n1. Midpoint between last turn (row 2) and this bar at row 10:  \n   \\( h_2 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2 + 10}{2} \\right\\rfloor = 6 \\).\n\n2. Go vertically from row 2 to row 6 in column 2:  \n   - set (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2) = 3.\n\n3. Choose side: Bar B covers [1,7], so only **right** side is safe (cols 8\u201316).  \n   We use safe right column `c_new = 13`.\n\n4. At row 6, draw horizontal 3s from col 2 to col 13:  \n   - row 6, cols 2\u201313 = 3.\n\n5. Update:  \n   - `prev_turn_row = 6`,  \n   - `c_cur = 13`.\n\nNow our vertical column is 13, which does not intersect Bar B at row 10.\n\n#### Bar C at row 18, interval [7,16]\n\nCheck: `c_cur = 13` \u2208 [7,16] \u2192 we\u2019d hit Bar C.\n\n1. Midpoint between last turn (row 6) and bar at row 18:  \n   \\( h_3 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{6 + 18}{2} \\right\\rfloor = 12 \\).\n\n2. Go vertically from row 6 to 12 in col 13:  \n   - set (7,13), (8,13), (9,13), (10,13), (11,13), (12,13) = 3.\n\n3. Choose side: Bar C covers [7,16], so only **left** side is safe (cols 1\u20136).  \n   We use left safe column `c_new = 2`.\n\n4. At row 12, draw horizontal 3s from col 13 to col 2:  \n   - row 12, cols 2\u201313 = 3.\n\n5. Update:  \n   - `prev_turn_row = 12`,  \n   - `c_cur = 2`.\n\nNow vertical column 2 avoids Bar C at row 18.\n\n#### Bar D at row 27, interval [1,9]\n\nCheck: `c_cur = 2` \u2208 [1,9] \u2192 again we must detour.\n\n1. Midpoint between last turn (row 12) and bar at row 27:  \n   \\( h_4 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{12 + 27}{2} \\right\\rfloor = 19 \\).\n\n2. Go vertically from row 12 to row 19 in col 2:  \n   - set (13,2), (14,2), (15,2), (16,2), (17,2), (18,2), (19,2) = 3.\n\n3. Choose side: Bar D covers [1,9], so only **right** side is safe (cols 10\u201316).  \n   We stay with safe right column `c_new = 13`.\n\n4. At row 19, draw horizontal 3s from col 2 to col 13:  \n   - row 19, cols 2\u201313 = 3.\n\n5. Update:\n   - `prev_turn_row = 19`,  \n   - `c_cur = 13`.\n\nNow the vertical column is 13, which is safely to the right of Bar D\u2019s [1,9] row.\n\n#### Finish to bottom\n\nAfter the last bar, run the vertical snake straight down to the bottom:\n\n- From row 19 down to row 28 in column 13:  \n  set (20,13)...(28,13) = 3.\n\nThis yields one continuous 3\u2011path:\n\n- (1,9) \u2192 down to (2,9),\n- left to (2,2),\n- down to (6,2),\n- right to (6,13),\n- down to (12,13),\n- left to (12,2),\n- down to (19,2),\n- right to (19,13),\n- down to (28,13).\n\nAt no point does it cross a 2\u2011bar.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Constructing the final grid\n\nNow we overlay:\n\n- The normalized 2\u2011bars from \u00a72.1.\n- The 3\u2011snake from \u00a72.4\u20132.5.\n- All other cells remain 8 from the input.\n\nRow by row:\n\n1.

        "Full raw LLM response": "We first convert every `1` in the input into `2`, leaving existing `2`s unchanged. Then, because the non\u2011background segments are horizontal lines, we construct a zig\u2011zag path of `3`s from the starting `3` at row\u202f1, col\u202f9 down to the bottom edge. We fix a left bypass column `x_left = 2` and compute a right bypass column `x_right = 16` (clamped from the first obstacle\u2019s end+2). For each obstacle row in order (rows\u202f4,\u202f10,\u202f18,\u202f28), we place a horizontal move above it (row\u202f3 for the first, then obstacle row minus\u202f3 for the rest) to whichever bypass column is outside that obstacle\u2019s span, and connect these moves with vertical segments. Finally we run a vertical segment to the bottom.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3",
