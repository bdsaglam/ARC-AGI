It seems like the inputs and outputs are the same size, with shapes made from contiguous blocks of different colors, and the only real difference is the position of these \"yellow\" pixels (represented by the number 4).  My initial observations show that these yellows move, and they're usually inside of other shapes. I've broken down the steps involved:\n\n**1. Analyze the movement:**  The yellow pixels don't seem to just jump randomly, they're more like particles in a tube. They stay within the boundary of the same shape and change its location, but not its size.\n\n**2. Detect the governing rule:** By looking at a few examples, it became clear that the rules are as follows:\n   -   They seem to have \u201cheads\u201d, which dictate a direction for movement, and are usually arranged within the bounding boxes that constitute the different colored shapes. These heads are identifiable by a pattern of blue (1) and red (2) pixels. I figured that the arrangement of these color pixels within the head pattern gives direction.\n   -   From the \u201chead\u201d, yellow pixels move horizontally or vertically until they hit the boundary of the shape.\n   -   The \"boundary\" is the same color as the shape itself.\n   - The dot stops at the last empty location before hitting a wall.\n  \n**3. Decipher the direction:**  I need to interpret the arrangement of blue (1) and red (2) pixels to find the head position, which then determines a direction. In the shapes, the number 2 is acting as an arrow, so, I figured out that if the heads arrangement is 1,1,2, then the direction is Right (like the arrow). If the arrangement is 2,1,1, the direction is Left (like the arrow).\n\n**4. Build a test:**  I will start by finding all yellow pixels (4s) in the test input, then trace their path based on the rule. It appears that the dots are not moving to empty spots, but to empty adjacent (or diagonal) locations within the \"pipe\" (area of same shape).\n\n**5. Applying the rules and Output:** Then, based on the positions of the yellow pixels, I'll then construct the output by placing all the yellow pixels in their final destination. The dots don't block each other.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the final positions of yellow pixels (represented by the integer 4) within a grid containing various shapes.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Shapes and Containers:** The grid contains static structures made of specific colors (Magenta 6 and Green 3 in the test input). These structures act as containers or obstacles. The yellow pixels (4) are located inside the empty spaces (0) within these structures.\n\n2.  **Identify Directional Indicators (\"Heads\"):** Each colored structure has a specific \"Head\" block containing a pattern of Blue (1) and Red (2) pixels. These patterns define a movement direction vector for the yellow pixels within that color's shape. The vector points from the average position of the Blue pixels (1) towards the average position of the Red pixels (2).\n\n    *   **Magenta Shape (6):** The head is in the top-left corner.\n        *   Red pixels (2) are in Row 1.\n        *   Blue pixels (1) are in Rows 2 and 3.\n        *   The Red pixels are above the Blue pixels.\n        *   **Direction:** **UP** (Vector: -1, 0).\n\n    *   **Green Shape (3):** The head is in the bottom-right quadrant (rows 14-19, cols 13-19).\n        *   Red pixels (2) are at (15,16) and (16,14). Average Row ~15.5, Average Col ~15.\n        *   Blue pixels (1) are at (16,17), (17,15), (17,18), (18,16). Average Row ~17, Average Col ~16.5.\n        *   The Red pixels are Above and to the Left of the Blue pixels.\n        *   **Direction:** **UP-LEFT** (Vector: -1, -1).\n\n3.  **Apply Movement:** Each yellow pixel (4) moves in the direction determined by its enclosing shape's color. It travels in a straight line (or diagonal) through the empty space (0) until it hits a wall (a pixel of the shape's color). The pixel stops at the last empty spot before the wall.\n\n    *   **Dot 1 at (5, 16) [Magenta]:** Moves UP.\n        *   Path: (4,16) is 0. (3,16) is 6 (Wall).\n        *   **Final Position:** (4, 16).\n\n    *   **Dot 2 at (7, 9) [Green]:** Moves UP-LEFT.\n        *   Path: (6,8) is 0 -> (5,7) is 0 -> (4,6) is 3 (Wall).\n        *   **Final Position:** (5, 7).\n\n    *   **Dot 3 at (8, 11) [Green]:** Moves UP-LEFT.\n        *   Path: (7,10) is 0 -> (6,9) is 0 -> (5,8) is 0 -> (4,7) is 0 -> (3,6) is 3 (Wall).\n        *   **Final Position:** (4, 7).\n\n    *   **Dot 4 at (8, 18) [Magenta]:** Moves UP.\n        *   Path: (7,18) is 0 ... -> (2,18) is 0 -> (1,18) is 6 (Wall).\n        *   **Final Position:** (2, 18).\n\n    *   **Dot 5 at (13, 6) [Green]:** Moves UP-LEFT.\n        *   Path: (12,5) is 0 -> (11,4) is 3 (Wall).\n        *   **Final Position:** (12, 5).\n\n    *   **Dot 6 at (17, 5) [Green]:** Moves UP-LEFT.\n        *   Path: (16,4) is 0 -> (15,3) is 0 -> (14,2) is 3 (Wall).\n        *   **Final Position:** (15, 3).\n\n4.  **Construct Output:** Create the final grid by moving the yellow pixels to their new calculated positions and clearing their original positions (unless a new pixel lands there).\n\n**Output Grid:**\n6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,6,0,4,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,6,6,6,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,0,4,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,0,6\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n<REASONING_MODEL_B model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_1_step_1\">\nThe solved examples show that the digits\u202f1 and\u202f2 embedded in a coloured region encode a direction: the vector from the centroid of the 1s to the centroid of the 2s (normalized to \u22121, 0, 1 steps) gives the movement direction for 4s associated with that colour. For each grid, determine the direction for each colour with an embedded 1/2 pattern. Then, for each 4, choose the colour of the nearest non\u2011zero cell and move the 4 one step at a time along that colour\u2019s direction through empty cells until the next step would hit any non\u2011zero; place the 4 in the last empty cell and clear its original position.\n\nIn the test grid, the 1/2 pattern in the 6\u2011coloured block points upward, and the pattern in the 3\u2011coloured block points up\u2011left.

The core seems to be predicting the movement of some special pixel (the \"agent\") within a grid, based on the grid's initial state and some encoded \"clue\" within the same grid. I'm going to start by breaking down each example, identify the core elements, and look for patterns. The dimensions of the input/output grids (20x20) are the same, which is good.\n\n**Example 1 Breakdown**\n\nExample 1 is where I am starting, and this grid seems to contain several distinct objects, so I need to understand them.  The pixels have colors (numbers), and some groups look like \"objects\" because they are made of connected pixels of the same color.  I'm trying to figure out which pixels are important to figure out how other pixels move.\n\n*   **Identifying the Objects**:\n    *   Top-left: There's a 5x5 box with an inner pattern. Seems important. Color 7 (orange).\n    *   Top-right: Another 5x5 box, but color 5 (grey) with a different inner pattern. Still important, I think.\n    *   Center: A more irregular shape, also color 7. This is the \"room\".\n    *   There is a yellow pixel at (6,9) that seems to move. It's inside the room made of color 7.\n*   **The Yellow Pixel Agent**:  I can see that a yellow pixel (color 4) is moving. It goes from (6, 9) to (6, 11). Another one at (10, 4) goes to (10, 8). Interesting that they always move horizontally right.\n*   **Key Idea: Structure and Movement**: The yellow agents seem to be confined within the orange (7) structures and move. The patterns inside the 5x5 boxes might relate to that movement.\n\n**Analyzing the \"Keys\" (Inner Patterns in 5x5 Boxes)**\n\nThe patterns inside those 5x5 boxes in Example 1, or those \"keys\", have to have some meaning. I'm going to look deeper into it.\n\n*   Orange Key (Color 7): Inside pattern of `1, 1, 2`. Blue (1) and Red (2).  Are they telling the pixels what to do?\n*   Grey Key (Color 5): `2, 1, 1`. The pixel that moves in grey enclosure.\n\nMy first guess is that the key inside each structure (5x5 box) might directly influence the motion of the agent inside each respective structure (room). Let's see if that's what's going on.\n\n**Hypothesis: Key-Based Movement**\n\n*   I'm thinking the 1s and 2s are directions. Maybe 2 means \"right\" and 1 \"stay\" or something. This does seem consistent with the movements in the Orange key (Right) and Grey key (Left).\n\n**Further Analysis and Refinement**\n\nOkay, there is more that I can tell now:\n\n*   The Orange pixel (moved right): Input: (6, 9) Output: (6, 11), +2. (10, 4) -> (10, 8) +4. The key is `1,1,2`, so 2 is associated with +2.  Seems that there could be some formula to get that value.\n*   The grey pixel (moving left): Input: (15, 4) to (15, 2) to get -2, and (16, 13) to (16, 7) to get -6 or -4 (this one is confusing). The key is `2,1,1` so 2 is associated with -2 and -4.\n\nIs there a pattern? Ok, The orange agents moved to adjacent walls, so 2 can also mean slide to the right wall, which is +2 and +4 from where they started. The grey agents moved until they hit a left wall: -2 and -6, where 6,18 ->7? Or is this relative? I am still not clear on what's going on here.\n\n**Checking the Walls**\n\nOkay, I need to see what this has to do with walls:\n\n*   The Orange pixels move to the right until they hit a wall.\n*   The Grey pixels move to the left until they hit a wall.\n*   The 2s in the keys seem to be linked to the movements\n\nBased on the solved examples, the puzzle logic is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Structures**: The grid contains structures made of specific colors (e.g., Pink/6, Green/3, Orange/7, Grey/5). Inside these structures or bounded areas, there are yellow pixels (value 4) which act as \"agents\".\n\n2.  **Identify Keys**: For each structure color, there is a distinct rectangular \"key\" block (usually 5x5 or similar) that contains the structure's color and a pattern of inner pixels with values 1 (Blue) and 2 (Red).\n    *   **Direction Decoding**: The position of the **Red (2)** pixels within the key's interior determines the direction of movement for the agents of that color.\n        *   If '2' is on the **Right** (relative to the key's center), the direction includes **Right**.\n        *   If '2' is on the **Left**, the direction includes **Left**.\n        *   If '2' is at the **Top**, the direction includes **Up**.\n        *   If '2' is at the **Bottom**, the direction includes **Down**.\n        *   If there are multiple '2's, the directions are combined (e.g., Top and Left becomes Up-Left).\n\n3.  **Apply Transformation**: All yellow agents (4) associated with a structure color move in the decoded direction until they act adjacent to a wall (a pixel of the structure's color or the grid boundary). They \"slide\" in the given direction as far as possible without overlapping a wall.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Pink Structure (Color 6)**:\n    *   **Key**: The 5x5 box at the top-left (Rows 0-4, Cols 0-4).\n    *   **Pattern**: Row 1 of the interior (Grid Row 1) contains `2, 6, 2`. The '2's are at the top-left and top-right of the interior.\n    *   **Direction**: The '2's are in the top row, signifying **UP**. (The Left/Right components cancel out or imply a spread that defaults to the vertical component 'Up' as seen in Example 1).\n    *   **Agents**:\n        *   Agent at (5, 16): Moves **UP** until adjacent to the wall at (3, 16). New position: **(4, 16)**.\n        *   Agent at (8, 18): Moves **UP** until adjacent to the wall at (1, 18). New position: **(2, 18)**.\n\n*   **Green Structure (Color 3)**:\n    *   **Key**: The 5x7 block at the bottom-right (Rows 15-19, Cols 13-19).\n    *   **Pattern**: Row 15 (Top of block) has a '2' at the center (`...3,2,3...`). Row 16 has a '2' at the left (`...2,3...`).\n    *   **Direction**: The '2's indicate **UP** and **LEFT**. Combined direction: **UP-LEFT** (Diagonal).\n    *   **Agents**:\n        *   Agent at (7, 9): Moves **UP-LEFT** (diagonal steps) -> (6, 8) -> (5, 7). The next step (4, 6) is a wall (3). New position: **(5, 7)**.\n        *   Agent at (8, 11): Moves **UP-LEFT** -> (7, 10) -> (6, 9) -> (5, 8) -> (4, 7). The next step (3, 6) is a wall. New position: **(4, 7)**.\n        *   Agent at (13, 6): Moves **UP-LEFT** -> (12, 5). The next step (11, 4) is a wall. New position: **(12, 5)**.\n        *   Agent at (17, 5): Moves **UP-LEFT** -> (16, 4) -> (15, 3). The next step (14, 2) is a wall. New position: **(15, 3)**.\n\n**Completed Output:**\n\n6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,6,0,4,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,6,6,6,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,0,4,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,0,6\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n</REASONING_MODEL_C>\n<REASONING_MODEL_D model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_3_step_3\">\nLooking at this problem, I need to analyze the solved examples to understand the transformation pattern.\n\n**Key observations from examples:**\n\n1.

In all three examples nothing but the cells of colour\u202f4 ever moved. The rest of each grid was untouched. The movement was not arbitrary: in each training example the small pattern of 1s and 2s embedded in the main coloured region defines a direction vector \u2013 the vector from the average position of the 1s to the average position of the 2s. For the left blue 7\u2011region in example\u202f1 that vector points right; for the red 5\u2011region it points left. In example\u202f2 the 1\u21922 vector points down\u2011right; in example\u202f3 it points straight down.\n\nEach 4 is associated with the nearest \u201cbase\u201d colour (any non\u2011zero colour other than 1,\u202f2 or 4). It is then slid step by step along that base colour\u2019s arrow direction until the next cell in that direction would be outside the grid or non\u2011zero; it stops on the last zero before that obstacle.

Moving each 4 along its assigned direction until just before the first non\u2011zero yields the output below.\n\nOutput grid:\n6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,6,0,4,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,6,6,6,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,0,4,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,0,6\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n</REASONING_MODEL_G>\n<REASONING_MODEL_H model_id=\"gpt-5.1-high_3_step_3\">\nFrom the three solved examples, the only cells that ever change are those of color 4.  \nAll other colors remain fixed. So the task is: **move each 4 to a new position**, according to a rule.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Finding the direction of motion\n\nIn each training task there are small patterns of 1s and 2s embedded inside a larger region of a single main color:\n\n- Example 1: 1s and 2s inside a big 7\u2013region and a big 5\u2013region.\n- Example 2: 1s and 2s inside a 5\u2013region.\n- Example 3: 1s and 2s inside a 5\u2013region.\n\nThe layout of 1s and 2s encodes a **direction vector**:\n\n- Compute the average position (barycenter) of all 1s in that region.\n- Compute the average position of all 2s in the same region.\n- The vector from the 1\u2011barycenter to the 2\u2011barycenter, reduced to signs of components, gives a discrete direction \\(D = (\\text{sign}(\\Delta r), \\text{sign}(\\Delta c))\\), which is one of\n  \\((0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0),(1,1),(-1,1),(1,-1),(-1,-1)\\).\n\nChecking the examples:\n\n- Example 1:\n  - In the left 7\u2011region, 1s are left of 2s \u21d2 \\(D = (0, +1)\\) (east).\n  - In the right 5\u2011region, 1s are right of 2s \u21d2 \\(D = (0, -1)\\) (west).\n  - 4s near the 7\u2011region move horizontally right; 4s near the 5\u2011region move horizontally left.\n- Example 2:\n  - 1s lie up\u2011left of 2s inside the 5\u2011block \u21d2 \\(D = (1,1)\\) (down\u2011right).\n  - Each 4 moves down\u2011right along that diagonal.\n- Example 3:\n  - 1s are above 2s \u21d2 \\(D = (1,0)\\) (down).\n  - Each 4 moves straight downward.\n\nSo: **each main colored region that contains 1s and 2s has its own direction \\(D\\) from 1s to 2s.**\n\n---\n\n## 2. How the 4s move along that direction\n\nFor each 4:\n\n1. Decide which main region it belongs to by the **nearest non\u2011zero color** (other than 4) around it.  \n   In the examples this always correctly assigns 4s to the nearest large 7/5/5 block.\n2. Take that region\u2019s direction vector \\(D\\).\n3. Starting from the 4\u2019s position, walk step\u2011by\u2011step along \\(D\\) (adding \\((dr,dc)\\) to the coordinates).\n4. As long as you are on 0s, keep going.\n5. When you reach the **first non\u2011zero cell** (in all examples this is in the main region\u2019s color), stop.  \n   Place the 4 on the **last 0 cell before that non\u2011zero**.\n6. The original 4 position becomes 0.\n\nThis reproduces all the example outputs:\n\n- Example 2, 4 at (10,4):\n  - \\(D=(1,1)\\). Path: (11,5)=0, (12,6)=0, (13,7)=5 \u21d2 stop; put 4 at (12,6).\n- Example 3, 4 at (7,6):\n  - \\(D=(1,0)\\). Path: (8,6)=0, (9,6)=0, (10,6)=0, (11,6)=5 \u21d2 stop; put 4 at (10,6).\n- Example 1:\n  - Left\u2011region \\(D=(0,1)\\), right\u2011region \\(D=(0,-1)\\).  \n    E.g. 4 at (11,5) in 7\u2011region: rightwards 0,0,0, then 7 at (11,10) \u21d2 place 4 at (11,9).\n\n---\n\n## 3.

It's about taking grids with shapes made of colors and transforming them, focusing on small pixels, often yellow \"4\"s, that seem to move. The goal is to figure out the rule.\n\nI start by looking at examples. I see shapes of different colors, and then \"keys\". These keys are small rectangular blocks with interior patterns. The yellow pixels are *inside* larger shapes that seem to be the same color as the borders of these key blocks. The output shows the yellow pixels moving or changing.\n\nI analyze Example 1. There are shapes and keys, with some colored pixels inside them. I find patterns in the key blocks: they seem to have blue (1) and red (2) pixels. The outputs make it look like those yellow dots, inside some color shape, move relative to some key, often to an empty space.\n\nI hypothesize that the keys are somehow related to the movement of these yellow pixels. I investigate the position of pixels within the shapes and compare to positions in the key, but it doesn't work directly because the shapes are irregular.\n\nThen, I analyze the yellow dot movement. In Example 1, some move right, and some move left. In the key, there are blue(1) and red(2) pixels. The pixels 1 and 2, which are the interiors of the blocks, appear to determine the direction the dots move. I notice how the \"2\" pixel is on the right for one key and the left for the other.\n\nThis leads me to the idea that the number and position of 1s and 2s in these \"key\" blocks have meaning. I check sums of these blocks. The total numbers don't matter.\n\nI check Example 1 and find:\n- Orange is associated with moving dots right. The Key is 1,1,2 (right).\n- Grey is associated with moving dots left. The Key is 2,1,1 (left).\n\nI think the 1 and 2 locations in those rectangular \"Key\" blocks, determine the shift direction for the dots.\n\nThen, I check to see if the key can have a 5x7 block, in which the \"2\" is on the bottom-right. Example 2 confirms this pattern because the dots moves diagonally down and to the right.\n\nTo find the exact shift vector, I make this hypothesis: The direction is related to the location of the 1s and 2s in those \"key\" blocks. I propose to calculate the vector between the centroids (average position) of the 1s and the 2s to determine the \"gravity\" or direction the yellow dots should go, within a given shape.\n\nIn Example 2, this hypothesis explains why the yellow dots shift down-right.\n\nNext, I check Example 3 and see if this vector approach holds. The Example 3 Key is a similar situation where the 2s are at the bottom of the Key. The dots in Example 3 are moved down. I apply the same hypothesis.\n\nNow I look for a refined rule:\n1.  **Find the \"Key\" block.** It has a border color C and an interior of 1s and 2s.\n2.  **Determine the movement vector (V).** It is derived from centroid of 1s to centroid of 2s, V = Centroid(2) - Centroid(1).\n3.  **Find the direction (D).** Simplify from the vector's coordinates, for example (0,+2) -> (Up), (+1,0) -> (Right), (1,1) -> (Down-Right).\n4.  **For all yellow pixels.** They move until they hit a wall. Stop when 8-way adjacent to a wall.\n\nI check this new rule in my examples and test it out.\n\nThen I get to the Test Input and use all I've found to solve it. I use the previous examples to decode how the yellow pixels shift. I get all the new positions.\n\n\nThe transformation rule involves moving the yellow pixels (4) inside the hollow colored shapes. The direction of movement is determined by a \"key\" block of the same color.\n\n**1. Identifying the Keys and Directions:**\n*   **Orange Key (Color 6):** Located at the top-left (Rows 0-4, Cols 0-4).\n    *   Interior Logic: We calculate the vector from the centroid of `1`s (Blue) to the centroid of `2`s (Red).\n    *   `1`s are at rows 2 and 3. Average Row \u2248 2.5.\n    *   `2`s are at row 1. Average Row = 1.\n    *   Vector direction is Up (Row 1 < Row 2.5).\n    *   **Rule for Orange Shapes:** Move yellow dots **UP** until they are adjacent to an orange wall.\n\n*   **Green Key (Color 3):** Located at the bottom-right (Rows 14-19, Cols 13-19).\n    *   Interior Logic:\n        *   `2`s are at local coordinates (1,3) and (2,1). Average Row \u2248 1.5, Average Col \u2248 2.\n        *   `1`s are at local coordinates (2,4), (3,2), (3,5), (4,3). Average Row \u2248 3, Average Col \u2248 3.5.\n    *   Vector direction (from `1`s to `2`s): Row decreases (Up), Col decreases (Left).\n    *   **Rule for Green Shapes:** Move yellow dots **UP-LEFT** (diagonally) until they are adjacent to a green wall.\n\n**2. Applying the Rules to Yellow Dots:**\n\n*   **Orange Shape (Top Right Loop):**\n    *   Dot at **(5, 16)**: Moves Up. Wall at (3, 16). Stops at **(4, 16)**.\n    *   Dot at **(8, 18)**: Moves Up. Wall at (1, 18). Stops at **(2, 18)**.\n\n*   **Green Shape (Large Central Loop):**\n    *   Dot at **(7, 9)**: Moves Up-Left. Path: (6,8) -> (5,7). Wall at (5,6). Stops at **(5, 7)**.\n    *   Dot at **(8, 11)**: Moves Up-Left. Path: (7,10) -> (6,9) -> (5,8) -> (4,7). Wall at (4,6). Stops at **(4, 7)**.\n    *   Dot at **(13, 6)**: Moves Up-Left. Path: (12,5). Wall at (12,4). Stops at **(12, 5)**.\n    *   Dot at **(17, 5)**: Moves Up-Left. Path: (16,4) -> (15,3). Wall at (15,2). Stops at **(15, 3)**.\n\n**3.

So final is (12,6).\n  - (16,12) \u2192 (17,13) (0) \u2192 next (18,14)=5. Final is (17,13).\n\n- **Example 3**\n\n  The 1/2 motif in the top\u2011right is vertical: 1s above, 2s below in the same columns, so axis is **vertical**. The direction from 1s to 2s is **downward**.\n\n  For each 4, we:\n  - Move straight **down** through zeros.\n  - Stop on the last zero before the first non\u2011zero below.\n\n  Check:\n  - Column 6: 4 at (7,6), below: 0,0,0,5 \u2192 stop at (10,6).  \n  - Column 7: 4 at (14,7), below: 0,0,0,0,0,5 \u2192 stop at (19,7).  \n  - Column 11: 4 at (14,11), below: 0,0,0,5 \u2192 stop at (17,11).\n\n  In all cases the final 4 is immediately above a 5.\n\nSo the **rule** that fits all training examples is:\n\n> 1. Use the arrangement of 1s/2s to pick a single global direction vector D (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).  \n> 2. For each 4, repeatedly step one cell along D as long as the next cell is 0.  \n> 3. Stop when the next cell along D is non\u2011zero or outside the grid.  \n> 4. Place the 4 at the last 0 you visited (its new position).  \n>    (If the next cell from the starting position is already non\u2011zero, the 4 does not move.)\n\nAfter movement, each 4 sits on a 0\u2011cell which has a non\u2011zero neighbor exactly one step in direction D.\n\n---\n\n### Applying the rule to the test input\n\nFirst identify the direction from the 1/2 patterns.\n\nIn the test grid:\n\n- Top\u2011left around the 6\u2011frame:\n  - Column 2: row2=2, rows3\u20134=1 \u2192 2 above 1s \u2192 vertical.\n  - Column 4: same structure.\n- Bottom\u2011right inside the 3\u2011area:\n  - Column 17: row16=2, row19=1 \u2192 again 2 above 1.\n\nSo in both regions the 2s are **above** 1s in the same column. That matches the vertical **downward** direction from 2 to 1, exactly like in Example 3.  \nTherefore, the global direction D for this puzzle is:\n\n> **Downwards** (dr=+1, dc=0)\n\nNow process each 4.\n\nThe original 4s are at:\n\n- A: (6,17)\n- B: (8,10)\n- C: (9,12)\n- D: (9,19)\n- E: (14,7)\n- F: (18,6)\n\nWe use the original grid, move every 4 **straight down** through zeros, and stop at the last zero before a non\u2011zero.\n\n---\n\n#### A: 4 at (6,17)\n\nColumn 17 values (rows 1\u219220):\n\n`[0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 3, 3, 1, 3]`\n\nFrom row 6:\n\n- row7,col17 = 6 (non\u2011zero) immediately below.\n\nSo there is **no zero below** it; it already sits directly on top of a non\u2011zero.  \nBy the rule, A does **not move**: stays at (6,17).\n\n---\n\n#### B: 4 at (8,10)\n\nColumn 10 values (rows 1\u219220):\n\n`[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]`\n\nFrom (8,10):\n\n- row9,col10 = 0 \u2192 can move down.\n- row10,col10 = 3 (non\u2011zero) \u2192 barrier.\n\nSo we stop on the last 0 before the 3, at row 9.  \nB moves: **(8,10) \u2192 (9,10)**.\n\n---\n\n#### C: 4 at (9,12)\n\nColumn 12 values:\n\n`[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom (9,12):\n\n- row10,col12 = 3 (non\u2011zero) directly below.\n\nSo no zero below; C does **not move**: stays at **(9,12)**.\n\n---\n\n#### D: 4 at (9,19)\n\nColumn 19 values:\n\n`[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3]`\n\nFrom (9,19):\n\n- row10,col19 = 0 \u2192 can move down.\n- row11,col19 = 6 (non\u2011zero) \u2192 barrier.\n\nSo D moves to row 10: **(9,19) \u2192 (10,19)**.\n\n---\n\n#### E: 4 at (14,7)\n\nColumn 7 values:\n\n`[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]`\n\nFrom (14,7):\n\n- row15,col7 = 0\n- row16,col7 = 0\n- row17,col7 = 0\n- row18,col7 = 0\n- row19,col7 = 0\n- row20,col7 = 3 (non\u2011zero)\n\nSo we slide all the way to row 19, the last 0 before the 3 at row 20:  \nE moves: **(14,7) \u2192 (19,7)**.\n\n---\n\n#### F: 4 at (18,6)\n\nColumn 6 values:\n\n`[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3]`\n\nFrom (18,6):\n\n- row19,col6 = 3 (non\u2011zero) just below.\n\nSo F does **not move**, stays at **(18,6)**.\n\n---\n\n### Constructing the output grid\n\nWe start from the input grid, turn the original 4\u2011cells to 0, then set 4 at the new positions:\n\n- (6,17): remains 4 (unchanged)\n- (8,10): becomes 0 (B moved)\n- (9,12): remains 4\n- (9,19): becomes 0\n- (10,19): becomes 4\n- (14,7): becomes 0 (E moved)\n- (18,6): remains 4\n- (19,7): becomes 4\n\nAll other cells stay as they are.\n\nFinal output grid:\n\nRow1:  `6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow2:  `6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6`  \nRow3:  `6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,6,0,0,6`  \nRow4:  `6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6`  \nRow5:  `6,6,6,6,6,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,0,0,0,0,6`  \nRow6:  `0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,4,0,0,6`  \nRow7:  `0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6`  \nRow8:  `0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6`  \nRow9:  `0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6`  \nRow10: `0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,4,6`  \nRow11: `0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6`  \nRow12: `0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow13: `0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow14: `0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow15: `0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3`  \nRow16: `0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3`  \nRow17: `0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3`  \nRow18: `0,0,3,3,0,4,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3`  \nRow19: `0,0,0,3,3,3,4,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3`  \nRow20: `0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3`\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 3>\n<CANDIDATE 4>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 20x20\n66666000000000000000\n62626003333333006666\n61616003000003006046\n61616033000003666606\n66666030000033604006\n00000030000030600006\n00333330000033666006\n00340000000003306006\n00334000000003306006\n00033333333333006606\n00003333333000000666\n00003400003000000000\n00003000003000000000\n00033000003000000000\n00330000003003333333\n00300000033003332333\n00300000030003233133\n00330000030003313313\n00033340330003331333\n00000333300003333333\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_1_step_1\">\nLooking at this puzzle, I need to identify the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\nIn each example, I notice:\n1.

If an axis is ambiguous, the 4 is slid to the farther end along that axis, as seen in example\u202f1.\n\nFor each 4, starting from its current position, step cell by cell in the determined direction through zeros until the next step would hit a non\u2011zero cell or go out of bounds; place the 4 in the last zero before that obstacle, and clear its original position.\n\nIn the test grid the 2s are on average above and to the left of the 1s, so the direction is up\u2011left (row\u202f\u22121, col\u202f\u22121).

In each training pair there is at least one **5\u00d75 \u201cframe\u201d** made of some color \\(B\\) (7, 5, 3 or 6) with digits 1 and 2 embedded.\n2. The arrangement of the 1\u2019s and 2\u2019s in that 5\u00d75 block encodes a **direction vector**:\n   - Compute the centroid of all 1\u2019s and the centroid of all 2\u2019s in that 5\u00d75.\n   - The vector from the 1\u2011centroid to the 2\u2011centroid gives a direction \\(D_B\\) \u2208 {(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1), (-1,-1), (1,1), (-1,1), (1,-1)} after normalization to unit steps.\n3. The only cells that change are the **4\u2019s**. For each relevant color \\(B\\):\n   - Look along the line through a 4 in direction \\(D_B\\) and in direction \\(-D_B\\).\n   - If in both directions you eventually hit a cell of color \\(B\\), and *all* cells strictly between the 4 and those B\u2019s are either 0 or 4, then the 4 lies in a **\u201ccorridor\u201d of zeros between two B\u2019s** along direction \\(D_B\\).\n   - That 4 is associated with color \\(B\\).\n4. For each such 4, you then **slide it along the direction \\(D_B\\)** (from 1s towards 2s), moving step by step through zeros, and stop at the last 0 just before the first non\u2011zero cell in that direction.\n\nThis rule explains all three training examples:\n\n- Example 1:\n  - Two 5\u00d75 frames:\n    - Color 7 frame: 1\u2019s cluster left, 2\u2019s cluster right \u2192 \\(D_7 = (0,+1)\\) (east).\n    - Color 5 frame (on the right): 1\u2019s right, 2\u2019s left \u2192 \\(D_5 = (0,-1)\\) (west).\n  - Each 4 lies in a horizontal zero corridor between two 7\u2019s or two 5\u2019s.  \n    It is slid horizontally in the direction of the corresponding arrow (east for 7, west for 5), exactly matching the output.\n\n- Example 2:\n  - Single 5\u00d75 frame of color 5 with arrow down\u2011right: centroid(1) \u2192 centroid(2) \u2248 (1.5,1.5) \u2192 \\(D_5 = (1,1)\\).\n  - Each 4 sits in a diagonal corridor between two 5\u2019s along that diagonal; they slide down\u2011right until just before the next 5.\n\n- Example 3:\n  - Single 5\u00d75 frame of color 5 with arrow straight down: \\(D_5 = (1,0)\\).\n  - Each 4 lies in a vertical zero corridor between two 5\u2019s; they slide straight down until they rest just above the lower 5\u2011segment.\n\nSo: **\u201cThe 5\u00d75 1/2\u2011pattern acts like an arrow; 4\u2019s in B\u2011colored corridors slide in that arrow\u2019s direction until they hit the B\u2011structure.\u201d**\n\n---\n\n## Applying to the test input\n\n### 1.

The main thing I'm picking up on is the yellow pixels (color 4) that are doing some kind of movement.  In the examples, it looks like these yellow pixels are *contained* within shapes and then *relocate*. There are also these \"reference boxes\" which could hold the key. Let's dig in.\n\n**Analyzing Example 1 and Hypothesizing the Core Logic:**\n\nExample 1 has shapes with colors 7 and 5, and the key is tracing the yellow pixels (4). They seem to move horizontally, sometimes left, sometimes right. Then, there's a connection to shapes around those 4 pixels. The 7 and 5 shapes each appear with inside a smaller shape:  a box with 1's and 2's.\n\nI hypothesize that the 4s move relative to these boxes. The content of those little boxes (with the 1's and 2's inside the larger ones) may be dictating the move. The 1s represent an empty space. Maybe the 2's indicate a shift?\n\n**More Hypothesis Refinement Based on Example 1:**\n\nI am seeing clear movement based on the 1s and the 2s and the enclosed shapes. The 2s in these \"reference\" boxes are actually indicating the *direction* of movement for the 4s. The 4s move to the end of open space in that direction, based on the shape color.\n\n*   If the 2 is on the right, the 4 moves right.\n*   If the 2 is on the left, the 4 moves left.\n\nThis directional movement seems to be the core idea. I am now looking at coordinates to check this.\n\n**Examining Example 2 for Directional Confirmation:**\n\nExample 2 reinforces the idea of directional movement. I see the same patterns of walls surrounding the 4's. The 4's are no longer just shifting horizontal, now moving diagonal in the example. So, in the new hypothesis. If the pattern is from bottom-right to top-left, the move is UP-LEFT.\n\n**Example 3 and Solidifying the Rule:**\n\nIn Example 3, I am seeing a clear down movement because of the bottom location of the `2` in the reference box. Now I understand: these 1's and 2's point to the *final* location of the yellow pixel (4). This finalizes my understanding of the direction and walls.\n\n**Summary of the Rule:**\n\n1.  Find the \"reference boxes.\"\n2.  Use the `2` relative position (compared to `1`s) inside the box to calculate the direction.\n3.  Move each `4` pixel within the shape in that direction, through any empty space.\n4.  Stop at a \"wall\" or edge.\n\n**Applying the Rule to the Test Input:**\n\nI apply my logic to the input grid. First, I identify the 6 and 3 reference blocks and the 4's location within. The block with the 6's has the 2 on top of the 1s. This means a UP movement. The block with the 3's points also UP. I find the 4's. Then I trace up to the first stopping point (a non-0 or wall) in the path.\n\n**Building the Output:**\n\nI place the new 4 locations, clearing out the originals.\n\n**Final Check and Output:**\n\nOkay, I make some checks again. The numbers make sense. I verify the walls. It looks correct. I create the transformed output grid.\n\n\nThe problem involves moving the yellow pixels (color 4) based on directional cues provided by \"reference blocks\" in the grid.\n\n**Logic:**\n1.  **Reference Blocks:** The grid contains specific rectangular structures (usually 5x5) made of a specific color (e.g., 6 or 3) that act as keys. Inside these blocks, there are pixels of color 1 (blue) and 2 (red). The spatial arrangement of 1s and 2s defines a movement vector:\n    *   The direction is from **1 to 2**.\n    *   In the Test Input, the top-left block (color 6) has 2s in the top row of its interior and 1s below. This indicates a direction of **UP**.\n    *   The bottom-right block (color 3) has 2s in the upper section and 1s in the lower section. This also indicates a direction of **UP**.\n2.  **Movement:** Every yellow pixel (4) is contained within a \"room\" or vertical/horizontal channel defined by one of the reference colors. The yellow pixel moves in the direction specified by its container's color reference block.\n3.  **Pathfinding:** The yellow pixel travels through empty space (0) in the specified direction until it hits a wall (a non-zero pixel). It settles in the last empty cell before the wall.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\nThe direction for both Color 6 and Color 3 enclosures is **UP**.\n\n*   **Pixel at (5, 16)** (inside color 6): Moves UP. The first wall above is at row 3 (color 6). It stops at **(4, 16)**.\n*   **Pixel at (7, 9)** (inside color 3): Moves UP. The first wall above is at row 1 (color 3). It stops at **(2, 9)**.\n*   **Pixel at (8, 11)** (inside color 3): Moves UP. The first wall above is at row 1 (color 3). It stops at **(2, 11)**.\n*   **Pixel at (8, 18)** (inside color 6): Moves UP. The first wall above is at row 1 (color 6). It stops at **(2, 18)**.\n*   **Pixel at (13, 6)** (inside color 3): Moves UP. The first wall above is at row 10 (color 3). It stops at **(11, 6)**.\n*   **Pixel at (17, 5)** (inside color 3): Moves UP. The first wall above is at row 10 (color 3). It stops at **(11, 5)**.\n\nAll original yellow pixels are removed (become 0) and placed at their new coordinates.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,4,0,4,0,3,0,0,6,0,4,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,6,6,6,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,0,4,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,0,6\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,3,4,4,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 7>\n</INPUT_DATA>\n\n<AUDIT_PROTOCOL>\nExecute this pipeline sequentially for every Candidate.

                "response": "**Comprehensive Puzzle Audit - Candidate 0 is the Answer!**\n\nOkay, so the task is to essentially audit the solutions provided for this ARC puzzle.  My initial assessment focuses on understanding the rules through example inputs and outputs.  We're looking at moving yellow pixels (4s) around inside colored regions. The keys lie within these regions - we're looking at blocks of blue (1s) and red (2s), the relative positions determining the movement vector.  I've thoroughly broken down the patterns, the directions (right, left, down, up, and diagonals), and the stop conditions \u2013 which appears to be hitting the region's color wall or a 0.\n\nBased on the example analysis I formulated the hypothesis that the move vector is from the centroid of 1s towards the centroid of 2s in these key blocks, and the 4's move in that direction until they hit an obstacle.\n\nI then did a deep dive into the test input.  I carefully analyzed the structure, focusing on the coordinates within the grid and how the 1s and 2s are arranged. In particular, I went line-by-line in the input data to work out what region belongs to each 4 and which direction it should move.\n\nAfter detailed examination of the 1s and 2s in Region 6 (top-left) in the test input, it was clearly **UP**. Similarly, for Region 3 in the bottom-right, the detailed trace concluded with a direction of **UP-LEFT** after a painstaking trace of the 1s and 2s in this region. This directionality is the key to solving the problem.\n\nThe next step involved the real meat - auditing the given solutions. I traced the paths of each 4 based on the determined directions for each region. The calculations had to be spot-on! This involved verifying the nearest region for each 4, calculating the movement path, and checking the \"wall\" condition (stopping point) at each step.\n\nAt first, I had some missteps due to the indexing (1-based descriptions versus 0-based array access).  I realized it was crucial to be absolutely precise on the coordinate mappings during the trace.  After correcting for this, and tracing all the 4s, I landed on candidate 0 as the best answer.  Reasoning A from candidate 0 proved that the directionality and the stop conditions were consistently used.\nI then performed a crucial audit of the other candidates to compare my work. The directionality of the 4's was the first thing to check.  Candidates 6 and 7 had directional or stop condition logic flaws or hallucinations. Many had completely broken grids. These are all invalid.  I also found Candidate 3 gets the movement direction reversed: it gets the logic backward by inferring DOWN from 2s being above the 1s.  This is wrong because example 3 shows the opposite pattern.  This clearly makes the candidate wrong.\n\nIn the end, only Candidate 0's solution checked out. The others are not consistent with the logic, and many contain significant errors.\n*   **Candidate 0 is the Gold standard.**\n*   Candidate 6,7 is silver or bronze due to minor errors.\n*   The rest are not correct at all.\nThe result is that candidate 0's detailed step-by-step logic matches all the constraints perfectly.  This puzzle is a tricky one to audit, but through careful analysis, it's clear that candidate 0 is the gold standard answer here!\n\n\n<AUDIT_LOG>\n### PHASE 1: LOGIC SELECTION & CRYSTALLIZATION\nSelected Reasoning: **<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_1_step_1\">** from **CANDIDATE 0**.\n\n**Logical Steps:**\n1.  **Identify Reference Blocks:** Locate rectangular structures (frames/boxes) of a specific non-zero color (excluding 4).\n2.  **Decode Direction:** Within each block, identify pixels of color 1 (Blue) and 2 (Red).\n    *   Calculate the centroid of all `1`s.\n    *   Calculate the centroid of all `2`s.\n    *   **Vector D** = Centroid(`2`) - Centroid(`1`).\n    *   Normalize **D** to integer directions {-1, 0, 1} for row/column deltas.\n3.  **Associate Agents:** For every yellow pixel (4), associate it with the color of the Reference Block it is enclosed by or nearest to.\n4.  **Execute Movement:** Move each 4 in direction **D** through empty space (0) until it is adjacent to a non-zero pixel (Wall) in that direction.\n    *   The 4 stops at the last empty cell (0) in the path.\n\n---\n\n### PHASE 2: THE GROUND TRUTH AUDIT (CRITICAL)\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   **Key 7 (Left):** `1`s at Left, `2` at Right. Vector: **Right** (0, +1).\n*   **Key 5 (Right):** `2` at Left, `1`s at Right. Vector: **Left** (0, -1).\n*   **Trace:**\n    *   4s in 7-region move Right until wall. (Check: 4 at (6,9) moves to (6,11), adjacent to 7. Correct).\n    *   4s in 5-region move Left until wall. (Check: 4 at (16,13) moves to (16,7), adjacent to 5. Correct).\n*   **Verdict:** **PASS**.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   **Key 5:** `1`s at Top-Left, `2` at Bottom-Right. Vector: **Down-Right** (+1, +1).\n*   **Trace:** 4s move diagonal Down-Right. (Check: 4 at (10,4) moves to (12,6), adjacent to 5. Correct).\n*   **Verdict:** **PASS**.\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   **Key 5:** `1`s in Row 1,2. `2`s in Row 3. Vector: **Down** (+1, 0).\n*   **Trace:** 4s move Down. (Check: 4 at (7,6) moves to (10,6), adjacent to 5. Correct).\n*   **Verdict:** **PASS**.\n\n---\n\n### PHASE 3: EXECUTION CONSISTENCY\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n1.  **Key 6 (Top-Left):**\n    *   `2`s at Row 1 (relative). `1`s at Row 2,3 (relative).\n    *   Vector: `2` is **Above** `1`. Direction: **UP** (-1, 0).\n2.  **Key 3 (Bottom-Right):**\n    *   `2`s at Col 15,16 (approx row 15/16). `1`s at Col 16-19 (approx row 17-19).\n    *   `2`s are **Above** and **Left** of `1`s.\n    *   Vector: **UP-LEFT** (-1, -1).\n\n**Proposed Moves vs Candidate Grid:**\n*   **Dot (5, 16)** [Region 6]: Move **UP** -> Stop at (4, 16) [Wall at 3].\n    *   Grid Check: Row 4 (Line 5) has a 4 at col 16. **MATCH**.\n*   **Dot (8, 18)** [Region 6]: Move **UP** -> Stop at (2, 18) [Wall at 1].\n    *   Grid Check: Row 2 (Line 3) has a 4 at col 18. **MATCH**.\n*   **Dot (7, 9)** [Region 3]: Move **UP-LEFT** -> Stop at (5, 7) [Wall at 4].\n    *   Grid Check: Row 5 (Line 6) has a 4 at col 7. **MATCH**.\n*   **Dot (8, 11)** [Region 3]: Move **UP-LEFT** -> Stop at (4, 7) [Wall at 3].\n    *   Grid Check: Row 4 (Line 5) has a 4 at col 7. **MATCH**.\n*   **Dot (13, 6)** [Region 3]: Move **UP-LEFT** -> Stop at (12, 5) [Wall at 11].\n    *   Grid Check: Row 12 (Line 13) has a 4 at col 5. **MATCH**.\n*   **Dot (17, 5)** [Region 3]: Move **UP-LEFT** -> Stop at (15, 3) [Wall at 14].\n    *   Grid Check: Row 15 (Line 16) has a 4 at col 3. **MATCH**.\n\n**Verdict:** The candidate correctly identified the logic, correctly calculated the complex vectors (especially Up-Left), correctly identified all 6 dots, and correctly simulated the physics for every dot in the final grid.\n\n---\n\n### PHASE 4: STACK RANKING & TIE-BREAKING\n\n*   **Candidate 0:** **GOLD**. Flawless logic and execution. Reasoning A is the most accurate.\n*   **Candidate 6:** **SILVER**. Logic mostly correct but hallucinated the behavior for the dot at (9,12) (claimed it wouldn't move, but vector was valid).\n*   **Candidate 7:** **BRONZE**. Correctly identified UP vector but missed the LEFT component for the second key, leading to incorrect final positions.\n*   **Candidate 3:** **INVALID**. Inverted the vector logic (thought \"Above\" meant \"Down\" despite Example 1 proving \"1->2\" logic).\n*   **Candidate 1:** **INVALID**. Grid execution is erratic and doesn't follow its own rule.\n*   **Others:** **INVALID**. Failed logic deduction.\n\nCandidate 0 is the robust solution.\n</AUDIT_LOG>\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 10.0,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Perfectly deduced the 'Vector Field' logic defined by the 1/2 pixels and applied the collision physics correctly.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Consistent\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Yellow pixels move in a direction defined by the vector from 1s (tail) to 2s (head) within the enclosing colored shape's key block, stopping at walls.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 6,\n      \"score\": 8.0,\n      \"tier\": \"SILVER\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Logic is generally correct but failed to move one dot (9,12) in the test output due to a calculation error.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Minor Error\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Similar to Candidate 0, but execution on the test grid had a minor hallucination.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 7,\n      \"score\": 4.0,\n      \"tier\": \"BRONZE\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Fail\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Correctly identified vertical movement but missed the horizontal component of the vector in the 3-region (Up-Left vs Up).\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Consistent with Flawed Logic\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Moves pixels based on 1/2 patterns but missed diagonal components.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 3,\n      \"score\": 2.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Fail\",\n          \"2\": \"Fail\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Inverted the vector direction logic (assumed 1 above 2 = Down, contradicting Ex 1).\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 1,\n      \"score\": 1.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Fail\",\n          \"2\": \"Fail\",\n          \"3\": \"Fail\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Grid output is erratic and does not follow the derived rules.\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Movable Particles in Pipes**\n\nOkay, so the challenge here is to figure out how these colored dots are moving around within a grid. It seems like the inputs and outputs are the same size, with shapes made from contiguous blocks of different colors, and the only real difference is the position of these \"yellow\" pixels (represented by the number 4).  My initial observations show that these yellows move, and they're usually inside of other shapes. I've broken down the steps involved:\n\n**1. Analyze the movement:**  The yellow pixels don't seem to just jump randomly, they're more like particles in a tube. They stay within the boundary of the same shape and change its location, but not its size.\n\n**2. Detect the governing rule:** By looking at a few examples, it became clear that the rules are as follows:\n   -   They seem to have \u201cheads\u201d, which dictate a direction for movement, and are usually arranged within the bounding boxes that constitute the different colored shapes. These heads are identifiable by a pattern of blue (1) and red (2) pixels. I figured that the arrangement of these color pixels within the head pattern gives direction.\n   -   From the \u201chead\u201d, yellow pixels move horizontally or vertically until they hit the boundary of the shape.\n   -   The \"boundary\" is the same color as the shape itself.\n   - The dot stops at the last empty location before hitting a wall.\n  \n**3. Decipher the direction:**  I need to interpret the arrangement of blue (1) and red (2) pixels to find the head position, which then determines a direction. In the shapes, the number 2 is acting as an arrow, so, I figured out that if the heads arrangement is 1,1,2, then the direction is Right (like the arrow). If the arrangement is 2,1,1, the direction is Left (like the arrow).\n\n**4. Build a test:**  I will start by finding all yellow pixels (4s) in the test input, then trace their path based on the rule. It appears that the dots are not moving to empty spots, but to empty adjacent (or diagonal) locations within the \"pipe\" (area of same shape).\n\n**5. Applying the rules and Output:** Then, based on the positions of the yellow pixels, I'll then construct the output by placing all the yellow pixels in their final destination. The dots don't block each other.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the final positions of yellow pixels (represented by the integer 4) within a grid containing various shapes.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Shapes and Containers:** The grid contains static structures made of specific colors (Magenta 6 and Green 3 in the test input). These structures act as containers or obstacles. The yellow pixels (4) are located inside the empty spaces (0) within these structures.\n\n2.  **Identify Directional Indicators (\"Heads\"):** Each colored structure has a specific \"Head\" block containing a pattern of Blue (1) and Red (2) pixels. These patterns define a movement direction vector for the yellow pixels within that color's shape. The vector points from the average position of the Blue pixels (1) towards the average position of the Red pixels (2).\n\n    *   **Magenta Shape (6):** The head is in the top-left corner.\n        *   Red pixels (2) are in Row 1.\n        *   Blue pixels (1) are in Rows 2 and 3.\n        *   The Red pixels are above the Blue pixels.\n        *   **Direction:** **UP** (Vector: -1, 0).\n\n    *   **Green Shape (3):** The head is in the bottom-right quadrant (rows 14-19, cols 13-19).\n        *   Red pixels (2) are at (15,16) and (16,14). Average Row ~15.5, Average Col ~15.\n        *   Blue pixels (1) are at (16,17), (17,15), (17,18), (18,16). Average Row ~17, Average Col ~16.5.\n        *   The Red pixels are Above and to the Left of the Blue pixels.\n        *   **Direction:** **UP-LEFT** (Vector: -1, -1).\n\n3.  **Apply Movement:** Each yellow pixel (4) moves in the direction determined by its enclosing shape's color.

The core seems to be predicting the movement of some special pixel (the \"agent\") within a grid, based on the grid's initial state and some encoded \"clue\" within the same grid. I'm going to start by breaking down each example, identify the core elements, and look for patterns. The dimensions of the input/output grids (20x20) are the same, which is good.\n\n**Example 1 Breakdown**\n\nExample 1 is where I am starting, and this grid seems to contain several distinct objects, so I need to understand them.  The pixels have colors (numbers), and some groups look like \"objects\" because they are made of connected pixels of the same color.  I'm trying to figure out which pixels are important to figure out how other pixels move.\n\n*   **Identifying the Objects**:\n    *   Top-left: There's a 5x5 box with an inner pattern. Seems important. Color 7 (orange).\n    *   Top-right: Another 5x5 box, but color 5 (grey) with a different inner pattern. Still important, I think.\n    *   Center: A more irregular shape, also color 7. This is the \"room\".\n    *   There is a yellow pixel at (6,9) that seems to move. It's inside the room made of color 7.\n*   **The Yellow Pixel Agent**:  I can see that a yellow pixel (color 4) is moving. It goes from (6, 9) to (6, 11). Another one at (10, 4) goes to (10, 8). Interesting that they always move horizontally right.\n*   **Key Idea: Structure and Movement**: The yellow agents seem to be confined within the orange (7) structures and move. The patterns inside the 5x5 boxes might relate to that movement.\n\n**Analyzing the \"Keys\" (Inner Patterns in 5x5 Boxes)**\n\nThe patterns inside those 5x5 boxes in Example 1, or those \"keys\", have to have some meaning. I'm going to look deeper into it.\n\n*   Orange Key (Color 7): Inside pattern of `1, 1, 2`. Blue (1) and Red (2).  Are they telling the pixels what to do?\n*   Grey Key (Color 5): `2, 1, 1`. The pixel that moves in grey enclosure.\n\nMy first guess is that the key inside each structure (5x5 box) might directly influence the motion of the agent inside each respective structure (room). Let's see if that's what's going on.\n\n**Hypothesis: Key-Based Movement**\n\n*   I'm thinking the 1s and 2s are directions. Maybe 2 means \"right\" and 1 \"stay\" or something. This does seem consistent with the movements in the Orange key (Right) and Grey key (Left).\n\n**Further Analysis and Refinement**\n\nOkay, there is more that I can tell now:\n\n*   The Orange pixel (moved right): Input: (6, 9) Output: (6, 11), +2. (10, 4) -> (10, 8) +4. The key is `1,1,2`, so 2 is associated with +2.  Seems that there could be some formula to get that value.\n*   The grey pixel (moving left): Input: (15, 4) to (15, 2) to get -2, and (16, 13) to (16, 7) to get -6 or -4 (this one is confusing). The key is `2,1,1` so 2 is associated with -2 and -4.\n\nIs there a pattern? Ok, The orange agents moved to adjacent walls, so 2 can also mean slide to the right wall, which is +2 and +4 from where they started. The grey agents moved until they hit a left wall: -2 and -6, where 6,18 ->7? Or is this relative? I am still not clear on what's going on here.\n\n**Checking the Walls**\n\nOkay, I need to see what this has to do with walls:\n\n*   The Orange pixels move to the right until they hit a wall.\n*   The Grey pixels move to the left until they hit a wall.\n*   The 2s in the keys seem to be linked to the movements\n\nBased on the solved examples, the puzzle logic is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Structures**: The grid contains structures made of specific colors (e.g., Pink/6, Green/3, Orange/7, Grey/5). Inside these structures or bounded areas, there are yellow pixels (value 4) which act as \"agents\".\n\n2.  **Identify Keys**: For each structure color, there is a distinct rectangular \"key\" block (usually 5x5 or similar) that contains the structure's color and a pattern of inner pixels with values 1 (Blue) and 2 (Red).\n    *   **Direction Decoding**: The position of the **Red (2)** pixels within the key's interior determines the direction of movement for the agents of that color.\n        *   If '2' is on the **Right** (relative to the key's center), the direction includes **Right**.\n        *   If '2' is on the **Left**, the direction includes **Left**.\n        *   If '2' is at the **Top**, the direction includes **Up**.\n        *   If '2' is at the **Bottom**, the direction includes **Down**.\n        *   If there are multiple '2's, the directions are combined (e.g., Top and Left becomes Up-Left).\n\n3.  **Apply Transformation**: All yellow agents (4) associated with a structure color move in the decoded direction until they act adjacent to a wall (a pixel of the structure's color or the grid boundary). They \"slide\" in the given direction as far as possible without overlapping a wall.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Pink Structure (Color 6)**:\n    *   **Key**: The 5x5 box at the top-left (Rows 0-4, Cols 0-4).\n    *   **Pattern**: Row 1 of the interior (Grid Row 1) contains `2, 6, 2`. The '2's are at the top-left and top-right of the interior.\n    *   **Direction**: The '2's are in the top row, signifying **UP**. (The Left/Right components cancel out or imply a spread that defaults to the vertical component 'Up' as seen in Example 1).\n    *   **Agents**:\n        *   Agent at (5, 16): Moves **UP** until adjacent to the wall at (3, 16). New position: **(4, 16)**.\n        *   Agent at (8, 18): Moves **UP** until adjacent to the wall at (1, 18). New position: **(2, 18)**.\n\n*   **Green Structure (Color 3)**:\n    *   **Key**: The 5x7 block at the bottom-right (Rows 15-19, Cols 13-19).\n    *   **Pattern**: Row 15 (Top of block) has a '2' at the center (`...3,2,3...`). Row 16 has a '2' at the left (`...2,3...`).\n    *   **Direction**: The '2's indicate **UP** and **LEFT**. Combined direction: **UP-LEFT** (Diagonal).\n    *   **Agents**:\n        *   Agent at (7, 9): Moves **UP-LEFT** (diagonal steps) -> (6, 8) -> (5, 7). The next step (4, 6) is a wall (3). New position: **(5, 7)**.\n        *   Agent at (8, 11): Moves **UP-LEFT** -> (7, 10) -> (6, 9) -> (5, 8) -> (4, 7). The next step (3, 6) is a wall.

There are \"template\" patterns in corners made of solid colored rectangles (5s, 7s, or 6s) containing internal patterns with 1s and 2s.\n\n2. There are irregular regions bounded by the same colors (5s, 7s, etc.) elsewhere in the grid, containing 4s.\n\n3. The transformation moves each 4 within its bounded region based on the template pattern.\n\n4. The direction of movement is determined by the position of 2 relative to 1 in the template:\n   - Example 1: 7-template has \"1,1,2\" (2 is RIGHT of 1s) \u2192 4s in 7-regions move RIGHT\n   - Example 1: 5-template has \"2,1,1\" (2 is LEFT of 1s) \u2192 4s in 5-regions move LEFT\n   - Example 3: 5-template has 2s BELOW 1s \u2192 4s move DOWN\n\n5. The 4 moves in that direction until it's adjacent to the region boundary.\n\n**Applying to test input:**\n\n**Templates identified:**\n- 6-template (top-left): 2s are ABOVE 1s \u2192 direction is UP\n- 3-template (bottom-right): 2s are UP-LEFT of 1s \u2192 direction is UP-LEFT\n\n**4s to move:**\n- (5,16) in 6-region \u2192 moves UP to (4,16)\n- (8,18) in 6-region \u2192 moves UP to (2,18)\n- (7,9) in 3-region \u2192 moves UP-LEFT to (5,7)\n- (8,11) in 3-region \u2192 moves UP-LEFT to (4,7)\n- (13,6) in 3-region \u2192 moves UP-LEFT to (12,5)\n- (17,5) in 3-region \u2192 moves UP-LEFT to (15,3)\n\n```\n6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,6,0,4,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,6,6,6,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,0,4,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,0,6\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n```\n

looked at what actually changed between the given inputs and outputs. In all three examples nothing but the cells of colour\u202f4 ever moved. The rest of each grid was untouched. The movement was not arbitrary: in each training example the small pattern of 1s and 2s embedded in the main coloured region defines a direction vector \u2013 the vector from the average position of the 1s to the average position of the 2s. For the left blue 7\u2011region in example\u202f1 that vector points right; for the red 5\u2011region it points left. In example\u202f2 the 1\u21922 vector points down\u2011right; in example\u202f3 it points straight down.\n\nEach 4 is associated with the nearest \u201cbase\u201d colour (any non\u2011zero colour other than 1,\u202f2 or 4). It is then slid step by step along that base colour\u2019s arrow direction until the next cell in that direction would be outside the grid or non\u2011zero; it stops on the last zero before that obstacle. The original 4 is erased and a 4 is written at the new position.\n\nIn the test grid there are two base colours. The cluster of 1s and 2s in the top\u2011left six\u2011block lies in the 6\u2011region; their mean gives a direction of up. The cluster of 1s and 2s in the lower 3\u2011region gives a direction of up\u2011left.

In the 6\u2011coloured region, columns\u202f2 and\u202f4 contain vertical patterns 6,1,1,2,6, so the direction for colour\u202f6 is north.

So the task is: **move each 4 to a new position**, according to a rule.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Finding the direction of motion\n\nIn each training task there are small patterns of 1s and 2s embedded inside a larger region of a single main color:\n\n- Example 1: 1s and 2s inside a big 7\u2013region and a big 5\u2013region.\n- Example 2: 1s and 2s inside a 5\u2013region.\n- Example 3: 1s and 2s inside a 5\u2013region.\n\nThe layout of 1s and 2s encodes a **direction vector**:\n\n- Compute the average position (barycenter) of all 1s in that region.\n- Compute the average position of all 2s in the same region.\n- The vector from the 1\u2011barycenter to the 2\u2011barycenter, reduced to signs of components, gives a discrete direction \\(D = (\\text{sign}(\\Delta r), \\text{sign}(\\Delta c))\\), which is one of\n  \\((0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0),(1,1),(-1,1),(1,-1),(-1,-1)\\).\n\nChecking the examples:\n\n- Example 1:\n  - In the left 7\u2011region, 1s are left of 2s \u21d2 \\(D = (0, +1)\\) (east).\n  - In the right 5\u2011region, 1s are right of 2s \u21d2 \\(D = (0, -1)\\) (west).\n  - 4s near the 7\u2011region move horizontally right; 4s near the 5\u2011region move horizontally left.\n- Example 2:\n  - 1s lie up\u2011left of 2s inside the 5\u2011block \u21d2 \\(D = (1,1)\\) (down\u2011right).\n  - Each 4 moves down\u2011right along that diagonal.\n- Example 3:\n  - 1s are above 2s \u21d2 \\(D = (1,0)\\) (down).\n  - Each 4 moves straight downward.\n\nSo: **each main colored region that contains 1s and 2s has its own direction \\(D\\) from 1s to 2s.**\n\n---\n\n## 2. How the 4s move along that direction\n\nFor each 4:\n\n1. Decide which main region it belongs to by the **nearest non\u2011zero color** (other than 4) around it.  \n   In the examples this always correctly assigns 4s to the nearest large 7/5/5 block.\n2. Take that region\u2019s direction vector \\(D\\).\n3. Starting from the 4\u2019s position, walk step\u2011by\u2011step along \\(D\\) (adding \\((dr,dc)\\) to the coordinates).\n4. As long as you are on 0s, keep going.\n5. When you reach the **first non\u2011zero cell** (in all examples this is in the main region\u2019s color), stop.  \n   Place the 4 on the **last 0 cell before that non\u2011zero**.\n6. The original 4 position becomes 0.\n\nThis reproduces all the example outputs:\n\n- Example 2, 4 at (10,4):\n  - \\(D=(1,1)\\). Path: (11,5)=0, (12,6)=0, (13,7)=5 \u21d2 stop; put 4 at (12,6).\n- Example 3, 4 at (7,6):\n  - \\(D=(1,0)\\). Path: (8,6)=0, (9,6)=0, (10,6)=0, (11,6)=5 \u21d2 stop; put 4 at (10,6).\n- Example 1:\n  - Left\u2011region \\(D=(0,1)\\), right\u2011region \\(D=(0,-1)\\).  \n    E.g. 4 at (11,5) in 7\u2011region: rightwards 0,0,0, then 7 at (11,10) \u21d2 place 4 at (11,9).\n\n---\n\n## 3.

all other colors stay fixed.  \n   The number of `4` cells is preserved.\n\n2. **How do the `4`s move?**  \n   Examining each example:\n\n   - The `4`s always move in a **straight line** (purely horizontal, purely vertical, or along a 45\u00b0 diagonal).\n   - For a given \u201cmain color region\u201d, all its `4`s move in the **same direction**.\n   - The direction is determined by a small pattern of `1`s and `2`s embedded inside a block of some main color.\n\n3. **Finding the direction from `1` and `2`:**\n\n   In every training grid there is at least one patch where a uniform color (like `5` or `7`) contains a small pattern of `1`s and `2`s.  \n  \n   For a given host color `h` (e.g. `5`, `7`):\n\n   - Collect all cells that are `1` and that have a 4-neighbor of color `h`.  \n     (These `1`s \u201cbelong\u201d to host color `h`.)\n   - Collect all cells that are `2` with a 4-neighbor of color `h`.\n   - Compute the centroids:\n     - \\( (r_1, c_1) \\) = average row and column of all those `1`s.\n     - \\( (r_2, c_2) \\) = average row and column of all those `2`s.\n   - Direction vector for color `h` is:\n     \\[\n     dr = \\text{sign}(r_2 - r_1), \\quad dc = \\text{sign}(c_2 - c_1)\n     \\]\n     So \\(dr,dc \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}\\).  \n     - Example2: `1`s above-left of `2`s \u2192 direction `(dr,dc) = (1,1)` (down-right).  \n     - Example3: `1`s above `2`s in same column \u2192 `(1,0)` (straight down).  \n     - Example1: color `7` has `1`s left of `2`s \u2192 `(0,1)` (right); color `5` has `1`s right of `2`s \u2192 `(0,-1)` (left).\n\n   This reproduces the directions in all training examples.\n\n4. **Assigning each `4` to a host color:**\n\n   There can be more than one host color with a direction (e.g. Example1 has `7` and `5`).  \n   For each `4`:\n\n   - Find which host color region it is closest to (by minimal Manhattan distance to any cell of that host color).\n   - That host color\u2019s direction vector \\((dr,dc)\\) is used for that `4`.\n\n   In Example1, `4`s near the big `7` block move right (direction from 7\u2019s `1\u21922`), those nearer the `5` blocks move left (from 5\u2019s `1\u21922`), exactly matching the outputs.\n\n5. **Sliding rule for a single `4`:**\n\n   Given a starting position \\((r,c)\\) for a `4` and direction \\((dr,dc)\\):\n\n   - Repeatedly:\n     - Look at the next cell \\((r+dr, c+dc)\\).\n     - If it is **outside the grid** or **non-zero** (any color other than `0`), **stop**.\n     - Otherwise (it is `0`), move the `4` there: update \\((r,c) := (r+dr, c+dc)\\) and repeat.\n   - The `4` ends on the **last `0` cell before the first non-zero** in that direction.\n\n   This exactly matches all training moves:\n   - Example3: vertical drops until just above a `5`.\n   - Example2: diagonal down-right slides until just before a `5`.\n   - Example1: horizontal slides left or right until just before `5`/`7`.\n\n6. **Apply this to the test grid**\n\n   **a. Identify host colors and their directions**\n\n   Colors present (besides `0` and `4`): `6`, `3`, `1`, `2`.  \n   Check which colors host `1` and `2` inside them:\n\n   - Top-left block (color `6`):\n     ```\n     6 2 6 2 6\n     6 1 6 1 6\n     6 1 6 1 6\n     6 6 6 6 6\n     ```\n     These `1`s and `2`s are embedded in color `6`.\n\n     1s of host 6: (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4)  \n     2s of host 6: (2,2), (2,4)\n\n     Centroids:\n     - 1s: \\( r_1 = (3+3+4+4)/4 = 3.5,\\ c_1 = (2+4+2+4)/4 = 3\\)\n     - 2s: \\( r_2 = (2+2)/2 = 2,\\ c_2 = (2+4)/2 = 3\\)\n\n     Vector from 1s to 2s:  \n     \\(r_2 - r_1 = -1.5 \\Rightarrow dr = -1\\) (up)  \n     \\(c_2 - c_1 = 0 \\Rightarrow dc = 0\\)\n\n     \u2192 **Direction for color 6: \\((dr,dc) = (-1,0)\\)** (straight up).\n\n   - Bottom-right block (color `3`):\n\n     1s: (17,18), (18,16), (18,19), (19,17)  \n     2s: (16,17), (17,15)\n\n     Centroids:\n     - 1s: \\( r_1 = (17+18+18+19)/4 = 18,\\ c_1 = (18+16+19+17)/4 = 17.5\\)\n     - 2s: \\( r_2 = (16+17)/2 = 16.5,\\ c_2 = (17+15)/2 = 16\\)\n\n     Vector:  \n     \\(r_2 - r_1 = -1.5 \\Rightarrow dr = -1\\) (up)  \n     \\(c_2 - c_1 = -1.5 \\Rightarrow dc = -1\\) (left)\n\n     \u2192 **Direction for color 3: \\((dr,dc) = (-1,-1)\\)** (up-left diagonal).\n\n   So:\n   - host color 6: move `4`s upward.\n   - host color 3: move `4`s up-left.\n\n   **b.

It's about taking grids with shapes made of colors and transforming them, focusing on small pixels, often yellow \"4\"s, that seem to move. The goal is to figure out the rule.\n\nI start by looking at examples. I see shapes of different colors, and then \"keys\". These keys are small rectangular blocks with interior patterns. The yellow pixels are *inside* larger shapes that seem to be the same color as the borders of these key blocks. The output shows the yellow pixels moving or changing.\n\nI analyze Example 1. There are shapes and keys, with some colored pixels inside them. I find patterns in the key blocks: they seem to have blue (1) and red (2) pixels. The outputs make it look like those yellow dots, inside some color shape, move relative to some key, often to an empty space.\n\nI hypothesize that the keys are somehow related to the movement of these yellow pixels. I investigate the position of pixels within the shapes and compare to positions in the key, but it doesn't work directly because the shapes are irregular.\n\nThen, I analyze the yellow dot movement. In Example 1, some move right, and some move left. In the key, there are blue(1) and red(2) pixels. The pixels 1 and 2, which are the interiors of the blocks, appear to determine the direction the dots move. I notice how the \"2\" pixel is on the right for one key and the left for the other.\n\nThis leads me to the idea that the number and position of 1s and 2s in these \"key\" blocks have meaning. I check sums of these blocks. The total numbers don't matter.\n\nI check Example 1 and find:\n- Orange is associated with moving dots right. The Key is 1,1,2 (right).\n- Grey is associated with moving dots left. The Key is 2,1,1 (left).\n\nI think the 1 and 2 locations in those rectangular \"Key\" blocks, determine the shift direction for the dots.\n\nThen, I check to see if the key can have a 5x7 block, in which the \"2\" is on the bottom-right. Example 2 confirms this pattern because the dots moves diagonally down and to the right.\n\nTo find the exact shift vector, I make this hypothesis: The direction is related to the location of the 1s and 2s in those \"key\" blocks. I propose to calculate the vector between the centroids (average position) of the 1s and the 2s to determine the \"gravity\" or direction the yellow dots should go, within a given shape.\n\nIn Example 2, this hypothesis explains why the yellow dots shift down-right.\n\nNext, I check Example 3 and see if this vector approach holds. The Example 3 Key is a similar situation where the 2s are at the bottom of the Key. The dots in Example 3 are moved down. I apply the same hypothesis.\n\nNow I look for a refined rule:\n1.  **Find the \"Key\" block.** It has a border color C and an interior of 1s and 2s.\n2.  **Determine the movement vector (V).** It is derived from centroid of 1s to centroid of 2s, V = Centroid(2) - Centroid(1).\n3.  **Find the direction (D).** Simplify from the vector's coordinates, for example (0,+2) -> (Up), (+1,0) -> (Right), (1,1) -> (Down-Right).\n4.  **For all yellow pixels.** They move until they hit a wall. Stop when 8-way adjacent to a wall.\n\nI check this new rule in my examples and test it out.\n\nThen I get to the Test Input and use all I've found to solve it. I use the previous examples to decode how the yellow pixels shift. I get all the new positions.\n\n\nThe transformation rule involves moving the yellow pixels (4) inside the hollow colored shapes. The direction of movement is determined by a \"key\" block of the same color.\n\n**1. Identifying the Keys and Directions:**\n*   **Orange Key (Color 6):** Located at the top-left (Rows 0-4, Cols 0-4).\n    *   Interior Logic: We calculate the vector from the centroid of `1`s (Blue) to the centroid of `2`s (Red).\n    *   `1`s are at rows 2 and 3. Average Row \u2248 2.5.\n    *   `2`s are at row 1. Average Row = 1.\n    *   Vector direction is Up (Row 1 < Row 2.5).\n    *   **Rule for Orange Shapes:** Move yellow dots **UP** until they are adjacent to an orange wall.\n\n*   **Green Key (Color 3):** Located at the bottom-right (Rows 14-19, Cols 13-19).\n    *   Interior Logic:\n        *   `2`s are at local coordinates (1,3) and (2,1). Average Row \u2248 1.5, Average Col \u2248 2.\n        *   `1`s are at local coordinates (2,4), (3,2), (3,5), (4,3). Average Row \u2248 3, Average Col \u2248 3.5.\n    *   Vector direction (from `1`s to `2`s): Row decreases (Up), Col decreases (Left).\n    *   **Rule for Green Shapes:** Move yellow dots **UP-LEFT** (diagonally) until they are adjacent to a green wall.\n\n**2. Applying the Rules to Yellow Dots:**\n\n*   **Orange Shape (Top Right Loop):**\n    *   Dot at **(5, 16)**: Moves Up. Wall at (3, 16). Stops at **(4, 16)**.\n    *   Dot at **(8, 18)**: Moves Up. Wall at (1, 18). Stops at **(2, 18)**.\n\n*   **Green Shape (Large Central Loop):**\n    *   Dot at **(7, 9)**: Moves Up-Left. Path: (6,8) -> (5,7). Wall at (5,6). Stops at **(5, 7)**.\n    *   Dot at **(8, 11)**: Moves Up-Left. Path: (7,10) -> (6,9) -> (5,8) -> (4,7). Wall at (4,6). Stops at **(4, 7)**.\n    *   Dot at **(13, 6)**: Moves Up-Left. Path: (12,5). Wall at (12,4). Stops at **(12, 5)**.\n    *   Dot at **(17, 5)**: Moves Up-Left. Path: (16,4) -> (15,3). Wall at (15,2). Stops at **(15, 3)**.\n\n**3.

So final is (12,6).\n  - (16,12) \u2192 (17,13) (0) \u2192 next (18,14)=5. Final is (17,13).\n\n- **Example 3**\n\n  The 1/2 motif in the top\u2011right is vertical: 1s above, 2s below in the same columns, so axis is **vertical**. The direction from 1s to 2s is **downward**.\n\n  For each 4, we:\n  - Move straight **down** through zeros.\n  - Stop on the last zero before the first non\u2011zero below.\n\n  Check:\n  - Column 6: 4 at (7,6), below: 0,0,0,5 \u2192 stop at (10,6).  \n  - Column 7: 4 at (14,7), below: 0,0,0,0,0,5 \u2192 stop at (19,7).  \n  - Column 11: 4 at (14,11), below: 0,0,0,5 \u2192 stop at (17,11).\n\n  In all cases the final 4 is immediately above a 5.\n\nSo the **rule** that fits all training examples is:\n\n> 1. Use the arrangement of 1s/2s to pick a single global direction vector D (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).  \n> 2. For each 4, repeatedly step one cell along D as long as the next cell is 0.  \n> 3. Stop when the next cell along D is non\u2011zero or outside the grid.  \n> 4. Place the 4 at the last 0 you visited (its new position).  \n>    (If the next cell from the starting position is already non\u2011zero, the 4 does not move.)\n\nAfter movement, each 4 sits on a 0\u2011cell which has a non\u2011zero neighbor exactly one step in direction D.\n\n---\n\n### Applying the rule to the test input\n\nFirst identify the direction from the 1/2 patterns.\n\nIn the test grid:\n\n- Top\u2011left around the 6\u2011frame:\n  - Column 2: row2=2, rows3\u20134=1 \u2192 2 above 1s \u2192 vertical.\n  - Column 4: same structure.\n- Bottom\u2011right inside the 3\u2011area:\n  - Column 17: row16=2, row19=1 \u2192 again 2 above 1.\n\nSo in both regions the 2s are **above** 1s in the same column. That matches the vertical **downward** direction from 2 to 1, exactly like in Example 3.  \nTherefore, the global direction D for this puzzle is:\n\n> **Downwards** (dr=+1, dc=0)\n\nNow process each 4.\n\nThe original 4s are at:\n\n- A: (6,17)\n- B: (8,10)\n- C: (9,12)\n- D: (9,19)\n- E: (14,7)\n- F: (18,6)\n\nWe use the original grid, move every 4 **straight down** through zeros, and stop at the last zero before a non\u2011zero.\n\n---\n\n#### A: 4 at (6,17)\n\nColumn 17 values (rows 1\u219220):\n\n`[0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 3, 3, 1, 3]`\n\nFrom row 6:\n\n- row7,col17 = 6 (non\u2011zero) immediately below.\n\nSo there is **no zero below** it; it already sits directly on top of a non\u2011zero.  \nBy the rule, A does **not move**: stays at (6,17).\n\n---\n\n#### B: 4 at (8,10)\n\nColumn 10 values (rows 1\u219220):\n\n`[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0]`\n\nFrom (8,10):\n\n- row9,col10 = 0 \u2192 can move down.\n- row10,col10 = 3 (non\u2011zero) \u2192 barrier.\n\nSo we stop on the last 0 before the 3, at row 9.  \nB moves: **(8,10) \u2192 (9,10)**.\n\n---\n\n#### C: 4 at (9,12)\n\nColumn 12 values:\n\n`[0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n\nFrom (9,12):\n\n- row10,col12 = 3 (non\u2011zero) directly below.\n\nSo no zero below; C does **not move**: stays at **(9,12)**.\n\n---\n\n#### D: 4 at (9,19)\n\nColumn 19 values:\n\n`[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3]`\n\nFrom (9,19):\n\n- row10,col19 = 0 \u2192 can move down.\n- row11,col19 = 6 (non\u2011zero) \u2192 barrier.\n\nSo D moves to row 10: **(9,19) \u2192 (10,19)**.\n\n---\n\n#### E: 4 at (14,7)\n\nColumn 7 values:\n\n`[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]`\n\nFrom (14,7):\n\n- row15,col7 = 0\n- row16,col7 = 0\n- row17,col7 = 0\n- row18,col7 = 0\n- row19,col7 = 0\n- row20,col7 = 3 (non\u2011zero)\n\nSo we slide all the way to row 19, the last 0 before the 3 at row 20:  \nE moves: **(14,7) \u2192 (19,7)**.\n\n---\n\n#### F: 4 at (18,6)\n\nColumn 6 values:\n\n`[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 3]`\n\nFrom (18,6):\n\n- row19,col6 = 3 (non\u2011zero) just below.\n\nSo F does **not move**, stays at **(18,6)**.\n\n---\n\n### Constructing the output grid\n\nWe start from the input grid, turn the original 4\u2011cells to 0, then set 4 at the new positions:\n\n- (6,17): remains 4 (unchanged)\n- (8,10): becomes 0 (B moved)\n- (9,12): remains 4\n- (9,19): becomes 0\n- (10,19): becomes 4\n- (14,7): becomes 0 (E moved)\n- (18,6): remains 4\n- (19,7): becomes 4\n\nAll other cells stay as they are.\n\nFinal output grid:\n\nRow1:  `6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow2:  `6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6`  \nRow3:  `6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,6,0,0,6`  \nRow4:  `6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6`  \nRow5:  `6,6,6,6,6,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,0,0,0,0,6`  \nRow6:  `0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,4,0,0,6`  \nRow7:  `0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6`  \nRow8:  `0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6`  \nRow9:  `0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6`  \nRow10: `0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,4,6`  \nRow11: `0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6`  \nRow12: `0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow13: `0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow14: `0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow15: `0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3`  \nRow16: `0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3`  \nRow17: `0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3`  \nRow18: `0,0,3,3,0,4,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3`  \nRow19: `0,0,0,3,3,3,4,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3`  \nRow20: `0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3`\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6\n      6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,6,0,0,6\n      6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,0,0,0,0,6\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,4,0,0,6\n      0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6\n      0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n      0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n      0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,4,6\n      0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n      0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n      0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3\n      0,0,3,3,0,4,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n      0,0,0,3,3,3,4,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3\n      0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"4\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_1_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at this puzzle, I need to identify the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\nIn each example, I notice:\n1.

The direction depends on:\n- The orientation of the template's internal pattern (vertical stripes = vertical movement)\n- When two templates exist horizontally, movement is horizontal\n- The 4 moves the maximum distance possible in the allowed direction\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\nTemplates identified:\n- 6-bordered template (top-left, rows 0-4, cols 0-4): Has vertical stripe pattern (2,1,1)\n- 3-bordered template (bottom-right, rows 14-19, cols 13-19)\n\n4s located at:\n- (5,16): 6-bounded region \u2192 vertical movement, moves UP to (4,16)\n- (7,9): 3-bounded region \u2192 horizontal movement, moves LEFT to (7,3)  \n- (8,11): 3-bounded region \u2192 horizontal movement, moves LEFT to (8,4)\n- (8,18): 6-bounded region \u2192 vertical movement, moves UP to (2,18)\n- (13,6): 3-bounded region (lower) \u2192 vertical movement, moves DOWN to (18,6)\n- (17,5): 3-bounded region (lower) \u2192 vertical movement, moves UP to (11,5)\n\n**Output Grid:**\n\n```\n6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,6,0,4,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,6,6,6,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,0,4,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,0,6\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n0,0,0,3,3,3,4,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6\n      6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,6,0,4,6\n      6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,0,4,0,0,6\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,0,0,6\n      0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6\n      0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n      0,0,3,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n      0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,0,6\n      0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n      0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n      0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3\n      0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n      0,0,0,3,3,3,4,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3\n      0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"5\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_2_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Explanation of the transformation**\n\nIn all the provided examples nothing changes except the positions of the cells with value\u202f4. The direction in which a 4 is \u201cslid\u201d is determined by the placement of the digits\u202f1 and\u202f2 in the input:\n\n- If the set of rows of the 1s and 2s are the same but the columns differ, the movement is horizontal.\n- If the set of columns are the same but the rows differ, the movement is vertical.\n- If both rows and columns differ, the movement is along a diagonal.\n\nThe orientation along that axis is from the 1s toward the 2s (e.g. if the 2s are below the 1s the movement is downward; if the 2s are above/left, the movement is up\u2011left, etc.). If an axis is ambiguous, the 4 is slid to the farther end along that axis, as seen in example\u202f1.\n\nFor each 4, starting from its current position, step cell by cell in the determined direction through zeros until the next step would hit a non\u2011zero cell or go out of bounds; place the 4 in the last zero before that obstacle, and clear its original position.\n\nIn the test grid the 2s are on average above and to the left of the 1s, so the direction is up\u2011left (row\u202f\u22121, col\u202f\u22121). Sliding each 4 in that direction until just before a non\u2011zero gives the following output.\n\n**Output grid**\n\n6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,6,0,0,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,6,6,6,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,4,0,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,4,0,6\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,0,6\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6\n      6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,6,0,0,6\n      6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6\n      6,6,6,6,6,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,4,0,0,0,6\n      0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,0,0,6\n      0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6\n      0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,4,0,6\n      0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n      0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,0,6\n      0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n      0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n      0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n      0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3\n      0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n      0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3\n      0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"6\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-high_2_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**High\u2011level pattern**\n\n1. In each training pair there is at least one **5\u00d75 \u201cframe\u201d** made of some color \\(B\\) (7, 5, 3 or 6) with digits 1 and 2 embedded.\n2. The arrangement of the 1\u2019s and 2\u2019s in that 5\u00d75 block encodes a **direction vector**:\n   - Compute the centroid of all 1\u2019s and the centroid of all 2\u2019s in that 5\u00d75.\n   - The vector from the 1\u2011centroid to the 2\u2011centroid gives a direction \\(D_B\\) \u2208 {(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1), (-1,-1), (1,1), (-1,1), (1,-1)} after normalization to unit steps.\n3. The only cells that change are the **4\u2019s**. For each relevant color \\(B\\):\n   - Look along the line through a 4 in direction \\(D_B\\) and in direction \\(-D_B\\).\n   - If in both directions you eventually hit a cell of color \\(B\\), and *all* cells strictly between the 4 and those B\u2019s are either 0 or 4, then the 4 lies in a **\u201ccorridor\u201d of zeros between two B\u2019s** along direction \\(D_B\\).\n   - That 4 is associated with color \\(B\\).\n4. For each such 4, you then **slide it along the direction \\(D_B\\)** (from 1s towards 2s), moving step by step through zeros, and stop at the last 0 just before the first non\u2011zero cell in that direction.\n\nThis rule explains all three training examples:\n\n- Example 1:\n  - Two 5\u00d75 frames:\n    - Color 7 frame: 1\u2019s cluster left, 2\u2019s cluster right \u2192 \\(D_7 = (0,+1)\\) (east).\n    - Color 5 frame (on the right): 1\u2019s right, 2\u2019s left \u2192 \\(D_5 = (0,-1)\\) (west).\n  - Each 4 lies in a horizontal zero corridor between two 7\u2019s or two 5\u2019s.  \n    It is slid horizontally in the direction of the corresponding arrow (east for 7, west for 5), exactly matching the output.\n\n- Example 2:\n  - Single 5\u00d75 frame of color 5 with arrow down\u2011right: centroid(1) \u2192 centroid(2) \u2248 (1.5,1.5) \u2192 \\(D_5 = (1,1)\\).\n  - Each 4 sits in a diagonal corridor between two 5\u2019s along that diagonal; they slide down\u2011right until just before the next 5.\n\n- Example 3:\n  - Single 5\u00d75 frame of color 5 with arrow straight down: \\(D_5 = (1,0)\\).\n  - Each 4 lies in a vertical zero corridor between two 5\u2019s; they slide straight down until they rest just above the lower 5\u2011segment.\n\nSo: **\u201cThe 5\u00d75 1/2\u2011pattern acts like an arrow; 4\u2019s in B\u2011colored corridors slide in that arrow\u2019s direction until they hit the B\u2011structure.\u201d**\n\n---\n\n## Applying to the test input\n\n### 1.

The main thing I'm picking up on is the yellow pixels (color 4) that are doing some kind of movement.  In the examples, it looks like these yellow pixels are *contained* within shapes and then *relocate*. There are also these \"reference boxes\" which could hold the key. Let's dig in.\n\n**Analyzing Example 1 and Hypothesizing the Core Logic:**\n\nExample 1 has shapes with colors 7 and 5, and the key is tracing the yellow pixels (4). They seem to move horizontally, sometimes left, sometimes right. Then, there's a connection to shapes around those 4 pixels. The 7 and 5 shapes each appear with inside a smaller shape:  a box with 1's and 2's.\n\nI hypothesize that the 4s move relative to these boxes. The content of those little boxes (with the 1's and 2's inside the larger ones) may be dictating the move. The 1s represent an empty space. Maybe the 2's indicate a shift?\n\n**More Hypothesis Refinement Based on Example 1:**\n\nI am seeing clear movement based on the 1s and the 2s and the enclosed shapes. The 2s in these \"reference\" boxes are actually indicating the *direction* of movement for the 4s. The 4s move to the end of open space in that direction, based on the shape color.\n\n*   If the 2 is on the right, the 4 moves right.\n*   If the 2 is on the left, the 4 moves left.\n\nThis directional movement seems to be the core idea. I am now looking at coordinates to check this.\n\n**Examining Example 2 for Directional Confirmation:**\n\nExample 2 reinforces the idea of directional movement. I see the same patterns of walls surrounding the 4's. The 4's are no longer just shifting horizontal, now moving diagonal in the example. So, in the new hypothesis. If the pattern is from bottom-right to top-left, the move is UP-LEFT.\n\n**Example 3 and Solidifying the Rule:**\n\nIn Example 3, I am seeing a clear down movement because of the bottom location of the `2` in the reference box. Now I understand: these 1's and 2's point to the *final* location of the yellow pixel (4). This finalizes my understanding of the direction and walls.\n\n**Summary of the Rule:**\n\n1.  Find the \"reference boxes.\"\n2.  Use the `2` relative position (compared to `1`s) inside the box to calculate the direction.\n3.  Move each `4` pixel within the shape in that direction, through any empty space.\n4.  Stop at a \"wall\" or edge.\n\n**Applying the Rule to the Test Input:**\n\nI apply my logic to the input grid. First, I identify the 6 and 3 reference blocks and the 4's location within. The block with the 6's has the 2 on top of the 1s. This means a UP movement. The block with the 3's points also UP. I find the 4's. Then I trace up to the first stopping point (a non-0 or wall) in the path.\n\n**Building the Output:**\n\nI place the new 4 locations, clearing out the originals.\n\n**Final Check and Output:**\n\nOkay, I make some checks again. The numbers make sense. I verify the walls. It looks correct. I create the transformed output grid.\n\n\nThe problem involves moving the yellow pixels (color 4) based on directional cues provided by \"reference blocks\" in the grid.\n\n**Logic:**\n1.  **Reference Blocks:** The grid contains specific rectangular structures (usually 5x5) made of a specific color (e.g., 6 or 3) that act as keys. Inside these blocks, there are pixels of color 1 (blue) and 2 (red). The spatial arrangement of 1s and 2s defines a movement vector:\n    *   The direction is from **1 to 2**.\n    *   In the Test Input, the top-left block (color 6) has 2s in the top row of its interior and 1s below. This indicates a direction of **UP**.\n    *   The bottom-right block (color 3) has 2s in the upper section and 1s in the lower section. This also indicates a direction of **UP**.\n2.  **Movement:** Every yellow pixel (4) is contained within a \"room\" or vertical/horizontal channel defined by one of the reference colors. The yellow pixel moves in the direction specified by its container's color reference block.\n3.  **Pathfinding:** The yellow pixel travels through empty space (0) in the specified direction until it hits a wall (a non-zero pixel). It settles in the last empty cell before the wall.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\nThe direction for both Color 6 and Color 3 enclosures is **UP**.\n\n*   **Pixel at (5, 16)** (inside color 6): Moves UP. The first wall above is at row 3 (color 6). It stops at **(4, 16)**.\n*   **Pixel at (7, 9)** (inside color 3): Moves UP. The first wall above is at row 1 (color 3). It stops at **(2, 9)**.\n*   **Pixel at (8, 11)** (inside color 3): Moves UP. The first wall above is at row 1 (color 3). It stops at **(2, 11)**.\n*   **Pixel at (8, 18)** (inside color 6): Moves UP. The first wall above is at row 1 (color 6).

                "response": "**Audit of Candidate Solutions for ARC Task**\n\nAlright, let's dive into this ARC task. The core idea is pretty clear: we're given grids with colored shapes and yellow pixels, and our job is to figure out the rules that govern how those yellow pixels move. The key is in these \"reference blocks\" - rectangular patterns of Blue and Red pixels (1s and 2s). My initial thought is that the spatial relationship of the 1s and 2s within these blocks must dictate the yellow pixel's movement.\n\nSo I started with the training examples. In the first one, I saw shapes (like the orange 7 and grey 5) and noticed a clear correspondence between the arrangement of 1s and 2s in their respective blocks and the direction the yellow pixels moved. Where the 2 was to the right of the 1s, the pixel moved right. Where it was to the left, it moved left. Seems like a directional vector from 1 to 2. Aha! So I concluded that the pixel moves in the direction that the vector is oriented in until it hits a wall.\n\nExample 2 showed a diagonal movement. I went through the input carefully to track the path, and it stopped at a wall. So the rule seems to be: move in the direction of the vector from the centroid of the 1s to the centroid of the 2s, until hitting a wall. The rule is: direction is vector from 1s to 2s. Move until adjacent to a wall.\n\nExample 3 confirmed this with a vertical movement. So I generalized the rule to be: move in the vector direction, stop at the last empty cell before hitting a non-empty cell - in other words, adjacent to the obstacle. I feel confident about that. I need to test that.\n\nNow, let's put this rule to the test with the provided candidates. The pink and green reference blocks are the keys here. For Pink, the 2s are above the 1s, so the direction is up. For Green, it's more complicated. The 2s seem above *and* to the left, so it's up-left. Now, with these rules in mind, I manually traced the paths of the yellow pixels in the test input.\n\nThere were some subtle differences in these candidate solutions. One thing I noticed right away was that all of the candidates seemed to have a problem generating a completely accurate grid (specifically with the position of a pixel). This made the validation slightly harder, because I needed to focus on the logic and traces of the movement to compare with my manual approach.\n\nCandidate 0 (Gemini) had the rule exactly right, and the correct trace for the movement. Candidate 1 (Gemini) was on the same page, but had one pixel's position shifted horizontally by one column, which must have been a mistake in the grid generation. Candidate 6 (GPT-3) had some slight confusion on wall logic and trace for two pixels, but still correctly identified the movement rules.\n\nCandidate 7 (Gemini) came up with a simplified rule of \"up\" for the entire grid, but completely failed to take into account the 1/2 structure. It was completely inconsistent with the examples (it would predict straight up, but it might have needed to move in the direction of the vector of 1->2). Candidate 5 (GPT) just generated one direction for all pixels. Candidate 3 had the rule direction inverted. Candidate 2/4 had rules based on \"opposite side\" or \"stripes\", which are entirely irrelevant.\n\nSo here's my final assessment: Candidate 0 gets the top spot because it had the most coherent rule and provided a near-perfect manual trace. Candidate 1 also understood the rules but made a minor grid generation mistake. Candidate 6 still identified the key components of vector movement but got lost on some of the mechanics. The other candidates are pretty far off-base. So, 0, 1, 6, 7, 5, 3, 2, 4.\n\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 9.0,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"The rule (movement vector defined by centroid of 1s to centroid of 2s within the enclosing shape's reference block) perfectly explains all training examples.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Yellow pixels (4) move within their colored enclosure in a direction defined by a reference block of that color (vector from 1s to 2s).
