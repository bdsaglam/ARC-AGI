Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Algorithm for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of this ARC task. The user is presenting a puzzle where the core idea seems to be about generating diagonal and orthogonal lines within a grid, based on the shape of certain \"boxes\". Let's get to it.\n\n1.  **Box Identification:** I need to identify rectangular structures (boxes) within the grid. These boxes are defined by their border color (usually 3) and enclose a distinct inner color. The task is to extend these inner colors as lines in the output.\n\n2.  **Gap Detection:** The key insight is that the border of these boxes will have gaps. These gaps determine the direction of the lines.\n\n3.  **Ray Generation:**\n    *   **Side Gaps:** If a gap exists on the side of the rectangle, an *orthogonal* (straight, horizontal or vertical) ray is emitted from that point.\n    *   **Corner Gaps:** If a gap exists at a corner, a *diagonal* ray of the inner color originates from that corner.\n\n4.  **Ray Interactions and Priority:** This is where things get interesting. The problem is complicated by *intersections* or *close-encounters* of rays. It appears that one ray might block another. Specifically:\n    *   **Collision:** If two rays meet at a point, one \"wins\". I hypothesize, based on previous examples, that *vertical/diagonal* rays tend to *block* horizontal rays in an intersection.\n    *   **Adjacent Paths:** When two diagonal rays are converging and become adjacent in their movement, I believe their rays, instead, fall vertically. They do not cross over. This is a very interesting finding.\n\n5.  **Test Case Analysis:** Now, in the given test input, I need to apply all these steps:\n    *   Find the boxes and their inner colors.\n    *   Identify the gaps in each box.\n    *   Trace the rays, accounting for the gaps and how they determine direction.\n    *   When paths collide, implement the \"blocking\" behavior determined in Step 4.\n\n6.  **Final Output:** Once the ray paths are determined with the blocking rules applied, the output grid is generated by placing all pixels. The process:\n    *   Copy original grid pixels, and box pixels.\n    *   Add the ray pixels (with blocking rules applied).\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid containing several \"boxes\" with incomplete borders. By analyzing the solved examples, we can deduce the following rules:\n\n1.  **Identify Boxes:** There are rectangular structures defined by a border color (3) and an inner color (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 7, 9).\n2.  **Identify Gaps:** The borders of these boxes are not continuous; they contain gaps (missing pixels where the background color 8 appears instead of the border color 3).\n3.  **Emit Rays:**\n    *   If a gap is located at a **corner** of the box's ideal rectangular boundary, a ray of the **inner color** is emitted diagonally outwards from that corner.\n    *   If a gap is located on a **side** (edge) of the box (not a corner), a ray of the **inner color** is emitted orthogonally (straight up, down, left, or right) outwards from that gap.\n4.  **Ray Propagation and Interaction:**\n    *   Rays travel until they hit the edge of the grid or are blocked.\n    *   **Blocking Rule:** Based on the examples (specifically Example 1 where a horizontal ray stops before a vertical line of rays), it appears that vertical and diagonal rays (\"lines\") are \"stronger\" than horizontal rays. If a horizontal ray intersects a vertical or diagonal ray, the horizontal ray stops *before* the intersection, and the cell at the intersection takes the color of the vertical/diagonal ray.\n    *   Rays fill the gap pixel itself.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\nWe identify 5 boxes and their gaps:\n\n1.  **Box A (Inner 2, Red):**\n    *   **Gap at Top Side (Row 4, Col 4):** Emits a **Vertical Ray Up**. Path: (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4) become 2.\n    *   **Gap at Left Side (Row 5, Col 3):** Emits a **Horizontal Ray Left**. Path starts at (5,3). It heads towards Col 2.\n\n2.  **Box E (Inner 9, Maroon):**\n    *   **Gap at Top Side (Row 24, Col 2):** Emits a **Vertical Ray Up**. Path: (23,2) up to (0,2).

Path: (12,23) up to (0,23) become 6.\n    *   **Gap at Top-Right Corner (Row 13, Col 25):** Emits a **Diagonal Ray Up-Right**. Path: (12,26), (11,27), (10,28), (9,29) become 6.\n    *   **Gap at Bottom-Right Corner (Row 16, Col 25):** Emits a **Diagonal Ray Down-Right**. Path: (17,26), (18,27), (19,28), (20,29) become 6.\n    *   **Interaction:** The vertical ray of 6s (at Col 23) intersects the horizontal ray of 4s (at Row 5). Vertical > Horizontal. The pixel at (5,23) becomes 6. The horizontal ray of 4s fills (5,17) to (5,22).\n\n5.  **Box D (Inner 7, Orange):**\n    *   **Gap at Right Side (Row 20, Col 24):** Emits a **Horizontal Ray Right**. Path starts at (20,24) heading right.\n    *   **Gap at Bottom-Right Corner (Row 22, Col 24):** Emits a **Diagonal Ray Down-Right**. Path: (23,25) to (27,29) become 7.\n    *   **Interaction:** The diagonal ray of 6s from Box C ends at (20,29). The horizontal ray of 7s from Box D reaches (20,29). Diagonal > Horizontal. The pixel at (20,29) becomes 6. The horizontal ray of 7s fills (20,24) to (20,28).\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\nI will generate the grid applying these modifications to the input background.\n\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,7,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Solution Construction and Analysis**\n\nI'm being asked to solve an ARC task using the provided examples. I begin by breaking down each example, focusing on how the input is transformed to the output, to identify underlying patterns.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\nI start by observing the initial state and features of each example and the output. In the first example, I notice that the input is a grid with various colored shapes, but the output only shows these shape's inner colors. The background remains the same. I then trace how the positions of the inner color pixels \"move\" from the input to the output. It looks like they are \"projecting\" along specific directions, but this projection may not be straightforward. After a closer look, the projection becomes clearer. It seems that the individual object colors radiate from their start points across the field. I hypothesize that the color (e.g., maroon, blue) dictates the projection direction from the original start point. I investigate this idea by looking for a pattern, e.g., corner-to-corner or similar, for these \"rays\". I'll compare to Example 2.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n\nI shift my attention to Example 2. This example is smaller, so I hope to see more straightforward behavior. I notice that the green boundary seems to have missing pixels. Also, the output displays the yellow pixels starting where the original was and projecting outwards. I see a vertical line, and a horizontal line. But a down-left diagonal. Hmm. I observe that each yellow pixel has a corresponding ray emanating from it. It looks like a shape's individual pixels produce beams in specific directions. I see 3 beams.\n\n**Hypothesis: Beam Emission from Gaps**\n\nMy attention turns towards gaps in the green border. I revise the idea that individual pixels are producing these beams. Now, I hypothesize that the emission is coming from the **gaps** within the object's surrounding boundary. Now, I focus on analyzing the border of all objects in all examples and look for the gaps relative to each object's inner colors. If there is a gap, what beam does this generate?\nFor Ex 2, I found that the direction of the gap, relative to an object, determines where the beam originates. A gap above the top-right corner of a yellow pixel is an \"Up\" emission.\nI test this hypothesis in Example 1, identifying the gaps in each colored shape's border and confirming that the \"beams\" match the gaps. The color is still important, but the color determines the beam behavior after it's emitted.\n\n**Collision and Interaction Logic**\nI notice that some of these emission patterns are simple diagonal or straight rays, but these can change. For example, if two horizontal beams are next to each other, they will shift to vertical for the remainder of their journey, or the opposite direction. I need to encode this idea that beams change direction.\n\n**Summarizing the Key rules**\n\nBased on this analysis, I've created the following rules:\n1.  **Beam Origin**: The beam emanates from gaps in the border.\n2.  **Initial Direction**:\n    *   Corner Gaps generate Diagonal paths (Slope 1).\n    *   Edge Gaps generate Straight paths (Vertical/Horizontal).\n3.  **Beam Collision/Interaction**:\n    *   If two beams are side-by-side, they change direction. They become a vertical path if the previous path was diagonal in opposing directions. If one is straight and the other is diagonal, the two will become parallel diagonals.\n\n**Test Input application:**\nI confirm that my set of rules matches the behavior on the test input.\n\n**Final Implementation and Check**\nI can finally implement the solution based on the rules.\n\n\nTo solve this task, we analyze the behavior of the colored objects and the \"beams\" they emit in the solved examples.\n\n### Rules and Observations:\n\n1.  **Objects**: The input contains shapes outlined in Green (3) with inner pixels of a specific color (e.g., Maroon 9, Blue 1, Yellow 4, etc.).\n2.  **Beams**: These objects emit lines of their inner color, which extend to the edges of the grid.\n3.  **Source of Beams (Gaps)**: The beams originate from \"gaps\" in the Green (3) border surrounding the object.\n    *   We inspect the 8-neighbor \"shell\" around the object's inner pixels.\n    *   If a pixel in this shell is not Green (3) (and is not part of another object/border), it counts as a **Gap**.\n    *   A beam starts from the coordinate of the Gap.\n4.  **Beam Direction**: The direction is determined by the position of the Gap relative to the object's center/bounding box.\n    *   **Corner Gaps** (e.g., Top-Left, Bottom-Right) produce **Diagonal Beams** (Slope 1).\n    *   **Edge Gaps** (e.g., directly Above, Left, Right, Below) produce **Straight Beams** (Vertical or Horizontal).\n5.  **Beam Interaction**:\n    *   If two beams run side-by-side (occupy adjacent columns `c` and `c+1` in the same row), they interact and change direction to maintain their relative spacing while moving in a compromise direction.\n    *   Specifically, a **Diagonal Beam** converging with a **Straight Beam** will cause both to adopt a \"Knight's Move\" slope (1 square sideways for every 2 squares forward) in the direction of the diagonal component.\n    *   The pattern for this slope (starting from the interaction row) is: Hold (vertical step), Shift (diagonal step), Hold, Shift...\n\n### Application to Test Input:\n\n**Grid Size**: 30x30.

Each pattern has a 2x2 colored region surrounded by a border of 3s with some gaps (8s instead of 3s)\n2. **Edge gaps** (on the middle of an edge): produce a line extending perpendicular to that edge\n3. **Corner gaps**: produce a diagonal line extending away from the center of the pattern\n4. Lines extend until they hit the grid boundary\n5. The gap cells themselves get filled with the inner color\n\nAnalyzing the test input patterns:\n- **Pattern 1 (2s)** at rows 5-6, cols 4-5: gaps at (4,4)-top edge\u2192up, (5,3)-left edge\u2192left, (7,6)-corner\u2192diagonal down-right\n- **Pattern 2 (4s)** at rows 5-6, cols 15-16: gaps at (4,14)-corner\u2192diagonal up-left, (5,17)-right edge\u2192right, (7,15)-bottom edge\u2192down\n- **Pattern 3 (6s)** at rows 14-15, cols 23-24: gaps at (13,23)-top edge\u2192up, (13,25)-corner\u2192diagonal up-right, (16,25)-corner\u2192diagonal down-right\n- **Pattern 4 (7s)** at rows 20-21, cols 22-23: gaps at (20,24)-right edge\u2192right, (22,24)-corner\u2192diagonal down-right\n- **Pattern 5 (9s)** at rows 25-26, cols 1-2: gaps at (24,2)-top edge\u2192up, (27,3)-corner\u2192diagonal down-right\n\n```\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Below is the reasoning for the transformation I applied, followed by the completed output grid.\n\n---\n\n## Inferred transformation (as I\u2019m using it)\n\nFrom the solved examples, I inferred the following style of transformation:\n\n- The background is color `8`.\n- Color `3` forms \u201cframes\u201d or structural lines and is not changed.\n- Other colors (`2,4,6,7,9,\u2026`) are \u201cinterior\u201d or \u201csignal\u201d colors.\n- Each interior *cluster* (e.g. a 2\u00d72 block of `2`, or `4`, or `6`, etc. inside or adjacent to `3`s) emits straight \u201crays\u201d of its color into the `8` background.\n- Rays start from immediate `8`-neighbors of the interior cluster and travel in a straight direction determined by the vector from the interior cell to that neighbor.\n- Rays recolor `8` cells along their path and stop when they hit a non-`8` cell or the border.\n- I apply this to the original interior clusters only (I don\u2019t iteratively re-emit new rays from newly painted cells; only from neighbors of the original interior cluster).\n\nConcretely for each color:\n\n1. **Find seed cells**: all cells whose color is not `8` and not `3`. For the test grid:\n   - `2` seeds: `(5,4),(5,5),(6,4),(6,5)`\n   - `4` seeds: `(5,15),(5,16),(6,15),(6,16)`\n   - `6` seeds: `(14,23),(14,24),(15,23),(15,24)`\n   - `7` seeds: `(21,22),(21,23),(22,22),(22,23)`\n   - `9` seeds: `(25,1),(25,2),(26,1),(26,2)`\n\n2. **For each seed cluster\u2019s neighbor `8` cells**:\n   - Look at all cells with value `8` in the 8-neighborhood of any seed in that cluster.\n   - For each such neighbor `p`, find one neighboring seed cell `q` of the same color:\n     - Prefer a 4-neighbor (up, down, left, right) if any, otherwise take a diagonal neighbor.\n   - Define direction vector `v = p - q` (row and column differences).\n\n3. **Cast a ray**:\n   - Starting from `p`, repeatedly add `v` to the position.\n   - At each step, if the cell is `8`, recolor it to the seed color.\n   - Stop when you leave the grid or meet a non-`8` cell.\n   - Do not recolor `3`s or other colored cells; they act as blockers.\n\n4. **Color priority / collisions**:\n   - I process colors in the order `2`, then `4`, then `6`, then `7`, then `9`.\n   - Rays never overwrite non-`8` cells; if a ray would hit a cell already colored (including by a previous ray), it stops just before that.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\n### Rays from each interior cluster\n\n#### Color 2 cluster at (5\u20136,4\u20135)\n\nSeeds: (5,4),(5,5),(6,4),(6,5).\n\n`8`-neighbors of seeds (unique):\n\n- (4,4) above seeds 5,4 and 5,5:\n  - Closest seed in 4-neighborhood: (5,4)  \n    Vector `v = (4,4)-(5,4) = (-1,0)` \u2192 straight up.\n  - Ray: (4,4) \u2192 (3,4) \u2192 (2,4) \u2192 (1,4) \u2192 (0,4).\n\n- (5,3) left of 5,4 and 6,4:\n  - `q = (5,4)`, `v = (5,3)-(5,4) = (0,-1)` \u2192 left.\n  - Ray: (5,3) \u2192 (5,2) \u2192 (5,1) \u2192 (5,0).\n\n- (7,6) down-right of 6,5:\n  - No 4-neighbor seeds; diagonal neighbor `q = (6,5)`.\n  - `v = (7,6)-(6,5) = (1,1)` \u2192 down-right.\n  - Ray: (7,6) \u2192 (8,7) \u2192 (9,8) \u2192 (10,9) \u2192 (11,10) \u2192 (12,11) \u2192 (13,12) \u2192 (14,13) \u2192 (15,14) \u2192 (16,15) \u2192 (17,16) \u2192 (18,17) \u2192 (19,18) \u2192 (20,19) \u2192 (21,20) then stops at a `3` beyond.\n\nThese recolor only `8` cells to `2`.

Apply this independently to all such 2\u00d72 color blocks (2,4,6,7,9, etc.).  \n   Rays from different blocks may approach each other, but since we never overwrite non\u20118, whichever ray arrives first at a cell keeps it, and later rays stop before that cell.\n\nThis matches Examples 2 and 4 exactly, and the more complex Examples 1 and 3 are compositions of several such framed blocks and their rays.\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\nThere are five framed 2\u00d72 blocks:\n\n- Color **2** at rows 5\u20136, cols 4\u20135.\n- Color **4** at rows 5\u20136, cols 15\u201316.\n- Color **6** at rows 14\u201315, cols 23\u201324.\n- Color **7** at rows 21\u201322, cols 22\u201323.\n- Color **9** at rows 25\u201326, cols 1\u20132.\n\nFor each:\n\n#### Color 2 block (r5\u20136, c4\u20135)\n\nLocal pattern of 3\u2019s gives three gates:\n\n- Gate (4,4) next to interior (5,4): `D = (-1,0)` \u2192 ray straight up column 4.\n- Gate (5,3) next to interior (5,4): `D = (0,-1)` \u2192 ray left along row 5.\n- Gate (7,6) next to interior (6,5): `D = (1,1)` \u2192 ray diagonally down\u2011right from (6,5) until it hits a non\u20118 (a 3 at (22,21)).\n\nAll those 8\u2019s along the ray become 2\u2019s.\n\n#### Color 4 block (r5\u20136, c15\u201316)\n\nGates:\n\n- (4,14) next to (5,15): `D = (-1,-1)` \u2192 diagonal up\u2011left.\n- (5,17) next to (5,16): `D = (0,1)` \u2192 horizontal to the right along row 5.\n- (7,15) next to (6,15): `D = (1,0)` \u2192 vertical down column 15 until hitting a 2 at (16,15).\n\nThose 8\u2019s become 4\u2019s.\n\n#### Color 6 block (r14\u201315, c23\u201324)\n\nGates:\n\n- (13,23) next to (14,23): `D = (-1,0)` \u2192 vertical up column 23, stopping just before a 4 at (5,23).\n- (13,25) next to (14,24): `D = (-1,1)` \u2192 diagonal up\u2011right.\n- (16,25) next to (15,24): `D = (1,1)` \u2192 diagonal down\u2011right.\n\nThose 8\u2019s become 6\u2019s.\n\n#### Color 7 block (r21\u201322, c22\u201323)\n\nGates (with walls of 3 around):\n\n- (21,24) next to (21,23): `D = (0,1)` \u2192 horizontal ray to the right along row 21.\n- (23,24) next to (22,23): `D = (1,1)` \u2192 diagonal down\u2011right.\n\nThese recolor 8\u2019s to 7\u2019s until they hit other non\u20118 cells.\n\n#### Color 9 block (r25\u201326, c1\u20132)\n\nGates:\n\n- (24,2) next to (25,2): `D = (-1,0)` \u2192 vertical up column 2, stopping one cell above a 2 at (5,2).\n- (27,3) next to (26,2): `D = (1,1)` \u2192 diagonal down\u2011right to bottom.\n\nThose 8\u2019s become 9\u2019s.\n\nApplying all rays in this way (never overwriting any non\u20118) yields the following final grid.\n\n---\n\n### Final output grid\n\nRow 0\u201329, each 30 columns:\n\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,7,7,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

The gap position itself gets filled with the block's color\n\nAnalyzing the test input blocks:\n- **Block 1 (2s)** at rows 5-6, cols 4-5: gaps at (4,4) top edge\u2192up, (5,3) left edge\u2192left, (7,6) corner\u2192diagonal\n- **Block 2 (4s)** at rows 5-6, cols 15-16: gaps at (4,14) corner\u2192diagonal, (5,17) right edge\u2192right, (7,15) bottom edge\u2192down\n- **Block 3 (6s)** at rows 14-15, cols 23-24: gaps at (13,23) top edge\u2192up, (13,25) & (16,25) corners\u2192diagonals\n- **Block 4 (7s)** at rows 20-21, cols 22-23: gap at (20,24) right edge\u2192right, (22,24) corner (only 1, no diagonal)\n- **Block 5 (9s)** at rows 25-26, cols 1-2: gap at (24,2) top edge\u2192up, (27,3) corner (only 1, no diagonal)\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

For each such opening a straight ray of the inner colour is cast outwards, overwriting only 8s and 3s, and stopping before any other colour already present. Rays are cast in the eight compass directions according to which neighbouring cells are open. Applying this in reverse scan order to the test grid gives the following result:\n\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,9,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,9,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,9,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,9,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,3,9,3,3,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,2,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "The transformation works by treating the 3\u2011coloured cells as walls and allowing the \u201cinner\u201d colours to leak out through any openings. From each non\u20113, non\u20118 cell you cast rays through adjacent background cells: straight rays through cardinal openings, and diagonal rays through corner openings (where both orthogonal neighbours are non\u2011background). A ray extends step by step through background cells, but it stops before an obstacle, leaving a gap of one cell between different colours. Obstacles are existing non\u2011background cells already present in the grid.\n\nApplying this to the test grid produces the following output:\n\n```\n2,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,8,2,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,2,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,8,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,6,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,9,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,6,8,8\n8,8,8,4,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7,8,6,8\n8,8,4,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,6\n8,4,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8\n4,8,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,7\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8\n```",
