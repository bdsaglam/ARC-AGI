Identify the \u201cmain objects\u201d and the special color 5\n\nIn every training input:\n\n- There are **exactly five non\u2011zero colors**.\n- Four of them form fairly large connected regions (\u201cmain objects\u201d).\n- Color **5** appears only as a **single pixel** and is embedded in, or touching, the **7\u2011region**.  \n  So 5 is a special marker that belongs to the 7\u2011object.\n\nWe will treat \u201c7+5\u201d as one object whose *dominant* color is 7.\n\nFor the **test** input, the non\u2011zero colors are:\n\n- 2, 3, 5, 7, 8.\n\nColor 5 appears once at (row 17, col 6), clearly inside the big 7\u2011region.  \nSo again we have four main colors/objects:\n\n- object 7 (with embedded 5),\n- object 2,\n- object 3,\n- object 8.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Compute block size and output size\n\nFor each of the four main colors, compute the **bounding box** (ignoring 5):\n\n- Color 2:\n  - rows 0\u20136 \u2192 height 7  \n  - columns 1\u20137 \u2192 width 7\n\n- Color 3:\n  - rows 1\u20137 \u2192 height 7  \n  - columns 9\u201318 \u2192 width 10\n\n- Color 7:\n  - rows 8\u201317 \u2192 height 10  \n  - columns 0\u20136 \u2192 width 7\n\n- Color 8:\n  - rows 11\u201319 \u2192 height 9  \n  - columns 9\u201316 \u2192 width 8\n\nFor each bounding box, take the **smaller side**:\n\n- minDim(2) = 7  \n- minDim(3) = 7  \n- minDim(7) = 7  \n- minDim(8) = 8 \u2192 smaller side 8, but we care about the global minimum.\n\nThe **global minimum side** among all four is:\n\n- `block_size = 7`.\n\nIn the examples, the final output is always a **2\u00d72 tiling of square blocks**, each of size `block_size \u00d7 block_size`:\n\n- Example 1: min side = 3 \u2192 output 6\u00d76 (2\u00d72 blocks of 3\u00d73),\n- Example 2: min side = 5 \u2192 output 10\u00d710,\n- Example 3: min side = 2 \u2192 output 4\u00d74.\n\nSo for the test:\n\n- Output size = `2 * block_size = 14` \u2192 **14\u00d714**.\n\nWe conceptually divide the 14\u00d714 output into 4 quadrants:\n\n- TL (top\u2011left): rows 0\u20136, cols 0\u20136,\n- TR (top\u2011right): rows 0\u20136, cols 7\u201313,\n- BL (bottom\u2011left): rows 7\u201313, cols 0\u20136,\n- BR (bottom\u2011right): rows 7\u201313, cols 7\u201313.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Decide which object goes into which quadrant\n\nFrom the training examples:\n\n1. Identify the four main color components.\n2. Sort them by **top row** of their bounding box (ascending).\n3. If the **7\u2011object** ends up in the **bottom half** of this sorted list (index 2 or 3), we **reverse** the list (flip vertical order). This ensures the 7\u2011object is always in the **top row** of quadrants.\n4. Split the (possibly reversed) list into two pairs:\n   - Top pair \u2192 top row of quadrants,\n   - Bottom pair \u2192 bottom row of quadrants.\n5. Inside each pair, decide left vs right:\n   - For the pair that contains **7**, put 7 on the **left**.\n   - For the other pair:\n     - If we **did not** reverse in step 3: order by **x\u2011coordinate** (center column) ascending \u2192 left = more left object.\n     - If we **did reverse** in step 3: order by **x\u2011coordinate descending** \u2192 left = more right object.\n\nThis rule reproduces the quadrant assignments of all three given examples.\n\nNow apply to the **test**:\n\n### 3.1. Top rows and x\u2011centers\n\nCompute **top row** (min row) of each bounding box and its **horizontal center**:\n\n- Color 2:\n  - topRow = 0,\n  - x\u2011center \u2248 (1 + 7) / 2 = 4.\n\n- Color 3:\n  - topRow = 1,\n  - x\u2011center \u2248 (9 + 18) / 2 = 13.5.\n\n- Color 7:\n  - topRow = 8,\n  - x\u2011center \u2248 (0 + 6) / 2 = 3.\n\n- Color 8:\n  - topRow = 11,\n  - x\u2011center \u2248 (9 + 16) / 2 = 12.5.\n\nSort by topRow ascending:\n\n- A = [2, 3, 7, 8].\n\n7 is at index 2 (bottom half), so we **reverse**:\n\n- A' = [8, 7, 3, 2].\n\nNow form the two pairs:\n\n- Top pair: [8, 7],\n- Bottom pair: [3, 2].\n\nAssign quadrants:\n\n- Top pair has 7; 7 must go on the **left**:\n  - TL = 7,\n  - TR = 8.\n\n- Bottom pair has no 7; since we **reversed vertically**, we now sort this pair by **x\u2011center descending**:\n\n  - x(3) \u2248 13.5,\n  - x(2) \u2248 4,\n  - descending \u2192 left = 3, right = 2.\n\nSo:\n\n- BL = 3,\n- BR = 2.\n\nThus quadrant main colors:\n\n- TL quadrant: 7 (with the embedded special 5),\n- TR quadrant: 8,\n- BL quadrant: 3,\n- BR quadrant: 2.\n\nThis matches the quadrant selection pattern from the examples (7 is always in TL, the others go to TR/BL/BR according to the above ordering logic).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Internal pattern inside the 4 blocks (orientation\u2011reversed case)\n\nStill from the examples, **when the vertical order had to be reversed to bring 7 to the top row** (this occurs in Example 3 and in our test), the internal pattern of the 2\u00d72 blocks follows the same scheme:\n\nLet `s = block_size`.\n\n- **BL block** (rows s..2s\u22121, cols 0..s\u22121):\n  - Completely filled with the BL color (no \u201cbleeding\u201d into it in any example).\n- **TL block** (rows 0..s\u22121, cols 0..s\u22121), with base color TL:\n  - Normally TL everywhere,\n  - Except:\n    - Cell (0,0) is the special color **5**, marking the embedded 5\u2011pixel in the 7\u2011object.\n    - Cell (s\u22121, s\u22121) is set to the **TR color**.\n- **TR block** (rows 0..s\u22121, cols s..2s\u22121), with base color TR:\n  - Base color TR everywhere,\n  - Except:\n    - Local cell (0,0) (global (0, s)) is set to the **TL color**.\n- **BR block** (rows s..2s\u22121, cols s..2s\u22121), with base color BR:\n  - Base color BR everywhere,\n  - Except:\n    - Local cell (0,0) (global (s, s)) is set to the **TR color**.\n\nThis reproduces Example 3 exactly when `s = 2`, and is the natural generalization for the \u201corientation reversed\u201d configuration we have in the test.\n\nFor our test:\n\n- `s = 7`,\n- TL = 7,\n- TR = 8,\n- BL = 3,\n- BR = 2.\n\nSo:\n\n- TL block (7\u00d77):\n  - Start with all 7.\n  - Put 5 at (0,0).\n  - Put 8 (TR color) at (6,6).\n- TR block (7\u00d77):\n  - Start with all 8.\n  - Put 7 at its local (0,0) = global (0,7).\n- BL block (7\u00d77):\n  - All 3.\n- BR block (7\u00d77):\n  - Start with all 2.\n  - Put 8 at its local (0,0) = global (7,7).\n\n---\n\n## 5.

Identify the \u201cobjects\u201d\n\nFrom each training input, there are four main non\u2011zero connected components (\u201cobjects\u201d).  \n\nColor 5 is always a single pixel that is *part of* one of those components (a marker cell, not its own object).\n\nFor the test input the non\u2011zero regions are:\n\n- A large region of 2\u2019s in the upper\u2011left.\n- A large region of 3\u2019s in the upper\u2011right.\n- A large region of 7\u2019s in the lower\u2011left, with a single 5 embedded in it (so this is the \u201c5\u2011cluster\u201d).\n- A large region of 8\u2019s in the lower\u2011right.\n\nSo the four objects are:\n\n- Object A: 2\u2011cluster (upper\u2011left)\n- Object B: 3\u2011cluster (upper\u2011right)\n- Object C: 7+5\u2011cluster (lower\u2011left, includes the 5)\n- Object D: 8\u2011cluster (lower\u2011right)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Determine the block size \\( B \\)\n\nFrom the examples, the output is always a 2\u00d72 tiling of 4 square blocks, each of size \\( B \\times B \\), where\n\n> \\( B = \\min\\big(\\min(\\text{height},\\text{width}) \\text{ over all four objects} \\big) \\)\n\nChecking that rule on the training examples gives:\n- Example 1: \\( B = 3 \\), output size \\( 6 \\times 6 \\)\n- Example 2: \\( B = 5 \\), output size \\( 10 \\times 10 \\)\n- Example 3: \\( B = 2 \\), output size \\( 4 \\times 4 \\)\n\nFor the test input:\n\n- Object 2 (A): rows 0\u20136, cols 1\u20137 \u2192 height 7, width 7 \u2192 min dim 7\n- Object 3 (B): rows 1\u20137, cols 9\u201318 \u2192 height 7, width 10 \u2192 min dim 7\n- Object 7+5 (C): rows 8\u201317, cols 0\u20136 \u2192 height 10, width 7 \u2192 min dim 7\n- Object 8 (D): rows 11\u201319, cols 9\u201315 \u2192 height 9, width 7 \u2192 min dim 7\n\nSo:\n- \\( B = 7 \\)\n- Output grid size = \\( 2B \\times 2B = 14 \\times 14 \\)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Place the four objects into quadrants\n\nIn the training examples, the four objects are conceptually arranged as quadrants ([TL, TR; BL, BR]) based on their positions (upper\u2011left, upper\u2011right, etc.). Then they are *permuted* so that:\n\n> the object that contains color 5 becomes the **top\u2011left** quadrant in the output.\n\nThe permutation pattern depends on where the 5\u2011object started:\n\n- Example 2: 5\u2011object already in TL \u2192 arrangement unchanged:  \n  `[A,B;C,D] \u2192 [A,B;C,D]`\n- Example 1: 5\u2011object originally in TR \u2192 TL and TR swapped:  \n  `[A,B;C,D] \u2192 [B,A;C,D]`\n- Example 3: 5\u2011object originally in BL \u2192 observed mapping:  \n  `[A,B;C,D] \u2192 [C,D;B,A]`\n\nIn our test case, the 5\u2011object is in the **BL** of the original layout:\n\nOriginal spatial quadrants of objects:\n\n- TL: A (2)\n- TR: B (3)\n- BL: C (7+5)\n- BR: D (8)\n\nSo this matches the Example\u20113 situation: 5\u2011object in BL.\n\nWe therefore apply the same permutation pattern:\n\n\\[\n[A,B;C,D] \\to [C,D;B,A]\n\\]\n\nSo the output quadrants (in terms of dominant color) will be:\n\n- TL: C \u2192 7\u2011cluster (with the single 5)\n- TR: D \u2192 8\u2011cluster\n- BL: B \u2192 3\u2011cluster\n- BR: A \u2192 2\u2011cluster\n\nEach of these is a \\(7 \\times 7\\) block.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Fill the \\(7 \\times 7\\) blocks (pattern from the \u201c5\u2011in\u2011BL\u201d case)\n\nFrom Example 3 (the only training case where the 5\u2011object started in BL), with \\( B = 2 \\), we can extract the *shape* of each quadrant\u2019s block in terms of **which object\u2019s color is used where**:\n\nFor that case (Example 3), after the permutation the quadrants were:\n\n- TL: 5+7 object (I\u2081)\n- TR: 8 object      (I\u2082)\n- BL: 6 object      (I\u2083)\n- BR: 2 object      (I\u2084)\n\nAnd their \\(2 \\times 2\\) patches (expressed as \u201cobject IDs\u201d rather than specific colors) were:\n\n- TL patch I\u2081:\n  ```\n  I\u2081 I\u2081\n  I\u2081 I\u2082\n  ```\n- TR patch I\u2082:\n  ```\n  I\u2081 I\u2082\n  I\u2082 I\u2082\n  ```\n- BL patch I\u2083:\n  ```\n  I\u2083 I\u2083\n  I\u2083 I\u2083\n  ```\n- BR patch I\u2084:\n  ```\n  I\u2082 I\u2084\n  I\u2084 I\u2084\n  ```\n\nInterpreting this pattern for the \u201c5\u2011object in BL\u201d situation:\n\n- The **BL block (I\u2083)** is completely uniform: just its own object\u2019s color.\n- The **TL block (I\u2081)**:\n  - Is filled with its own color.\n  - Has its **bottom\u2011right** cell overwritten by the TR object\u2019s color.\n  - Has its **top\u2011left** cell overwritten by the literal color 5 (the special marker), instead of the base color of that object.\n- The **TR block (I\u2082)**:\n  - Is filled with its own color.\n  - Has its **top\u2011left** cell overwritten by the TL object\u2019s color (but *not* 5, the base cluster color).\n- The **BR block (I\u2084)**:\n  - Is filled with its own color.\n  - Has its **top\u2011left** cell overwritten by the TR object\u2019s color.\n\nThis gives a **generic rule** for the \u201c5\u2011object in BL\u201d case, for any block size \\( B \\ge 2 \\):\n\n- TL block (size \\(B \\times B\\)):\n  - Fill with TL object\u2019s base color.\n  - Set cell \\((0,0)\\) to color 5.\n  - Set cell \\((B-1,B-1)\\) to the TR object\u2019s base color.\n- TR block:\n  - Fill with TR object\u2019s base color.\n  - Set cell \\((0,0)\\) (top\u2011left of the TR block) to the TL object\u2019s base color.\n- BL block:\n  - Fill uniformly with BL object\u2019s base color.\n- BR block:\n  - Fill with BR object\u2019s base color.\n  - Set cell \\((0,0)\\) (top\u2011left of the BR block) to the TR object\u2019s base color.\n\nWe now apply this to the test, with:\n\n- TL object base color: 7\n- TR object base color: 8\n- BL object base color: 3\n- BR object base color: 2\n- \\(B = 7\\)\n\n---\n\n## 5.

Apply the special 5 and the \u201cinfiltration\u201d rules for the \u201c5\u2011in\u2011BL\u201d case:\n\n   - Put 5 at the global top\u2011left: TL block (0,0) = 5.\n   - TL bottom\u2011right: (B\u20111,B\u20111) = (6,6) set to TR\u2019s base color (8).\n   - TR top\u2011left: global (0,7) set to TL\u2019s base color (7).\n   - BR top\u2011left: global (7,7) set to TR\u2019s base color (8).\n\nThe resulting 14\u00d714 grid is:\n\nRow 0:  \n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 1:  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 2:  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 3:  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 4:  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 5:  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 6:  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 7:  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,2,2,2,2,2,2\n\nRow 8:  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n\nRow 9:  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n\nRow 10:  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n\nRow 11:  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n\nRow 12:  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n\nRow 13:  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\nHere is the completed output grid in CSV row form:\n\n```\n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_B>\n</CANDIDATE 4>\n<CANDIDATE 19>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 14x14\n57777778888888\n77777778888888\n77777778888888\n77777888888888\n77777778888888\n77777778888888\n77777778888888\n33373332228222\n33373332222222\n33373332222222\n33333333332222\n33333332222222\n33333332222222\n33333332222222\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_6_step_5_deep_thinking\">\nThe transformation identifies each distinct non\u2011zero color as a piece, anchors the 7\u2011colored piece in the top\u2011left corner with the 5 overlaid at (0,0), assigns the remaining colors to the other corners, and rotates them to fit together into a square whose side length is the square root of the total number of colored cells.

then match these via the column sums of B and C in their chosen orientations.\n\n   After subtracting A and D, the remaining column counts (to be filled by B and C) are:\n\n   ```\n   [7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7]\n   ```\n\n   Column\u2011sum patterns:\n\n   * B (0\u00b0) columns: [6,6,6,6,7,7,7]\n   * C (180\u00b0) columns: reversed C0  \n     = [7,7,7,4,7,7,7,1,1,1]\n\n   Try two possibilities:\n\n   *C at left, B at right* (C on cols 1\u201310, B on 8\u201314):\n\n   - Combined col sums become exactly  \n     `[7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7]`.\n\n   *The other assignment (B left, C right) fails immediately* on column 1.\n\n   \u21d2 **C (3\u2011piece, 180\u00b0) is bottom\u2011left**, occupying rows 8\u201314, cols 1\u201310;  \n   **B (2\u2011piece, 0\u00b0) is bottom\u2011right**, rows 8\u201314, cols 8\u201314.\n\n   With these orientations and positions fixed, all row and column sums match and areas match, which strongly indicates a consistent tiling with no overlaps.\n\n7. **Build the final 14\u00d714 grid**\n\n   Now we overlay all four pieces:\n\n   * A (7+5), 180\u00b0 rotation, at rows 1\u201310, cols 1\u20137;

This involves acting as a logic auditor, verifying the candidate's reasoning against the ground truth (solved examples) and then checking the consistency of the proposed solution on the test input.**\n\nI started by thoroughly analyzing the solved examples to understand the underlying logic. The key seems to be the \"conservation of mass\" principle; the output's total pixel count always equals the total number of colored pixels in the input. Furthermore, the output shape is always a square, with a side length equal to the square root of the total pixel count. The puzzling part is how the input clusters are packed into this square. It appears to be a complex, \"tetris-like\" packing problem where the individual shapes (polyominoes) are preserved but arranged in the output. The presence of a pixel with the value of \"5\" in Example 3 which is always at position (0,0) in the output, introduces an important anchor to the solution which can be used to rotate the pieces to get their correct orientation.\n\nI then moved on to the test input and performed an initial analysis, calculating the pixel counts for each color. Based on the solved examples, I estimated the output size would be a 14x14 grid.\n\nThe meat of the audit lies in examining the reasoning of each candidate. The first candidate (Candidate 4) assumes that the block size is defined based on the \"minimum dimension of objects\". Based on this block size, it divides the outputs into quadrants and assigns each shape a place. The solution does not account for the irregular shapes of the polyominoes, and the logic is rejected.\n\nThe second candidate (Candidate 19) provides the best and most likely model. It correctly identifies the task as a packing problem with rotated pieces, which leads to the idea of the conservation of mass. Additionally, the candidate claims that each connected component is a polyomino piece, the output is a square whose area equals the number of non-zero cells and shapes are preserved exactly up to rotation with a constant rotation for all inputs. Crucially, the approach attempts to solve this tiling puzzle using \"constraint satisfaction\", by using the bounding box of a part, as well as row and column sums, to pack and calculate a fit. The test data also had a gap which was matched to the 'tail' of the piece with the '7'. This demonstrates an understanding of the relationship between geometry, space, and orientation. After comparing it with the constraints imposed on the test case, this approach works consistently.\n\nThe third candidate (Candidate 26) seems to employ a very simplistic \"Voronoi\" or \"Relative Position\" logic, which doesn't capture the intricacy of the packing. This approach results in simple rectangles of color, rather than the intricate interlocking seen in the examples and implied by the shape geometry. This is rejected for inconsistencies.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, the clear winner is Candidate 19, which correctly models the packing problem and shows strong geometrical reasoning. Candidate 4's logic is fundamentally flawed, and Candidate 26's approach is overly simplistic. Candidate 19's method provides the only valid and physically consistent solution.\n\n\n<AUDIT_LOG>\n### PHASE 1: LOGIC SELECTION & CRYSTALLIZATION\n\n**Selected Candidate:** Candidate 19\n**Reasoning Source:** Model B (detailed polyomino tiling logic).\n\n**Crystallized Rule:**\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Treat each connected color region as a rigid \"polyomino\" piece. The single pixel of color 5 is an integral part of the color 7 object (marker).\n2.  **Determine Output Size:** Calculate the total number of non-zero pixels in the input. The output is a square grid with dimensions $S \\times S$ such that $S^2 = \\text{Total Pixels}$.\n3.  **Orientation Constraint:** Find the piece containing the color 5. Rotate this piece such that the 5 is located at the top-left (0,0) of the piece's bounding box. Anchor this piece at (0,0) in the output grid.\n4.  **Jigsaw Packing:** Rotate and position the remaining pieces to completely fill the $S \\times S$ grid without overlap. The pieces must interlock, utilizing any holes or protrusions (e.g., a \"tail\" of one piece filling a \"gap\" in another).\n\n---\n\n### PHASE 2: THE GROUND TRUTH AUDIT\n\n**Example 1:**\n*   **Hypothesis:** Input has pieces of color 9, 7+5, 4, 3. Total area = 36 pixels (checked manually: 9+7+12+8=36). Output should be 6x6. Pieces should be packed.\n*   **Observation:** Output is 6x6. The shapes are visible but tightly packed. The 7+5 piece is at the top, but the 5 is at (0,0). The 9s, 4s, and 3s fill the rest.\n*   **Verdict:** Pass.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*   **Hypothesis:** Total non-zero pixels = 100. Output 10x10. Pieces 7+5, 2, 3, 6 packed.\n*   **Observation:** Output is 10x10. 5 is at (0,0). The pieces fit together. Notably, the 7-piece and 2-piece interlock significantly (row 4, col 2 has a '3' inside the 7-block? No, looking at Ex 2 output, Row 4 is `77377...` This suggests the pieces are interleaved or one fills a hole in another).\n*   **Verdict:** Pass. Matches the \"Jigsaw\" hypothesis better than simple quadrants.\n\n**Example 3:**\n*   **Hypothesis:** Input has 2, 6, 8, 7+5. Total area 16. Output 4x4.\n*   **Observation:** Output is 4x4. 5 is at (0,0). The output `5778 / 7888 / 6682 / 6622` shows the pieces packed tightly.\n*   **Verdict:** Pass.\n\n---\n\n### PHASE 3: EXECUTION CONSISTENCY\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n*   **Objects:**\n    *   **Piece 7+5:** Large block with a \"tail\" of three vertical 7s at the bottom.\n    *   **Piece 3:** Large block with a vertical \"gap\" (1-pixel wide) in the middle.\n    *   **Piece 2:** Block with a \"gap\" in the top row.\n    *   **Piece 8:** Block with a \"tail\" of two vertical 8s at the bottom.\n*   **Consistency Check for Candidate 19:**\n    *   Candidate 19 rotates Piece 7+5 (180\u00b0) so the 5 is at (0,0). This puts the \"tail\" pointing *down* into the region below.\n    *   Candidate 19 places Piece 3 in the bottom-left. The grid shows the 7-tail intruding into the 3-region (`3337333`). This implies Piece 3 fills around the tail. Does Piece 3 have a corresponding hole? Yes! The input Piece 3 has a vertical gap `00033303330`.\n    *   Candidate 19 places Piece 8 in the top-right and Piece 2 in the bottom-right. The grid shows the 8-tail intruding into the 2-region (`2228222`). Does Piece 2 have a hole? Yes! The input Piece 2 has a gap `022202220`.\n*   **Consistency Check for Candidate 4:**\n    *   Candidate 4 fills the Bottom-Left quadrant with solid 3s. This deletes the hole in the 3-piece.\n    *   Candidate 4 fills the Top-Left quadrant with solid 7s (except corners). This deletes the tail of the 7-piece.\n    *   **Verdict:** Candidate 4 hallucinates shapes (rectangles) that don't exist. Candidate 19 respects the actual topology of the objects.\n\n---\n\n### PHASE 4: STACK RANKING & TIE-BREAKING\n\n1.  **Candidate 19 (GOLD):** Correctly identifies the problem as a Jigsaw Packing task. The solution grid proves this by perfectly matching the protrusions (tails) of the 7 and 8 pieces into the holes of the 3 and 2 pieces respectively. This is a high-precision match.\n2.  **Candidate 4 (INVALID):** Assumes pieces are generic blocks/rectangles and tries to apply a \"corner bleeding\" rule. Fails to account for the actual geometry (holes/tails) of the pieces, leading to a physically impossible packing (overlapping or shape-deleting).\n3.  **Candidate 26 (INVALID):** Applies a Voronoi filter that destroys the specific shapes of the pieces. Fails on Example 1 and Test Input geometry.\n\n</AUDIT_LOG>\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 19,\n      \"score\": 9.8,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Perfectly explains the task as a Jigsaw Packing problem.

fits all three training examples and then applied it to the test.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Identify the \u201cmain objects\u201d and the special color 5\n\nIn every training input:\n\n- There are **exactly five non\u2011zero colors**.\n- Four of them form fairly large connected regions (\u201cmain objects\u201d).\n- Color **5** appears only as a **single pixel** and is embedded in, or touching, the **7\u2011region**.  \n  So 5 is a special marker that belongs to the 7\u2011object.\n\nWe will treat \u201c7+5\u201d as one object whose *dominant* color is 7.\n\nFor the **test** input, the non\u2011zero colors are:\n\n- 2, 3, 5, 7, 8.\n\nColor 5 appears once at (row 17, col 6), clearly inside the big 7\u2011region.  \nSo again we have four main colors/objects:\n\n- object 7 (with embedded 5),\n- object 2,\n- object 3,\n- object 8.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Compute block size and output size\n\nFor each of the four main colors, compute the **bounding box** (ignoring 5):\n\n- Color 2:\n  - rows 0\u20136 \u2192 height 7  \n  - columns 1\u20137 \u2192 width 7\n\n- Color 3:\n  - rows 1\u20137 \u2192 height 7  \n  - columns 9\u201318 \u2192 width 10\n\n- Color 7:\n  - rows 8\u201317 \u2192 height 10  \n  - columns 0\u20136 \u2192 width 7\n\n- Color 8:\n  - rows 11\u201319 \u2192 height 9  \n  - columns 9\u201316 \u2192 width 8\n\nFor each bounding box, take the **smaller side**:\n\n- minDim(2) = 7  \n- minDim(3) = 7  \n- minDim(7) = 7  \n- minDim(8) = 8 \u2192 smaller side 8, but we care about the global minimum.\n\nThe **global minimum side** among all four is:\n\n- `block_size = 7`.\n\nIn the examples, the final output is always a **2\u00d72 tiling of square blocks**, each of size `block_size \u00d7 block_size`:\n\n- Example 1: min side = 3 \u2192 output 6\u00d76 (2\u00d72 blocks of 3\u00d73),\n- Example 2: min side = 5 \u2192 output 10\u00d710,\n- Example 3: min side = 2 \u2192 output 4\u00d74.\n\nSo for the test:\n\n- Output size = `2 * block_size = 14` \u2192 **14\u00d714**.\n\nWe conceptually divide the 14\u00d714 output into 4 quadrants:\n\n- TL (top\u2011left): rows 0\u20136, cols 0\u20136,\n- TR (top\u2011right): rows 0\u20136, cols 7\u201313,\n- BL (bottom\u2011left): rows 7\u201313, cols 0\u20136,\n- BR (bottom\u2011right): rows 7\u201313, cols 7\u201313.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Decide which object goes into which quadrant\n\nFrom the training examples:\n\n1. Identify the four main color components.\n2. Sort them by **top row** of their bounding box (ascending).\n3. If the **7\u2011object** ends up in the **bottom half** of this sorted list (index 2 or 3), we **reverse** the list (flip vertical order). This ensures the 7\u2011object is always in the **top row** of quadrants.\n4. Split the (possibly reversed) list into two pairs:\n   - Top pair \u2192 top row of quadrants,\n   - Bottom pair \u2192 bottom row of quadrants.\n5. Inside each pair, decide left vs right:\n   - For the pair that contains **7**, put 7 on the **left**.\n   - For the other pair:\n     - If we **did not** reverse in step 3: order by **x\u2011coordinate** (center column) ascending \u2192 left = more left object.\n     - If we **did reverse** in step 3: order by **x\u2011coordinate descending** \u2192 left = more right object.\n\nThis rule reproduces the quadrant assignments of all three given examples.\n\nNow apply to the **test**:\n\n### 3.1. Top rows and x\u2011centers\n\nCompute **top row** (min row) of each bounding box and its **horizontal center**:\n\n- Color 2:\n  - topRow = 0,\n  - x\u2011center \u2248 (1 + 7) / 2 = 4.\n\n- Color 3:\n  - topRow = 1,\n  - x\u2011center \u2248 (9 + 18) / 2 = 13.5.\n\n- Color 7:\n  - topRow = 8,\n  - x\u2011center \u2248 (0 + 6) / 2 = 3.\n\n- Color 8:\n  - topRow = 11,\n  - x\u2011center \u2248 (9 + 16) / 2 = 12.5.\n\nSort by topRow ascending:\n\n- A = [2, 3, 7, 8].\n\n7 is at index 2 (bottom half), so we **reverse**:\n\n- A' = [8, 7, 3, 2].\n\nNow form the two pairs:\n\n- Top pair: [8, 7],\n- Bottom pair: [3, 2].\n\nAssign quadrants:\n\n- Top pair has 7; 7 must go on the **left**:\n  - TL = 7,\n  - TR = 8.\n\n- Bottom pair has no 7; since we **reversed vertically**, we now sort this pair by **x\u2011center descending**:\n\n  - x(3) \u2248 13.5,\n  - x(2) \u2248 4,\n  - descending \u2192 left = 3, right = 2.\n\nSo:\n\n- BL = 3,\n- BR = 2.\n\nThus quadrant main colors:\n\n- TL quadrant: 7 (with the embedded special 5),\n- TR quadrant: 8,\n- BL quadrant: 3,\n- BR quadrant: 2.\n\nThis matches the quadrant selection pattern from the examples (7 is always in TL, the others go to TR/BL/BR according to the above ordering logic).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Internal pattern inside the 4 blocks (orientation\u2011reversed case)\n\nStill from the examples, **when the vertical order had to be reversed to bring 7 to the top row** (this occurs in Example 3 and in our test), the internal pattern of the 2\u00d72 blocks follows the same scheme:\n\nLet `s = block_size`.\n\n- **BL block** (rows s..2s\u22121, cols 0..s\u22121):\n  - Completely filled with the BL color (no \u201cbleeding\u201d into it in any example).\n- **TL block** (rows 0..s\u22121, cols 0..s\u22121), with base color TL:\n  - Normally TL everywhere,\n  - Except:\n    - Cell (0,0) is the special color **5**, marking the embedded 5\u2011pixel in the 7\u2011object.\n    - Cell (s\u22121, s\u22121) is set to the **TR color**.\n- **TR block** (rows 0..s\u22121, cols s..2s\u22121), with base color TR:\n  - Base color TR everywhere,\n  - Except:\n    - Local cell (0,0) (global (0, s)) is set to the **TL color**.\n- **BR block** (rows s..2s\u22121, cols s..2s\u22121), with base color BR:\n  - Base color BR everywhere,\n  - Except:\n    - Local cell (0,0) (global (s, s)) is set to the **TR color**.\n\nThis reproduces Example 3 exactly when `s = 2`, and is the natural generalization for the \u201corientation reversed\u201d configuration we have in the test.\n\nFor our test:\n\n- `s = 7`,\n- TL = 7,\n- TR = 8,\n- BL = 3,\n- BR = 2.\n\nSo:\n\n- TL block (7\u00d77):\n  - Start with all 7.\n  - Put 5 at (0,0).\n  - Put 8 (TR color) at (6,6).\n- TR block (7\u00d77):\n  - Start with all 8.\n  - Put 7 at its local (0,0) = global (0,7).\n- BL block (7\u00d77):\n  - All 3.\n- BR block (7\u00d77):\n  - Start with all 2.\n  - Put 8 at its local (0,0) = global (7,7).\n\n---\n\n## 5.

Identify the \u201cobjects\u201d\n\nFrom each training input, there are four main non\u2011zero connected components (\u201cobjects\u201d).  \n\nColor 5 is always a single pixel that is *part of* one of those components (a marker cell, not its own object).\n\nFor the test input the non\u2011zero regions are:\n\n- A large region of 2\u2019s in the upper\u2011left.\n- A large region of 3\u2019s in the upper\u2011right.\n- A large region of 7\u2019s in the lower\u2011left, with a single 5 embedded in it (so this is the \u201c5\u2011cluster\u201d).\n- A large region of 8\u2019s in the lower\u2011right.\n\nSo the four objects are:\n\n- Object A: 2\u2011cluster (upper\u2011left)\n- Object B: 3\u2011cluster (upper\u2011right)\n- Object C: 7+5\u2011cluster (lower\u2011left, includes the 5)\n- Object D: 8\u2011cluster (lower\u2011right)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Determine the block size \\( B \\)\n\nFrom the examples, the output is always a 2\u00d72 tiling of 4 square blocks, each of size \\( B \\times B \\), where\n\n> \\( B = \\min\\big(\\min(\\text{height},\\text{width}) \\text{ over all four objects} \\big) \\)\n\nChecking that rule on the training examples gives:\n- Example 1: \\( B = 3 \\), output size \\( 6 \\times 6 \\)\n- Example 2: \\( B = 5 \\), output size \\( 10 \\times 10 \\)\n- Example 3: \\( B = 2 \\), output size \\( 4 \\times 4 \\)\n\nFor the test input:\n\n- Object 2 (A): rows 0\u20136, cols 1\u20137 \u2192 height 7, width 7 \u2192 min dim 7\n- Object 3 (B): rows 1\u20137, cols 9\u201318 \u2192 height 7, width 10 \u2192 min dim 7\n- Object 7+5 (C): rows 8\u201317, cols 0\u20136 \u2192 height 10, width 7 \u2192 min dim 7\n- Object 8 (D): rows 11\u201319, cols 9\u201315 \u2192 height 9, width 7 \u2192 min dim 7\n\nSo:\n- \\( B = 7 \\)\n- Output grid size = \\( 2B \\times 2B = 14 \\times 14 \\)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Place the four objects into quadrants\n\nIn the training examples, the four objects are conceptually arranged as quadrants ([TL, TR; BL, BR]) based on their positions (upper\u2011left, upper\u2011right, etc.). Then they are *permuted* so that:\n\n> the object that contains color 5 becomes the **top\u2011left** quadrant in the output.\n\nThe permutation pattern depends on where the 5\u2011object started:\n\n- Example 2: 5\u2011object already in TL \u2192 arrangement unchanged:  \n  `[A,B;C,D] \u2192 [A,B;C,D]`\n- Example 1: 5\u2011object originally in TR \u2192 TL and TR swapped:  \n  `[A,B;C,D] \u2192 [B,A;C,D]`\n- Example 3: 5\u2011object originally in BL \u2192 observed mapping:  \n  `[A,B;C,D] \u2192 [C,D;B,A]`\n\nIn our test case, the 5\u2011object is in the **BL** of the original layout:\n\nOriginal spatial quadrants of objects:\n\n- TL: A (2)\n- TR: B (3)\n- BL: C (7+5)\n- BR: D (8)\n\nSo this matches the Example\u20113 situation: 5\u2011object in BL.\n\nWe therefore apply the same permutation pattern:\n\n\\[\n[A,B;C,D] \\to [C,D;B,A]\n\\]\n\nSo the output quadrants (in terms of dominant color) will be:\n\n- TL: C \u2192 7\u2011cluster (with the single 5)\n- TR: D \u2192 8\u2011cluster\n- BL: B \u2192 3\u2011cluster\n- BR: A \u2192 2\u2011cluster\n\nEach of these is a \\(7 \\times 7\\) block.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Fill the \\(7 \\times 7\\) blocks (pattern from the \u201c5\u2011in\u2011BL\u201d case)\n\nFrom Example 3 (the only training case where the 5\u2011object started in BL), with \\( B = 2 \\), we can extract the *shape* of each quadrant\u2019s block in terms of **which object\u2019s color is used where**:\n\nFor that case (Example 3), after the permutation the quadrants were:\n\n- TL: 5+7 object (I\u2081)\n- TR: 8 object      (I\u2082)\n- BL: 6 object      (I\u2083)\n- BR: 2 object      (I\u2084)\n\nAnd their \\(2 \\times 2\\) patches (expressed as \u201cobject IDs\u201d rather than specific colors) were:\n\n- TL patch I\u2081:\n  ```\n  I\u2081 I\u2081\n  I\u2081 I\u2082\n  ```\n- TR patch I\u2082:\n  ```\n  I\u2081 I\u2082\n  I\u2082 I\u2082\n  ```\n- BL patch I\u2083:\n  ```\n  I\u2083 I\u2083\n  I\u2083 I\u2083\n  ```\n- BR patch I\u2084:\n  ```\n  I\u2082 I\u2084\n  I\u2084 I\u2084\n  ```\n\nInterpreting this pattern for the \u201c5\u2011object in BL\u201d situation:\n\n- The **BL block (I\u2083)** is completely uniform: just its own object\u2019s color.\n- The **TL block (I\u2081)**:\n  - Is filled with its own color.\n  - Has its **bottom\u2011right** cell overwritten by the TR object\u2019s color.\n  - Has its **top\u2011left** cell overwritten by the literal color 5 (the special marker), instead of the base color of that object.\n- The **TR block (I\u2082)**:\n  - Is filled with its own color.\n  - Has its **top\u2011left** cell overwritten by the TL object\u2019s color (but *not* 5, the base cluster color).\n- The **BR block (I\u2084)**:\n  - Is filled with its own color.\n  - Has its **top\u2011left** cell overwritten by the TR object\u2019s color.\n\nThis gives a **generic rule** for the \u201c5\u2011object in BL\u201d case, for any block size \\( B \\ge 2 \\):\n\n- TL block (size \\(B \\times B\\)):\n  - Fill with TL object\u2019s base color.\n  - Set cell \\((0,0)\\) to color 5.\n  - Set cell \\((B-1,B-1)\\) to the TR object\u2019s base color.\n- TR block:\n  - Fill with TR object\u2019s base color.\n  - Set cell \\((0,0)\\) (top\u2011left of the TR block) to the TL object\u2019s base color.\n- BL block:\n  - Fill uniformly with BL object\u2019s base color.\n- BR block:\n  - Fill with BR object\u2019s base color.\n  - Set cell \\((0,0)\\) (top\u2011left of the BR block) to the TR object\u2019s base color.\n\nWe now apply this to the test, with:\n\n- TL object base color: 7\n- TR object base color: 8\n- BL object base color: 3\n- BR object base color: 2\n- \\(B = 7\\)\n\n---\n\n## 5.

therefore:\n\n   * Rows 1\u20134 **cannot** be touched by any bottom piece (C or B) in any allowed orientation (their heights \u226410).\n   * So rows 1\u20134 must be filled entirely by the **UR** piece.\n\n   We compute row\u2011sum patterns of each piece in all rotations and see which can provide row sums\n   `[7,7,7,9]` for the first four rows.\n\n   For D (8\u2011piece):\n\n   * In its 90\u00b0 clockwise rotation, its row sums from top are  \n     `[7,7,7,9,7,7,7,1]`.\n\n   That matches `[7,7,7,9]` for the first four rows.  \n   No other piece/orientation produces that.  \n   \u21d2 **D (rotated 90\u00b0 clockwise) must be the UR piece**, sitting in rows 1\u20138, cols 6\u201314.\n\n   Subtracting D\u2019s contribution from the row totals, the remaining per\u2011row counts for rows 8\u201314 (to be filled by B and C) are:\n\n   ```\n   r8 : 12\n   r9 : 13\n   r10: 13\n   r11: 14\n   r12: 14\n   r13: 14\n   r14: 14\n   ```\n\n   Now we consider B and C as **bottom\u2011anchored**:\n\n   * B (height 7 in any rotation).  \n     Candidate row-sum sequences (top\u2192bottom) are:\n     - 0\u00b0:     [6,7,7,4,7,7,7]\n     - 180\u00b0:   [7,7,7,4,7,7,6]\n     - 90\u00b0/270\u00b0: [6,6,6,6,7,7,7] or its reverse.\n   * C, if rotated 90\u00b0 would have height 10 and reach into rows 5\u20137, which must already be filled by A+D, impossible.  \n     So C must be 0\u00b0 or 180\u00b0 (height 7):\n     - 0\u00b0:   [7,7,7,10,6,6,6]\n     - 180\u00b0: [6,6,6,10,7,7,7]\n\n   We need B_rows + C_rows = [12,13,13,14,14,14,14].\n\n   Checking combinations, there is a unique solution:\n\n   * B in **0\u00b0** orientation: [6,7,7,4,7,7,7]\n   * C in **180\u00b0** orientation: [6,6,6,10,7,7,7]\n\n   Their sum row\u2011wise:\n   `[12,13,13,14,14,14,14]` \u2013 exactly as required.\n\n6. **Left vs right at the bottom (by column sums)**\n\n   Next we use **column sums** to decide whether the 2\u2011piece goes bottom\u2011left or bottom\u2011right.\n\n   First compute the column\u2011wise remaining cells after placing A and D; then match these via the column sums of B and C in their chosen orientations.\n\n   After subtracting A and D, the remaining column counts (to be filled by B and C) are:\n\n   ```\n   [7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7]\n   ```\n\n   Column\u2011sum patterns:\n\n   * B (0\u00b0) columns: [6,6,6,6,7,7,7]\n   * C (180\u00b0) columns: reversed C0  \n     = [7,7,7,4,7,7,7,1,1,1]\n\n   Try two possibilities:\n\n   *C at left, B at right* (C on cols 1\u201310, B on 8\u201314):\n\n   - Combined col sums become exactly  \n     `[7,7,7,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7]`.\n\n   *The other assignment (B left, C right) fails immediately* on column 1.\n\n   \u21d2 **C (3\u2011piece, 180\u00b0) is bottom\u2011left**, occupying rows 8\u201314, cols 1\u201310;  \n   **B (2\u2011piece, 0\u00b0) is bottom\u2011right**, rows 8\u201314, cols 8\u201314.\n\n   With these orientations and positions fixed, all row and column sums match and areas match, which strongly indicates a consistent tiling with no overlaps.\n\n7. **Build the final 14\u00d714 grid**\n\n   Now we overlay all four pieces:\n\n   * A (7+5), 180\u00b0 rotation, at rows 1\u201310, cols 1\u20137; (1,1) is color 5, the rest are 7.\n   * D (8), 90\u00b0 clockwise, at rows 1\u20138, cols 6\u201314.\n   * C (3), 180\u00b0 rotation, at rows 8\u201314, cols 1\u201310.\n   * B (2), 0\u00b0 rotation, at rows 8\u201314, cols 8\u201314.\n\n   Checking cell\u2011by\u2011cell shows no overlaps and every cell is covered.  \n   Counting colors gives exactly the original counts: 5:1, 7:49, 2:45, 3:49, 8:52.\n\n8. **Final output grid**\n\nHere is the resulting 14\u00d714 output:\n\n```\n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,7,3,3,3,2,2,2,8,2,2,2\n3,3,3,7,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,7,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      5,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,3,7,3,3,3,2,2,2,8,2,2,2\n      3,3,3,7,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      3,3,3,7,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"26\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at this problem, I need to:\n1.

                "response": "**My Assessment: Deep Dive into ARC Task Solutions**\n\nAlright, here's the deal. I've been tasked with dissecting three potential solutions for an ARC problem. It's all about grids, sparse inputs with colored objects, and dense square outputs.  My focus is on understanding the reasoning behind these solutions and determining which one actually gets it.\n\n**The Setup:**\n\nI'm looking at three training examples and one test input. The inputs are these big, sparse grids, with colored regions. The outputs are these smaller, dense, square grids. A key observation is that the color '5' appears adjacent to other colors in the training examples.\n\n**Training Examples: Clues to the Solution:**\n\n*   **Example 1:** This is where the lightbulb really starts to flicker. We have a set of colored blocks (purple, orange, yellow, green) in the input. The output is a 6x6 grid.  Here's the pattern: the output seems to be a tiled version of the input shapes.  More precisely, the output is a 6x6 grid where each of the input objects is essentially packed into it. The area covered by all the colors in the input is equal to the number of pixels in the output (36). The shape of the objects are more or less conserved, but the relative positions are altered. The \"5\" is interesting - it seems to \"anchor\" the 7-block.  There's some bleeding or wrapping effect too. I'm noting the shape of each object as well, and I think that, because there is no missing pixel, that this may be the key to the task.\n\n*   **Example 2:** Similar story. We have some colors (7, 2, 3, 6) in the input. The output is a 10x10 grid, which means 100 pixels. The key here is the relative positioning of the shapes again.  The relative shape of the '7' and '5' is preserved.\n\n*   **Example 3:** Now, the colors are 2, 6, 8, and 7. There's a '5' adjacent to the 7. The output is a 4x4 grid. The objects are again, relatively positioned the same way.\n\n**The Test Input:**\n\nThis is the acid test.  Four main colored regions with a '5'. I've tallied the pixel counts, and the total is 196. This means the output needs to be a 14x14 grid.\n\n**The Candidate Solutions: Let the Games Begin!**\n\n*   **Candidate 4:** Their approach is \"quadrant assignments\" with some \"infiltration\". Essentially, they're dividing the output into solid blocks. I'm seeing big problems with this because the training examples clearly show the *shapes* of the objects matter, and they are not necessarily solid blocks. For example, the 7-object in Example 1 has a specific shape. This is a low-scoring approach. **Verdict: Low Score, fails to account for shape preservation.**\n\n*   **Candidate 19:**  They call it \"conservation of mass + tiling\".  This is interesting. They are trying to pack the inputs into a grid without any overlap.  They're identifying each shape, counting pixels, and determining the size of the output (14x14). They rotate the objects and fit the output like a jigsaw puzzle. They anchor the 7+5 object in the TL corner. Based on the counts, this appears to be a good candidate and a *much* higher score. Let's dig in. They seem to preserve all objects, shapes, and have a good strategy. **Verdict: Excellent.**\n\n    *   **Candidate 19 Audit (Jigsaw Time!):** I've checked Example 1 and the logic appears to work.\n\n*   **Candidate 26:** They use a Voronoi approach. It sounds fancy, but it just means solid rectangles. Again, this ignores the internal geometry, the holes, and the relative positions of the input. **Verdict: Low Score.**\n\n**The Showdown: Candidate 19 is the Champion!**\n\nCandidate 4 and 26 are quadrant solutions, which means they are solid rectangles. In my expert opinion, this strategy misses the key ingredient in Example 1; shape preservation is fundamental! Candidate 19 is the one who understands it. They correctly identify this as a tiling/packing problem (jigsaw).\n\n**Deep Dive into Candidate 19:**\n\nThey've counted the pixels. They've determined the area of the output (196). They know they need to create the perfect square. In the explanation, they say:\n\n*   They extract the objects and count the area.\n*   They put the '\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 4,\n      \"score\": 3.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Fail\",\n          \"2\": \"Partial\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"The rule proposes creating rectangular blocks of solid color with corner swaps.
