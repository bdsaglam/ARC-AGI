            "Full raw LLM response": "**Understanding and Solving the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task. My goal is to transform an input grid into an output grid based on a few provided examples. Seems straightforward, right? I'll use my expertise to analyze the examples, identify the underlying logic, and apply that logic to a new test input.\n\nFirst, I'm examining Example 1. It's a large grid with colored shapes. I'm looking for patterns, specific features, and how they relate to the output. I start by tracing shapes, counting pixels, and looking for anything that might connect the input and output. The initial description gets messy, so I try to visualize the shapes mentally. I'm trying to identify potential container shapes or shapes that are associated with the grey pixels (color 5). The output of example 1 reveals a red 'C' shape, which might be a critical part of a transformation rule. I'm now trying to connect specific object structures like U shapes with the final transformation.\n\nThen, I analyze Example 2. It's another grid, and I immediately focus on the grey pixels (5). These seem key to understanding the task. Their location and relationship to other colored shapes are important. I observe that the grey pixels define a bounding box or \"selector.\" The output grid's dimensions seem to match this box in some way but not exactly. I'm thinking, \"Is the output a cropped section of the input? Does the grey box 'point' to an area, determine its size, or define something else?\"\n\nI notice that the values around the grey pixels are being \"transferred\" to the output, but in an unusual way. I now have to identify the transformation happening on the pixels.\n\nI'm thinking about how the grey pixels define a selection, shape, or boundary and looking at how it \"points\" to the output. I'm exploring the hypothesis that the grey pixels are like a window or lens that specifies *where* the relevant content is coming from. The content might be tiled, combined, or manipulated in some way within the viewport. I then think that maybe I should focus on how they define a \"Viewport\".\n\nAfter looking at multiple examples, I begin to suspect the grey pixels define a box. Maybe the solution is to find an object of that size and \"project\" its content? The \"content\" might be based on pattern found, shape, or repeating structure.\n\nBy examining Example 3, the link becomes clear. It seems the output is a subgrid cropped from the input, but with a specific pattern. The pattern might be repeating. The location seems to be defined by the 5s (in some capacity).\n\nI now focus on the test input. It's a grid with a set of colored shapes. What am I going to do to get the output?\nSince I suspect that the \"Grey pixels define source of shape,\" I am trying to understand the nature of the \"Source\". I now realize that the 5s might define a *region* to be *filled* with a repeating pattern. Now I need to identify which one, by looking at other objects in the input. Maybe I should extend a repeating pattern found?\n\nI decide that the pattern can be determined, and a transformation applied.\n\nI define a 9x17 target area. I observe two units, and now have:\n\n*   The Box: defined by 5s.\n*   The \"Content\": A Sequence of shapes (based on pattern, repetition).\n\nThe strategy is to determine:\n1.  The start of the content inside the box.\n2.  The rules about shape extraction.\n3.  The pattern (which is clear: Green, Gap, Red, Green, Red).\n\nThe goal is to determine the output, by continuing the pattern defined in the input. Since the input ends with GS (Green), I determine that the next cycle has to be GS.\n\nBased on the pattern, I am creating a \"Grid Output\" using:\n1.  Shape 1, Shape 2, Gap.\n2.  Color codes.\n\nI confirm the correct row numbers, calculate each value in each row, and confirm that my understanding matches the pattern and its rules, I have now completed the work to get the output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on a pattern inferred from the solved examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Decomposition & Segmentation:**\n    *   The grids contain background objects (colored shapes) and \"marker\" objects (grey pixels, color 5).\n    *   The grey pixels (5) always appear in the corners of a rectangular region, effectively defining a **bounding box** or **viewport**.\n    *   In Example 1, the 5s define a 3x7 region. The output is a 3x6 grid related to the red shapes.\n    *   In Example 2, the 5s define a 15x2 region (Rows 14-28, Cols 19-20). The output is a 14x2 grid containing a pattern (`9,9`, `8,9`...) found in a vertical strip elsewhere in the input.\n    *   In Example 3, the 5s define a 17x3 region (Rows 1-17, Cols 25-27). The output is a 17x3 grid containing the pattern (`7 7 7`, `7 0 7`) found in the leftmost vertical strip of the input.\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   The grey markers define a **Target Viewport** (position and dimensions) in the grid.\n    *   The content of the output is determined by projecting or extending the pattern of the main shapes (foreground objects) into this viewport.\n    *   In the test input, we identify the pattern of the shapes above the viewport and continue that sequence into the viewport rows.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n1.  **Identify Viewport:**\n    *   Grey markers (5) appear at the top-left (Rows 15-16, Cols 6-7) and bottom-right (Rows 22-23, Cols 21-22).\n    *   This defines a viewport spanning **Rows 15 to 23** (Height 9) and **Cols 6 to 22** (Width 17).\n    *   The output grid size will be 9x17.\n\n2.  **Analyze Pattern Sequence (Rows 0-14):**\n    *   The input features a vertical sequence of shapes centered horizontally.\n    *   **Cycle A (Rows 0-7):**\n        *   Rows 0-1: Green Simple Box (GS).\n        *   Row 2: Gap (Empty).\n        *   Rows 3-4: Red Simple Box (RS).\n        *   Rows 5-6: Green Complex Shape (GC).\n        *   Row 7: Gap.\n    *   **Cycle B (Rows 8-14):**\n        *   Rows 8-9: Green Simple Box (GS).\n        *   Rows 10-11: Red Complex Shape (RC).\n        *   Rows 12-13: Green Complex Shape (GC).\n        *   Row 14: Gap.\n    *   The sequence alternates between Cycle A and Cycle B. Cycle A has a Gap between the first and second shape, while Cycle B does not. Both end with a Gap.\n    *   The next sequence (Rows 15+) should be **Cycle A** again.\n\n3.  **Generate Output Content (Rows 15-23):**\n    *   We generate the rows for Cycle A starting at Row 15.\n    *   **Row 15-16 (GS):** Green Simple Box.\n        *   Top: `0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n        *   Bot: `0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n    *   **Row 17 (Gap):** Empty row.\n        *   `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n    *   **Row 18-19 (RS):** Red Simple Box.\n        *   Top: `0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n        *   Bot: `0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n    *   **Row 20-21 (GC):** Green Complex Shape.\n        *   Top: `0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0`\n        *   Bot: `0,0,0,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0`\n    *   **Row 22 (Gap):** Empty row.\n    *   **Row 23 (Start of next):** Green Simple Box Top (GS).\n\n4.  **Final Construction:**\n    *   Combine these rows to form the 9x17 output grid.\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Example 1**: Horizontal bars with different colors (1, 2, 4, 1) at widths 2, 3, 4, 5. The 5-markers define a 3\u00d76 region, and the output continues the pattern with color 2 at width 6.\n\n2. **Example 2**: A diamond/triangular pattern. The 5-markers define a 14\u00d72 vertical region, and the output shows the continued edge pattern.\n\n3. **Example 3**: Staircase tiles of 3\u00d72 with colors 7, 2, 3. The 5-markers define a 17\u00d73 region, and the output shows color 7's tile repeated vertically.\n\n**Key insight**: The 5-markers (forming L-shapes at opposite corners) define the bounding box for the output. The output continues/completes the pattern using the appropriate tile structure and colors.\n\n**Analyzing the test input**:\n- The pattern shows concentric nested rectangles with colors 2 and 3\n- Basic tile structure: 5-wide rectangular frames with pattern `X,X,X,X,X` / `X,0,0,0,X`\n- The pattern expands outward: widths 5, 9, 13, and next would be 17\n- Edge colors alternate: at rows 5\u21923, rows 10\u21922, rows 12\u21923, so continuing: rows 14\u21922, 16\u21923, 18\u21922, 20\u21923\n\n**5-marker positions**:\n- First L: rows 15-16, cols 6-7 (top-left corner)\n- Second L: rows 21-22, cols 21-22 (bottom-right corner)\n- Bounding box: 8 rows \u00d7 17 columns\n\n**Output construction**:\nFollowing the nested rectangle pattern with 17-column width and alternating colors (2, 3, 2, 3) for 4 pairs of rows:\n\n```\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Solution for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task, and it seems I need to figure out a pattern and generate an output grid based on some input and a \"gray\" indicator. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the \"gray\" indicator's role. Looking at Example 1, I see this gray shape that kind of sits at the bottom of these other colored shapes. It's a key. The output, a tiny U shape, is *related* to a specific color (red) in the input. Is the gray shape a selector? Maybe. It seems the input has a series of \"cups\", or stacks. The gray object looks different. But what does \"different\" mean? Is this gray indicator a selector?\n\nI start tracing the \"gray\" pixels' positions. It looks like it is defining the size of the output. Width 6. Height 3. This matches. What is the pattern? The shape is not a direct replication of an input shape. It seems to be a key about where to pick the shape or how to form the output. So, I see the output has 2 (Red). How is that generated? In Ex 1, the output is red, and the red \"cup\" is vertically aligned with the gray. Is the output a direct transform of that shape?\n\nHmm, the red \"cup\" doesn't look like the output U. The gray shape? It has dimensions to be related to the output size. The shape is the 3x6 grid. Maybe the output isn't a direct transform, but the gray shape defines the size and the contents?\n\nLooking at Example 2 is helpful. The gray shape is a bracket, defining a bounding box. Output is 14 rows, 2 columns. Gray pixels are also a 14 rows, 2 columns. This must be the size. I see the output has a repeating pattern related to colors, and I can recreate the background with this method. It is likely the solution's central logic. This confirms the hypothesis - use the gray area as a window or cropped region.\n\nSo, I start thinking, the gray region defines the output's size and somehow hints at content. I realize the repeating pattern could be hidden. The task is to \"reconstruct\" the background. I assume the ARC task means extrapolation and continuity.\n\nI test this with Example 1 and Example 3. Both confirm this logic. The gray area defines the *dimensions* of the output, and I extrapolate the values from the *background* pattern to fill that area. The objects create a sequence. The gray object fills in the next step.\n\nMy key now is the sequence. It's about finding the rule and the object. With my focus on \"sequences\", I've cracked the code! It is about finding the pattern of attributes: width, color, and shape. I apply my sequence logic and come to some insights about test input:\n\nAnalyzing the test input, I see two blocks of colors, and one gray indicator, and I'm ready to apply my sequence logic.\n\nFirst, I identify objects in the input grid. I see a pattern, a sequence (Maroon -> Red). It's a stack. So, the new object I need to generate goes at the gray location. Now, I have all the pieces. I need to \"predict\" the objects based on these input features. I need to get: width, color, shape.\n\n*   Width: It looks like the width is 5, then 5. The next should be something predictable, related to the gray bounding box.\n*   Color: Is there a pattern? Probably. Let's get to it.\n*   Shape: Let's extract the \"shape\" of these blocks to get the basic form.\nI notice the blocks, in the test input, seem to expand and have a more complex structure, but their basic forms are a solid.\n\nWith Example 2 logic, this problem should be similar. So, I need to find the pattern. This could be in the \"expansion\" that continues downwards in the test input.\n\nI then decide to examine how these blocks in the input progress. It seems there are two blocks - an upper and a lower one. So, it's about finding what the next block looks like.\n\nSo, based on these observations, it looks like a repeating series that depends on several properties. The gray box forms a new region and the content is determined by a series. I predict the pattern!\n\n1.  Identify the sequence.\n2.  Width progression. The pattern should have a predictable width.\n3.  Color: Let's consider a repeating sequence.\n4.  Shape: Analyze how this progresses.\nI begin by looking for patterns in the colors and structure. A bit complex, but I\n\nThe problem asks us to fill in a region defined by gray (5) markers with a pattern derived from the sequence of objects in the input grid.\n\n**Analysis of the Input Data:**\n1.  **Object Identification:** The input contains a series of objects evolving down the grid.\n    *   **Layer 1 (Rows 0-1):** A central block of color 3 (Maroon). Shape: `33333` / `30003`. Center x=14.\n    *   **Layer 2 (Rows 3-4):** A central block of color 2 (Red). Shape: `22222` / `20002`. Center x=14.\n    *   **Layer 3 (Rows 5-6):** Two blocks (\"Split\") of color 3 (Main) and 2 (Secondary). Centers at x=11, 17 (Offset 3). Shape: `333` / `302` (Left) and `333` / `203` (Right).\n    *   **Layer 4 (Rows 8-9):** A central block of color 3. Shape: `33333` / `30003`.\n    *   **Layer 5 (Rows 10-11):** Two blocks of color 2 (Main) and 3 (Secondary). Centers at x=11, 17 (Offset 3). Shape: `222` / `203` (Left) and `222` / `302` (Right).\n    *   **Layer 6 (Rows 12-13):** Two blocks of color 3 (Main) and 2 (Secondary). Centers at x=9, 19 (Offset 5). Shape: `333` / `302` (Left) and `333` / `203` (Right).\n\n2.  **Sequence Logic:**\n    *   **Type:** The objects alternate between Central blocks and Split blocks (or expand). The sequence of \"Split\" layers (L3, L5, L6) shows an expansion in width.\n    *   **Offsets (for Split layers):** L3 (Offset 3) -> L5 (Offset 3) -> L6 (Offset 5). The sequence of offsets is increasing.\n    *   **Colors:** The sequence of Main colors for the Split layers is 3 -> 2 -> 3. This suggests an alternating pattern (3, 2, 3, 2...). The Secondary color is always the complement in the set {2, 3} (i.e., if Main is 3, Secondary is 2).\n    *   **Block Shape Rule:** For Split blocks, the top row is solid Main color (`MMM`). The bottom row has the Main color on the outer edge, Secondary color on the inner edge, and 0 in the middle (`M 0 S` for left block, `S 0 M` for right block).\n\n3.  **Target Region:**\n    *   **Markers:** Gray (5) pixels at (6,15), (7,15), (6,16) and (21,22), (22,21), (22,22) define a bounding box.\n    *   **Dimensions:** x = 6 to 22 (Width 17), y = 15 to 22 (Height 8).\n    *   **Inferred Content:** The width 17 corresponds to blocks with an offset of 7 from the center (14). (Center 14 - 7 = 7; Block spanning 6-8. Center 14 + 7 = 21; Block spanning 20-22). This follows the expansion trend (offsets 3, 3, 5, -> 7).\n\n4.  **Construction of Output:**\n    *   We need to generate 4 layers (each 2 rows high) to fill the 8-row high target box.\n    *   The layers will follow the alternating color pattern starting after L6 (Color 3).\n    *   **Layer 7 (Rows 0-1 of output):** Main Color 2, Secondary 3. Offset 7.\n    *   **Layer 8 (Rows 2-3 of output):** Main Color 3, Secondary 2. Offset 7.\n    *   **Layer 9 (Rows 4-5 of output):** Main Color 2, Secondary 3. Offset 7.\n    *   **Layer 10 (Rows 6-7 of output):** Main Color 3, Secondary 2. Offset 7.\n\n    **Row Patterns:**\n    *   **Color 2 Layer (2, 3):**\n        *   Top: `2,2,2` ... `0`s ... `2,2,2`\n        *   Bottom: `2,0,3` ... `0`s ... `3,0,2` (Inner is 3, Outer is 2)\n    *   **Color 3 Layer (3, 2):**\n        *   Top: `3,3,3` ... `0`s ... `3,3,3`\n        *   Bottom: `3,0,2` ... `0`s ... `2,0,3` (Inner is 2, Outer is 3)\n\n2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2\n2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,2\n3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3\n3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3\n2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2\n2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,2\n3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3\n3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

The output shows what the pattern would look like if extended into that region\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\nThe main pattern consists of concentric diamond/frame structures made of colors 3 (green) and 2 (red):\n- Layer 0 (center): cols 12-16\n- Layer 1: cols 10-18  \n- Layer 2: cols 8-20\n- Layer 3 (to be extended): cols 6-22\n\nThe two 5 markers define:\n- First marker at rows 15-16, cols 6-7 (upper-left L)\n- Second marker at rows 21-22, cols 21-22 (lower-right L)\n- This defines an 8\u00d717 output region (rows 15-22, cols 6-22)\n\n**Extending the Pattern:**\n\nFollowing the nested structure with alternating colors:\n- Layer 3 (new outer): color 2\n- Layer 2 (2nd instance): color 2 \n- Layer 1 (3rd instance): color 3\n- Layer 0 (4th instance): color 2\n\nEach layer has:\n- First row: solid outer edges\n- Second row: outer edge + inner connections to next layer\n\n**Output Construction:**\n\nRow 0: Layer 3 outer (color 2) + Layer 2 content (color 3)\nRow 1: Layer 3's second row with connections\nRow 2: Gap row\nRows 3-4: Layer 2 instance\nRows 5-6: Layer 1 instance  \nRow 7: Layer 0 instance\n\n```\n2,2,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,2,2\n2,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,2\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0\n0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**I'm diving deep into the ARC task, focusing on the patterns and structures within the provided examples. The goal is to figure out the underlying logic and develop a general solution for all three problems.**\n\nMy initial thought process involves meticulously analyzing the input grids, identifying the key features and their relationships with the corresponding outputs. I'm noting the grid sizes, the colors involved, and the shapes that emerge. I quickly noticed that the grids are mostly filled with black (0) and that there are colored shapes of varying forms, sizes, and colors. I\u2019m thinking about this as a visual pattern and I am attempting to encode it with the specific numbers.\n\nIn Example 1, I saw what appeared to be stacks of colored blocks or shapes at the bottom of the grid. I noticed grey markers (value 5) and started tracing them, hypothesizing that they might delineate a specific region or provide crucial information about the output generation process. Tracing the grey markers gave me an insight: they seemed to define a rectangular bounding box. My first guess was that this region somehow contained the solution, but there was nothing there. So, I started relating these input elements (grey brackets, colored shapes) to the given output: a small, red \u201cC\u201d shape.\n\nI began to analyze the colored shapes in detail, noting their dimensions, and structures. The red shape that was presented in the output shared some similarities in its structure (but not the size) to one of the shapes in the input. Also, I tried to link the red color in the output to the red shapes in the input.\n\nThis is where I realized that the sequence of shapes from left to right was important. The grey markers might give the size to create the next object. After a lot of investigation, I saw a sequence of dimensions in the blocks and the bracketed size matched the next width in the series. The colors also appeared to form a sequence (blue, red, yellow, blue, red...).\n\nThis is my core concept: 1) Identify shape sequence. 2) Grey brackets specify the bounding box of the output. 3) Find shape to match bracket.\n\nI then tested my hypothesis against Example 2, which involved a pyramid-like structure. Here, the challenge was to establish a link between the grey bracket and the repeating color patterns in the pyramid, and in the output which was a column. After analyzing the sequence of columns and their color patterns, I recognized that the grey brackets somehow point to a *column* and that the pattern of colors within that column needed to be extracted and used to make the output.\n\nExample 3 solidified my understanding. The input consisted of a sequence of colored rectangular shapes, increasing in height. The grey markers again defined a bounding box, which matched the width and height of a specific shape in the sequence. I understood that this sequence extrapolation was important and the bracket provided the exact target. I needed to extrapolate to determine the dimension of an output object.\n\nIn analyzing the test input, I discovered the importance of considering the \u201ctest cases\u201d. In this problem, the images were more difficult to read and text-only information was more important.\n\nMy core strategy, refined through these examples, is now clear:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Input Shapes:** Determine the recurring patterns or sequences in color, dimension (width, height), and structure, including the internal details of the objects.\n2.  **Bracket Interpretation:** The grey brackets define the exact dimensions (width and height) of the output grid. I am thinking about these brackets as a cropping tool or as a guide.\n3.  **Sequence Extrapolation:** Identify the target in the input sequence, or an element that corresponds with these specific characteristics.\n4.  **Content Generation:** I\u2019m constructing the content of the output based on the identified element or shape.\n5.  I consider the alignment.\n\nI\u2019m starting to think about applying this logic to the provided test input. The test input, as the other examples, have these brackets. The goal is to generate output by extrapolating from this sequence and the region defined. I\u2019m making a detailed analysis to match the shape and size from the series. I will now carefully generate the test outputs with my newly devised method.\n\n\nTo solve this challenge, we must identify the sequence of shapes in the input grid and extrapolate it to fill the region defined by the grey bracket markers.\n\n**1. Analysis of Input Patterns:**\nThe input contains a vertical sequence of \"platform\" shapes.\n-   **Level 1 (Rows 1-2):** Green Box, Width 5. (Center column 15).\n-   **Level 2 (Rows 4-5):** Red Box, Width 5. (Center column 15).\n-   **Level 3 (Rows 6-7):** Green Box, Width 9. (Center column 15).\n-   **Level 4 (Rows 9-10):** Green Box, Width 5. (Center column 15). This acts as a \"filler\" or spacer.\n-   **Level 5 (Rows 11-12):** Red Box, Width 9. (Center column 14).\n-   **Level 6 (Rows 13-14):** Green Box, Width 13. (Center column 14).\n\n**Pattern Logic:**\nThe sequence consists of pairs of Main Shapes (Green then Red) with increasing widths, separated by a standard Green Width-5 Filler.\n-   **Width 5 Pair:** Green W5 -> Red W5. (No filler seen, possibly base case).\n-   **Width 9 Pair:** Green W9 -> (Filler: Green W5) -> Red W9.\n-   **Width 13 Pair:** Green W13 -> (Next should be Filler) -> (Next should be Red W13).\n-   **Width 17 Pair:** (Next should be Green W17) -> ...\n\nThe Last Object in input is **Green W13**.\nFollowing the pattern, the next three objects in the sequence should be:\n1.  **Green W5 (Filler)**\n2.  **Red W13** (Completing the W13 pair)\n3.  **Green W17** (Starting the W17 pair)\n\n**2. Target Region (Grey Brackets):**\nThe grey markers in the test input define the target region:\n-   Top-Left: Row 16, Col 6.\n-   Bottom-Right: Row 23, Col 23.\n-   This defines an output grid of **Height 8** and **Width 18**.\n-   The vertical space (8 rows) accommodates exactly 3 objects (height 2) with 1-row gaps:\n    -   Slot 1: Rows 0-1\n    -   Gap: Row 2\n    -   Slot 2: Rows 3-4\n    -   Gap: Row 5\n    -   Slot 3: Rows 6-7\n\n**3. Constructing the Shapes:**\nWe center the shapes horizontally. The trend shows the center shifting from 15 to 14. We will use **Center 14** relative to the original grid.\nThe output grid corresponds to columns 6 to 23 of the original grid (0-indexed in output corresponds to Col 6 in input).\nCenter 14 in Input is index **14 - 6 = 8** in the Output grid.\n\n*   **Object 1: Green W5 (Filler)**\n    *   Width 5, Center 8. Occupies indices 6-10.\n    *   Row 0: `0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n    *   Row 1: `0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\n*   **Object 2: Red W13**\n    *   Width 13, Center 8.

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Okay, so here's the deal: I'm staring at these ARC tasks, and this one has me thinking. The goal seems to be to take this large grid input and squish it down into a smaller output grid, based on some pattern. I'm seeing a lot of colored shapes, and some grey ones too. Those grey shapes look like markers or pointers, and that's key.\n\nBasically, I'm breaking down the examples to see how it works, example by example, and what the logic is.\n\n**I'm hypothesizing that the grey shapes are key.** I'm figuring they are defining a specific area to focus on within the input grid and the size of the output. I am looking for a *transformation rule*.\n\nIn the first example, I see these letter-like shapes. The output, though, doesn't seem to be a direct copy; it's some sort of stretched shape. My initial thought was that the output was a visual representation or even logical combination of the shapes selected by the grey box.\n\nThen I realized that the output size is given by these grey markers. It's like the window size is defined by the grey objects. The contents, though, are constructed somehow, so I need to find the rule.\n\nI looked at the colors and coordinates of the grey markers. There's a link, but I didn't see it yet. Let me put more thought into it.\nI'm also considering the second example. I see this pyramid shape and again, the grey shapes are key. The output looks like a vertical slice of the pyramid. The grey markers might specify that section in the pyramid.\n\nIt's getting more complex, and I'm analyzing the relationships of these pyramids and grey blocks to extract this rule. The pattern is probably geometric.\n\nOkay, let's keep analyzing the examples. If you could give me a hint about the task type, that would be helpful.\nIn the last example I'm looking for a way to connect these shapes, sizes, colors and positions. They all have some meaning.\n\nSo it all started making sense with this test input. The shapes are overlapping.\n\nNow, my theory is that we take the data inside the rectangle defined by the two grey shapes and use them to construct the smaller output grid. It's like finding a small part of a larger pattern.\n\nThe final idea comes to my head. In a nutshell, if I define where I am with the grey markers, I can build an output. But which input data do I select? I just defined the shape and size. Now I need to define the data.\n\nI'm starting to think about *periodic patterns*, and how these shapes relate. Green and Red patterns seem to repeat, but maybe are shifted and expanding. The answer is most probably related to the geometry!\n\nOkay, so I got it. The pattern expands, and I can build a new data set!\nLet's make sure it checks all the requirements: the box size, colors and the relationships between each color and period, the output is built in rows! Done.\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the contents of an output grid based on a specific transformation logic inferred from three examples. The input grids contain colored shapes and a pair of grey \"marker\" shapes (color 5) that seem to define a region of interest.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n\n1.  **Selection Logic:** The grey markers (color 5) act as brackets or corners defining a rectangular bounding box.\n    *   In Example 1, the markers define a 6x3 box.\n    *   In Example 2, the markers define a 2x14 box.\n    *   In Example 3, the markers define a 3x17 box.\n    *   In the Test Input, the markers are at (6, 15) and (23, 22), defining an 18x8 box (width 18, height 8).\n\n2.  **Pattern Extension Logic:** The content inside the output box is not simply copied from the input at that location (which is often empty or sparse). Instead, the output is generated by **extending the pattern** of the colored shapes found elsewhere in the input grid into the region defined by the markers.\n\n    *   **Test Input Pattern Analysis:**\n        The input features two interleaving patterns: Green (3) and Red (2).\n        *   **Green Pattern (Period 8):**\n            *   Starts at Row 0 with a \"Center\" block (width 5).\n            *   At Row 5 (+5), it becomes a \"Split\" block (two chunks of width 3, shifted outwards).\n            *   At Row 8 (+8), it repeats the \"Center\" block.\n            *   At Row 13 (+5 from R8), it repeats the \"Split\" block but wider (two chunks of width 3, shifted further outwards).\n            *   *Rule:* Center blocks appear at rows $0, 8, 16, \\dots$. Split blocks appear at rows $5, 13, 21, \\dots$. Each split block is wider than the previous one by 2 pixels on each side.\n        *   **Red Pattern (Period 7):**\n            *   Starts at Row 3 with a \"Center\" block (width 5).\n            *   At Row 10 (+7), it becomes a \"Split\" block (two chunks of width 3, shifted outwards).\n            *   *Rule:* Center blocks appear at rows $3, \\dots$. Split blocks appear at rows $10, 17, \\dots$. Each successive split block is wider.\n\n3.  **Synthesizing the Output (Rows 15-22):**\n    We need to fill the 18x8 box corresponding to global rows 15-22 and global columns 6-23.\n\n    *   **Row 15 (Output Row 0):** No pattern active. (Green is between 13 and 16; Red is between 10 and 17). **Result: All 0.**\n    *   **Row 16 (Output Row 1):**\n        *   **Green:** Cycle matches Row 16 (Center block). Global Cols 12-16 (Width 5).\n        *   **Red:** Inactive.\n        *   **Result:** `3 3 3 3 3` at offsets matching global 12-16.\n    *   **Row 17 (Output Row 2):**\n        *   **Green:** Continuation of Row 16 (Outline). Global Cols 12, 16.\n        *   **Red:** Cycle matches Row 17 (Split block 2). This is the second split for Red. First was at 10 (cols 10-12, 16-18). This one shifts outward by 2: Global Cols 8-10, 18-20.\n        *   **Result:** Red `2 2 2` at 8-10, 18-20. Green `3` at 12, 16.\n    *   **Row 18 (Output Row 3):**\n        *   **Red:** Continuation of Row 17 (Outline). Global Cols 8, 10, 18, 20.\n        *   **Green:** Inactive.\n        *   **Result:** `2` at 8, 10, 18, 20.\n    *   **Rows 19, 20 (Output Rows 4, 5):** No pattern active. (Green next at 21, Red next at 24). **Result: All 0.**\n    *   **Row 21 (Output Row 6):**\n        *   **Green:** Cycle matches Row 21 (Split block 3). This is the third split for Green. Previous was at 13 (cols 8-10, 18-20). This one shifts outward by 2: Global Cols 6-8, 20-22.\n        *   **Result:** `3 3 3` at 6-8, 20-22.\n    *   **Row 22 (Output Row 7):**\n        *   **Green:** Continuation of Row 21 (Outline). Global Cols 6, 8, 20, 22.\n        *   **Result:** `3` at 6, 8, 20, 22.\n\nThe output grid is the crop of these calculated patterns mapped to the local coordinates of the box (Global Col 6 = Local Col 0).\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,2,2,2,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,2,2,2,0,0,0\n0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0\n3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning**\n\nFrom the examples (and the sketch) we can interpret the grids as \u201cTetris-like\u201d boards built from repeated **frame pieces**: a 3\u00d73 square border of a single color with a hole (0) in the middle\n\n```\nc c c\nc 0 c\nc c c\n```\n\nIn each training input there are many such 3\u00d73 frames, often stacked vertically into towers and appearing in different colors.  \nThe transformation is:\n\n1. **Ignore color 5 and background 0** \u2013 they are just markers / scaffolding.\n2. Look for all 3\u00d73 frame pieces made from the other colors.\n3. **Choose the color that contributes the most frame pieces.**  \n   - Example 1: yellow (color 2) contributes the majority \u2192 output is built from 2\u2019s.\n   - Example 2: color 9 is the dominant frame color in the central construction \u2192 output uses 9, 8 and 4 where each level corresponds to the color of that frame in the diagonal stack.\n   - Example 3: color 7 has the tallest / dominant stack of frames \u2192 output is a tall single tower of 7\u2011frames.\n4. Count how many frames of the chosen color exist. Let this be \\(n\\).\n5. Build the **output** as a single vertical stack of these frames, sharing borders between consecutive frames:\n   - A single 3\u00d73 frame has 3 rows.\n   - Two stacked frames overlap on one row, giving 5 rows.\n   - In general, stacking \\(n\\) frames gives height \\(2n+1\\) with width 3.\n   - Every \u201cframe row\u201d is either `c c c` (top/bottom of a frame) or `c 0 c` (middle of a frame).\n\nFor the **test input**:\n\n- Colors present (excluding 0 and 5) are 2 and 3.\n- The 3\u2019s form more complete 3\u00d73 frame pieces than the 2\u2019s; so we select **color 3** as the dominant frame color.\n- There are **8 such 3\u2011frames** made from color 3 (they appear in four stacks of two frames each across the board).\n- Stacking 8 frames vertically yields an output of height \\(2\u00b78+1 = 17\\) and width 3.\n- Each frame contributes a pattern `3,3,3` then `3,0,3`, with the stack starting and ending on a full `3,3,3` row.\n\nThus the output grid is a 3\u2011wide column of 17 rows with alternating full and holed rows of color 3.\n\n---\n\n**Output grid**\n\n3,3,3\n3,0,3\n3,3,3\n3,0,3\n3,3,3\n3,0,3\n3,3,3\n3,0,3\n3,3,3\n3,0,3\n3,3,3\n3,0,3\n3,3,3\n3,0,3\n3,3,3\n3,0,3\n3,3,3",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Analyzing the Examples:**\n\n1. **The 5-markers (gray L-shapes)** define the output dimensions:\n   - Example 1: Two L-shapes define a 3\u00d76 rectangle\n   - Example 2: Two L-shapes define a 14\u00d72 rectangle  \n   - Example 3: Two L-shapes define a 17\u00d73 rectangle\n\n2. **The main pattern** contains a repeating tile/unit that gets extended to fill the output rectangle:\n   - Example 1: Red T-shape pattern (extended horizontally)\n   - Example 2: Column slice of the diamond pattern\n   - Example 3: Orange frame pattern (extended vertically)\n\n3. **The transformation** takes the basic unit pattern and extends it (not tiles it) to fill the output space, maintaining the structural properties (edges, frames).\n\n**Analyzing the Test Input:**\n\nFinding the 5-markers:\n- First L-shape: rows 15-16, cols 6-7 (pointing down-right)\n- Second L-shape: rows 21-22, cols 21-22 (pointing up-left)\n\nOutput dimensions: 8 rows \u00d7 17 columns\n\nThe main pattern has nested frames with colors 3 (green) and 2 (red). The basic unit at the core (rows 0-1, cols 12-16) is:\n```\n3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,3\n```\n\nThis is a frame pattern where:\n- First row: all 3s (top edge)\n- Second row: 3 on edges, 0 in middle\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\n\nFollowing the pattern from Example 3 (similar frame structure), I extend this unit:\n- Vertically: repeat the 2-row unit 4 times (= 8 rows)\n- Horizontally: extend the frame to 17 columns (3 on edges, 0 in middle)\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n## Analysis of Examples\n\n**Example 1:** \n- Input has T-shaped pieces arranged horizontally in different colors (blue-1, red-2, yellow-4)\n- Gray markers (5s) are placed indicating horizontal extent\n- Output is the red (2) shape extracted and extended horizontally: a 3\u00d76 rectangle pattern\n\n**Example 2:**\n- Input has a diamond pattern made of cross/plus shapes with colors 4, 8, 9\n- Gray L-shaped markers indicate vertical extent\n- Output is a vertical strip (14 rows \u00d7 2 cols) showing the pattern edge\n\n**Example 3:**\n- Input has rectangular frames (color 7, 2, 3) in a stair-step diagonal arrangement  \n- Gray L-shaped markers indicate vertical extent (rows 1-17)\n- Output extracts the orange (7) rectangle unit and extends it vertically: 17 rows \u00d7 3 cols\n\n## Pattern Recognition\n\n1. The gray L-shaped markers (5s) indicate direction and extent of the output\n2. The output extracts the basic repeating unit and extends it\n3. For vertical/diagonal patterns, the output is a vertical strip\n4. The outermost color in the pattern determines the output color\n\n## Test Input Analysis\n\n- The pattern shows **concentric expanding rectangles** with colors 3 (green) and 2 (red)\n- Color 3 appears at the outermost positions (rows 0-1, 12-13 edges)\n- The basic unit is: `3,3,3,3,3` / `3,0,0,0,3` (5 cols \u00d7 2 rows)\n- Gray markers at rows 15-16 (cols 6-7) and rows 21-22 (cols 21-22)\n- Pattern spans rows 0-13 (~6 layers), markers suggest extending to ~8 layers\n\n## Output\n\nFollowing the pattern from Example 3, the output extends the color-3 rectangular unit vertically:\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,3\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning**\n\nFrom the three given example pairs we can see that:\n\n* The big input grids mostly consist of black background (0) with a relatively small cluster of coloured \u201ctetris-like\u201d shapes.\n* The outputs are much smaller and consist of a **single, central motif** repeated vertically or horizontally.\n* In example 3 in particular, we can see clearly that the relevant shapes are \u201cU\u2011shapes\u201d or hollow squares of a single colour; each such shape is reduced to a canonical 3\u2011cell\u2011wide pattern:\n  * a solid row of that colour (`c c c`) when the original row is completely filled with that colour,\n  * a hollow row (`c 0 c`) when only the two outer cells in the row are that colour.\n\nThe key steps that are consistent and usable for the test case are:\n\n1. **Locate the main structured region**:  \n   In the test input there is a central block between columns 12 and 16 (0\u2011indexed) where colours 3 and 2 form clear U\u2011shapes:\n   * Row 0: `3 3 3 3 3`\n   * Row 1: `3 0 0 0 3`\n   * Row 3: `2 2 2 2 2`\n   * Row 4: `2 0 0 0 2`\n   * Row 5: `3 0 0 0 3`\n   * Row 6: `2 0 0 0 2`\n   * Row 8: `3 3 3 3 3`\n   * Row 9: `3 0 0 0 3`\n   * Row10: `2 0 0 0 2`\n   * Row11: `3 0 0 0 3`  \n   Rows 2,7,12,13 in this band are all zeros and act as separators.\n\n2. **Compress each non\u2011empty row in this band** to a canonical 3\u2011wide pattern:\n   * If the 5\u2011cell slice is `c c c c c` (all same non\u2011zero colour `c`), output `[c,c,c]`.\n   * If it is `c 0 0 0 c`, output `[c,0,c]`.\n   * Purely zero rows are ignored (no output row).\n\n   Applying this to the rows listed above gives:\n\n   * Row 0 (`3 3 3 3 3`) \u2192 `3 3 3`\n   * Row 1 (`3 0 0 0 3`) \u2192 `3 0 3`\n   * Row 3 (`2 2 2 2 2`) \u2192 `2 2 2`\n   * Row 4 (`2 0 0 0 2`) \u2192 `2 0 2`\n   * Row 5 (`3 0 0 0 3`) \u2192 `3 0 3`\n   * Row 6 (`2 0 0 0 2`) \u2192 `2 0 2`\n   * Row 8 (`3 3 3 3 3`) \u2192 `3 3 3`\n   * Row 9 (`3 0 0 0 3`) \u2192 `3 0 3`\n   * Row10 (`2 0 0 0 2`) \u2192 `2 0 2`\n   * Row11 (`3 0 0 0 3`) \u2192 `3 0 3`\n\n3. **Stack these canonical rows vertically** in the same order to form the final output.\n   * Colour 5 in the input never participates in such U\u2011shapes, and in the examples the \u201cextra\u201d grey pieces are always ignored in the transformation, so we ignore all 5s here as well.\n\nThis yields a 10\u00d73 output grid.\n\n---\n\n**Output grid**\n\n3,3,3\n3,0,3\n2,2,2\n2,0,2\n3,0,3\n2,0,2\n3,3,3\n3,0,3\n2,0,2\n3,0,3",

            "Full raw LLM response": "To build the outputs in the examples you can think of the non\u2011grey structures as \u201cframe\u201d motifs. An output consists of a vertical stack of such frames: odd rows are the solid bars of the frames, and even rows are the side connectors with zero interior. The length of the stack is tied to how many motifs are present in the input, and the colour used comes from a non\u2011dominant colour in the motif set.\n\nFor the test case there are nine partial frames; the runner\u2011up colour among them is `2`, and the largest bar length is five. Using five frames gives an output height of \\(2\\times5-1=9\\) rows. Each odd row is a bar of five `2`s and each even row has just the end `2`s with zeros inside.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n```\n2,2,2,2,2\n2,0,0,0,2\n2,2,2,2,2\n2,0,0,0,2\n2,2,2,2,2\n2,0,0,0,2\n2,2,2,2,2\n2,0,0,0,2\n2,2,2,2,2\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The output grid dimensions (width and height) are explicitly defined by the bounding box of the two grey L-shaped markers found in the input.\n*   The transformation scans input objects left-to-right and selects the first one that is **at least as wide** as the target width defined by the markers.\n*   If the selected object matches the target width, it is tiled vertically to fill the output height.\n*   If the selected object is wider than the target width, it is sliced into columns which are then stacked vertically to fill the output height.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Understanding the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to solve this ARC problem. It looks like I'm given some input, a grid with shapes and markers, and I need to figure out how to transform that into a smaller output grid. The hints give me some direction: the output's size is defined by these \"L-shaped\" markers, and I should scan the objects from left to right. There's also this bit about selecting an object that's \"at least as wide\" as the target width, and depending on whether it's wider or not, I'll tile or slice. Time to dig into these examples and see if they make sense.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\nI start by looking at Example 1. The markers seem to define the output size \u2013 they're essentially the bounding box. The hint about \"scanning\" and picking objects... okay, I find objects like shapes of color 2, 4, and 1, but none of them are wide enough to match the output size, which is 6.  Huh.  The output grid is full of the color 2 pattern. Wait a minute, could I have misunderstood what an object is in this context? Let's check the hint again: \"If the selected object matches the target width, it is tiled vertically\". The hint says \"scans input objects... selects\". Okay, I seem to be thinking in the same way as the user. The output for Example 1 shows the pattern of shape 1 (color 2), but *duplicated* to the target width! The object width (3) is actually *smaller* than the target width (6), but it *doesn't* tile the same way. Maybe I misread the hint.  \"If wider, then slice\" must be the part I need to focus on.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n\nMoving on to Example 2. I identify the markers. They again define the output size (2x14), but I can see a big pattern in the image that spans several columns. Here, the target width is only 2. The *object* appears to be a big lattice pattern, a bunch of lines. It is definitely *wider* than 2. Okay, the hint comes into play: Since the object is wider (W=14) than the target width (2), I need to \"slice into columns\". Then, stack them up. If I did this with the \"column\" logic from before, it would produce the output, by selecting diagonals.\n\n**Example 3 Analysis:**\n\nExample 3 makes it clearer. Target is width 3. First Object is width 3. It's the \"matches the target width, it is tiled vertically\" case.  The object is color 7 column pattern, it matches target width. It's just stacked vertically, to match. I'm starting to get the flow.\n\n**Re-evaluating the \"At Least As Wide\" Hint**\n\nI'm thinking about Example 1 again. The output width is 6 and there is no object that's at least as wide as 6. If the hint is true, that implies there *should* be such an object.  Perhaps \"Object\" is defined differently?  Maybe I should stop thinking that way and go with the examples. Let's focus on what's actually happening in these outputs. In Example 1, I'm taking that shape (Color 2) that's the *first* one from the left and *duplicating* it to match the width! In the test input, there are a series of growing pyramids. The shape width is increasing. Then maybe the task is about finding an object, finding the pattern or rule (here, increasing sizes), determining the next step in the sequence, and filling the output with the \"extrapolated\" object?\n\n**Test Input Analysis and Solution Plan**\n\nI need to come up with a strategy. I'm going to look at the test input's markers to define the output size (17x8). There's this pattern of growing pyramids. The final plan now feels solid. I need to continue the pattern to a width of 17. The color alternates, with each layer being either red or green. It's the \"constructing the pyramid\" logic that has to happen. So, I construct the layer of the width 17 red pyramid pattern. Repeat the pattern to a height 8.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid into an output grid based on a set of rules inferred from the solved examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Output Dimensions:** The output grid size is determined by the bounding box of the two gray L-shaped markers (color 5).\n    *   Example 1 markers define a 6x3 region.\n    *   Example 2 markers define a 2x14 region.\n    *   Example 3 markers define a 3x17 region.\n    *   Test Input markers define a **17x8** region (from rows 15-22 and columns 6-22).\n\n2.  **Transformation Logic:**\n    *   The hints suggest scanning objects and selecting based on width.\n    *   **Example 1:** Target width is 6. The sequence of objects has widths 2, 3, 4, 5. None is $\\ge$ 6. However, the sequence of colors is Blue(1), Red(2), Yellow(4), Blue(1). The pattern repeats: 1, 2, 4, 1... Next would be **2 (Red)**. The sequence of widths is 2, 3, 4, 5... Next would be **6**. The output is a Red object of width 6. Its pattern is derived from the Red object of width 3 (`2,2,2` / `2,0,0`), extrapolated to width 6 (`2,2,2,2,2,2` / `2,0,0,0,0,0`).\n    *   **Test Input:**\n        *   We observe a sequence of \"pyramid\" layers growing in size.\n        *   Row 0-1: Width 5, Color 3 (Green).\n        *   Row 3-4: Width 5, Color 2 (Red).\n        *   Row 5-6: Width 9, Color 3 (Green).\n        *   Row 8-9: Width 5, Color 3 (Green) [Reset/Oscillation?].\n        *   Row 10-11: Width 9, Color 2 (Red).\n        *   Row 12-13: Width 13, Color 3 (Green).\n        *   The target width is **17**. Following the sequence of strictly increasing sizes (5, 9, 13), the next size is 17.\n        *   Following the alternating color pattern for these sizes (Green, Red, Green), the next color should be **Red (2)**.\n        *   The height of each layer is 2. The target height is 8. This implies we need to stack the generated layer 4 times.\n\n3.  **Constructing the Target Layer (Width 17, Color 2):**\n    *   We look at previous layers to determine the structure.\n    *   **Width 9 Red (Rows 10-11):**\n        *   Top: `2,2,2` ... `2,2,2` (3-pixel corners).\n        *   Bottom: `2,0,3` ... `3,0,2` (3-pixel corners, with inner pixel color 3).\n        *   Gap: Width 9 - 3 - 3 = 3 zeros.\n    *   **Width 13 Green (Rows 12-13):**\n        *   Top: `3,3,3` ... `3,3,3`.\n        *   Bottom: `3,0,2` ... `2,0,3` (Inner pixel color 2).\n        *   Gap: Width 13 - 3 - 3 = 7 zeros.\n    *   **Width 17 Red (Hypothesis):**\n        *   Top: `2,2,2` corners. Gap: $17 - 3 - 3 = 11$ zeros.\n        *   Bottom: `2,0,3` ... `3,0,2`. The inner pixel for a Red layer is Green (3), and for a Green layer is Red (2). Since this layer is Red, the inner pixel is **3**.\n        *   Top Row: `2,2,2` + 11 zeros + `2,2,2`.\n        *   Bottom Row: `2,0,3` + 11 zeros + `3,0,2`.\n\n4.  **Final Output Generation:**\n    *   Create a 17x8 grid.\n    *   Fill it by vertically tiling the constructed 2-row Red layer 4 times.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n*   **Odd Rows (1, 3, 5, 7):** `2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2`\n*   **Even Rows (2, 4, 6, 8):** `2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,2`\n\n2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2\n2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,2\n2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2\n2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,2\n2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2\n2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,2\n2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2\n2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,2",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The output grid dimensions (width and height) are explicitly defined by the bounding box of the two grey L-shaped markers found in the input.\n*   The transformation scans input objects left-to-right and selects the first one that is **at least as wide** as the target width defined by the markers.\n*   If the selected object matches the target width, it is tiled vertically to fill the output height.\n*   If the selected object is wider than the target width, it is sliced into columns which are then stacked vertically to fill the output height.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to:\n1. Find the output dimensions from the grey (5) L-shaped markers\n2. Identify the pattern to use from the input\n3. Apply the transformation to generate the output\n\n**Finding the markers:**\n- Upper-left L: rows 15-16, cols 6-7 (5,5 at row 15 cols 6-7; 5 at row 16 col 6)\n- Lower-right L: rows 21-22, cols 21-22 (5 at row 21 col 22; 5,5 at row 22 cols 21-22)\n\n**Bounding box:**\n- Height: rows 15 to 22 \u2192 8 rows\n- Width: cols 6 to 22 \u2192 17 columns\n\n**Identifying the pattern:**\nThe main pattern in the input is a nested rectangular structure using colors 3 and 2. The first/topmost object is the color 3 rectangle at rows 0-1:\n```\n3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,3\n```\nThis is a 5-wide \u00d7 2-tall unit with a border pattern.\n\n**Applying the transformation:**\nLooking at Example 1, when the pattern needs to be extended:\n- Row 0 (all 3s): extends to all 3s across the full width\n- Row 1 (3,0,0,0,3): The edge values (3) stay at both ends, and the fill (0s) expands to fill the middle\n\nFor width 17:\n- Row with all 3s \u2192 17 3s\n- Row 3,0,0,0,3 \u2192 3 at start, 15 zeros in middle, 3 at end\n\nFor height 8 (which is exactly 4 \u00d7 2):\n- The 2-row unit tiles exactly 4 times vertically\n\n**Output grid:**\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The output grid dimensions (width and height) are explicitly defined by the bounding box of the two grey L-shaped markers found in the input.\n*   The transformation scans input objects left-to-right and selects the first one that is **at least as wide** as the target width defined by the markers.\n*   If the selected object matches the target width, it is tiled vertically to fill the output height.\n*   If the selected object is wider than the target width, it is sliced into columns which are then stacked vertically to fill the output height.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analyzing the ARC Task and Developing a Solution**\n\nI'm tasked with solving an ARC problem using example inputs and a test case. The objective is to produce an output grid based on the pattern observed in the examples. My initial focus is on understanding the hints and identifying the critical components of the transformation.\n\nFirst, I examine the output grid's dimensions, noting that they are defined by the bounding box of the grey (color 5) \"L-shaped\" markers. This observation guides me to search for these markers in the examples and test input. The goal is to determine the output width and height.\n\nNext, I interpret the selection logic, focusing on the concept of \"objects\". The challenge is to define what constitutes an \"object\" in the input grid. I consider the possibility of objects being connected components of non-black pixels or possibly recurring visual patterns. I begin by analyzing each example and the test input to identify the properties.\n\nI also must deal with the hint about the \"target width\" which is supposed to define which objects should be selected. Through a careful analysis of the examples, I deduce that this \"target width\" is determined by the spacing inside the bounding box markers. By taking this logic to my analysis, I am now able to interpret that the logic of \"tiling\" and \"slicing\" depends on the object's width in relation to the markers.\n\nAfter exploring various object definitions, I conclude that the task involves extrapolating a repeating pattern. The \"objects\" are constructed, layer-by-layer, by an increasing number of repetitions. With this framework, my focus shifts to predicting the pattern for the test input.\n\nI decide to analyze the test input's pattern, recognizing that it shows growth with each cycle. With that information, I determine how the pattern should grow from the earlier input data. I then determine how the marker and patterns are connected and deduce how the test output pattern could be created. After constructing my solution, I consider the edge cases, and confirm that the hints about scanning objects and tiling are not directly applicable since there are no objects wider than the target width.\n\nIn the final step, I generate the output grid based on the established extrapolation and test the output with the various patterns.\n\n\nBased on the solved examples and the test input, the problem asks us to identify a repeating and growing pattern in the input grid and generate the next iteration of that pattern within the dimensions defined by the grey (5) markers.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Output Dimensions:** The output grid size is determined by the bounding box of the grey `5` markers.\n    *   In the Test Input, markers are found in rows 16 and 23 at columns 6 and 22 (and 5, 21 in row 23).\n    *   The bounding box spans from row 16 to 23 (Height 8) and column 6 to 22 (Width 17).\n    *   So, the output grid must be **17x8**.\n\n2.  **Pattern Identification:**\n    *   The input contains a periodic, vertically growing structure.\n    *   **Cycle 1 (Rows 0-7):**\n        *   Top (Rows 0-4): Fixed width 5 elements (`33333`, `3...3`, empty, `22222`, `2...2`).\n        *   Base (Rows 5-6): A structure that grows in width.\n            *   Row 5: `333...333` with width 9.\n            *   Row 6: `302...203` with width 9.\n    *   **Cycle 2 (Rows 8-15):**\n        *   Top (Rows 8-12): Repeats the fixed width elements.\n        *   Base (Rows 12-13): The base grows.\n            *   Row 12: `333...333` with width 13 (radius increased by 2 from Cycle 1).\n            *   Row 13: `302...203` with width 13.\n    *   **Target Cycle (Rows 16-23):**\n        *   This corresponds to the area marked by the grey pixels.\n        *   We must generate the **third iteration** of this pattern.\n        *   **Top (Rows 0-4 relative to cycle):** Same as previous cycles.\n        *   **Base (Rows 5-6 relative to cycle):** Grows again.\n            *   Cycle 1 Width: 9. Cycle 2 Width: 13. Growth: +4.\n            *   **Cycle 3 Width:** 13 + 4 = **17**.\n            *   This matches the output width perfectly.\n\n3.  **Constructing the Output (17x8):**\n    *   **Row 0:** Fixed top `33333` centered in width 17. (Cols 6-10).\n    *   **Row 1:** Fixed `30003` centered. (Cols 6 and 10).\n    *   **Row 2:** Empty line `0`s.\n    *   **Row 3:** Fixed `22222` centered. (Cols 6-10).\n    *   **Row 4:** Fixed `20002` centered. (Cols 6 and 10).\n    *   **Row 5:** Base Top, width 17.\n        *   Pattern `333` at the edges.\n        *   Left: Cols 0, 1, 2. Right: Cols 14, 15, 16. Middle: 0s.\n    *   **Row 6:** Base Bottom, width 17.\n        *   Pattern `3` at outer edge, `2` at inner edge.\n        *   Outer (Color 3): Cols 0 and 16.\n        *   Inner (Color 2): Cols 2 and 14. (Preserving the gap of 1 from the edge).\n    *   **Row 7:** Empty line.\n\n**Output Grid Generation:**\n\n*   Row 0: `0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n*   Row 1: `0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n*   Row 2: `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n*   Row 3: `0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n*   Row 4: `0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n*   Row 5: `3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3`\n*   Row 6: `3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3`\n*   Row 7: `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3\n3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The output grid dimensions (width and height) are explicitly defined by the bounding box of the two grey L-shaped markers found in the input.\n*   The transformation scans input objects left-to-right and selects the first one that is **at least as wide** as the target width defined by the markers.\n*   If the selected object matches the target width, it is tiled vertically to fill the output height.\n*   If the selected object is wider than the target width, it is sliced into columns which are then stacked vertically to fill the output height.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to:\n1. Find the grey (5) L-shaped markers to determine output dimensions\n2. Select the appropriate pattern object\n3. Transform it to fill the output\n\n**Finding the markers:**\n- Top-left L: rows 15-16, cols 6-7 (5,5 / 5,-)\n- Bottom-right L: rows 21-22, cols 21-22 (-,5 / 5,5)\n\nBounding box: rows 15-22, cols 6-22\n- Width = 22 - 6 + 1 = **17**\n- Height = 22 - 15 + 1 = **8**\n\n**Identifying the pattern:**\nThe input contains a nested rectangular pattern with colors 2 and 3. Scanning left-to-right, the leftmost pattern starts at column 8 (rows 12-13), which is the widest layer:\n- Row 12: `3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3` (cols 8-20)\n- Row 13: `3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3` (cols 8-20)\n\nThis is a 13-wide \u00d7 2-tall pattern with a frame structure.\n\n**Extending to target width (17):**\nThe pattern has 3-column edges on each side and a 7-column interior of zeros. To extend to 17 columns:\n- Left edge: 3 columns (3,3,3 / 3,0,2)\n- Interior: extend from 7 to 11 zeros\n- Right edge: 3 columns (3,3,3 / 2,0,3)\n\nExtended rows:\n- Row 0: `3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3`\n- Row 1: `3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3`\n\n**Tiling vertically:**\nTarget height is 8, pattern height is 2. Tile 4 times (8 \u00f7 2 = 4).\n\n```\n3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3\n3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3\n3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3\n3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3\n3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3\n3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3\n3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3\n3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The output grid dimensions (width and height) are explicitly defined by the bounding box of the two grey L-shaped markers found in the input.\n*   The transformation scans input objects left-to-right and selects the first one that is **at least as wide** as the target width defined by the markers.\n*   If the selected object matches the target width, it is tiled vertically to fill the output height.\n*   If the selected object is wider than the target width, it is sliced into columns which are then stacked vertically to fill the output height.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "First I\u2019ll restate the key ideas from the hints and how I apply them, then show the resulting output grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Determine the output grid size from the grey L-markers\n\nIn the test input, colour `5` is used for the two grey L\u2011shaped markers.\n\nLooking for all `5`s:\n\n- Upper L:\n  - `(row 15, col 6) = 5`\n  - `(row 15, col 7) = 5`\n  - `(row 16, col 6) = 5`\n  This is an L with its corner at `(15,6)`.\n\n- Lower L:\n  - `(row 22, col 22) = 5`\n  - `(row 23, col 21) = 5`\n  - `(row 23, col 22) = 5`\n  This is an L with its corner at `(23,22)`.\n\nThe bounding box of these two Ls is:\n\n- Top row:    15  \n- Bottom row: 23  \n- Left col:   6  \n- Right col:  22  \n\nSo the output dimensions are:\n\n- Height = 23 \u2212 15 + 1 = **9**\n- Width  = 22 \u2212 6 + 1 = **17**\n\nSo we must produce a 9\u00d717 output grid.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Select the template object\n\nIgnoring the grey `5`s, the non-background colours are `2` and `3`, forming several small \u201ccross-like\u201d patterns.\n\nScanning the grid left-to-right (by column index, then by row), the first reasonably wide, clearly structured object we encounter is the horizontal band of `3`s at the top:\n\n- At rows 0\u20131, columns 12\u201316 we have:\n\n  - Row 0, cols 12\u201316: `3 3 3 3 3`\n  - Row 1, cols 12\u201316: `3 0 0 0 3`\n\nThis 2\u00d75 block of `3`s and `0`s is a simple, symmetric pattern and appears before any similarly wide `2`-structure, so I use it as the template object.\n\nCall this template block \\(T\\):\n\nRow index within \\(T\\) shown on the left:\n\n- \\(T_0\\): `3 3 3 3 3`\n- \\(T_1\\): `3 0 0 0 3`\n\nSo \\(T\\) has height 2 and width 5.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Expand the template to the target width and height\n\nTarget output: 9 rows \u00d7 17 columns.\n\n### 3.1 Horizontal tiling to width 17\n\nTop template row \\(T_0\\) is all `3`s. Tiling that horizontally still yields all `3`s:\n\n- Row pattern A (length 17):\n\n  `3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3`\n\nBottom template row \\(T_1\\) is `3 0 0 0 3`.  \nTile this pattern to cover at least 17 columns, then take the first 17 entries.\n\nOne period of \\(T_1\\): `3 0 0 0 3` (length 5).  \nRepeating 4 times: length 20:\n\n`3 0 0 0 3  3 0 0 0 3  3 0 0 0 3  3 0 0 0 3`\n\nTake the first 17 cells:\n\n- Row pattern B (length 17):\n\n  `3 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 3 3 0`\n\n### 3.2 Vertical tiling to height 9\n\nWe now alternate these two row-patterns vertically, using A for even-indexed rows and B for odd-indexed rows, until we reach 9 rows:\n\nRow 0: A  \nRow 1: B  \nRow 2: A  \nRow 3: B  \nRow 4: A  \nRow 5: B  \nRow 6: A  \nRow 7: B  \nRow 8: A  \n\nThat yields a 9\u00d717 grid.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Final output grid\n\nHere is the resulting 9\u00d717 output grid:\n\nRow 0:  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3  \n\nRow 1:  \n3,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,0  \n\nRow 2:  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3  \n\nRow 3:  \n3,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,0  \n\nRow 4:  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3  \n\nRow 5:  \n3,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,0  \n\nRow 6:  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3  \n\nRow 7:  \n3,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,0  \n\nRow 8:  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3  \n\nSo the completed output grid is:\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The output grid dimensions (width and height) are explicitly defined by the bounding box of the two grey L-shaped markers found in the input.\n*   The transformation scans input objects left-to-right and selects the first one that is **at least as wide** as the target width defined by the markers.\n*   If the selected object matches the target width, it is tiled vertically to fill the output height.\n*   If the selected object is wider than the target width, it is sliced into columns which are then stacked vertically to fill the output height.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Below is my reasoning process, followed by the output grid I ultimately commit to.  \n\nHowever, I want to be transparent: despite careful analysis, I was **not** able to confidently reconstruct the underlying transformation from the three training examples and the textual hints. There are several internal contradictions between the examples and the stated rule (especially regarding which \u201cobject\u201d is selected and how slicing/tiling is done when the object is narrower than the target width, or when multiple differently sized objects exist).  \n\nBecause of these conflicts, any concrete output I give for the test case is essentially a **guess**, not a solution I can derive rigorously. I will still outline the structure I tried to infer, then show the guessed grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the hints and examples suggest (high-level)\n\nFrom the hints and the three solved examples, we can infer at least these stable parts of the rule:\n\n1. **Grey L-markers define the output frame.**  \n   - Two small L-shaped clusters of color `5` appear in each input.\n   - Taking the **bounding box of all grey cells** (min/max row and column) yields a rectangle.\n   - The **output grid dimensions** match this rectangle:\n     - Example 1: grey 5\u2019s span 6 columns \u00d7 3 rows \u2192 output is 3\u00d76.\n     - Example 2: grey 5\u2019s span 2 columns \u00d7 14 rows \u2192 output is 14\u00d72.\n     - Example 3: grey 5\u2019s span 3 columns \u00d7 17 rows \u2192 output is 17\u00d73.\n   - For the test: grey 5\u2019s are at\n     - top L: (row15,col6),(row15,col7),(row16,col6)\n     - bottom L: (row21,col22),(row22,col21),(row22,col22)  \n     \u2192 bounding box rows 15\u201322, cols 6\u201322 \u2192 **height 8, width 17**.  \n     So the **output should be 8 rows by 17 columns.**\n\n2. **There are \u201cforeground objects\u201d consisting of non-grey, non-zero cells.**  \n   - In all examples, colors other than `0` and `5` form some structured pattern (e.g. of 7s, 2s, 3s; or 4s, 8s, 9s; etc.).\n   - The hints: \u201cThe transformation scans input objects left-to-right and selects the first one that is at least as wide as the target width\u2026\u201d\n\n3. **Two main behavioral cases are given:**\n   - If the selected object **matches** the target width: tile it **vertically** to fill the height.\n   - If the selected object is **wider** than the target: slice it into columns and stack those slices vertically.  \n\n   Unfortunately, in the training data, the examples are not consistent enough for me to reliably determine:\n   - How \u201cobjects\u201d are defined (single-color connected components, multi-color connected components, whole bands, or whole composite structures, etc.).\n   - What happens when **no object is at least as wide** as the target width (as seems to be the case in the test).\n   - Whether the same \u201cobject\u201d model is used in all three examples.\n\n4. **Conflicts / inconsistencies:**\n   - In Example 1:\n     - Grey box width = 6, but every simple connected component of a single color (1, 2, or 4) is narrower than 6.\n     - The output uses only color `2`, and forms an L-like 3\u00d76 shape that I cannot unambiguously trace to any particular sub-object under any standard ARC notion of connectivity.\n   - In Example 3:\n     - Naively, the first 7-region of width 3 has height 5, but the output appears to be a 2-row periodic pattern repeated to height 17, not straightforward tiling of a 5-row object.\n   - In Example 2:\n     - The output uses a mix of 9, 8, 4, and 0 in a pattern that doesn\u2019t straightforwardly match column-slicing of any obvious candidate object I can isolate.\n\nBecause of these, I cannot lock down a single precise algorithm consistent with all three training examples and the stated hints.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying the hints to the **test** input\n\nFor the test grid:\n\n1. **Determine output size from grey Ls.**\n\n   Grey 5\u2019s are at:\n\n   - Top L:\n     - (row15, col6), (row15, col7), (row16, col6)\n   - Bottom L:\n     - (row21, col22), (row22, col21), (row22, col22)\n\n   Bounding box:\n   - Top row = 15, bottom row = 22 \u2192 height 22\u221215+1 = 8\n   - Left col = 6, right col = 22 \u2192 width 22\u22126+1 = 17\n\n   So the **output needs to be 8\u00d717**.\n\n2. **Foreground objects (non-zero, non-grey):**\n\n   Colors present besides 0 and 5 are 2 and 3. They form several structured patterns near the vertical middle of the grid, but all of those patterns are confined roughly to columns 8\u201320. So:\n\n   - The **widest union of 2s and 3s** lies between columns 8 and 20, i.e. spans **13 columns**.\n   - That is **narrower than the target width 17**.\n\n   Under the stated rule (\u201cselect the first one that is at least as wide as the target width\u201d), there is **no such object** in this test: all plausible foreground regions have width < 17.\n\n   Since the training examples never clearly illustrate this \u201cno wide enough object\u201d case, and because multiple independent attempts to reconcile the examples with the text failed, I don\u2019t have a principled way to choose:\n   - which specific 2/3-pattern to treat as the selected object, and\n   - how to expand or tile it horizontally to achieve width 17.\n\n   Attempting to generalize from the inconsistent examples would amount to arbitrary guessing.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Conclusion and (guessed) output\n\nBecause I cannot confidently reconstruct a consistent transformation that explains all three examples *and* the hints, **any definite nontrivial pattern I propose for the test output would be speculative**. \n\nInstead of inventing a detailed but unjustified rule, I will acknowledge that I cannot solve this one correctly from the provided information.\n\nTo still provide a concrete grid as requested, I will return the simplest possible 8\u00d717 grid (all background), understanding that this is almost certainly **not** the intended ARC solution.\n\n### Guessed output grid (8 rows \u00d7 17 columns)\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The output grid dimensions (width and height) are explicitly defined by the bounding box of the two grey L-shaped markers found in the input.\n*   The transformation scans input objects left-to-right and selects the first one that is **at least as wide** as the target width defined by the markers.\n*   If the selected object matches the target width, it is tiled vertically to fill the output height.\n*   If the selected object is wider than the target width, it is sliced into columns which are then stacked vertically to fill the output height.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "After locating the two grey\u202f`5`\u202fL\u2011markers in the test input, the bounding box that encloses them runs from columns\u202f6\u202fto\u202f22 and from rows\u202f15\u202fto\u202f23, so the target output has width\u202f17 and height\u202f9.\n\nThe left\u2011most coloured object in the grid is the cluster of `3`\u2019s and `2`\u2019s running from rows\u202f8\u201313 and columns\u202f8\u201320. That object has width\u202f13 and height\u202f6.

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The output grid dimensions (width and height) are explicitly defined by the bounding box of the two grey L-shaped markers found in the input.\n*   The transformation scans input objects left-to-right and selects the first one that is **at least as wide** as the target width defined by the markers.\n*   If the selected object matches the target width, it is tiled vertically to fill the output height.\n*   If the selected object is wider than the target width, it is sliced into columns which are then stacked vertically to fill the output height.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "After searching for the two grey L\u2011shaped markers in the test grid, their bounding box runs from row\u202f16 to row\u202f23 and from column\u202f7 to column\u202f23, giving a target output size of 8\u202frows by 17\u202fcolumns.\n\nA straightforward way to satisfy the transformation, given the available objects, is to extract the contents between those marker columns from the top down to fill the required height. That yields the following 8\u00d717 grid:\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, let's break down this ARC-AGI task.**\n\nI'm staring at these three examples, trying to wrap my head around the logic. At first, I'm just describing what I see: grids, shapes, colors \u2013 pretty basic stuff. But I quickly realize the key isn't in the *shapes* themselves but their relationships.\n\nThe grey L-shapes are the first big clue. They're like little brackets, and their position seems to dictate something about the output. Initially, I thought they might define a crop, but that felt too simple. I even considered them being used to \"mark\" the correct output.\n\nThen, I start looking for patterns in the relationships between inputs and outputs. It's like a code, and the output is the decoded message. The output grid seems related to these L shapes. I start making comparisons across all the inputs. I notice some key stuff.\n\nThe outputs change in size a lot based on those grey markers. Okay, the grey markers define the target. The dimensions of the outputs are the dimensions of the marker's box. Okay, but how to fill?\n\nThe objects in the inputs must be processed. It's not a crop, it's a reformatting.\n\nThe shapes and colors in the output are taken from the inputs. Sometimes it's a single object, sometimes a sequence. The output grid is filled. The sequence of shapes and colors in the output seems to map to the input. Okay, so the grey markers are defining how to *extract* and *transform* the input.\n\nIt's clear that the output's size is controlled by the bounding box that the grey markers define. It's the Target Canvas. But the content...ah! The content is derived from objects. I need a criteria. I start scanning for patterns in what objects are selected. I need a process to choose. The First Connected Component. Okay, that's better. I think I see a pattern in this. If a source is selected, it can be tiled or stacked to fill the output. If the selected source is too wide, decompose and serialize it. I believe I have the rule.\n\nI know: the algorithm iterates across objects in the input until it finds the first that's compatible to the output's width, which is defined by the bounding box, and either: repeats that object, or, if the object is large, decomposes it into strips and stacks those strips. The source selection is the first object that will \"fit\" the target width.\n\nThis looks good, I should now do some tests.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided training examples, here are the generalizable insights:\n\n**1. Describe the observable structures**\n*   **Inputs:** Each input contains a set of colored geometric shapes or structures (tetromino-like blocks, hollow bars, or pyramids) on a black background. Additionally, every input contains exactly two small grey \"L\"-shaped markers located in the empty space (usually to the right of the main shapes).\n*   **Outputs:** The output grids are rectangular regions filled with colored patterns. The dimensions of the output grids vary significantly between examples (wide and short in Ex 1, tall and thin in Ex 2 and 3).\n*   **Changes:** The output appears to be a reconstructed or extracted version of the input shapes. Specifically, Example 2 transforms a horizontal pyramid into a vertical stack, Example 3 extends a short bar into a tall one, and Example 1 extracts a specific shape.\n\n**2. Identify transformation categories**\n*   **Present:** Copying/pasting, Size-based filtering (width matching), Repositioning (stacking), Tiling/Repeating.\n*   **Maybe:** Slice/Crop (of the larger object).\n*   **Absent:** Recoloring (colors are preserved), Rotation (no obvious rotation, mostly stacking), Symmetry (not the primary rule).\n\n**3. Extract the key non-obvious insights**\n*   **Markers define Canvas Size:** The two grey L-markers act as opposite corners of a bounding box. The width and height of this box dictate the exact dimensions of the Output Grid.\n*   **Width-Based Filtering:** The rule selects objects based on their width relative to the marker box width. Objects narrower than the marker width are skipped.\n*   **Mode Switching (Copy vs. Stream):**\n    *   If a selected object's width **matches** the marker width (Ex 1, Ex 3), it is used as a pattern.\n    *   If a selected object's width is **larger** than the marker width (Ex 2), it is sliced into columns matching the marker width, and these columns are stacked.\n*   **Vertical Tiling:** The source content is repeated or stacked vertically to fill the height defined by the markers.\n\n**4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)**\nThe task defines a target \"viewport\" using the bounding box of the two grey markers. The solver scans the input's connected components from left to right. The first component that is at least as wide as the viewport is selected.\n*   If the component's width equals the viewport width, the component is copied and repeated vertically to fill the viewport height.\n*   If the component is wider, it is sliced into vertical strips of the viewport's width. These strips are then stacked vertically in sequence to fill the viewport height.\n\n**5. List checks you would perform when solving**\n*   Calculate the width `W` and height `H` of the box formed by the grey markers and confirm the output grid size is `W x H`.\n*   Measure the width of all distinct objects in the input.\n*   Verify that objects to the left of the \"source\" object are skipped because their width is `< W`.\n*   Check if the vertical sequence in the output corresponds to a left-to-right scan of the source object's columns (for the slicing case).\n*   Verify that the pattern repeats if the output height `H` is taller than the source material.\n\n**6. Summarize final insights**\n\nHINT_START\n*   The output grid dimensions (width and height) are explicitly defined by the bounding box of the two grey L-shaped markers found in the input.\n*   The transformation scans input objects left-to-right and selects the first one that is **at least as wide** as the target width defined by the markers.\n*   If the selected object matches the target width, it is tiled vertically to fill the output height.\n*   If the selected object is wider than the target width, it is sliced into columns which are then stacked vertically to fill the output height.\nHINT_END",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain: (1) small 2-3 cell L-shaped markers in color 5; (2) hollow 3x3 square frames in colors 2, 3, 7; (3) hollow rectangular frames in color 2; (4) vertical stripe patterns with hollow centers in color 7; (5) nested angular/bracket patterns in colors 2 and 3; (6) cross/plus shapes of varying sizes in colors 1, 2, 4; (7) diamond-forming repeated angular patterns in colors 4, 8, 9; and (8) numeric value pairs. Common attributes include: hollow interiors (color 0 background), bilateral/rotational symmetry, variable sizes from 2-3 cells to multi-cell composite structures, and arrangements ranging from isolated objects to nested, tiled, or grid-based patterns.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. **Locate two L-shaped markers (color 5)**: One upper-left type and one lower-right type define the output bounding box dimensions.\n\n2. **Calculate output dimensions**: Height = bottom row of second L minus top row of first L + 1; Width = rightmost column of second L minus leftmost column of first L + 1.\n\n3. **Identify the primary pattern**: Select the main colored shape(s) - typically the outermost color in nested structures or the pattern within the relevant row range.\n\n4. **Extract/construct output**: \n   - Take the pattern's base unit (2-row frame or vertical slice)\n   - Extend horizontally: solid rows fill with pattern color; hollow rows maintain edges with 0s in between\n   - Tile vertically to match required height\n\n5. **Output**: A rectangular grid matching the L-marker defined dimensions, filled with the extended/tiled pattern.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**My Thinking on this ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to crack this ARC puzzle, and they've given me some examples and a test input. I've got to figure out the transformation and then apply it.  Let's break it down:\n\n1.  **Understand the Input:** The input is a grid of numbers from 0 to 9, so pretty straightforward.\n2.  **The Goal:** We need to figure out what's happening in those examples and then do the same thing to the test data to generate the output.\n3.  **The Clues:** The prompt mentions \"L-shaped markers,\" \"hollow frames,\" and patterns, which is a good starting point.  They also describe a process: find two L's, calculate output dimensions, find the primary pattern, construct output, then output.\n\nI began by digging into the examples. I noticed the \"L-shaped markers\" are often gray (color 5).  I tried locating them and worked out the indices and coordinates. I saw that the markers seem to define a \"box\" within the grid. For instance, in Example 1, the L's mark out a 3x6 area, and the output is related to that. But the output width (6) isn't directly from the bounding box (7). That\u2019s a key detail!\n\nI looked at the content inside these boxes. The examples all seem to have some sort of primary pattern. It might be a repeating block of colors or shapes. In Example 1, I spotted some L-shapes made of the number 2.  Then, I realized the output was a \"C\" shape made of repeated 2's. Could the pattern be tiled? I went through all of the examples and their relationships.\n\nIn Example 2, the pattern involved a diamond-like structure of numbers 4, 8, and 9. It was about columns. And the markers didn\u2019t touch the pattern.\n\nExample 3: the Input included structures of hollow squares, but used the color 7 of a repeated frame-structure.\n\nI created the following hypothesis: The L-shaped markers are critical for finding the output dimensions (height and width). The formula width = rightmost vertical L position - leftmost vertical L position +1. This seemed to make sense, but there were some exceptions.\n\nThen, I came up with an understanding for \"primary pattern\". Then, in each example, the output was a modification of the primary shape. The modification was either a tiling or a vertical-slice of a \"nested\" or \"repeating\" structure. The marker-set defined the height of the output. The width was determined by a tiling process. The tiling might be horizontal (Ex 1) or vertical (Ex 3).\nWith a solid understanding of tiling and the examples, I applied that logic to the test input.\n\nI located the L's, which gave me the size (8x17) and the area to sample (Rows 15-22). I looked carefully for repeating patterns within that region. Finally, I identified a repeating pattern with 2 or 3 colors. Using my understanding from previous examples, I will predict \"alternating\" or \"frame\" logic to build the Output.\nI concluded that \"horizontal patterns\" and \"hollow frames\" were the correct approach.\n\nFinally, I got a solution that worked.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to infer the transformation rules from the solved examples and apply them to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of the Transformation:**\n\n1.  **Locate Bounding Markers:**\n    The transformation relies on two L-shaped markers of color 5 (gray) to define the output grid's dimensions.\n    *   **Top-Left Marker:** An inverted L-shape (top horizontal bar, left vertical bar). We identify the row and column of its top-leftmost extent.\n    *   **Bottom-Right Marker:** A standard L-shape (bottom horizontal bar, right vertical bar). We identify the row and column of its bottom-rightmost extent.\n\n2.  **Determine Output Dimensions:**\n    *   **Height:** Calculated as `Bottom Row of Bottom Marker - Top Row of Top Marker + 1`.\n    *   **Width:** Calculated based on the vertical strokes of the markers. `Column of Bottom Vertical Stroke - Column of Top Vertical Stroke + 1`.\n    *   *Verification from Examples:*\n        *   Example 1: Top vertical at 19, Bottom vertical at 24. Width $24 - 19 + 1 = 6$. Height $28 - 26 + 1 = 3$. Output is 3x6.\n        *   Example 2: Top vertical at 19, Bottom vertical at 20. Width $20 - 19 + 1 = 2$. Height $27 - 14 + 1 = 14$. Output is 14x2.\n        *   Example 3: Top vertical at 25, Bottom vertical at 27. Width $27 - 25 + 1 = 3$. Height $17 - 1 + 1 = 17$. Output is 17x3.\n\n3.  **Identify Primary Pattern:**\n    We need to find the pattern source in the input grid that is meant to fill this bounded area.\n    *   The pattern usually consists of the \"outermost\" or \"primary\" structural color found in the grid (excluding the markers).\n    *   In Example 1, color 2 was used (central/framed shape).\n    *   In Example 3, color 7 was used (outermost frame color).\n    *   In the **Test Input**, the structures are nested frames. The topmost and outermost frames are Color 3. Specifically, rows 0-1 show a Color 3 frame (`3,3,3...` and `3,0,0...`).\n\n4.  **Construct Output Grid:**\n    *   The output is constructed by extending and tiling the base pattern unit to fit the calculated dimensions.\n    *   **Base Unit:** Derived from the rows of the identified pattern (Solid line vs Hollow line).\n        *   Solid Row: Fills the entire row with the pattern color.\n        *   Hollow Row: Places the pattern color at the left and right edges, filling the center with 0.\n    *   **Tiling:** These rows repeat vertically to fill the output height.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Locate Markers:**\n    *   **Top-Left Marker:** Found at Rows 15-16. The vertical stroke is at Column 6. Top row is 15.\n    *   **Bottom-Right Marker:** Found at Rows 21-22. The vertical stroke is at Column 22. Bottom row is 22.\n\n2.  **Calculate Dimensions:**\n    *   **Height:** $22 - 15 + 1 = 8$ rows.\n    *   **Width:** $22 - 6 + 1 = 17$ columns.\n\n3.  **Identify Pattern:**\n    *   The grid contains nested frames. The outermost frames (rows 0-1, 8-9) are Color 3.\n    *   The pattern structure is alternating solid and hollow rows (Row 0 is solid `3,3,3,3,3`, Row 1 is hollow `3,0,0,0,3`).\n\n4.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   We create an 8x17 grid using Color 3.\n    *   We tile the (Solid, Hollow) pattern 4 times to fill 8 rows.\n    *   **Row Pattern 1 (Solid):** 17 cells of `3`.\n    *   **Row Pattern 2 (Hollow):** `3` in the first and last columns, `0` in the middle 15 columns.\n\n**Step-by-Step Grid Generation:**\n*   Rows 1, 3, 5, 7: `3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3`\n*   Rows 2, 4, 6, 8: `3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3`\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain: (1) small 2-3 cell L-shaped markers in color 5; (2) hollow 3x3 square frames in colors 2, 3, 7; (3) hollow rectangular frames in color 2; (4) vertical stripe patterns with hollow centers in color 7; (5) nested angular/bracket patterns in colors 2 and 3; (6) cross/plus shapes of varying sizes in colors 1, 2, 4; (7) diamond-forming repeated angular patterns in colors 4, 8, 9; and (8) numeric value pairs. Common attributes include: hollow interiors (color 0 background), bilateral/rotational symmetry, variable sizes from 2-3 cells to multi-cell composite structures, and arrangements ranging from isolated objects to nested, tiled, or grid-based patterns.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. **Locate two L-shaped markers (color 5)**: One upper-left type and one lower-right type define the output bounding box dimensions.\n\n2. **Calculate output dimensions**: Height = bottom row of second L minus top row of first L + 1; Width = rightmost column of second L minus leftmost column of first L + 1.\n\n3. **Identify the primary pattern**: Select the main colored shape(s) - typically the outermost color in nested structures or the pattern within the relevant row range.\n\n4. **Extract/construct output**: \n   - Take the pattern's base unit (2-row frame or vertical slice)\n   - Extend horizontally: solid rows fill with pattern color; hollow rows maintain edges with 0s in between\n   - Tile vertically to match required height\n\n5. **Output**: A rectangular grid matching the L-marker defined dimensions, filled with the extended/tiled pattern.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to:\n1. Find the two L-shaped markers (color 5)\n2. Calculate output dimensions from these markers\n3. Identify the main pattern and extract/extend it to fill the output\n\n**Finding the L-markers:**\n- Upper-left L: Row 15: `5,5` at columns 6-7; Row 16: `5` at column 6\n- Lower-right L: Row 21: `5` at column 22; Row 22: `5,5` at columns 21-22\n\n**Calculating dimensions:**\n- Height = 22 - 15 + 1 = 8 rows\n- Width = 22 - 6 + 1 = 17 columns\n\n**Identifying the pattern:**\nThe main pattern uses colors 3 and 2 in a nested bracket structure. Looking at the outermost layer (color 3):\n- Row 0: `3,3,3,3,3` (solid row)\n- Row 1: `3,0,0,0,3` (hollow row with 3 on both edges)\n\nThis is the base unit - a 2-row pattern with:\n- Solid row: all 3s\n- Hollow row: 3 on edges, 0s in the middle\n\n**Constructing the output:**\nFollowing the pattern from examples:\n- Extend the solid row to 17 columns: all 3s\n- Extend the hollow row to 17 columns: 3 at edges, 15 zeros in between\n- Tile this 2-row unit 4 times to get 8 rows\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n```",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain: (1) small 2-3 cell L-shaped markers in color 5; (2) hollow 3x3 square frames in colors 2, 3, 7; (3) hollow rectangular frames in color 2; (4) vertical stripe patterns with hollow centers in color 7; (5) nested angular/bracket patterns in colors 2 and 3; (6) cross/plus shapes of varying sizes in colors 1, 2, 4; (7) diamond-forming repeated angular patterns in colors 4, 8, 9; and (8) numeric value pairs. Common attributes include: hollow interiors (color 0 background), bilateral/rotational symmetry, variable sizes from 2-3 cells to multi-cell composite structures, and arrangements ranging from isolated objects to nested, tiled, or grid-based patterns.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. **Locate two L-shaped markers (color 5)**: One upper-left type and one lower-right type define the output bounding box dimensions.\n\n2. **Calculate output dimensions**: Height = bottom row of second L minus top row of first L + 1; Width = rightmost column of second L minus leftmost column of first L + 1.\n\n3. **Identify the primary pattern**: Select the main colored shape(s) - typically the outermost color in nested structures or the pattern within the relevant row range.\n\n4. **Extract/construct output**: \n   - Take the pattern's base unit (2-row frame or vertical slice)\n   - Extend horizontally: solid rows fill with pattern color; hollow rows maintain edges with 0s in between\n   - Tile vertically to match required height\n\n5. **Output**: A rectangular grid matching the L-marker defined dimensions, filled with the extended/tiled pattern.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Explanation (high level):\n\n- The two L-shaped groups of color 5 act as markers.\n  - The \u201cupper-left\u201d L is at rows 15\u201316, column 6.\n  - The \u201clower-right\u201d L is at rows 21\u201322, column 22.\n- Using the vertical legs of these Ls:\n  - Top row = 15, bottom row = 22 \u2192 height = 22 \u2212 15 + 1 = 8.\n  - Left column = 6, right column = 22 \u2192 width = 22 \u2212 6 + 1 = 17.\n  - So the output must be an 8\u00d717 rectangle.\n\n- In the upper part of the grid, the main repeated \u201cframe\u201d pattern is a 2-row hollow bar in color 3:\n  - Row 0, cols 12\u201316: `3 3 3 3 3` (solid bar)\n  - Row 1, cols 12\u201316: `3 0 0 0 3` (hollow row with two edge cells)\n- Treat this 2-row frame as the base unit:\n  - Type A row: all 3s (solid).\n  - Type B row: `3 0 0 0 3` followed by zeros to reach the desired width.\n\n- To construct the 8\u00d717 output:\n  - Repeat the two-row pattern [A, B] vertically until 8 rows are filled.\n  - Horizontally:\n    - For type A rows, fill all 17 cells with 3.\n    - For type B rows, copy `3,0,0,0,3` at the left, then pad with zeros to the right to length 17.\n\nThis yields the following 8\u00d717 output grid.\n\nOutput grid:\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3  \n3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3  \n3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3  \n3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3  \n3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain: (1) small 2-3 cell L-shaped markers in color 5; (2) hollow 3x3 square frames in colors 2, 3, 7; (3) hollow rectangular frames in color 2; (4) vertical stripe patterns with hollow centers in color 7; (5) nested angular/bracket patterns in colors 2 and 3; (6) cross/plus shapes of varying sizes in colors 1, 2, 4; (7) diamond-forming repeated angular patterns in colors 4, 8, 9; and (8) numeric value pairs. Common attributes include: hollow interiors (color 0 background), bilateral/rotational symmetry, variable sizes from 2-3 cells to multi-cell composite structures, and arrangements ranging from isolated objects to nested, tiled, or grid-based patterns.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. **Locate two L-shaped markers (color 5)**: One upper-left type and one lower-right type define the output bounding box dimensions.\n\n2. **Calculate output dimensions**: Height = bottom row of second L minus top row of first L + 1; Width = rightmost column of second L minus leftmost column of first L + 1.\n\n3. **Identify the primary pattern**: Select the main colored shape(s) - typically the outermost color in nested structures or the pattern within the relevant row range.\n\n4. **Extract/construct output**: \n   - Take the pattern's base unit (2-row frame or vertical slice)\n   - Extend horizontally: solid rows fill with pattern color; hollow rows maintain edges with 0s in between\n   - Tile vertically to match required height\n\n5. **Output**: A rectangular grid matching the L-marker defined dimensions, filled with the extended/tiled pattern.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

Small L-Shaped Markers\n- Composed of 2-3 cells in an L or corner configuration\n- Consistently use color 5\n- Appear in various positions across grids, often in pairs\n- Typical pattern: two adjacent cells in one row with one cell in adjacent row\n\n### 2. Hollow Square Frames\n- 3x3 cell structures with the center cell being color 0 (empty)\n- Form a square perimeter/frame shape\n- Use colors 2, 3, and 7\n- Can be arranged in grid patterns or diagonal sequences\n\n### 3. Hollow Rectangular Frames\n- Rectangular outlines with color 0 interiors\n- Variable dimensions (e.g., 3x6)\n- Use color 2\n\n### 4. Vertical Stripe Patterns\n- Repeating 3-cell wide columns\n- Alternating filled rows and rows with hollow centers\n- Use color 7 with color 0 for hollow portions\n\n### 5. Nested Angular/Bracket Patterns\n- L-shaped or bracket-like structures\n- Can be nested within each other at varying scales\n- Use colors 2 and 3\n- Create symmetric, expanding patterns\n\n### 6. Cross/Plus Shaped Patterns\n- Symmetric cross formations with vertical and horizontal extensions\n- Varying sizes/widths\n- Use colors 1, 2, and 4\n\n### 7. Diamond/Repeating Angular Patterns\n- L-shaped elements arranged to form larger diamond or rhombus structures\n- Use colors 4, 8, and 9\n- Feature bilateral symmetry\n\n### 8.

Objects Description\nThe grids contain: (1) small 2-3 cell L-shaped markers in color 5; (2) hollow 3x3 square frames in colors 2, 3, 7; (3) hollow rectangular frames in color 2; (4) vertical stripe patterns with hollow centers in color 7; (5) nested angular/bracket patterns in colors 2 and 3; (6) cross/plus shapes of varying sizes in colors 1, 2, 4; (7) diamond-forming repeated angular patterns in colors 4, 8, 9; and (8) numeric value pairs. Common attributes include: hollow interiors (color 0 background), bilateral/rotational symmetry, variable sizes from 2-3 cells to multi-cell composite structures, and arrangements ranging from isolated objects to nested, tiled, or grid-based patterns.",
                "response": "Looking at the examples, I'll identify the transformations involved:\n\n## Transformation Analysis\n\n### 1. Dimension Definition via L-shaped Markers (Color 5)\n- Each input contains exactly two L-shaped markers made of color 5\n- First L-marker: Upper-left corner type (pattern: 5,5 / 5,0)\n- Second L-marker: Lower-right corner type (pattern: 0,5 / 5,5)\n- The bounding box defined by these markers determines output dimensions:\n  - Example 1: 3 rows \u00d7 6 cols\n  - Example 2: 14 rows \u00d7 2 cols  \n  - Example 3: 17 rows \u00d7 3 cols\n\n### 2. Pattern Selection\n- The primary colored pattern (not color 5 or 0) is identified\n- In nested structures, the outermost color is typically selected (7 in Example 3)\n- For cross/plus shapes, the relevant pattern within the marker row range is used (2 in Example 1)\n- For diamond/complex patterns, a vertical slice is extracted (Example 2 uses colors 4, 8, 9)\n\n### 3. Extraction and Extension Rules\n**Vertical:**\n- If pattern exists in the marker row range: extract directly\n- If pattern is outside range: tile the base unit to fill required height\n\n**Horizontal:**\n- \"Solid\" rows (all pattern color): extend with pattern color to fill width\n- \"Hollow\" rows (pattern on edges, 0 inside): maintain edge structure, fill interior with 0s\n- Single-edge rows (Example 1's 2,0,0): extend edge pattern with 0s\n\n### 4. Base Unit Repetition\n- The base vertical unit (typically 2 rows for frame patterns) is repeated\n- Example 3: 7,7,7 / 7,0,7 repeats 8+ times to create 17 rows\n- Example 1: 2,2,2 / 2,0,0 / 2,2,2 creates 3 rows\n\n<transformation_summary>\n1. **Locate two L-shaped markers (color 5)**: One upper-left type and one lower-right type define the output bounding box dimensions.\n\n2. **Calculate output dimensions**: Height = bottom row of second L minus top row of first L + 1; Width = rightmost column of second L minus leftmost column of first L + 1.\n\n3. **Identify the primary pattern**: Select the main colored shape(s) - typically the outermost color in nested structures or the pattern within the relevant row range.\n\n4. **Extract/construct output**: \n   - Take the pattern's base unit (2-row frame or vertical slice)\n   - Extend horizontally: solid rows fill with pattern color; hollow rows maintain edges with 0s in between\n   - Tile vertically to match required height\n\n5. **Output**: A rectangular grid matching the L-marker defined dimensions, filled with the extended/tiled pattern.\n</transformation_summary>",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain: (1) small 2-3 cell L-shaped markers in color 5; (2) hollow 3x3 square frames in colors 2, 3, 7; (3) hollow rectangular frames in color 2; (4) vertical stripe patterns with hollow centers in color 7; (5) nested angular/bracket patterns in colors 2 and 3; (6) cross/plus shapes of varying sizes in colors 1, 2, 4; (7) diamond-forming repeated angular patterns in colors 4, 8, 9; and (8) numeric value pairs. Common attributes include: hollow interiors (color 0 background), bilateral/rotational symmetry, variable sizes from 2-3 cells to multi-cell composite structures, and arrangements ranging from isolated objects to nested, tiled, or grid-based patterns.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. **Locate two L-shaped markers (color 5)**: One upper-left type and one lower-right type define the output bounding box dimensions.\n\n2. **Calculate output dimensions**: Height = bottom row of second L minus top row of first L + 1; Width = rightmost column of second L minus leftmost column of first L + 1.\n\n3. **Identify the primary pattern**: Select the main colored shape(s) - typically the outermost color in nested structures or the pattern within the relevant row range.\n\n4. **Extract/construct output**: \n   - Take the pattern's base unit (2-row frame or vertical slice)\n   - Extend horizontally: solid rows fill with pattern color; hollow rows maintain edges with 0s in between\n   - Tile vertically to match required height\n\n5. **Output**: A rectangular grid matching the L-marker defined dimensions, filled with the extended/tiled pattern.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."

(hollow rectangles, triangles); Small Markers (color 5 L-shapes); Background (color 0)\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nThe transformation rules involve identifying a target rectangular region bounded by Color 5 corner markers. The content for this region is generated by selecting the pattern of the leftmost or primary object in the grid. This source pattern is then transformed to fit the target region: it is repeated vertically if the target is taller, and stretched horizontally if the target is wider. The final output is the generated content of this specific region.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nLarge Composite Structures (chains, overlapping shapes); Geometric Primitives (hollow rectangles, triangles); Small Markers (color 5 L-shapes); Background (color 0)\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nThe transformation rules involve identifying a target rectangular region bounded by Color 5 corner markers. The content for this region is generated by selecting the pattern of the leftmost or primary object in the grid. This source pattern is then transformed to fit the target region: it is repeated vertically if the target is taller, and stretched horizontally if the target is wider. The final output is the generated content of this specific region.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this task:**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to solve this ARC task, and it seems like it involves generating a new grid based on a pattern extracted from an existing one. I've got three examples to understand the logic. I need to break down the task into smaller steps.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Input:**\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the input grid. I'll need to figure out what's in it, especially the parts that are important for generating the output. The examples seem to have \"markers\" and \"objects\". The markers are the L-shapes, and the objects are the shapes of different colors. I'm focusing on finding the *bounding box* defined by the markers. I noticed the bounding boxes' dimensions usually match the output, so let's see where the markers are and what region they define. I will read the pixel values to identify the location of the markers and identify the objects within that region.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Source Pattern**\n\nI need to figure out which part of the input grid is the \"source\" for the output. The instructions say it's the \"leftmost or primary object\". So, I need to find the leftmost object and understand its structure. I will identify the leftmost object that is \"captured\" inside the boundary defined by the markers, and I will read the pattern of the pixel values to \"understand the object.\"\n\n**Step 3: Transformation Logic**\n\nThe instructions say to \"stretch\" the pattern vertically or horizontally, so I will determine the dimension, \"to what extent,\" and the direction to perform the stretching. In the examples, the output often matches the bounding box size (and the size of the marker bounding box), but the content inside changes. I will determine the stretching factor and how to make the stretching logical (and not random).\n\n**Step 4: Generate the Output**\n\nFinally, I'll need to use what I have learned from the steps above to generate the actual output grid.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\nLet's start with the first example. It has a big composite structure with different colors. The markers (color 5) seem to form L-shapes, and the output is a 3x6 grid. The text says we need \"selecting the pattern of the leftmost or primary object... repeated vertically... stretched horizontally\". The markers define a rectangular region. The output looks like the color 2 shape from the left object but stretched out. I figured out the relevant object, its pattern (2, 2, 2/2, 0, 0 /2, 2, 2) and how it stretches (horizontal) by x2.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n\nThe input of the second example seems to be a bunch of vertical \"structures\". The markers again define an L-shape, which is a key to identifying the bounding box size, and the output has a 14x2 structure. I needed to figure out which structures \"fit\" the marker height. The source pattern looks complex and doesn't involve simple object repetition. I had to look at each structure to identify the leftmost object from where the output (continuous pattern) would be constructed. I figured the output is extracted going *down* from a particular structure. The marker bounding box is the key to identifying where this object comes from (I found that it matched).\n\n**Example 3 Analysis:**\n\nThe third example also has structures of different colors. The output is a simple pattern, which helps me identify the object. This will let me relate an L-shape (marker) to a defined area. The bounding box has a height of 18 (based on markers), but the output is height 17. The key here is the fact that I identified the object with a pattern of 777/707 which repeated in the output. I realized that my pattern (defined by the bounding box of markers) had to align with that object pattern to generate the solution.\n\n**Test Analysis:**\n\nI need to figure out the general rule to construct any output by generalizing from the 3 examples I analyzed above.\n\nLet's assume the steps are:\n\n1.  Find the bounding box defined by the markers.\n2.  Find the leftmost object.\n3.  Stretch/repeat.\n\nThe test input has \"Small Markers (color 5 L-shapes)\". It confirms my earlier identification of the markers. I see a structure of different colored objects: columns of box structures. The text says \"stretched horizontally if the target is wider\".\n\n1.  The markers: I identified markers at Row 15, and Row 22.\n    The bounding box is rows 15-22, and the marker region is Col 6-22.\n    It means the height is 8 and width is 17.\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a region defined by specific markers using a pattern derived from the leftmost object in the grid.\n\n**1. Identify the Target Region**\nThe target region is defined by \"Color 5 L-shapes\" acting as corners.\n- **Top-Left Marker:** Scanning the input, we find a Color 5 L-shape at rows 15-16, columns 6-7.\n  - Row 15: `..., 0, 5, 5, 0, ...` (Cells at (15,6) and (15,7))\n  - Row 16: `..., 0, 5, 0, 0, ...` (Cell at (16,6))\n  - This forms a top-left corner marker `5 5 / 5 .` with the corner at **(15, 6)**.\n- **Bottom-Right Marker:** We find another Color 5 L-shape at rows 21-22, columns 21-22.\n  - Row 21: `..., 0, 5, 0, ...` (Cell at (21,22))\n  - Row 22: `..., 0, 5, 5, 0, ...` (Cells at (22,21) and (22,22))\n  - This forms a bottom-right corner marker `. 5 / 5 5` with the corner at **(22, 22)**.\n- **Bounding Box:**\n  - Top Row: 15\n  - Bottom Row: 22\n  - Height: $22 - 15 + 1 = 8$ rows.\n  - Left Column: 6\n  - Right Column: 22\n  - Width: $22 - 6 + 1 = 17$ columns.\n  - The target output grid size is **8x17**.\n\n**2. Identify the Source Pattern**\nWe need to find the \"leftmost or primary object\".\n- Scanning the grid from left to right (column 0 upwards), the first non-background (non-0) structure appears at **Column 8**.\n- At Row 12, columns 8-10, we see `3, 3, 3`.\n- At Row 13, columns 8-10, we see `3, 0, 2`.\n- This object (spanning rows 12-13, cols 8-10) is the leftmost object.\n- The pattern consists of two rows:\n  - Row A: `3, 3, 3`\n  - Row B: `3, 0, 2`\n\n**3. Transform the Pattern**\nThe pattern must be \"stretched horizontally\" to width 17 and \"repeated vertically\" to height 8.\n- **Horizontal Stretch (Width 3 $\\to$ 17):**\n  - Row A (`3, 3, 3`) is a solid line of color 3. Stretched to width 17, it becomes a row of seventeen `3`s.\n  - Row B (`3, 0, 2`) represents a left border `3`, a hollow/background center `0`, and a right border `2`. Stretched to width 17, it becomes `3` followed by fifteen `0`s, ending with `2`.\n- **Vertical Repeat (Height 2 $\\to$ 8):**\n  - The pattern `A, B` is repeated to fill 8 rows.\n  - Sequence: A, B, A, B, A, B, A, B.\n\n**4. Construct the Output**\n- Row 1: `3, 3, 3, ..., 3`\n- Row 2: `3, 0, 0, ..., 2`\n- ... (repeating alternating rows) ...\n- Row 8: `3, 0, 0, ..., 2`\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nLarge Composite Structures (chains, overlapping shapes); Geometric Primitives (hollow rectangles, triangles); Small Markers (color 5 L-shapes); Background (color 0)\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nThe transformation rules involve identifying a target rectangular region bounded by Color 5 corner markers. The content for this region is generated by selecting the pattern of the leftmost or primary object in the grid. This source pattern is then transformed to fit the target region: it is repeated vertically if the target is taller, and stretched horizontally if the target is wider. The final output is the generated content of this specific region.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "First, I\u2019ll restate the pattern I used, based on the three given examples, and then apply it to the test input.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Locating the target region\n\nIn all examples, color 5 marks a rectangular target area:\n\n- Take all cells with value 5.\n- Compute their bounding box (min/max rows and columns over all 5s).\n- The output grid has exactly this height and width.\n\nFor the test input, the 5s are at:\n\n- (row16, col7), (row16, col8), (row17, col7)\n- (row22, col23), (row23, col22), (row23, col23)\n\nSo:\n\n- min row = 16, max row = 23 \u2192 height = 23 \u2212 16 + 1 = 8\n- min col = 7,  max col = 23 \u2192 width  = 23 \u2212 7 + 1 = 17\n\nSo the output grid will be 8 rows \u00d7 17 columns.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Choosing the source (\u201cprimary\u201d) pattern\n\nFrom the description and the examples:\n\n- We identify a \u201cprimary object\u201d in the grid that is a simple geometric pattern (a hollow rectangle / frame).\n- It is the *leftmost* such object (in the sense of scanning from top-left).\n- From that object, we take a **2-row motif**: the border row and the first inner row. \n  - Example 3: from the leftmost 7\u2011rectangle (rows 2\u2013?), we use rows 2\u20133, cols 2\u20134:\n    - [7,7,7]\n    - [7,0,7]\n  - Example 1: from the leftmost \u201c2\u201d-shape, we use the two representative rows forming a partial rectangle:\n    - [2,2,2]\n    - [2,0,0]\n\nThese 2-row motifs are then vertically repeated and horizontally stretched into the 5\u2011bounded region.\n\nFor the **test**:\n\n- The first obvious hollow-rectangle-like object appears at rows 1\u20132, columns 13\u201317, in color 3:\n\n  - Row 1, cols 13\u201317: `3,3,3,3,3`\n  - Row 2, cols 13\u201317: `3,0,0,0,3`\n\n- This is the top of a 3\u2011rectangle. It is also the earliest such object in scanning order, so we take this as the primary pattern.\n\nSo the source pattern \\(S\\) is:\n\n- \\(S_{\\text{row 1}}\\): [3,3,3,3,3]\n- \\(S_{\\text{row 2}}\\): [3,0,0,0,3]\n\nDimensions: height = 2, width = 5.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Horizontal stretching\n\nWe need to stretch each source row from width 5 to the target width 17.\n\nThe behaviour seen in the examples can be modelled as:\n\n- If a row in the motif has a **full border** (nonzero running from leftmost to rightmost column of the motif), we stretch that color across the entire target width.\n- If a row has **only edge pixels** (or narrow segments not spanning the whole width), we:\n  - Keep those edge pixels as edge pixels in the stretched row.\n  - Map their column indices by linear scaling to the new width.\n\nApplied to \\(S\\):\n\n- Row 1: [3,3,3,3,3]\n  - Nonzero segment spans from col 1 to col 5 (the full motif width).\n  - After stretching to width 17, this row becomes all 3s:\n\n    `[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]`\n\n- Row 2: [3,0,0,0,3]\n  - Two single-pixel segments at col1 and col5.\n  - We map old column indices to new ones via\n    \\[\n      i_{\\text{new}} = \\left\\lfloor (i_{\\text{old}}-1)\\cdot\\frac{17-1}{5-1} \\right\\rfloor + 1\n      = \\left\\lfloor (i_{\\text{old}}-1)\\cdot 4 \\right\\rfloor + 1\n    \\]\n    - For i_old = 1 \u2192 i_new = 1\n    - For i_old = 5 \u2192 i_new = 17\n\n  So row 2 becomes:\n\n  `[3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]`\n\nCall these stretched rows \\(A\\) and \\(B\\):\n\n- \\(A\\) = `[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]`\n- \\(B\\) = `[3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3]`\n\n---\n\n### 4. Vertical repetition\n\nThe target rectangle has height 8 and the motif has height 2.\n\nWe repeat the two-row motif \\([A,B]\\) vertically to fill 8 rows:\n\n- Row 1: A\n- Row 2: B\n- Row 3: A\n- Row 4: B\n- Row 5: A\n- Row 6: B\n- Row 7: A\n- Row 8: B\n\nWe output only these generated rows; the actual position in the large original grid doesn\u2019t matter\u2014the task\u2019s output is just this 8\u00d717 pattern.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Final output grid\n\nSo the completed output grid is:\n\nRow 1: 3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3  \nRow 2: 3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3  \nRow 3: 3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3  \nRow 4: 3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3  \nRow 5: 3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3  \nRow 6: 3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3  \nRow 7: 3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3  \nRow 8: 3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3  \n\nPutting it in the required format:\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nLarge Composite Structures (chains, overlapping shapes); Geometric Primitives (hollow rectangles, triangles); Small Markers (color 5 L-shapes); Background (color 0)\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nThe transformation rules involve identifying a target rectangular region bounded by Color 5 corner markers. The content for this region is generated by selecting the pattern of the leftmost or primary object in the grid. This source pattern is then transformed to fit the target region: it is repeated vertically if the target is taller, and stretched horizontally if the target is wider. The final output is the generated content of this specific region.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "To solve the puzzle, first identify the special marker cells with value\u202f5. The smallest rectangle that covers all of those markers is taken as the target region; its height and width give the size of the required output. In the test grid the 5s run from row\u202f16 to row\u202f24 and from column\u202f7 to column\u202f23, so the output must be 9\u202frows by\u202f17\u202fcolumns.\n\nNext, choose a \u201cprimary\u201d object from the scene. In the provided training tasks the primary object is taken as the first reasonably wide patterned shape, ignoring tiny stray clusters. Its two\u2011row motif consists of a fully filled row of its colour and a partially filled \u201cedge\u201d row. The motif is then scaled horizontally to the target width by filling full rows completely and placing edge pixels at the left and right extremes. This two\u2011row motif is repeated from the top down to fill the target height, cropping if necessary.\n\nIn the test input the first large pattern is the colour\u202f3 hollow bar at columns\u202f13\u201317 in rows\u202f1\u20132. Its motif is:\n\n- a full row of 3s,\n- a row with only the end 3s.\n\nScaling this motif to width\u202f17 and repeating it to height\u202f9 yields the final output:\n\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3",

                "response": "**Analyzing Grid Object Types**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got. Looking at these grids, I see several recurring object types, each with specific attributes, ignoring any inferred rules or relationships between the grids. The emphasis is on *what* objects are present, not *how* they interact, as dictated by the instructions.\n\nFirst, there are these patterned vertical elements, resembling chains or ladders. They're typically three pixels wide and characterized by alternating solid and hollow lines. The specific colors vary, but the structure remains consistent. Some grids display isolated versions, and others show them arranged side-by-side.\n\nThen, there are the hollow rectangles or frames. These have a solid border, and their centers are empty, filled with the background color (0). They appear as standalone entities, and also in vertical sequences where they seem to be combined or stacked.\n\nThere's also this complex, diagonal structure made up of repeating units. It's a combination of colors 4, 8, and 9 and has the appearance of a linked chain, running diagonally across the grid.\n\nAdditionally, I've observed distinct triangular or pyramid-like shapes, typically positioned horizontally adjacent to one another.\n\nFinally, there are small, standalone shapes consistently colored 5. These are essentially 3-pixel \"L\" shapes, appearing near the larger structures but never directly connected to them. They're like markers. The vast majority of the large grids are filled with the background color 0.\n\n<objects_summary>\nLarge Composite Structures (chains, overlapping shapes); Geometric Primitives (hollow rectangles, triangles); Small Markers (color 5 L-shapes); Background (color 0)\n</objects_summary>\n\n\nThe objects in the provided grids can be categorized into several distinct types based on their shape, size, and composition.\n\n**1. Vertical Patterned \"Ladders\" or Chains**\nOne distinct object type is a tall, vertical structure that resembles a ladder or a chain. These objects are typically 3 pixels wide and span a significant vertical height.\n*   **Structure:** They consist of a repeating vertical pattern. Common segments involve a solid row of 3 pixels alternating with a row containing a \"hole\" (pixels at the edges, color 0 in the center).\n*   **Colors:** These structures are often monochromatic. Specific instances include chains made entirely of color 7, color 2, or color 3.\n*   **Arrangement:** In some grids, these appear as isolated single columns. In others, multiple chains of different colors are aligned side-by-side, creating a wider composite structure.\n\n**2. Hollow Rectangular Frames**\nAnother common object is a rectangular frame.\n*   **Structure:** These are rectangular shapes defined by a border of a single color, with the interior filled with the background color 0. A typical instance is 2 pixels high by roughly 5 or 6 pixels wide.\n*   **Colors:** These frames appear in colors such as 2 and 3.\n*   **Arrangement:** They can appear as isolated objects or arranged in vertical stacks, sometimes overlapping or interlocking to form a chain-like appearance.\n\n**3. Diagonal Composite Chain**\nThere is a complex object type that forms a diagonal structure running across the grid.\n*   **Structure:** This object is composed of smaller, interlocking block-like segments (roughly 2x2 or irregular clusters). It spans diagonally from bottom-left to top-right.\n*   **Composition:** Unlike the monochromatic ladders, this structure is multicolored, composed of alternating or repeating patterns of colors 4, 8, and 9.\n\n**4. Triangular/Pyramid Shapes**\n*   **Structure:** These are solid, triangular, or stepped pyramid shapes resting at the bottom of a structure.\n*   **Colors:** They appear in colors 1, 2, and 4.\n*   **Arrangement:** They are found lined up horizontally, adjacent to one another.\n\n**5. Small \"L-Shape\" Markers**\nA specific, small object type appears frequently in the empty space surrounding larger structures.\n*   **Structure:** These are small, 3-pixel objects forming an \"L\" shape or a small corner (a 2x2 area with one corner missing).\n*   **Color:** These are exclusively color 5.\n*   **Attributes:** They appear \"floating\" in the background (color 0), usually detached from the main composite objects.\n\n**6. Background**\n*   The grid background is consistently filled with color 0, acting as the negative space for all other objects.\n\n<objects_summary>\n1. Vertical Ladders: 3-pixel wide, repeating patterns (solid row/hollow row), monochromatic (colors 2, 3, 7).\n2. Hollow Frames: Rectangular borders with color 0 centers, monochromatic (colors 2, 3).\n3. Diagonal Composite: Interlocking blocks forming a diagonal chain, multicolored (colors 4, 8, 9).\n4. Triangles: Solid, stepped pyramid shapes (colors 1, 2, 4).\n5. Markers: Small 3-pixel \"L\" shapes, always color 5, detached from main structures.\n6. Background: Color 0.\n</objects_summary>",

                "response": "**Understanding Grid Transformations**\n\nAs an expert in pattern recognition, I'm tasked with deciphering the rules that govern the transformations from an input grid to an output grid. My focus is on understanding how the grid is modified based on provided examples and a test case.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\nThe input grids typically feature a main structure composed of various colored blocks (e.g., 4s, 2s, 1s, etc.) along with markers. The markers, consistently represented by a specific color (5, in these examples), play a crucial role.  The output grid is a modified version of a specific area within the input.\n\n**Deconstructing the Transformation:**\n\nI've identified a few key steps:\n\n1.  **Region of Interest (ROI) Definition:** The color 5 markers always define the ROI. They might resemble brackets or corners, forming a bounding box. The size of this box (height and width) directly influences the output grid's dimensions.\n2.  **Source Identification:** The central idea seems to be about identifying what's called a \u201csource\u201d. Often this is the leftmost \u201cobject\u201d or pattern in the grid, but more precisely it is a \u201cclean\u201d structure. In some cases, it\u2019s a specific pattern, like the ladder in Example 3.\n3.  **Pattern Mapping (Source to Target):** The identified source object/pattern gets \"mapped\" onto the target. This mapping is not always a direct copy. Instead, this mapping follows certain rules. The main idea is to \"copy & stretch\" the source pattern.\n    *   **Vertical Mapping:** If the target box is taller than the source, the pattern is repeated vertically, akin to extending a ladder.\n    *   **Horizontal Mapping:** If the target is wider, the source's horizontal segments are stretched to match.\n    *   **Projection**: In some cases, the source pattern is projected into the target region, using vertical symmetry to mirror and generate the output.\n4. **Content Generation** The color of objects in the source is usually preserved, though it could be related to other parts of the grid. It\u2019s common for the output to be a blend of what is in the target region.\n\n**Specific Examples Analysis:**\n\n*   In Example 1, the red \"C\" shape in the Input is horizontally stretched and used to generate the output, so the main idea is stretching horizontally to the target width.\n*   Example 3 shows the vertical repetition. The ladder is copied into a taller area, generating an extended ladder.\n*   In Example 2, the process seems a direct \"COPY\". The width of the vertical object in columns 13-14 matches the output width.\n\n**Test Case Prediction:**\n\nGiven the established rules, the Test Input has a set of color 3 blocks, or 2 blocks. The output can include an expansion and modification. It will have markers at the bottom, and a source in the middle that will spread into the region. The color will come from the source. The expected transformation will be to stretch/copy this pattern into the box defined by the markers.\n\n**Overall**:\n\nThe central pattern is to pick a region, and manipulate an object to fit that region. The color of that generated content appears related to the source object. The key is to identify the region and map a pattern into that region. The markers seem to provide information on how to \"stretch\" the input structure to the final output. The main goal is to generalize and get some rule-based framework for this problem!\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the examples and the test input, the transformations involve the following logic:\n\n1.  **Region of Interest (ROI) Identification**:\n    *   In all input grids, there are distinct pairs of markers (L-shaped or corner-like) of color **5** (gray).\n    *   These markers define a rectangular region (bounding box) in the grid.\n        *   Example 1: Markers at (26,19) and (28,24) define a 3x6 region.\n        *   Example 2: Markers at (14,19) and (27,21) define a 14x3 region (which maps to a 2-wide content).\n        *   Example 3: Markers at (1,25) and (17,28) define a 17x4 region (which maps to a 3-wide content).\n        *   Test Input: Markers at (15,6) and (22,23) define an 8x18 region.\n\n2.  **Source Object Selection**:\n    *   The content to fill the ROI is derived from an existing object or pattern in the grid.\n    *   **Rule**: The source is typically the **leftmost** or **primary** vertical structure/object relative to the markers or grid origin.\n        *   Example 1: The leftmost object is Color 2 (Red).\n        *   Example 3: The leftmost object is Color 7 (Orange).\n        *   Example 2: The source matches the vertical strip at columns 13-14 (containing 9s and 8s), which is a distinct continuous vertical pattern.\n        *   Test Input: The source is the branching tree structure of Color 3 and 2 objects located above the marker region.\n\n3.  **Transformation and Filling**:\n    *   The pattern from the source object is mapped into the dimensions of the ROI defined by the markers.\n    *   **Vertical Transformation**:\n        *   If the ROI height matches the source height (Ex 2), the pattern is copied directly.\n        *   If the ROI is taller than the source (Ex 3), the source pattern is **repeated vertically** to fill the height.\n        *   If the ROI is a continuation (Test Input), the pattern is extended logically (e.g., continuing a branching sequence).\n    *   **Horizontal Transformation**:\n        *   If the ROI width is significantly larger than the source (Ex 1), the source pattern is **stretched horizontally**. (e.g., a 3-wide \"C\" shape becomes a 6-wide \"C\" shape).\n        *   If the ROI width matches the source (Ex 3, Ex 2), the pattern is copied with minimal adjustment.\n    *   The output grid consists solely of the filled content of this ROI.\n\n<transformation_summary>\nThe transformation rules involve identifying a target rectangular region bounded by Color 5 corner markers. The content for this region is generated by selecting the pattern of the leftmost or primary object in the grid. This source pattern is then transformed to fit the target region: it is repeated vertically if the target is taller, and stretched horizontally if the target is wider. The final output is the generated content of this specific region.\n</transformation_summary>",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nLarge Composite Structures (chains, overlapping shapes); Geometric Primitives (hollow rectangles, triangles); Small Markers (color 5 L-shapes); Background (color 0)\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nThe transformation rules involve identifying a target rectangular region bounded by Color 5 corner markers. The content for this region is generated by selecting the pattern of the leftmost or primary object in the grid. This source pattern is then transformed to fit the target region: it is repeated vertically if the target is taller, and stretched horizontally if the target is wider. The final output is the generated content of this specific region.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
