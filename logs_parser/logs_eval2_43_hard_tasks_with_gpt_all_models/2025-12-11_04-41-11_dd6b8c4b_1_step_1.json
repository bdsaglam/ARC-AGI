Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, here's my breakdown of this ARC task and how I'm thinking about solving it.** I see I need to take three solved examples and a test input and come up with a rule to transform the input grids into output grids. The goal is to come up with a rule based on what's visible in each grid.\n\n1.  **I started by analyzing Example 1.** I noticed a colored background with a rectangular frame, and inside, there was a small square with a colored center. There were scattered colored pixels, but I'll call them '9s'. I then compared the input and output grids. Initially, it seemed like the '9s' outside were somehow being collected and inserted into that small square. The colored square would have a mix of 3s and 2s, but the output changed those to nines.\n2.  **So I looked more closely at the position of the nines** and whether they were somehow related to the box's position. I counted how many there were in both. I also looked at Example 2.\n3.  **In Example 2, some nine's disappeared completely, and the center's color also changes.** This tells me the number of nines could have something to do with the outcome.\n4.  **I tried a gravity model** where nines are falling towards the box. It kind of works but doesn't quite explain every case.\n5.  **I tried something more spatial.** Could the grid be \"wrapped\" or \"connected\"? Maybe the frame acted as a barrier.\n6.  **I started playing around with coordinates, trying to map where the input nines were located in the new output.** I considered rotation and mirroring as operations. This didn't quite pan out.\n7.  **Then I considered the colored pixels and the structure, and I got to this idea of \"walls\", and what's connected to those walls.** I also realized the frame's color was significant.\n8.  **I also saw that the output 3x3 had some changes, but other changes also happened to the outer tiles.** So maybe outer tiles could map to tiles within the 3x3 somehow.\n9.  **Then came the \"Extraction and Mapping\" idea:** The idea was that nines are relative coordinates, which are extracted relative to some central reference and re-mapped inside the box.\n10. **I began investigating the concept of \"gravity\",** where the nine tiles fall to the bottom row, and fill the small box if they are on a column or row intersecting with the small box.\n11. **But then I tried the idea of \"Connected Components.\"** Maybe nines that are connected to a colored structure were active, meaning they get absorbed, and others are just along for the ride.\n12. **Next, the count and fill idea emerged.** I thought about how many nines were present and whether they were removed. The basic rule seems to be: \"Count the reachable nines and fill the target.\" I'll determine how to determine \"reachable\" in a moment.\n13. **So here's the pathfinding rule I settled on.** The rule is: starting from the box's cells, check if you can travel through 7-colored pixels to the \"nine\" to determine if it is \"reachable\" or \"active\".\n14. **So, I tried applying this new rule to the samples**. And it fit! The pathfinding, where the \"path\" is 7 colored pixels, seemed to correctly identify nines that should be absorbed.\n15. **After this, I went through the test input and followed the steps:** I created this rule: if the nines are \"reachable\" from the center, then the boxes' pixels' position is determined, and they can be filled with nines.\n16. **Then I created my solution.**\n\nThis rule accounts for all the examples I've seen, and I'm ready to apply this to the test input.\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the transformation rule based on three solved examples and apply it to a test input.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n\n1.  **Structure:** All grids are 11x11. There is a background of Orange (7) and a structure of Magenta (6) pixels acting as walls. In the center (Rows 4-6, Columns 4-6), there is a 3x3 \"Green Box\" (initially mostly Green (3) with a Red (2) center). There are scattered Maroon (9) pixels.\n2.  **Transformation Process:**\n    *   **Absorption of Maroon (9) Pixels:** Certain Maroon (9) pixels in the grid disappear (turn into background 7).\n    *   **Filling the Green Box:** The Green Box pixels change from Green (3) or Red (2) to Maroon (9). The number of pixels that change in the box seems directly related to the number of Maroon pixels that disappeared from the grid.\n3.  **Determining Which 9s Disappear:**\n    *   By examining the Magenta (6) structures, we can see they form enclosures or barriers.\n    *   In **Example 1**, the 9s at (8,7) and (8,8) disappear. These are reachable from the Green Box through the background (7) path. Other 9s, like those above the top wall (Row 3) or blocked by side walls, remain.\n    *   In **Example 2**, a large number of 9s disappear. The container is open at the bottom, and Row 10 acts as a passage connecting different areas. Most 9s are reachable and thus disappear.\n    *   In **Example 3**, there are no Magenta walls. All 9s disappear.\n    *   **Rule:** A Maroon (9) pixel is \"absorbed\" if it is connected to the central Green Box via a path of background (7) pixels (orthogonal movement, not blocked by Magenta 6s).\n4.  **Determining the Box Fill Pattern:**\n    *   Let $N$ be the count of absorbed 9s.\n    *   The Green Box (3x3) is filled with $N$ Maroon (9) pixels, replacing the original values.\n    *   The filling order is reading order: Row by Row, Left to Right.\n        *   Indices:\n            (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)\n            (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n            (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n    *   **Example 1:** $N=2$. Positions (0,0) and (0,1) become 9. Center (1,1) remains 2.\n    *   **Example 3:** $N=4$. Positions (0,0) to (1,0) become 9. Center (1,1) remains 2.\n    *   **Example 2:** $N \\ge 5$. The center (1,1) becomes 9. In this case, the box was completely filled ($N \\ge 9$).\n    *   **Conclusion:** We fill the first $N$ pixels of the 3x3 box. If $N \\ge 5$, the center (red 2) gets overwritten.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Structure:**\n    *   There is a large container defined by Magenta (6) walls: Row 1 (Top), Column 1 (Left), Column 9 (Right), and Row 9 (Bottom).\n    *   The Green Box is at the center (Rows 4-6, Columns 4-6).\n    *   There are gaps in the inner horizontal walls (Row 3 and Row 7) at Column 5, allowing access between the Box and the rest of the container.\n    *   There are gaps in the inner vertical walls (Column 3 and Column 7) at Row 5, also allowing access.\n2.  **Count Reachable 9s:**\n    *   We scan the grid for Maroon (9) pixels inside the container (Rows 2-8, Columns 2-8).\n    *   (2,2): Inside. Reachable.\n    *   (2,8): Inside. Reachable.\n    *   (8,2): Inside. Reachable.\n    *   (8,5): Inside. Reachable.\n    *   (8,8): Inside. Reachable.\n    *   **Total Count ($N$) = 5.**\n    *   Note: The 9s at (0,2), (0,8), (2,0), (3,10), (5,10), (7,10) are blocked by walls (Row 1, Col 1, Col 9). They remain unchanged.\n3.  **Update Grid:**\n    *   **Remove Absorbed 9s:** Change (2,2), (2,8), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8) to 7.\n    *   **Fill Green Box:** $N=5$. We fill the first 5 pixels of the box with 9s.\n        *   (4,4) -> 9\n        *   (4,5) -> 9\n        *   (4,6) -> 9\n        *   (5,4) -> 9\n        *   (5,5) -> 9 (Center overwrites 2)\n        *   Remaining pixels (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) retain their original values (3, 3, 3, 3). Note: (5,6) was 3.\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\n\n*   Row 2 becomes: `9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7` (Indices 2 and 8 changed to 7).\n*   Row 8 becomes: `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7` (Indices 2, 5, 8 changed to 7).\n*   Green Box (Rows 4-6, Cols 4-6):\n    *   Row 4: `9,9,9`\n    *   Row 5: `9,9,3`\n    *   Row 6: `3,3,3`\n\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,3,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Problem Breakdown and Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process. The user wants me to solve an ARC task where I need to take three example input-output pairs, analyze them, and apply the pattern I discover to a new test input. The problem looks like it's about transforming a grid, probably based on moving pixels with specific values.\n\nI'm starting by carefully examining the examples. I'm looking for consistent structures like patterns, symmetries, and any elements that remain fixed or changed predictably.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\nI noticed that the grid has a background color (7, orange), and a shape made of a specific color, magenta. Inside, there seems to be a central core of 3x3 cells. Sometimes there are random pixels (maroon) scattered around.\n\n*   **Initial Observation**: There's a rectangular frame made of color 6 (magenta) containing a 3x3 square of color 3 (green) with a central 2 (red). There is also a scattered background of color 9 (maroon) pixels.\n*   **Detailed Observation**: The 9s inside the frame changed to a mixture of 9s and 3s. The outer 9s remained. Rows 5-7 have some pattern inside the 6-frame. The output is where 9s have changed to some number inside the 6-frame.\n*   **Hypothesis**: The change is inside the frame. The input has 9s and they somehow \"move\" to the center of the 3x3 green box.\n\nI examined the input and output pixels. I also observed 9s (maroon) seem to move into the frame. Then I noted how there seems to be a frame around the central 3x3 box. Also, the 9 pixels seem to go into the green square.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n\nI noticed that I could find the position of the 9s relative to the center 3x3 box. I saw the same core, but the 9s had a bigger pattern. In Example 2, some of the 9s were inside the outer frame, some were outside. In Example 2 output, the entire 3x3 box turned to 9s. I noticed that the pixels outside of a certain range remain untouched in both the Example 1 and Example 2 output.\n\n*   **Observations**: In Example 2, all 9s within the \"6\" frame are \"absorbed\" into the central 3x3 area. The entire 3x3 block (including the center \"2\") transforms into 9s in the output. The pixels *outside* the 6-frame remain unchanged.\n*   **Deeper analysis**: The \"9\" pixels that move are somehow linked to the frame. I noticed that 9s outside the 6 frame were untouched, while 9s inside were absorbed to the central 3x3 area. I then noticed that some pixels changed into 9s. Then I checked how the pixels in the box in Example 2 were updated.\n*   **Hypothesis Update**: The 6 frame is the key to define some boundary. I theorized that pixels could only be altered if inside the central 3x3 box or a certain range or area to the box.\n\nI'm thinking now about a possible \"gravity\" effect: The 9s \"fall\" towards the central target (the 3x3 area) if the area around is \"empty\". Now, maybe they have to be enclosed or next to the box.\n\n**Example 3 Analysis:**\n\nThis example had no external frame. The 9s simply moved into the center. There was a direct relationship between *all* 9s and the central box. I also looked at the color values and how pixels were arranged. The frame 6 color was missing.\n\n*   **Observation**: Example 3 has no outer \"frame\", and *all* the 9s are absorbed into the central area. The central 3x3 box now contained all \"9\" pixels, even the center \"2\", completely erasing any trace of them outside of that box. The 9s were somehow getting absorbed in the 3x3 core.\n*   **Hypothesis**: Maybe the frame 6 is irrelevant?\n*   **New Hypothesis**: I have a theory that all the 9s will move and become part of the central 3x3. I will test this by looking at the input to the test case, and then applying the process.\n\n**Generalizing the Rule**\n\nI noticed now a filling order pattern in the box. Now, the main rule is:\n\n1.  Identify the 3x3 central target (with 3s and a 2 in the center).\n2.  Find *all* 9s\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on a pattern inferred from three examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n1.  **Identify the Target Container:**\n    In all examples, there is a central 3x3 block composed of green (3) pixels with a single red (2) pixel in the center.\n    - Example 1: Rows 4-6, Cols 4-6.\n    - Example 2: Rows 4-6, Cols 4-6.\n    - Example 3: Rows 4-6, Cols 4-6.\n    This 3x3 block acts as a \"container\" or \"collector\" for maroon (9) pixels.\n\n2.  **Identify Movable Objects (9s):**\n    The grid contains scattered maroon (9) pixels.\n    - In Example 1, the 9s *inside* the magenta (6) frame move to the target. The 9s *outside* the frame stay.\n    - In Example 2, the 9s that can reach the target (the frame is open at the bottom) move. 9 9s moved, completely filling the 3x3 container. The distant/isolated 9s stayed.\n    - In Example 3, there are no walls; all 9s move.\n\n    **Rule:** A maroon (9) pixel moves to the target container if and only if it is **accessible** to the target. Accessibility is defined by a path of non-wall pixels (where walls are magenta 6s) connecting the 9 to the 3x3 block.\n\n3.  **Transformation Process:**\n    - Count the number of accessible 9s, let's say $N$.\n    - The capacity of the 3x3 target container is 9 pixels.\n    - The first $N$ spots in the target container are filled with 9s. The filling order is standard reading order: Row 4 (Left to Right), then Row 5 (Left to Right), then Row 6 (Left to Right).\n    - If $N < 9$, the remaining spots in the target retain their original color (3 or 2).\n    - If $N \\ge 9$, the entire target becomes 9s (excess 9s disappear? In the examples, $N$ matches the moved count or fills the container, so we assume we just fill up to the limit).\n    - The accessible 9s in the original grid are replaced by the background color (7).\n    - Inaccessible 9s remain unchanged.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Locate Target:**\n    The 3x3 block of 3s and 2 is at Rows 4-6, Cols 4-6.\n\n2.  **Map Accessibility:**\n    - **Walls (6):** There is a solid wall at Row 1 (`6,6...`). There are vertical walls at Col 1 and Col 9 enclosing the center. There is a bottom wall at Row 9 (partial).\n    - **Accessible Zone:** The region bounded by Row 1, Col 1, Col 9, and Row 9 contains the target. The target itself is surrounded by partial 6s but has openings (e.g., at (3,5), (5,3), (5,7), (7,5)).\n    - **Scanning for 9s:**\n        - **Row 0:** `(0,2), (0,8)` are 9s. They are above the solid wall at Row 1. **Inaccessible**.\n        - **Row 2:** `(2,0)` is 9 (blocked by col 1 wall). `(2,2)` and `(2,8)` are 9s inside the main enclosure. **Accessible**.\n        - **Row 3:** `(3,10)` is 9 (outside col 9 wall). **Inaccessible**.\n        - **Row 5:** `(5,10)` is 9 (outside col 9 wall). **Inaccessible**.\n        - **Row 8:** `(8,2), (8,5), (8,8)` are 9s inside the enclosure. `(8,8)` connects via `(8,7)-(8,6)-(8,5)`. **Accessible**.\n    - **Accessible 9s Count:** 5 pixels at `(2,2), (2,8), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8)`.\n\n3.  **Construct Output:**\n    - **Move 9s:** Change the 5 accessible 9s at `(2,2), (2,8), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8)` to background `7`.\n    - **Fill Target:** Fill the first 5 spots of the 3x3 target with `9`.\n        - Spot 1 `(4,4)`: 3 -> 9\n        - Spot 2 `(4,5)`: 3 -> 9\n        - Spot 3 `(4,6)`: 3 -> 9\n        - Spot 4 `(5,4)`: 3 -> 9\n        - Spot 5 `(5,5)`: 2 -> 9\n    - **Remain:** The remaining 4 spots `(5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)` stay as `3`.\n    - **Inaccessible:** All other 9s `(0,2), (0,8), (2,0), (3,10), (5,10), ...` remain `9`.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,3,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6",

There are 9s scattered around the grid\n3. There's a boundary made of 6s forming a frame\n\n**Pattern Discovery:**\n- The 6s form a frame/boundary that encloses a region\n- 9s that are INSIDE the bounded region get \"collected\" and moved to fill the 3x3 pattern (replacing 3s)\n- 9s that are OUTSIDE the bounded region stay in place\n- The 3x3 fills from top-left, going left-to-right, top-to-bottom, skipping the center 2 until it needs to be filled\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n- The outer 6-boundary: Column 1 and column 9 form vertical edges, row 1 (full 6s) and row 9 (mostly 6s) form horizontal edges\n- Inside region: rows 2-8, columns 2-8\n\n**Finding 9s:**\n- Inside (will be removed): (2,2), (2,8), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8) = 5 nines\n- Outside (will stay): (0,2), (0,8), (2,0), (3,10), (5,10), (7,10) = 6 nines\n\n**Filling the 3x3 with 5 nines:**\nStarting from top-left, filling left-to-right, top-to-bottom, skipping center:\n- Position 1: (4,4) \u2192 9\n- Position 2: (4,5) \u2192 9  \n- Position 3: (4,6) \u2192 9\n- Position 4: (5,4) \u2192 9\n- Position 5: (5,6) \u2192 9 (skip center 2 at (5,5))\n\nThe 3x3 becomes: 9,9,9 / 9,2,9 / 3,3,3\n\n```\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,2,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n```",

The 3x3 fills with 9s starting from top-left in row-major order, skipping the center 2.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\nThe 3x3 pattern is at rows 4-6, cols 4-6.\n\nThe 6-border forms a frame with:\n- Top edge: row 1 (all 6s)\n- Left edge: col 1 \n- Right edge: col 9\n- Bottom: row 9\n\n9s inside the frame (rows 2-8, cols 2-8):\n- (2,2), (2,8), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8) \u2192 **5 nines absorbed**\n\n9s outside the frame that remain:\n- (0,2), (0,8), (2,0), (3,10), (5,10), (7,10)\n\nWith 5 absorbed 9s, I fill 5 cells in the 3x3 (skipping center):\n- (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6) \u2192 become 9\n\nThe absorbed 9s become 7s.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,2,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "First, I\u2019ll describe the pattern I inferred, then I\u2019ll show how I applied it to the test grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Structure common to all examples\n\nAll three training examples share these structural elements:\n\n- The grid is mostly background color `7`.\n- There is a unique **3\u00d73 block** of `3`s with a `2` in the center:\n\n  ```\n  3 3 3\n  3 2 3\n  3 3 3\n  ```\n\n- There are several `9`s scattered elsewhere.\n- In the output:\n  - Some `9`s disappear (turn into `7`).\n  - The 3\u00d73 block gets some of its cells turned into `9`s.\n  - The total count of `9`s in the whole grid is preserved.\n\nWithin the 3\u00d73 block, the cells that become `9` always start from the **top-left of the 3\u00d73 block** and are filled **row by row**:\n\nOrder inside the 3\u00d73 block:\n\n1. (top row) (r\u22121,c\u22121), (r\u22121,c), (r\u22121,c+1)\n2. (middle row) (r,  c\u22121), (r,  c), (r,  c+1)\n3. (bottom row) (r+1,c\u22121), (r+1,c), (r+1,c+1)\n\nwhere (r,c) is the position of the central `2`.\n\nSo, for a given integer K, you:\n- Take the first K cells of that list and paint them `9`.\n- Leave the rest as they are.\n\nThe examples differ in **how many** cells K they change inside the block:\n- Example 1: K = 2 (only two cells in the top row of the block)\n- Example 2: K = 9 (the entire 3\u00d73 block)\n- Example 3: K = 4 (top row 3 cells + one cell in second row)\n\nCrucially, the number K always equals the number of `9`s removed elsewhere.\n\nSo the transformation is:\n\n1. Select a certain subset of existing `9`s (the \u201cdonors\u201d), turn them to `7`.\n2. Use exactly that many new `9`s to fill cells inside the 3\u00d73 block in row-major order from its top-left.\n\nBecause the training tasks are few, and multiple donor-selection rules could fit, I used a **local neighborhood rule** to define donors:\n\n> A **donor 9** is a `9` that is \u201cenclosed\u201d vertically by the same non-9 color immediately above and below it (i.e. its up and down neighbors are equal and not `9`).  \n>  \n> In the test grid, extra donors also include 9s that are similarly enclosed horizontally.\n\nOnce donors are chosen:\n- Turn all donor `9`s into `7`.\n- Let K be the count of donor `9`s.\n- Fill the first K cells of the 3\u00d73 pattern (in row-major order) with `9`s.\n\nThis gives a consistent, deterministic way to:\n- Preserve the global count of 9s.\n- Move the \u201cmass\u201d of the 9s into the 3\u00d73 block.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Apply the rule to the test input\n\n### 2.1. Locate the 3\u00d73 (3,2,3) block\n\nTest input:\n\n```\n1: 6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n2: 6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n3: 9,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,7\n4: 7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n5: 7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n6: 7,6,7,7,3,2,3,7,7,6,9\n7: 7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n8: 7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n9: 7,6,9,7,7,9,7,7,9,6,7\n10:7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n11:7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n```\n\nThe special 3\u00d73 pattern:\n\nRows 5\u20137, cols 5\u20137:\n\n- Row 5: `3,3,3`\n- Row 6: `3,2,3`\n- Row 7: `3,3,3`\n\nSo the block is at (row, col) = (5\u20137, 5\u20137), center `2` at (6,6).\n\nRow-major order of its 9 candidate cells:\n\n1. (5,5)\n2. (5,6)\n3. (5,7)\n4. (6,5)\n5. (6,6)\n6. (6,7)\n7. (7,5)\n8. (7,6)\n9. (7,7)\n\n### 2.2. Find donor 9s\n\nList all 9s in the test grid:\n\n- Row 1: (1,3), (1,9)\n- Row 3: (3,1), (3,3), (3,9)\n- Row 4: (4,11)\n- Row 6: (6,11)\n- Row 8: (8,11)\n- Row 9: (9,3), (9,6), (9,9)\n\nCheck which are **enclosed** (above and below same non-9 color or left-right same non-9 color).\n\nFor each:\n\n- (4,11):\n  - Up: (3,11)=7\n  - Down: (5,11)=7\n  - Same and not 9 \u2192 donor.\n\n- (6,11):\n  - Up: (5,11)=7\n  - Down: (7,11)=7\n  - Donor.\n\n- (8,11):\n  - Up: (7,11)=7\n  - Down: (9,11)=7\n  - Donor.\n\n- (9,6):\n  - Left: (9,5)=7\n  - Right: (9,7)=7\n  - Donor.\n\n- (9,9):\n  - Up: (8,9)=7\n  - Down: (10,9)=7\n  - Donor.\n\nAll other 9s fail that enclosure test (their above/below or left/right are not equal or include another 9 or a 6), so we treat these five as donors.\n\nThus:\n- Number of donors K = 5.\n\n### 2.3. Remove donor 9s (turn them to 7)\n\nWe change:\n\n- (4,11): 9 \u2192 7\n- (6,11): 9 \u2192 7\n- (8,11): 9 \u2192 7\n- (9,6): 9 \u2192 7\n- (9,9): 9 \u2192 7\n\nSo rows 4, 6, 8, 9 change at those positions:\n\n- Row 4: from `7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9`\n  \u2192 `7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,7`\n\n- Row 6: from `7,6,7,7,3,2,3,7,7,6,9`\n  \u2192 (c11\u21927) later also we\u2019ll alter inside 3\u00d73\n\n- Row 8: from `7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9`\n  \u2192 `7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,7`\n\n- Row 9: from `7,6,9,7,7,9,7,7,9,6,7`\n  \u2192 `7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7`\n\n### 2.4.

        "Full raw LLM response": "To solve this task, I interpreted color `6` as an obstacle and considered all other colors as open. The unique `2` marks the center of the 3\u00d73 block of `3`s; those nine cells form the target cluster.\n\nI first found the connected component of open (non\u20116) cells that contains the `2` using 8\u2011neighbour connectivity. Only `9`s in this component can be moved. The number to move is the minimum of the number of accessible `9`s and the cluster capacity (nine cells).\n\nTo choose which accessible `9`s to move, I scanned the grid from the bottom row up to the first row that contains a `6`, left\u2011to\u2011right within each row, selecting accessible `9`s until the required count was reached. Since the first row already contains `6`, this pass covered all rows; no second pass was needed. The selected `9`s are set to `7`.\n\nFinally, I filled the cluster cells in row\u2011major order with `9` for as many as were moved; the remaining cluster cells stayed unchanged.\n\nApplying this to the test grid, six `9`s at positions (9,3),(9,6),(9,9),(3,1),(3,3),(3,9) are moved into the first six cluster cells, and the output grid becomes:\n\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6",

        "Full raw LLM response": "After analyzing the three given example pairs, I arrived at an interpretation that is consistent across them:\n\n- Look for any row that is entirely filled with the value\u202f6. If such a row exists, take the lowest such row and remove any\u202f9s from the row immediately above it; set those cells to\u202f7. The number of removed\u202f9s determines how many positions in the 3\u00d73 block containing the central\u202f2 will be filled with\u202f9s. Fill the block in row\u2011major order (top\u2011left first) with that many\u202f9s, overwriting existing\u202f3s/2 as needed. Leave all other cells unchanged.\n\n- If there is no row of all\u202f6s, remove\u202f9s starting from the bottom row upwards until either you have removed nine or there are no more\u202f9s. Within a row, take leftmost\u202f9s if only a subset is needed. The removed count again dictates how many positions in the 3\u00d73 block to overwrite with\u202f9s.\n\nIn the test grid there is a full row of\u202f6s at row\u202f2, so we remove the two\u202f9s from row\u202f1 (setting them to\u202f7) and place two\u202f9s into the top\u2011left of the 3\u00d73 block. All other cells stay as they are.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n\n```\n6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n9,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,9,9,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,3,2,3,7,7,6,9\n7,6,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,9\n7,6,9,7,7,9,7,7,9,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n```",
