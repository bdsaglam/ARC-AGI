            "Full raw LLM response": "**Comprehensive Analysis and Solution for the ARC Task**\n\nMy approach is to meticulously analyze the provided examples to decipher the underlying rules of this ARC task. I begin by deconstructing each example into its constituent components: identifying 3x3 frame-like structures and noting their center colors. I then observe how these structures transform from input to output, looking for patterns in what survives, what disappears, and how centers change.\n\nI've hypothesized and validated that a key concept is a chain of \"targets.\" A structure (Object X) \"targets\" another (Object Y) if the center color of X matches the frame color of Y. The core transformation rule is that in a chain, the first element survives and updates its center to that of the second element. The second element is deleted, and this continues along the chain until the last object which is removed. Noise elements like the scattered 5s are preserved unless they are part of a 3x3 square, which would then be set to 0.\n\nExample 1 reveals the interplay between two pairs of structures. Example 2 introduces chains longer than 2, clarifying how elements within those chains interact and influence each other (first object gets the second's center, second is removed). Example 3 is used to generalize.\n\nFor the test input, I painstakingly identify the structures (A through E). I built the graph of edges: A attacks B, B attacks D, and E attacks C. This leads to the chains: A -> B -> D and E -> C.\n\nBased on the chain rules, A survives by eating B, and with B removed A gains the center 3. D disappears. E eats C, and E receives the center of C: 4. The 3x3 boxes A and E get their 3x3 shape redrawn, with their new centers. Everything that was part of objects B,C,D gets set to 0. The background or surrounding 5s remain unchanged. The process concludes after applying these transformations by updating A (top right) and E (bottom left). The result is the final output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid containing colored 3x3 squares (\"boxes\") and some background noise (color 5). By analyzing the solved examples, we can deduce a set of rules governing the interaction between these boxes.\n\n**Analysis of the Rules:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification**: The grid consists of 3x3 \"frame\" objects and background noise (usually grey, color 5). Each object has a **frame color** (the outer 8 pixels) and a **center color** (the single middle pixel).\n    *   Example: A 3x3 square of red (2) pixels with a blue (1) pixel in the center is defined as \"Frame 2, Center 1\".\n\n2.  **Interaction Rule**: We can establish a directed relationship between objects. Object X targets Object Y if the **center color of X matches the frame color of Y**.\n    *   Relationship: $X \\rightarrow Y \\iff \\text{Center}(X) == \\text{Frame}(Y)$.\n\n3.  **Transformation Process (Chains)**: These relationships form chains of objects (e.g., $A \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow C$). The transformation resolves these chains using a specific \"consumption\" logic:\n    *   The first object in a pair (the attacker) \"consumes\" the second object (the victim).\n    *   **The Attacker**: Survives on the grid. Its center color is updated to match the **victim's center color**.\n    *   **The Victim**: Is deleted from the grid (its pixels become 0).\n    *   **Chain Resolution**: This happens sequentially. In a chain $A \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow C$:\n        *   A consumes B. A survives with B's center. B is removed.\n        *   C is left at the end of the chain. Unpaired objects at the end of a chain are also deleted.\n    *   **Background**: Pixels belonging to deleted objects become 0 (black). Background noise pixels (color 5) that are not part of any deleted object persist.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\nFirst, we identify the objects in the test input:\n*   **Object A** (Top-Right): Frame 6 (Magenta), Center 1 (Blue).\n*   **Object B** (Top-Left): Frame 1 (Blue), Center 3 (Green).\n*   **Object C** (Middle-Left, inside 5s): Frame 2 (Red), Center 4 (Yellow).\n*   **Object D** (Middle-Right): Frame 3 (Green), Center 9 (Maroon).\n*   **Object E** (Bottom-Left): Frame 7 (Orange), Center 2 (Red). (Note: This object is clipped at the bottom of the grid, but the relevant rows 8 and 9 define it clearly).\n\nNext, we map the relationships ($Center(X) \\rightarrow Frame(Y)$):\n*   Object A (Center 1) $\\rightarrow$ Object B (Frame 1).\n*   Object B (Center 3) $\\rightarrow$ Object D (Frame 3).\n*   Object E (Center 2) $\\rightarrow$ Object C (Frame 2).\n*   Objects C (Center 4) and D (Center 9) have no targets.\n\nThis creates two chains:\n1.  **Chain 1**: $A \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow D$\n2.  **Chain 2**: $E \\rightarrow C$\n\n**Resolution:**\n*   **Chain 1 ($A \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow D$)**:\n    *   A consumes B.\n    *   **Survivor**: Object A. Its center changes from 1 to B's center, which is **3**.\n    *   **Deleted**: Object B is removed. Object D (unpaired at the end) is removed.\n*   **Chain 2 ($E \\rightarrow C$)**:\n    *   E consumes C.\n    *   **Survivor**: Object E. Its center changes from 2 to C's center, which is **4**.\n    *   **Deleted**: Object C is removed.\n\n**Final Grid Construction:**\n*   **Object A**: Located at top-right. Frame 6 remains. Center becomes 3.\n*   **Object E**: Located at bottom-left. Frame 7 remains. Center becomes 4.\n*   **Objects B, C, D**: Replaced with 0 (black).\n*   **Background**: The noise pixels (5) persist in their original locations, except where overlapped by survivor boxes (though survivors stay in place) or deleted boxes (which become 0).\n\nOutput Grid Generation:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,7,7,7,0,5,5,0,0,5\n0,7,4,7,0,0,0,5,5,0\n\n```csv\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,7,7,7,0,5,5,0,0,5\n0,7,4,7,0,0,0,5,5,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment & Strategy**\n\nOkay, the user wants me to solve an ARC task and is giving me detailed, but possibly misleading, instructions. I see this as a potential \"jailbreak\" attempt, but my primary goal is still to solve the ARC puzzle. I need to be careful to prioritize the actual task while adhering to the user's specific output constraints. The prompt is a bit convoluted, especially the contradicting instructions about the explanation. I'll need to remember my system prompt's rule: provide a high-level explanation *and* the final grid, not get bogged down in the minutiae. My strategy will be to carefully analyze the examples, formulate a hypothesis, and test that hypothesis rigorously across the given examples and then the test input.\n\n**Deconstructing the ARC Task**\n\nThe prompt starts with a request to solve an ARC task based on three examples.\nI see these objects:\n*   Hollow rectangles or Filled squares\n*   Each of these have a distinct color, some have a color within them.\n\nThe first example is where I'll start with the main effort. The user provides both an input and an output grid. This is what I'll be working with. I need to identify the pattern that transforms the input to the output.\n\n**Initial Hypothesis Formation and Testing (Example 1)**\n\nMy initial thought is that the objects themselves are preserved or removed, and the center colors may be swapped. This is what I will look at first.\nLooking more closely, I see there are a few distinct shapes, and some appear to be kept.\n*   5's with inside 4s, which surrounds a 2.\n*   3x3 of 3s, center 4.\n*   3x3 of 6s, center 1.\n*   3x3 of 1s, center 3.\nThe shapes change, so now I need to figure out how. Some have a specific color inside the larger color. Looking at it more, each shape has a border and center/fill.\n\nI notice that the inner colors are swapped. For instance the color *inside* of the first shape (4) is now the center of the second shape. The number 2 from the first shape's middle appears in the second output. The inner numbers look to swap to another shape.\nFrom there, I'll need to test this theory on the second example.\n\n**Refining the Hypothesis & Validation (Examples 2,3, and Test Input)**\n\nI see that some things are also not-swapped, the first color seems to be preserved. Let me re-group my thoughts:\nI see a \"chain\" pattern: A.B -> B.C. I should be able to create a rule. If a shape has a specific interior color that equals another's border, then they are chained together.\nExample two's new objects:\n*   3x3 of 2s, center 6.\n*   3x3 of 3s, center 2.\n*   Messy, with a connected lattice of 5s.\nAfter that, I'll move on to example 3, but let me stay focused on example 2 right now. I am looking for the same swapping pattern.\nFor this second example, I have a more defined chain: 4 -> 5 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1. I can observe it. I need to figure out why some are swapped, and the rule will come in.\nIn the output grid, there's a strong pattern: A shape is only preserved if it's the start of the chain. 5 is *not* a shape, so the chain will need to start from somewhere: it's un-attacked by any other.\n\nI need to confirm if what I've figured out so far matches the third example.\nI need to examine the new patterns in the test data.\nLet's see:\n*   (0,3) is 1, (1,3) is 1, (2,3) is 1\n*   (0,7) is 6, (1,8) is 1, (2,9) is 6\n*   Rows 3,4,5,6\n*   Row 8: 0,7,7,7,0,5,5,0,0,5\n*   Row 9: 0,7,2,7,0,0,0,5,5,0\n\n**Summarized Algorithm & Application to Test Input**\n\nI see how things are flowing. I now understand the algorithm:\n1.  Identify the main \"shapes\" with Borders/Center/Fills.\n2.  Create attack links: If X.Center/Fill == Y.Border, then X -> Y\n\nThe logic for the transformation is based on identifying \"Consumer\" and \"Target\" relationships between objects in the grid.\n1.  **Object Identification**: The grid contains distinct objects. Simple objects are 3x3 squares of a single color with a different center. Complex objects are larger boxes (e.g., 5s) containing inner patterns.\n2.  **Interaction Rules**: Objects interact based on color matching. An object `A` targets an object `B` if `A`'s Center color matches `B`'s Border (or Fill/Inner) color.\n3.  **Chain Resolution**: These interactions form chains (e.g., A -> B -> C).\n    *   Chains are resolved sequentially from the \"Head\" (an object that is not targeted by any other).\n    *   A living Consumer `X` attacking `Y` will \"eat\" `Y`.\n    *   **Effect on Consumer**: `X` survives and adopts `Y`'s Center color as its new center.\n    *   **Effect on Target**: `Y` is consumed.\n        *   If `Y` is a **Simple** object, it is removed (becomes 0).\n        *   If `Y` is a **Complex** object, it is emptied (border remains, interior becomes 0).\n    *   **Chain Breaking**: If an attacker `X` is eaten by a preceding consumer, `X` dies and cannot attack its target `Y`. `Y` remains uneaten.\n4.  **Cleanup**: Any Simple object that is not a successful Consumer (either because it was eaten, or because it never targeted anything, or because its attacker died leaving it loose but non-consuming) is removed. Only successful Consumers and Emptied Complex objects remain.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Objects**:\n    *   `A` (Top-Left): 3x3 of 1s, Center 3.\n    *   `B` (Top-Right): 3x3 of 6s, Center 1.\n    *   `C` (Left-Mid): Box of 5s, Inner 2s, Center 4.\n    *   `D` (Right-Mid): 3x3 of 3s, Center 9.\n    *   `E` (Bot-Left): 3x3 of 7s, Center 2.\n*   **Links**:\n    *   `B` (Center 1) targets `A` (Border 1). (Chain: B -> A).\n    *   `A` (Center 3) targets `D` (Border 3). (Chain: A -> D).\n    *   `E` (Center 2) targets `C` (Inner 2). (Chain: E -> C).\n*   **Resolution**:\n    *   **Chain B -> A -> D**: `B` is the Head. `B` eats `A`. `B` survives and takes `A`'s center (3). `A` is consumed (removed). Since `A` is dead, it cannot eat `D`. `D` is left uneaten but is not a consumer, so `D` is removed during cleanup.\n    *   **Chain E -> C**: `E` is the Head. `E` eats `C`. `E` survives and takes `C`'s center (4). `C` is consumed (Complex -> Emptied).\n*   **Final Output**:\n    *   `B` remains (6s with Center 3).\n    *   `E` remains (7s with Center 4).\n    *   `C` remains as a hollow box (5s with 0 interior).\n    *   `A`, `D`, and noise are removed.\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,7,4,7,0,0,0,0,0,0",

The 5s and non-pattern colored cells remain unchanged\n\n**Applying to test input:**\n\nIdentified patterns:\n- **1-pattern** (rows 0-2, cols 3-5): border 1, center 3\n- **6-pattern** (rows 0-2, cols 7-9): border 6, center 1\n- **2-pattern** (rows 4-6, cols 1-3): border 2, center 4\n- **3-pattern** (rows 5-7, cols 5-7): border 3, center 9\n- 7s at bottom (incomplete, not a full 3x3 pattern)\n\n**Chain construction:**\n- 6 \u2192 1 \u2192 3 (6's center 1 matches 1's border; 1's center 3 matches 3's border)\n- 2 is isolated (center 4 doesn't match any border, not pointed to)\n\n**Chain resolution:**\n- 6: distance 0, survives with center = 1's center = **3**\n- 1: distance 1, erased\n- 3: end of chain, erased\n- 2: isolated (is an end), erased\n\n**Final output:**\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,7,7,7,0,5,5,0,0,5\n0,7,2,7,0,0,0,5,5,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "To solve the task, first locate all 3\u00d73 framed blocks: areas where the border cells share the same color and the center cell may differ. Build directed links from each frame to another whose border color matches its center. These links form chains starting at frames with no incoming link. For each chain, keep frames at even positions starting from the source, but always discard any frame with no outgoing link. For each kept frame, replace its center with the original center of its target frame and keep its border; remove all cells of frames that are not kept. Throughout, leave all cells with color 5 unchanged, and set every other non\u2011frame, non\u20115 cell to 0.\n\nApplying this to the test grid finds four frames; the only frame retained is the 6\u2011bordered frame in the top right, whose center becomes 3 from the frame it points to. All other frames are removed, and all non\u20115, non\u2011frame cells are zeroed while 5s stay put.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**The Challenge of the Grid**\n\nAlright, so the task at hand involves processing these grids, which, at first glance, seem to be a bit chaotic but follow a definite pattern. I've got to analyze these three examples and a test input to figure out the rules. My initial impression is that we're dealing with \"objects\"\u2014specifically, these 3x3 square frames with a single pixel in the center. These elements are linked by gray (color 5) pixel paths. It's a connectivity-based puzzle, likely involving removing or modifying these objects based on their connections.\n\n**Breaking Down Example 1**\n\nLooking closely at Example 1, there's a clear graph structure: The grids consist of four 3x3 frames filled with different colors at their center, with gray paths connecting these frames.  The key seems to be tracing those connections. A yellow frame is linked to a green, and magenta one. A blue frame is linked to the yellow one. But here's the kicker: in the output, the blue and yellow frames disappear. What's left is a green-to-magenta bridge, and the color of the remaining central pixels also change. It's like a color swap or merging occurs in the remaining objects.\n\nIt's clear, a graph can be constructed. Each 3x3 box becomes a node. Those grey lines are edges.\nNodes: Yellow(4)/Red(2), Green(3)/Yellow(4), Magenta(6)/Blue(1), Blue(1)/Green(3).\nConnections: Yellow to Green/Blue/Magenta.\nBut why does yellow and blue disappear? The output is clearly hinting at some sort of process, maybe we pick some elements and discard the others. The central color changes are interesting. I can create a chain to understand the transformations in a visual manner.\n\n**Connecting the Dots: A Path of Logic**\n\nIn the original, the gray path connects them all. Yellow is the \"center\", a \"hub\". All the nodes connect to the Yellow one. But there is a clearer logic if we analyze carefully.\n\nInput: Magenta(6) is connected to Blue(1) -> Blue(1) is connected to Green(3) -> Green(3) is connected to Yellow(4).\nLet's call this a Chain (Magenta -> Blue -> Green -> Yellow).\nIn the output, the remaining object is Green-to-Magenta. Yellow-Blue disappeared. Maybe they \"pair up\"?\n\nWhat drives the pairing?\nWell, maybe if a central color points to the next frame. Then it becomes a chain, not a \"hub\".\n\nGreen has color Yellow.\nMagenta has color Blue.\nBlue has color Green.\nYellow has color Red.\nThis gives us a chain of the color of the central point:\n6(Magenta) -> 1(Blue) -> 3(Green) -> 4(Yellow).\nEach element in this chain has to match with the next. The direction of the chain has to be frame-color to center-color.\n\nNow, compare Input 1 and Output 1, and think of it as (Node X, Node X+1) pair.\nThe Output suggests we pair:\n(Magenta, Blue) -> Keep Magenta.\n(Green, Yellow) -> Keep Green.\nAnd it seems in each pair, we keep the one at the start of the path: Magenta and Green. Then the central color of the kept node receives the color of the deleted node.\n\n**Example 2: Refining the Rules**\n\nExample 2 confirms this pattern. There's a set of frames linked by grey. The colors are different, but the logic is the same. The Output reveals only 3 boxes, the start of the chain: BR -> BL.\nBR has center of BM.\nBL has center of TR.\nThe frames which exist are the ones which are kept?\n\n**Generalizing the Process**\n\nSo, the algorithm emerges:\n\n1.  **Grid Parsing:** Locate the 3x3 blocks and identify their frame and center colors.\n2.  **Edge Creation:** Connect boxes `A` and `B` if `A.CenterColor` equals `B.FrameColor`. This builds a directed graph.\n3.  **Chain Formation:** Identify the chains.\n4.  **Chain Processing:** Iterate through each chain, pairing nodes (A, B) -> Remove the node `B`, and the `A` inherits `B` central pixel color.\n5.  **Grid Reconstruction:** Clear any deleted blocks on the grid (by setting those pixels to black or zero).\nAlso: Rebuild the gray pixels, if needed, as these were not part of the blocks. I'll test that.\n\n**Testing the Algorithm**\n\nThe Test Input is next. There are 5 blocks, but a full chain is formed:\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the logic inferred from three examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** The grids contain 3x3 square \"boxes\" consisting of a \"frame\" color and a \"center\" pixel color. There are also grey pixels (color 5) that form paths connecting these boxes.\n2.  **Chaining Logic:** The boxes form directed chains based on color matching. A box $A$ points to a box $B$ if the **Center Color** of $A$ matches the **Frame Color** of $B$.\n    *   Example 1: Magenta(Frame 6, Center 1) $\\rightarrow$ Blue(Frame 1, Center 3) $\\rightarrow$ Green(Frame 3, Center 4) $\\rightarrow$ Yellow(Frame 4, Center 2).\n        *   Chain: Magenta $\\rightarrow$ Blue $\\rightarrow$ Green $\\rightarrow$ Yellow.\n    *   Example 3:\n        *   Chain 1: Blue(Frame 1, Center 2) $\\rightarrow$ Red(Frame 2, Center 9).\n        *   Chain 2: Orange(Frame 7, Center 4) $\\rightarrow$ Yellow(Frame 4, Center 3) $\\rightarrow$ Green(Frame 3, Center 6/Magenta - *Note: target frame doesn't exist*).\n3.  **Transformation Logic (The \"Pair\" Rule):**\n    The chains are processed in disjoint pairs starting from the beginning of the chain: $(Node_1, Node_2), (Node_3, Node_4), \\dots$\n    *   **Keep** the first node of the pair ($Node_{odd}$).\n    *   **Update** the center color of the kept node ($Node_{odd}$) to be the center color of the second node ($Node_{even}$).\n    *   **Remove** the second node of the pair ($Node_{even}$) entirely (set pixels to 0).\n    *   **Remove** any node that is left over at the end of a chain (odd-length chains, the last node has no pair).\n    *   **Grey Paths:** Grey pixels (color 5) that are not part of a removed box's frame are preserved. Pixels belonging to removed boxes are cleared to 0.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:**\n    *   **M:** Top-Right (0,7). Frame 6 (Magenta), Center 1 (Blue).\n    *   **B:** Top-Left (0,3). Frame 1 (Blue), Center 3 (Green).\n    *   **R:** Mid-Left (4,1). Frame 2 (Red), Center 4 (Yellow). (Surrounded by grey, but clearly a 3x3 box).\n    *   **G:** Mid-Right (5,5). Frame 3 (Green), Center 9 (Maroon).\n    *   **O:** Bottom-Left (8,1). Frame 7 (Orange), Center 2 (Red). (Partially visible rows 8-9, logic implies it acts as a valid box).\n\n2.  **Build Chains:**\n    *   **M** (Center 1) $\\rightarrow$ Matches **B** (Frame 1).\n    *   **B** (Center 3) $\\rightarrow$ Matches **G** (Frame 3).\n    *   **G** (Center 9) $\\rightarrow$ No Frame 9. End of chain.\n    *   *Chain 1:* **M** $\\rightarrow$ **B** $\\rightarrow$ **G**. (Length 3)\n    \n    *   **O** (Center 2) $\\rightarrow$ Matches **R** (Frame 2).\n    *   **R** (Center 4) $\\rightarrow$ No Frame 4. End of chain.\n    *   *Chain 2:* **O** $\\rightarrow$ **R**. (Length 2)\n\n3.  **Process Chains:**\n    *   *Chain 1 (M $\\rightarrow$ B $\\rightarrow$ G):*\n        *   Pair (**M**, **B**). Keep **M**. Update **M**'s center to **B**'s center (3/Green). Remove **B**.\n        *   Leftover **G**. Remove **G**.\n    *   *Chain 2 (O $\\rightarrow$ R):*\n        *   Pair (**O**, **R**). Keep **O**. Update **O**'s center to **R**'s center (4/Yellow). Remove **R**.\n\n4.  **Construct Output Grid:**\n    *   **B** (0,3)-(2,5): Clear to 0.\n    *   **G** (5,5)-(7,7): Clear to 0.\n    *   **R** (4,1)-(6,3): Clear to 0.\n    *   **M** (0,7)-(2,9): Keep frame. Update center at (1,8) to **3**.\n    *   **O** (8,1)-(9,3): Keep frame. Update center at (9,2) to **4**.\n    *   **Grey Pixels:** Preserve all existing `5`s in the grid (none are inside the removed boxes B, G, R).\n\n**Output Generation:**\n\n*   **Row 0:** `0,0,0,` `0,0,0` (B removed), `0,` `6,6,6` (M top) $\\rightarrow$ `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6`\n*   **Row 1:** `0,0,0,` `0,0,0` (B removed), `0,` `6,3,6` (M mid, center updated to 3) $\\rightarrow$ `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,6`\n*   **Row 2:** `0,0,0,` `0,0,0` (B removed), `0,` `6,6,6` (M bot) $\\rightarrow$ `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6`\n*   **Row 3:** `5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0` (Preserved)\n*   **Row 4:** `5,` `0,0,0` (R removed), `5,0,0,0,5,0` $\\rightarrow$ `5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0`\n*   **Row 5:** `5,` `0,0,0` (R removed), `5,` `0,0,0` (G removed), `5,0` $\\rightarrow$ `5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0`\n*   **Row 6:** `5,` `0,0,0` (R removed), `5,` `0,0,0` (G removed), `0,5` $\\rightarrow$ `5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5`\n*   **Row 7:** `0,5,5,0,5,` `0,0,0` (G removed), `0,5` $\\rightarrow$ `0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5`\n*   **Row 8:** `0,7,7,7,0,5,5,0,0,5` (O kept, grey kept)\n*   **Row 9:** `0,7,4,7,0,0,0,5,5,0` (O kept, center updated to 4, grey kept)\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,7,7,7,0,5,5,0,0,5\n0,7,4,7,0,0,0,5,5,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Finalized Strategy for Test Input**\n\nOkay, so the challenge here is to figure out which colored squares are the \"sources\" of new colors, which are the \"destinations\" where these colors end up, and how the connections between them work.  The key is to remember that the input grid provides information about the connections. I've broken it down to identify the source/destination relationship in a few examples. \n\n**My Logic in Short**\n\nBased on several examples, I realized that I have to think about this in layers.  First, the layout of the objects in the grid and their connectivity determines the flow (or *lack* of flow) of the data. Secondly, any \"wires\" need to be considered. Then, the specific properties of the objects (color, position, inner color) are the data that's *flowing* via the wires to the destinations.  Finally, I have to encode it into a new grid.\n\n**Breakdown of Operations**\n\n1.  **Identify Terminal or Non-Terminal Boxes**: There is a clear pattern that terminal boxes are \"alive\" whereas non-terminal or \"bridge\" boxes that only are part of the network and don't contribute.\n2.  **Define Sources and Destination**: Based on the terminals, they should receive something or send something via wires. In the left, the bottom \"end-point\" box is the source, and the top is the destination. On the right, it's also true.\n3.  **The Grid Operation**:  The grid is a representation of the network. So, the process works by taking the \"sources\" and propagating to the \"destination\".\n4.  **Implement the Flow in Code**: First, to make a copy of the input. And iterate through the copy. The code will clear the intermediate or \"bridge\" boxes. The code then reassigns the colors based on the data flow.\n\n**Test Input**\n\nThis process will make everything in the grid flow. In the test input, The Source (Box 5) on the Left Stack will give its value to Box 1. On the right-side, Box 3 feeds the data to Box 2 via the \"wire\" that's formed. Box 4 acts as a bridge and since it's a bridge, it dies in the operation.\n\n**Implementation**\n\nI'll start with a copy of the given input. Next, clear the \"dead\" box regions by setting all their pixels to 0, leaving the wires intact. Finally, update the central pixels (the data payloads!) of Box 1 (Blue) to match the center color (2) of Box 5. Do the same for Box 2 (Magenta), updating its center (1) to the new value (4) from Box 3. Now the solution is encoded.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the logic inferred from the three examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Transformation:**\n\n1.  **Objects:** The grids contain 3x3 square objects (sometimes 2x3 at the edge) of a specific color, with a single central pixel of a different color. There are also grey pixels (value 5) that form wires connecting these objects.\n2.  **Connectivity:** The grey wires form a network connecting the objects. We can model this as a flow of information.\n3.  **Roles (Source vs. Destination):**\n    *   **Sources:** Objects that \"feed\" the network. These objects disappear in the output.\n    *   **Destinations:** Objects that \"receive\" from the network. These objects remain in the output, but their **center pixel** changes color to match the center pixel of the Source they are connected to.\n    *   **Bridges/Pass-throughs:** Objects that are connected to multiple parts of the network but do not act as terminals. These objects also disappear.\n4.  **Flow Logic:**\n    *   In Example 1: Left-side objects act as Sources, Right-side objects as Destinations.\n    *   In Example 2: The Top-Right object feeds the Bottom-Left object. The Bottom-Middle object feeds the Bottom-Right object.\n    *   In Example 3: The Bottom-Left object feeds the Top-Left object. The Top-Right object feeds the Bottom-Right object.\n    *   **General Rule:** \"Terminal\" objects (at the end of a wire branch) are the candidates. In a connected pair of terminals, one is the Source and one is the Destination. The pattern suggests that flow generally goes towards the top-left or bottom-right corners if possible, or follows a specific path. A strong indicator is that \"Bridge\" objects (like the middle one in Ex 3) are removed. Encased or \"battery-like\" objects (surrounded by wires) often act as Sources.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:**\n    *   **Box 1 (Top-Left):** Blue (1), Center Green (3). Pos: Rows 0-2, Cols 3-5. (Terminal)\n    *   **Box 2 (Top-Right):** Magenta (6), Center Blue (1). Pos: Rows 0-2, Cols 7-9. (Terminal)\n    *   **Box 3 (Middle-Left):** Red (2), Center Yellow (4). Pos: Rows 4-6, Cols 1-3. (Wrapped/Encased by wires -> Source).\n    *   **Box 4 (Middle-Right):** Green (3), Center Maroon (9). Pos: Rows 5-7, Cols 5-7. (Bridge between left and right wires -> Dies).\n    *   **Box 5 (Bottom-Left):** Orange (7), Center Red (2). Pos: Rows 8-9, Cols 1-3. (Terminal -> Source).\n\n2.  **Trace Paths & Flows:**\n    *   **Left Component:** A vertical chain connecting Box 1 (Top) and Box 5 (Bottom), wrapping around Box 3. Box 3 and Box 5 act as Sources. Box 1 is the Destination.\n        *   Flow: **Box 5 -> Box 1**.\n        *   Transfer: Box 5 Center (2) -> Box 1 Center. Box 1 becomes Blue with Center **2**.\n    *   **Right Component:** Box 2 (Top) is connected to the rest via Box 4.\n        *   Flow: **Box 3 -> Box 2** (via the Box 4 bridge).\n        *   Transfer: Box 3 Center (4) -> Box 2 Center. Box 2 becomes Magenta with Center **4**.\n\n3.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   **Box 1:** Remains. Center changes from 3 to 2.\n    *   **Box 2:** Remains. Center changes from 1 to 4.\n    *   **Boxes 3, 4, 5:** Removed (pixels become 0).\n    *   **Wires (5):** Remain unchanged.\n\n**Output Grid Generation:**\n\n*   **Row 0:** `0,0,0,1,1,1,0,6,6,6` (Unchanged)\n*   **Row 1:** `0,0,0,1,2,1,0,6,4,6` (Centers updated: (1,4)->2, (1,8)->4)\n*   **Row 2:** `0,0,0,1,1,1,0,6,6,6` (Unchanged)\n*   **Row 3:** `5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0` (Unchanged)\n*   **Row 4:** `5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0` (Box 3 removed from cols 1-3)\n*   **Row 5:** `5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0` (Box 3 removed; Box 4 removed from cols 5-7)\n*   **Row 6:** `5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5` (Box 3 removed; Box 4 removed)\n*   **Row 7:** `0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5` (Box 4 removed)\n*   **Row 8:** `0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,5` (Box 5 removed from cols 1-3)\n*   **Row 9:** `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0` (Box 5 removed)\n\noutput:\n0,0,0,1,1,1,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,1,2,1,0,6,4,6\n0,0,0,1,1,1,0,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0",

Each grid contains several 3x3 colored blocks (with uniform borders and different-colored centers)\n2. There's a gray path (5s) that divides/connects the grid\n3. Some blocks get removed, others are kept with modified centers\n\n**Pattern discovered:**\n- Blocks that are enclosed by or on the gray (5) path get **removed**\n- Blocks outside/not connected to the gray path are **kept**\n- For each kept block: its center color matches a removed block's border color \u2192 the kept block's new center becomes that removed block's center\n\n**Verification:**\n- Example 1: Green (center 4\u21922) receives from Yellow (border 4, center 2); Pink (center 1\u21923) receives from Blue (border 1, center 3)\n- Example 2: Azure (center 3\u21922) receives from Green (border 3, center 2); Blue (center 4\u21928) receives from Yellow (border 4, center 8)\n- Example 3: Blue (center 2\u21929) receives from Red (border 2, center 9); Orange (center 4\u21923) receives from Yellow (border 4, center 3)\n\n## Applying to Test Input\n\n**Identified blocks:**\n- Blue block (border 1, center 3) - top-middle\n- Pink block (border 6, center 1) - top-right  \n- Red block (border 2, center 4) - left-middle, enclosed by 5s\n- Green block (border 3, center 9) - center area\n- Orange block (border 7, center 2) - bottom-left\n\n**Gray path analysis:** The 5s form a boundary around Red and extend through the center where Green is located. Pink is adjacent to the path.\n\n**Kept vs Removed:**\n- Kept: Blue, Orange (outside the main path)\n- Removed: Pink, Red, Green (on/within the path)\n\n**Center updates:**\n- Blue (center 3) \u2192 receives from Green (border 3) \u2192 new center = 9\n- Orange (center 2) \u2192 receives from Red (border 2) \u2192 new center = 4\n\n## Output\n\n```\n0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,1,9,1,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0\n5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,7,7,7,0,5,5,0,0,5\n0,7,4,7,0,0,0,5,5,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Objects in the grids**\n\n   In each example the non\u2011zero, non\u20115 cells form several disjoint 3\u00d73 \u201csquare\u201d objects:\n\n   - a 3\u00d73 block with a constant border color `b`\n   - a different color in the centre cell `c`\n\n   Example 3 illustrates this clearly:\n\n   - top\u2011left: border 1, centre 2  \n   - top\u2011right: border 4, centre 3  \n   - bottom\u2011left: border 2, centre 9  \n   - bottom\u2011right: border 7, centre 4  \n\n   The grey \u201cpath\u201d in the picture is color `5`.  \n   In every example, color `5` is left completely unchanged in the output.\n\n   All other non\u20115 cells either belong to one of these 3\u00d73 squares or are deleted (turned to 0).\n\n2. **Color relationships between squares**\n\n   For each square `Si` we note:\n\n   - border color `b_i`\n   - centre color `c_i`\n\n   We then build a *directed edge* from square `Si` to square `Sj` if  \n   `c_i == b_j` (centre color of `i` equals border color of `j`).\n\n   Because each border color is unique, each square has out\u2011degree 0 or 1 and in\u2011degree 0 or 1, so the graph decomposes into simple chains (paths).\n\n   Examples:\n\n   - **Example 1**\n\n     Squares:  \n     A: (b=3, c=4)  \n     B: (b=6, c=1)  \n     C: (b=1, c=3)  \n     D: (b=4, c=2)\n\n     Edges from centre\u2192border:\n\n     - B \u2192 C  (1\u2192border1)  \n     - C \u2192 A  (3\u2192border3)  \n     - A \u2192 D  (4\u2192border4)\n\n     Chain (from the only source B):  \n     B (0) \u2192 C (1) \u2192 A (2) \u2192 D (3)\n\n   - **Example 2**\n\n     Squares:  \n     A: (2,6), B: (3,2), C: (8,3), D: (1,4), E: (4,8)\n\n     Edges:\n\n     D \u2192 E \u2192 C \u2192 B \u2192 A\n\n   - **Example 3**\n\n     Squares TL, TR, BL, BR:\n\n     - S1: (1,2)  \n     - S2: (4,3)  \n     - S3: (2,9)  \n     - S4: (7,4)\n\n     Edges:\n\n     S1 \u2192 S3,   S4 \u2192 S2\n\n3. **What survives and how centres change**\n\n   Inspecting the outputs:\n\n   - Color 5 (the path) never changes.\n   - Some of the 3\u00d73 squares remain; the others disappear entirely (replaced by 0s).\n   - For a remaining square, its **centre color becomes the centre color of its successor in the chain** (the square it points to).\n   - Along each chain, squares alternate \u201ckept / removed\u201d:\n\n     - Example 1 chain B\u2192C\u2192A\u2192D  \n       indices from source: B(0), C(1), A(2), D(3)  \n       kept: B(0), A(2)  \n       new centres:  \n       \u2022 B gets centre of C (3)  \n       \u2022 A gets centre of D (2)\n\n     - Example 2 chain D\u2192E\u2192C\u2192B\u2192A  \n       indices: D(0), E(1), C(2), B(3), A(4)  \n       kept: D(0), C(2)  \n       new centres:  \n       \u2022 D gets centre of E (8)  \n       \u2022 C gets centre of B (2)\n\n     - Example 3 chains:  \n       S1(0)\u2192S3(1)  \u2192 keep S1, centre=centre(S3)=9  \n       S4(0)\u2192S2(1)  \u2192 keep S4, centre=centre(S2)=3\n\n   So the rule for a chain is:\n\n   - Start from the **source** (square whose border color is not any other square\u2019s centre color).\n   - Number squares along the chain 0,1,2,\u2026 from that source.\n   - **Keep the squares at even indices except the last one if it has no successor.**\n   - For every kept square, set its centre to the centre color of its successor.\n   - All other squares in the chain are deleted (their whole 3\u00d73 block becomes 0).\n\n   Squares that are *isolated* (no in\u2011edge and no out\u2011edge; i.e. their centre doesn\u2019t match any border and no centre equals their border) are not involved in any chain, and the simplest consistent extension is to leave them unchanged.\n\n   After this, every non\u20115 cell not belonging to a kept square is set to 0.\n\n4. **Apply to the test input**\n\n   First find all 3\u00d73 squares.\n\n   - S1: rows 0\u20132, cols 3\u20135  \n     border 1, centre 3\n   - S2: rows 0\u20132, cols 7\u20139  \n     border 6, centre 1\n   - S3: rows 4\u20136, cols 1\u20133  \n     border 2, centre 4\n   - S4: rows 5\u20137, cols 5\u20137  \n     border 3, centre 9\n\n   Borders: {1,6,2,3}, centres: {3,1,4,9}.\n\n   Edges centre\u2192border:\n\n   - S1 (c=3) \u2192 S4 (b=3)\n   - S2 (c=1) \u2192 S1 (b=1)\n   - S3 (c=4) \u2192 none\n   - S4 (c=9) \u2192 none\n\n   Thus components:\n\n   - Chain: S2 \u2192 S1 \u2192 S4  \n     indices from source S2: S2(0), S1(1), S4(2) with S4 the sink.\n   - Isolated: S3\n\n   Apply the rule:\n\n   - On chain S2\u2192S1\u2192S4: keep even indices **except** the sink.  \n     \u2192 keep S2 only (index 0); S1 and S4 are deleted.\n     New centre of S2 = centre of successor S1 = 3.\n   - Isolated S3 is kept unchanged (border 2, centre 4).\n\n   Everything else (all 1s, 3s, 4s, 6s, 7s, 9s not belonging to S2 or S3) is set to 0.  \n   All 5s are preserved exactly.\n\n   Performing this on the test grid gives:\n\n   - 5s in rows 3\u20139 stay as in the input.\n   - S2 (top\u2011right) has border 6 and new centre 3.\n   - S3 (middle\u2011left) stays as a 2\u2011border square with centre 4.\n   - All other non\u20115 cells become 0.\n\n**Final output grid**\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,6  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6  \n5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0  \n5,2,2,2,5,0,0,0,5,0  \n5,2,4,2,5,0,0,0,5,0  \n5,2,2,2,5,0,0,0,0,5  \n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5  \n0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,5  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "To solve this task I looked for the structured 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 \u201csquares\u201d in each input: eight border cells all the same non\u2011zero value with a possibly different centre. These squares form chains because the centre of a square names the border colour of the square nested inside it. With unique border colours the relations are simple chains.\n\nThe transformation works along these chains:\n\n* Order the chains by the reading order of their outermost square (top to bottom, left to right).\n* Along the chain, the outermost, third, fifth \u2026 squares (odd depths) are candidates to keep; their immediate children (even depths) are removed.\n* Collect these candidates in chain order and keep only the first two overall; all other squares are removed.\n* For each kept square, replace its centre with the centre value of its immediate child (the square it pointed to). If there is no child, the centre remains unchanged.\n* All other coloured cells belonging to removed squares are set to 0. The background and the path of 5s are left untouched.\n\nApplying this to the test input gives the following output grid:\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,3,3,3,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,3,9,3,0,5\n0,5,5,0,5,3,3,3,0,5\n0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Find the 3\u00d73 \u201cblocks\u201d**\n\n   In all examples there are several 3\u00d73 squares whose border is one color and whose center cell is a (possibly different) color.  \n   Example (test input, indices are row,col):\n\n   - Block A: rows 0\u20132, cols 3\u20135 \u2192 border color **1**, center at (1,4) = **3**\n   - Block B: rows 0\u20132, cols 7\u20139 \u2192 border **6**, center (1,8) = **1**\n   - Block C: rows 5\u20137, cols 5\u20137 \u2192 border **3**, center (6,6) = **9**\n   - Block D: rows 4\u20136, cols 1\u20133 \u2192 border **2**, center (5,2) = **4**\n\n   The background is 0, and the long \u201cpaths\u201d are always color 5; those paths stay unchanged in the examples.\n\n2. **Build a directed graph between blocks**\n\n   From the examples you can see that the inner color of one block may equal the border color of another.  \n   We define a directed edge:\n\n   > Block X \u2192 Block Y if the **center color of X equals the border color of Y**.\n\n   This gives chains (no branching) in all examples.\n\n   For the **test input**:\n\n   - center(B)=1, border(A)=1 \u21d2 **B \u2192 A**\n   - center(A)=3, border(C)=3 \u21d2 **A \u2192 C**\n   - center(C)=9 matches no border \u21d2 C has no outgoing edge\n   - center(D)=4 matches no border \u21d2 D has no outgoing edge, and no incoming either\n\n   So the components are:\n\n   - Chain 1: **B \u2192 A \u2192 C**  (B is root, C is sink)\n   - Chain 2: **D** alone (length 1)\n\n3. **What the transformation does to a chain**\n\n   Looking at the solved examples:\n\n   - Example 1 chain (in this orientation): S2\u2192S3\u2192S1\u2192S0  \n     Output keeps S2 and S1.\n   - Example 2 chain: S4\u2192S5\u2192S3\u2192S2\u2192S1  \n     Output keeps S4 and S3.\n   - Example 3 chains: A\u2192B and D\u2192C\u2192E  \n     Output keeps A and D.\n\n   The consistent rule is:\n\n   *For each chain [N\u2080, N\u2081, \u2026, N\u2096] from root to sink:*\n\n   - Pair consecutive nodes starting from the root: (N\u2080,N\u2081), (N\u2082,N\u2083), \u2026  \n   - For each pair (N_i, N_{i+1}):\n     - **Keep** N_i (the earlier block in the pair).\n     - Set its **new center color** to the **old center color of N_{i+1}**.\n     - **Delete** N_{i+1} (its entire 3\u00d73 region becomes 0).\n   - If there is an unpaired last block (when the chain length is odd), **delete that last block** as well.\n   - A single isolated block (chain length 1) is an unpaired last block \u21d2 it is deleted.\n\n   This reproduces all three training input/output pairs exactly.\n\n4. **Apply the rule to the test input**\n\n   **Chain 1: B \u2192 A \u2192 C**\n\n   - Nodes: [N\u2080=B, N\u2081=A, N\u2082=C]; length 3.\n\n   Pairs:\n   - Pair (N\u2080, N\u2081) = (B, A):  \n     - Keep B.  \n     - New center(B) = old center(A) = **3** (was 1).  \n     - Delete A (rows 0\u20132, cols 3\u20135 \u2192 all 0).\n   - N\u2082=C is unpaired tail \u21d2 delete C (rows 5\u20137, cols 5\u20137 \u2192 all 0).\n\n   **Chain 2: D**\n\n   - Only one node (length 1), unpaired tail \u21d2 delete D (rows 4\u20136, cols 1\u20133 \u2192 all 0).\n\n   **Other cells**\n\n   - Color-5 path cells are untouched (none lie inside the deleted 3\u00d73 blocks).\n   - All non-block regions (other colors such as 7 or isolated 2) stay as they are.\n   - For the remaining block B (rows 0\u20132, cols 7\u20139) the border 6\u2019s remain; only its center changes from 1 to 3.\n\n5. **Resulting output grid**\n\nRow by row:\n\n- r0: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n- r1: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,6\n- r2: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n- r3: 5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0\n- r4: 5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n- r5: 5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n- r6: 5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n- r7: 0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n- r8: 0,7,7,7,0,5,5,0,0,5\n- r9: 0,7,2,7,0,0,0,5,5,0\n\n**Final output grid:**\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,7,7,7,0,5,5,0,0,5\n0,7,2,7,0,0,0,5,5,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to solve this Abstract Reasoning Challenge (ARC) task. I need to figure out what the transformation rules are based on these examples and hints. My initial thought is to break down the task into smaller steps and look for patterns.\n\n**Hints Analysis & Object Identification:**\n\nFirst, the hint \"Transformation is driven by a match between the outer rim color of one object and the inner center color of another\" is my starting point. It sounds like there are \"objects\" with rims and centers, and a match triggers a color transfer. Let's analyze the input grids: they look like they contain 3x3 squares with a colored rim and a colored center pixel, possibly irregular shapes, with the color of the rim and center being distinct.\n\nI systematically go through each example, identifying these 3x3 squares in detail. It seems like the objects are 3x3 (sometimes less if the grid ends, and sometimes the surrounding colors cover it). Also, there are gray pixels (color 5), which form \"connectors\" or the grid structure itself.\n\n**Color Transfer Logic and Chain Reactions:**\n\nNext, the hint about the color transfer is key: \"This match triggers a transfer: the inner color of the 'rim-matching' object replaces the inner color of the 'center-matching' object.\" I'll need to figure out which color goes where. I check each example, looking for pairs where the rim of one object matches the center of another. The action is that the matching center color is changed.\n\nBased on the Example 1 results, I figure out that I need to look for a rim-to-center match, then the \"center color of donor\" (the object that has the rim) will replace the center color of the object with that center, and the donor is deleted. It appears the donor is the \"providing color\", and the acceptor is the \"receiving color\". I examine Example 2 in detail. It seems that objects can participate in a chain: A is a donor to B, and B is a donor to C. It also appears that donors are deleted from the final answer (the object that provides the color is removed, even if it could be seen as an acceptor). So, if an object provides to another, it's out. Otherwise, it stays.\n\n**Grey Pixel Treatment:**\n\nFinally, the hint \"The final grey lines are merely connectors drawn between the surviving objects.\"  implies that the gray pixels (color 5) have some special status. In examples, they were part of the input. I look at the gray 5 pixels, which seem stable. The rule is simple: copy the 5s exactly as they are in the input. They seem to be persistent in the background, except where they are overwritten by a surviving object.\n\n**Formalizing the Algorithm:**\n\nAfter going through each example and re-evaluating, I can summarize my understanding as follows:\n\n1.  **Parse Objects:** Identify the 3x3 (or less if at the edge of the grid) squares and store their positions, rim colors, and center colors.\n2.  **5 Pixel Identification:** Store all the locations and colors for pixels of value 5.\n3.  **Topology Construction:** Check which rim matches which center. A match means the corresponding object is a donor to the other. Construct a \"graph\" where the nodes are objects and the edges are donations.\n4.  **Object Filtering (Keep/Delete):** If an object is a donor, it is deleted. If not, it is kept. I realize that independent objects which are neither are also kept.\n5.  **New Color Assignment:** For surviving objects, the center color changes to the original center of the donor object that matched it. If multiple donors match to make a chain, take the original color (only immediate neighbour counts).\n6.  **Output Grid Construction:** Start with a black (0) grid, draw the surviving objects with their updated colors, then draw the 5s at the same places from the input, overwriting if needed (kept objects should take precedence).\n\n**Applying the Strategy to the Test Input:**\n\nI then begin to test this logic on the specific test input that the user provides.\n\n1.  I identify 4 objects: one at the top-mid, one at the top-right, one at the middle-left, and one at the middle-right. They all have a 3x3 structure. There is a potential \"object\" at the bottom-left with color 7. It looks like the start of a 3x3 structure, but the full shape is not present. This may be critical.\n2.  I note the positions of pixels of value 5.\n3.  I check which rims match which centers. I find a chain: Object 4 donates to Object 1\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid by identifying interactions between \"objects\".\n\n**Analysis of the Rules:**\n1.  **Objects:** Objects are 3x3 squares consisting of a \"rim\" color and a \"center\" color.\n2.  **Interaction (Donation):** An interaction occurs when the **rim color** of one object matches the **center color** of another.\n    *   The object with the matching rim is the **Donor**.\n    *   The object with the matching center is the **Acceptor**.\n3.  **Transformation:**\n    *   **Donors are deleted.** Their pixels become 0 (or revert to background).\n    *   **Acceptors are kept.**\n    *   **Color Transfer:** The Acceptor's center color is replaced by the **Donor's original center color**.\n    *   **Chains:** If there is a chain (A -> B -> C), B is both a donor (to C) and an acceptor (from A). Since B is a donor, it is deleted. Only the terminal acceptor (C) remains visible. C receives B's original center color.\n4.  **Background:** The grey pixels (color 5) act as a static background/connector structure. They generally persist unless they conflict with a surviving object, in which case the surviving object (being the foreground subject) takes precedence.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:**\n    *   **Object 1 (Top-Left):** Located at rows 0-2, cols 3-5. Rim: **1**, Center: **3**.\n    *   **Object 2 (Top-Right):** Located at rows 0-2, cols 7-9. Rim: **6**, Center: **1**.\n    *   **Object 3 (Mid-Left):** Located at rows 4-6, cols 1-3. Rim: **2**, Center: **4**.\n    *   **Object 4 (Mid-Right):** Located at rows 5-7, cols 5-7. Rim: **3**, Center: **9**.\n    *   **Object 5 (Bottom-Left):** Located at rows 7-9, cols 1-3. Rim: **7**, Center: **2**. (Note: In the input, the top row of this object (row 7) is obscured by background 5s, but the pattern \"7,2,7\" in row 9 and rim logic confirms its existence).\n\n2.  **Determine Chains & Roles:**\n    *   **Chain 1:**\n        *   Object 4 (Rim 3) matches Object 1 (Center 3). -> Obj 4 donates to Obj 1.\n        *   Object 1 (Rim 1) matches Object 2 (Center 1). -> Obj 1 donates to Obj 2.\n        *   Roles:\n            *   Obj 4: Donor -> **Deleted**.\n            *   Obj 1: Donor (to 2) -> **Deleted**.\n            *   Obj 2: Acceptor (Terminal) -> **Kept**.\n        *   Result for Obj 2: Center becomes Obj 1's original center (**3**).\n    *   **Chain 2:**\n        *   Object 3 (Rim 2) matches Object 5 (Center 2). -> Obj 3 donates to Obj 5.\n        *   Roles:\n            *   Obj 3: Donor -> **Deleted**.\n            *   Obj 5: Acceptor (Terminal) -> **Kept**.\n        *   Result for Obj 5: Center becomes Obj 3's original center (**4**).\n\n3.  **Construct Output Grid:**\n    *   **Background (5s):** Copy all 5s from the input.\n    *   **Deleted Objects:** Ensure areas for Obj 1, Obj 3, and Obj 4 are cleared to 0 (unless they contain background 5s that should persist, but here the objects are donors so they are removed. The 5s around them stay).\n    *   **Kept Objects:**\n        *   **Draw Obj 2:** At (0-2, 7-9). Rim 6, new Center 3.\n        *   **Draw Obj 5:** At (7-9, 1-3). Rim 7, new Center 4. This object is drawn fully, overwriting the background 5s that obscured its top row in the input.\n\n**Grid Generation Details:**\n*   **Row 0-2:** Obj 1 (middle) is gone. Obj 2 (right) is `6,6,6 / 6,3,6 / 6,6,6`.\n*   **Row 3:** Line of 5s remains.\n*   **Row 4-6:** Obj 3 (left) is gone. Obj 4 (right) is gone. The 5s forming the structure remain.\n*   **Row 7-9:** Obj 5 (left) is drawn `7,7,7 / 7,4,7 / 7,7,7`. This overwrites the 5s at (7,1) and (7,2). The rest of the 5s remain.\n\ninput:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,7,7,7,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,7,4,7,0,5,5,0,0,5\n0,7,7,7,0,0,0,5,5,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**My thought process in solving this ARC task:**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at these grid examples. They're all about these \"objects\" \u2013 blocks of color with a different-colored center.  The task seems to be about how these objects interact and change. I'm seeing patterns: the rim colors, the center colors, and these grey lines that seem to be \"connectors\".\n\n**Deductions and Pattern Recognition**\nI started by meticulously analyzing the first example.  I broke down each object, noting its rim and center color.  I noticed the hints talking about \"matching\" rim and center colors, and I began to see a connection between the inner and outer colors of the objects. It seems like the matching is between the rim of one object and the center of another. I thought, \"if one object's outer rim color matches another object's inner center color, the inner color is transferred\".\n\n**The \"Transfer\" Principle**\nThis \"transfer\" of color \u2013 one object's center color replacing another's \u2013 is the key.  But there are \"donors\" and \"acceptors.\" If the rim of one object matches the center of another object, then the rim-matching object is the donor, and the center-matching object is the acceptor. It transfers its center to the acceptor, and the donor is then deleted.\n\nI carefully mapped out the objects in the first example, identifying those that \"matched\" and thinking about which object would become what. I was careful with tracing the values. It looked like the object, whose rim matched the accepting object's center, was deleted, and its original center was moved over. \n\n**Grey Lines as Connectors**\nI then focused on those grey lines. The hint says \"the final grey lines are merely connectors drawn between the surviving objects\". In the examples, the grey pixels form a network or paths between the objects. This connectivity is important.  If an object isn't connected to the network, it doesn't participate in the transfer rules. I needed to verify the grid's connections by looking at the location of pixels.\n\nI got to work tracing the grey connections. I also checked that the grey structure was preserved.\n\n**Forming a System**\nI started to form a system:\n1. Identify objects.\n2. Find matches.\n3. Establish donor/acceptor relationships.\n4. Execute transfers: donor's center -> acceptor.\n5. Delete donors.\n6. Preserve everything else (background and connectors).\n\nI carefully went through Examples 2 and 3, checking if this system held true. I found myself verifying the connectivity of an object, if it didn't connect, or if the donors and acceptors made sense. I also had to recheck the math to make sure the center value was transferred properly. The output color needed to correspond to the original values.\n\n**Addressing Complex Scenarios**\nI ran into a problem where one object was both a donor and acceptor.  It had to be deleted. And I realized objects outside of the grey network are also deleted.\n\n**Finalized Rule Set**\nOkay, so I need to establish the final rules.\n1. Parse all objects: Rectangle. Rim + Center Color.\n2. Identify directed matches: Object X is a donor to Object Y if Rim(X) == Center(Y).\n3. Determine outcomes simultaneously:\n    - Donor object is deleted.\n    - Acceptor object receives the Donor's original center.\n    - All other objects are deleted.\n4. Keep the output 5s.\n\n**Applying the Rules to the Test Case**\nNow, I'm ready to tackle the test input. I identified all the objects in the test grid, looking for rim and center values. I found matches.  I looked at the chains and drew a diagram. The Donor dies.  The Acceptor gets the donors center. I applied this logic, carefully updating the colors and setting deleted object pixels to zero.\n\nFinally, I carefully wrote out each change, and created the final output. I rechecked one more time, and hopefully, I've solved it!\n\n\nThe transformation rule involves identifying \"objects\" (rectangular rims with a center of a different color) and a \"network\" of grey (color 5) connectors.\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:**\n    *   **A (Top Left):** Rim 1 (Blue), Center 3 (Green). Located at rows 0-2, cols 3-5.\n    *   **B (Top Right):** Rim 6 (Magenta), Center 1 (Blue). Located at rows 0-2, cols 7-9.\n    *   **C (Middle Left):** Rim 2 (Red), Center 4 (Yellow). Located at rows 4-6, cols 1-3.\n    *   **D (Middle Right):** Rim 3 (Green), Center 9 (Maroon). Located at rows 5-7, cols 5-7.\n    *   **E (Bottom Left):** Rim 7 (Orange), Center 2 (Red). Located at rows 8-9, cols 1-3.\n\n2.  **Identify Matches and Transfers:**\n    Matches occur when the **Rim color of a donor object** equals the **Center color of an acceptor object**.\n    *   **Rim(D) = 3** matches **Center(A) = 3**. (D $\\to$ A)\n    *   **Rim(A) = 1** matches **Center(B) = 1**. (A $\\to$ B)\n    *   **Rim(C) = 2** matches **Center(E) = 2**. (C $\\to$ E)\n    *   **Rim(B) = 6** matches nothing.\n    *   **Rim(E) = 7** matches nothing.\n\n    This forms two transfer chains:\n    *   **Chain 1:** D $\\to$ A $\\to$ B\n    *   **Chain 2:** C $\\to$ E\n\n3.  **Determine Survival:**\n    *   **Donors are deleted.** If an object acts as a donor, it is removed.\n    *   **Acceptors are kept** (unless they are also donors).\n    *   **Transferred Color:** An acceptor receives the *original* center color of the object that donated to it.\n\n    **Applying to Chain 1 (D $\\to$ A $\\to$ B):**\n    *   **D** acts as a donor (to A). **D is deleted.**\n    *   **A** acts as an acceptor (from D) AND as a donor (to B). Because it is a donor, **A is deleted.**\n    *   **B** acts as an acceptor (from A) and is not a donor. **B is kept.**\n    *   **B** receives the original center color of **A**, which is **3** (Green).\n\n    **Applying to Chain 2 (C $\\to$ E):**\n    *   **C** acts as a donor (to E). **C is deleted.**\n    *   **E** acts as an acceptor (from C) and is not a donor. **E is kept.**\n    *   **E** receives the original center color of **C**, which is **4** (Yellow).\n\n4.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   Copy the non-object parts of the grid (background 0s and connector 5s) exactly.\n    *   Clear the areas occupied by deleted objects **A, C, and D** (set pixels to 0).\n    *   Update the center of kept object **B** to **3**.\n    *   Update the center of kept object **E** to **4**.\n\n    **Details:**\n    *   **A:** Clear rows 0-2, cols 3-5.\n    *   **C:** Clear rows 4-6, cols 1-3.\n    *   **D:** Clear rows 5-7, cols 5-7.\n    *   **B:** Rows 0-2, cols 7-9. Center at (1,8). Set (1,8) to 3.\n    *   **E:** Rows 8-9, cols 1-3. Center at (9,2). Set (9,2) to 4.\n\noutput:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,7,7,7,0,5,5,0,0,5\n0,7,4,7,0,0,0,5,5,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n## Analysis of the Pattern\n\n**Identifying Objects:** Each example has 3x3 objects with:\n- An outer rim (single color forming the border)\n- An inner center (single color in the middle cell)\n\n**Finding Matches:** A match occurs when one object's rim color equals another object's center color. This creates a \"donation\" chain where:\n- The rim-matching object donates its center color\n- The center-matching object receives the donation\n\n**Building Chains:** Following the donation edges creates chains like: A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D\n\n**Survival Rule:** Processing from the end of each chain:\n- Objects at odd positions from the end (1st, 3rd, 5th...) survive\n- Source nodes (pure donors at the very start) are always deleted\n- Surviving objects receive the center color from their donor\n\n## Applying to Test Input\n\n**Objects identified:**\n1. Rows 0-2, cols 3-5: rim 1, center 3\n2. Rows 0-2, cols 7-9: rim 6, center 1\n3. Rows 4-6, cols 1-3: rim 2, center 4\n4. Rows 5-7, cols 5-7: rim 3, center 9\n5. Rows 8-9, cols 1-3: rim 7, center 2\n\n**Donation edges:**\n- Object 4 (rim 3) \u2192 Object 1 (center 3)\n- Object 1 (rim 1) \u2192 Object 2 (center 1)\n- Object 3 (rim 2) \u2192 Object 5 (center 2)\n\n**Chains:**\n- Chain A: 4 \u2192 1 \u2192 2 (length 3)\n- Chain B: 3 \u2192 5 (length 2)\n\n**Survivors (odd positions from end):**\n- Chain A: Object 2 survives, receives center 3 from Object 1\n- Chain B: Object 5 survives, receives center 4 from Object 3\n\n**Final transformations:**\n- Object 2 (6s): center changes 1\u21923\n- Object 5 (7s): center changes 2\u21924\n- Objects 1, 3, 4: deleted (replaced with 0s)\n- Gray (5) connectors: preserved\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,7,7,7,0,5,5,0,0,5\n0,7,4,7,0,0,0,5,5,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "To solve this task I first looked for the recurring \u201cobjects\u201d in the examples: they are 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 blocks with a uniform rim color and a different center color. The transformation builds a directed graph on these objects: draw an arrow from object A to object B if the rim color of A equals the center color of B. This arrow represents a donation of A\u2019s center colour to B.\n\nFrom the solved cases I inferred two rules:\n\n* All center updates happen simultaneously: each object that has an incoming arrow replaces its center with the original center color of the object one step upstream (the object whose rim matches its center).\n* Deletion/retention is decided along the chains that end in sinks (objects with no outgoing arrows). Walking upstream from each sink, keep the sink, remove the next, keep the next, and so on, but only objects that actually have an incoming donor are ever kept. Sources with no incoming donor are always deleted.\n\nThe rest of the grid remains unchanged except that deleted objects\u2019 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 areas are set to 0.\n\nFor the test input there are four objects:\n\n* O1 at rows\u202f0\u20132, cols\u202f3\u20135: rim\u202f1, center\u202f3.\n* O2 at rows\u202f0\u20132, cols\u202f7\u20139: rim\u202f6, center\u202f1.\n* O3 at rows\u202f4\u20136, cols\u202f1\u20133: rim\u202f2, center\u202f4.\n* O4 at rows\u202f5\u20137, cols\u202f5\u20137: rim\u202f3, center\u202f9.\n\nThe rim/center matches give edges O4\u202f\u2192\u202fO1 (3 matches center\u202f3) and O1\u202f\u2192\u202fO2 (1 matches center\u202f1). O2 and O3 have no outgoing edges, so sinks are O2 and O3. Walking back from sink O2 gives the chain O4\u2013O1\u2013O2; applying the keep/remove pattern and the \u201cmust have incoming\u201d condition leaves only O2. O2\u2019s center is updated from its donor O1\u2019s original center, giving a new center colour of 3. O3 has no incoming donor so is deleted.\n\nApplying these changes yields:\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,7,7,7,0,5,5,0,0,5\n0,7,2,7,0,0,0,5,5,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "To solve the task, I looked for the 3\u00d73 \u201cring\u201d objects that appear in the examples: a solid coloured border with a single central cell of a different colour. From each input I built a directed link from a ring whose rim colour equals the centre colour of another ring.\n\nThese links form chains. In all of the solved examples the surviving rings were the sinks of these chains and, going backwards along each chain, every other ring starting from the sink: the sink itself is kept, its predecessor is removed, the predecessor\u2019s predecessor is kept, and so on. Rings with no incoming link are sources and are removed. Only the rings that are kept have their centre cell replaced by the original centre colour of their immediate predecessor; donors\u2019 centres are never chained through.\n\nOn the test grid the ring objects are:\n\n- A rim\u202f1, centre\u202f3 at rows\u202f1\u20133, cols\u202f4\u20136\n- B rim\u202f6, centre\u202f1 at rows\u202f1\u20133, cols\u202f8\u201310\n- C rim\u202f2, centre\u202f4 at rows\u202f5\u20137, cols\u202f2\u20134\n- D rim\u202f3, centre\u202f9 at rows\u202f6\u20138, cols\u202f6\u20138\n\nThe links are D\u202f\u2192\u202fA (rim\u202f3 matches centre\u202f3) and A\u202f\u2192\u202fB (rim\u202f1 matches centre\u202f1). Chain D\u2192A\u2192B has sink B, so B is kept and its centre becomes A\u2019s original centre (3); A and D are removed. C has no incoming link and is removed.

            "Full raw LLM response": "Transformation rule (from the examples and hints)\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n1. **Identify objects**: Each relevant object is a 3\u00d73 square with:\n   - a uniform **outer rim color** (all 8 border cells the same non-zero color), and\n   - a possibly different **inner center color** (the central cell).\n\n2. **Match objects**:\n   - For any pair of objects **X** and **Y**:\n     - If `rimColor(X) == centerColor(Y)`, then:\n       - **X is the donor**, **Y is the acceptor**.\n       - The **inner color of X** is transferred to Y:  \n         `centerColor(Y) := centerColor(X)` (using the colors from the original input, not after any updates).\n\n3. **Delete donors, keep acceptors**:\n   - Any object that acts as a **donor** in at least one such pairing is **deleted entirely** (its 3\u00d73 area becomes 0).\n   - Objects that are **only acceptors or unmatched** are kept, with centers updated as above.\n   - Other non-object pixels (e.g., the grey connector lines, color `5`) are left unchanged unless they lie inside deleted 3\u00d73 donors.\n\nApplying this to the test input\n-------------------------------\n\n### 1. Find all 3\u00d73 \u201cring\u201d objects\n\nScan the test grid for 3\u00d73 blocks with a single rim color and a distinct center:\n\nTest input (for reference):\n\n0,0,0,1,1,1,0,6,6,6  \n0,0,0,1,3,1,0,6,1,6  \n0,0,0,1,1,1,0,6,6,6  \n5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0  \n5,2,2,2,5,0,0,0,5,0  \n5,2,4,2,5,3,3,3,5,0  \n5,2,2,2,5,3,9,3,0,5  \n0,5,5,0,5,3,3,3,0,5  \n0,7,7,7,0,5,5,0,0,5  \n0,7,2,7,0,0,0,5,5,0  \n\nThe 3\u00d73 rings are:\n\n1. **O1** (top-left ring of 1\u2019s):\n   - Rows 0\u20132, cols 3\u20135:\n     ```\n     1 1 1\n     1 3 1\n     1 1 1\n     ```\n   - rimColor(O1) = 1, centerColor(O1) = 3, center at (1,4).\n\n2. **O2** (top-right ring of 6\u2019s):\n   - Rows 0\u20132, cols 7\u20139:\n     ```\n     6 6 6\n     6 1 6\n     6 6 6\n     ```\n   - rimColor(O2) = 6, centerColor(O2) = 1, center at (1,8).\n\n3. **O3** (middle-left ring of 2\u2019s):\n   - Rows 4\u20136, cols 1\u20133:\n     ```\n     2 2 2\n     2 4 2\n     2 2 2\n     ```\n   - rimColor(O3) = 2, centerColor(O3) = 4, center at (5,2).\n\n4. **O4** (central ring of 3\u2019s):\n   - Rows 5\u20137, cols 5\u20137:\n     ```\n     3 3 3\n     3 9 3\n     3 3 3\n     ```\n   - rimColor(O4) = 3, centerColor(O4) = 9, center at (6,6).\n\nNo other 3\u00d73 blocks have a uniform rim and distinct center, so these are all the objects.\n\n### 2. Determine donor\u2013acceptor pairings\n\nWe look for pairs where `rimColor(donor) == centerColor(acceptor)`.\n\n- rimColor(O1) = 1:\n  - Matches centerColor(O2) = 1 \u2192 **O1 is donor, O2 is acceptor**.\n  - Transfer: center(O2) becomes center(O1) = 3.\n\n- rimColor(O2) = 6:\n  - No object has center = 6 \u2192 O2 is **not** a donor.\n\n- rimColor(O3) = 2:\n  - No object has center = 2 \u2192 O3 is **not** a donor.\n\n- rimColor(O4) = 3:\n  - Matches centerColor(O1) = 3 \u2192 **O4 is donor, O1 is acceptor**.\n  - Transfer: center(O1) becomes center(O4) = 9.  \n    (But O1 will later be deleted as a donor, so this change won\u2019t be visible.)\n\nSummary:\n\n- Donors: **O1, O4**\n- Acceptors (i.e., objects whose centers conceptually change):  \n  - O2: center 1 \u2192 3 (from O1)  \n  - O1: center 3 \u2192 9 (from O4), but O1 is also a donor and will be deleted.\n\nO3 has neither incoming nor outgoing matches, so it remains unchanged.\n\n### 3. Apply changes and delete donors\n\nStart from the input grid and:\n\n1. **Update centers of acceptors** using donors\u2019 original center colors:\n   - O2 center (row 1, col 8): 1 \u2192 3.\n   - O1 center (row 1, col 4): 3 \u2192 9 (will be erased next).\n\n2. **Delete donor objects** O1 and O4 by zeroing their entire 3\u00d73 regions:\n\n   - O1 region (rows 0\u20132, cols 3\u20135) set to 0.\n   - O4 region (rows 5\u20137, cols 5\u20137) set to 0.\n\nAll other cells remain as in the input.\n\nConstructing the final grid row by row:\n\n- Row 0: original `0,0,0,1,1,1,0,6,6,6`  \n  Zero cols 3\u20135 \u2192 `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6`\n\n- Row 1: original `0,0,0,1,3,1,0,6,1,6`  \n  Center(O2) at col 8: 1 \u2192 3; then zero cols 3\u20135 (O1) \u2192  \n  `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,6`\n\n- Row 2: original `0,0,0,1,1,1,0,6,6,6`  \n  Zero cols 3\u20135 \u2192 `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6`\n\n- Row 3: unaffected \u2192 `5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0`\n\n- Row 4: unaffected \u2192 `5,2,2,2,5,0,0,0,5,0`\n\n- Row 5: original `5,2,4,2,5,3,3,3,5,0`  \n  Zero cols 5\u20137 (O4) \u2192 `5,2,4,2,5,0,0,0,5,0`\n\n- Row 6: original `5,2,2,2,5,3,9,3,0,5`  \n  Zero cols 5\u20137 \u2192 `5,2,2,2,5,0,0,0,0,5`\n\n- Row 7: original `0,5,5,0,5,3,3,3,0,5`  \n  Zero cols 5\u20137 \u2192 `0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5`\n\n- Row 8: unaffected \u2192 `0,7,7,7,0,5,5,0,0,5`\n\n- Row 9: unaffected \u2192 `0,7,2,7,0,0,0,5,5,0`\n\nFinal output grid\n-----------------\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,6  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6  \n5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0  \n5,2,2,2,5,0,0,0,5,0  \n5,2,4,2,5,0,0,0,5,0  \n5,2,2,2,5,0,0,0,0,5  \n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5  \n0,7,7,7,0,5,5,0,0,5  \n0,7,2,7,0,0,0,5,5,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Below is how I reconstructed the transformation, then how I applied it to the test grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Identifying the \u201cobjects\u201d\n\nIn all examples, the non\u2011grey \u201cobjects\u201d are 3\u00d73 squares of this form:\n\n- Outer rim: all 8 border cells have the same non\u2011zero color \\(R\\).\n- Center: the middle cell has a single color \\(C\\) (possibly different from \\(R\\)).\n\nExample (from the test):\n\n```\n1 1 1\n1 3 1\n1 1 1\n```\n\nThis is an object with rim color \\(R=1\\), center color \\(C=3\\).\n\nColor 5 forms a separate network of straight segments: those are the \u201cgrey connectors\u201d. They are never changed by the transformation; input and output 5s are in the same positions in all three examples.\n\nEverything else (non\u20115 cells not belonging to surviving 3\u00d73 objects) is turned to 0.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Building a graph of objects from rim\u2013center matches\n\nFor each 3\u00d73 object \\(O_i = (R_i, C_i)\\):\n\n- If there exists another object \\(O_j\\) whose **center** color equals \\(R_i\\) (i.e. \\(C_j = R_i\\)), then we draw a **directed edge**\n  \\[\n  O_i \\rightarrow O_j\n  \\]\n  and say \u201c\\(O_i\\) donates to \\(O_j\\).\u201d\n\nEquivalently: object \\(O_j\\) has predecessor \\(O_i\\) if\n\\[\nR_i = C_j.\n\\]\n\nBecause in the examples each rim color and each center color appears at most once among the ring objects, each object has at most one predecessor and at most one successor. Thus the directed graph decomposes into disjoint **chains**:\n\n\\[\nO_{k_1} \\rightarrow O_{k_2} \\rightarrow \\dots \\rightarrow O_{k_L}\n\\]\n\n(no branching, no cycles in these tasks).\n\n### Center-color transfer\n\nFor every edge \\(O_i \\rightarrow O_j\\):\n\n- The center color of \\(O_j\\) is replaced by the **original** center color of \\(O_i\\):\n  \\[\n  C_j' = C_i\n  \\]\n  (We always use the original centers, not updated ones.)\n\nThis matches what we see:\n\n- Example 2:\n  - Chain \\(A \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow C \\rightarrow E \\rightarrow D\\).\n  - \\(C\\) new center is 2 (original center of \\(B\\)).\n  - \\(D\\) new center is 8 (original center of \\(E\\)).\n- Example 3:\n  - Chains \\(D \\rightarrow A\\) and \\(C \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow E\\).\n  - \\(A\\) new center 9 from \\(D\\).\n  - \\(E\\) new center 3 from \\(B\\).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Which objects survive?\n\nFrom the training examples, the pattern that matches all three is:\n\n1. **Decompose into chains** using the rim\u2013center rule above.\n2. For each chain, define:\n   - **Sink**: last object (no outgoing edge, i.e. outdegree 0, indegree 1).\n   - **Length** \\(L\\): number of objects in the chain.\n\n3. **Survival rule**:\n\n   - If there is **more than one chain**:\n     - **All sinks survive.**\n   - If there is **exactly one chain** (length \\(L>1\\)):\n     - The **sink** survives.\n     - Additionally, the \u201cmiddle\u201d object of the chain also survives:\n       - Index \\(m = \\left\\lfloor\\frac{L-1}{2}\\right\\rfloor\\) in 0\u2011based indexing of the path \\((O_0,O_1,\\dots,O_{L-1})\\).\n       - So:\n         - For \\(L=4\\), we keep \\(O_1\\) (2nd object) and \\(O_3\\) (sink).\n         - For \\(L=5\\), we keep \\(O_2\\) (3rd object) and \\(O_4\\) (sink).\n\n   - (Chains of length 1 would have their only object as sink; in these tasks we don\u2019t see the \u201csingle chain of length 1\u201d case.)\n\n4. **Deletion rule**:\n\n   - All ring objects **not** selected by this rule are deleted (their 3\u00d73 cells become 0, except any 5s, which never occur inside rings in these puzzles).\n   - Color\u20115 connectors are **left untouched**.\n   - Surviving objects show their updated centers (from step 2).\n\n### Check against the training examples\n\n- **Example 1**\n\n  Objects (R,C): \\(B(4,2), A(3,4), C(1,3), D(6,1)\\).\n\n  Edges from rim\u2013center matches:\n\n  - 4 \u2192 4 gives \\(B \\rightarrow A\\).\n  - 3 \u2192 3 gives \\(A \\rightarrow C\\).\n  - 1 \u2192 1 gives \\(C \\rightarrow D\\).\n\n  Single chain: \\(B \\rightarrow A \\rightarrow C \\rightarrow D\\), length \\(L=4\\):\n\n  - Sink: \\(D\\) (kept).\n  - Middle index \\(m=\\lfloor(4-1)/2\\rfloor=1\\) \u21d2 \\(O_1 = A\\) (kept).\n  - \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) deleted.\n\n  Centers:\n  - \\(A\\) gets center from \\(B\\): 2.\n  - \\(D\\) gets center from \\(C\\): 3.\n\n  This matches the output: only the 3\u2011rim object (now with center 2) and the 6\u2011rim object (now with center 3) remain; the 4\u2011rim and 1\u2011rim rings are gone; all 5s unchanged.\n\n- **Example 2**\n\n  Objects: \\(A(2,6), B(3,2), C(8,3), E(4,8), D(1,4)\\).\n\n  Edges:\n  - \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) (2\u21922),\n  - \\(B \\rightarrow C\\) (3\u21923),\n  - \\(C \\rightarrow E\\) (8\u21928),\n  - \\(E \\rightarrow D\\) (4\u21924).\n\n  Single chain \\(A \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow C \\rightarrow E \\rightarrow D\\), \\(L=5\\):\n\n  - Sink: \\(D\\) (kept).\n  - Middle index \\(m=\\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor=2\\) \u21d2 \\(O_2=C\\) (kept).\n  - Others \\(A,B,E\\) deleted.\n\n  Centers:\n  - \\(C\\) from \\(B\\): 2.\n  - \\(D\\) from \\(E\\): 8.\n\n  Again exactly matches the output.\n\n- **Example 3**\n\n  Objects: \\(A(1,2), B(4,3), C(3,6), D(2,9), E(7,4)\\).\n\n  Edges:\n  - \\(D \\rightarrow A\\) (2\u21922),\n  - \\(C \\rightarrow B\\) (3\u21923),\n  - \\(B \\rightarrow E\\) (4\u21924).\n\n  Chains:\n  - Chain1: \\(D \\rightarrow A\\) (length 2), sink \\(A\\).\n  - Chain2: \\(C \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow E\\) (length 3), sink \\(E\\).\n\n  There are **two chains**, so we keep **all sinks**: \\(A\\) and \\(E\\). No \u201cmiddle\u201d nodes are additionally kept.\n\n  Centers:\n  - \\(A\\) from \\(D\\): 9.\n  - \\(E\\) from \\(B\\): 3.\n\n  Exactly as in the example output.\n\nThis rule explains all three examples without modifying the 5-connectors.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Applying the rule to the test input\n\n### 4.1.

Build the rim\u2013center graph\n\nMake a map from rim color to object:\n\n- color 1 \u2192 P1\n- color 2 \u2192 P3\n- color 3 \u2192 P4\n- color 6 \u2192 P2\n\nNow, for each object, find its predecessor (object whose rim equals its center):\n\n- For **P1** (center 3):\n\n  - rim color 3 exists (P4) \u21d2 edge \\(P4 \\rightarrow P1\\).\n\n- For **P2** (center 1):\n\n  - rim color 1 exists (P1) \u21d2 edge \\(P1 \\rightarrow P2\\).\n\n- For **P3** (center 4):\n\n  - rim color 4: **none** \u21d2 no predecessor.\n\n- For **P4** (center 9):\n\n  - rim color 9: **none** \u21d2 no predecessor.\n\nSo we have:\n\n- Chain 1: \\(P4 \\rightarrow P1 \\rightarrow P2\\) (length \\(L=3\\)), sink \\(P2\\).\n- Chain 2: single node \\(P3\\) (no in or out), sink \\(P3\\).\n\n### 4.3. Decide which objects survive\n\nThere are **two chains** in total, so by the rule:\n\n- All sinks survive:\n  - From chain 1: **P2**.\n  - From chain 2: **P3**.\n- Since we have more than one chain, we **do not** add an extra \u201cmiddle\u201d node.\n\nObjects **P1** and **P4** are deleted.\n\n### 4.4. Apply center-color transfer\n\nFor each edge:\n\n- \\(P4 \\rightarrow P1\\):\n  - P1\u2019s new center \\(C_1' = C_4 = 9\\).  \n    But P1 is deleted later, so we never see this.\n\n- \\(P1 \\rightarrow P2\\):\n  - P2\u2019s new center \\(C_2' = C_1 = 3\\) (original center of P1).\n\nP3 has no predecessor, so its center remains \\(4\\).\n\n### 4.5.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this ARC-AGI problem:**\n\nMy objective is to analyze a single training image from the ARC-AGI dataset and find a generalizable rule. I\u2019m breaking down the image by first understanding the goal and then performing a step-by-step visual analysis of the input/output pairs.\n\nI see that the core objects are colored 3x3 frames (Nodes) and grey paths. Each Node has an outer color and a center pixel color. I\u2019m analyzing Input 1, tracing the grey paths, and identifying connections between Nodes. I\u2019m making initial hypotheses about the role of the paths and Nodes.\n\nIn Input 1, the grey path connects the nodes. The output has simplified paths and a changed center pixel color in some nodes. I\u2019m analyzing what nodes are kept, removed, and how their center pixel colors have changed. My first hypothesis is that the grey path is a sequence: Start -> Intermediate Node -> End Node, where the intermediate Node is removed, and its center color is transferred to the End Node.\n\nI then move to Input 2, again identifying nodes, tracing the path, and examining the output. I notice that some nodes are retained and their colors change. I begin to think about the connections as a directed graph. The logic is becoming complicated. I analyze Input 3. I look at chain ends. The grey lines seem to imply some type of color flow or transfer between nodes, leading me to make the first testable logic rule.\n\nI attempt a new rule that looks for a connection between nodes. The logic rule fails. The direction of the grey lines becomes suspect. I need to re-evaluate the colors and look for a simpler pattern or relationship. The rule needs to accommodate chains, connections, and output changes. I return to Input 1 to re-evaluate.\n\nI decide to focus on the color properties and look at the \"inner\" color of a frame compared to the \"outer\" color of the frames. I notice a pattern: If the outer color of Node A matches the inner color of Node B, it is connected. If they match, then Node B's inner color becomes the inner color of A. I test this logic in all the Input images.\n\nI refine the rule as \u201cKey-lock\u201d logic, where one Node \"unlocks\" another with color matching. The \"unlocked\" Node is kept. Node A is now a key. I analyze the \"wiring\" i.e., the path, which connects the survivors of the process. The path seems to connect the surviving nodes to a grid.\n\nWith that I categorize this transformation. It's recoloring, with a key or lock mechanism. There is no movement. There is transfer. My non-obvious insights involve the directed graph of the nodes, relationship between the outer and inner colors, and pairing. The unpaired nodes are removed, and the path is rewired.\n\nI use this knowledge to produce a high-level description: The task simulates a key-lock or donor-acceptor mechanism between colored blocks. A donor block gives a color to an acceptor block. Unmatched blocks are removed, and the remaining ones are connected with a new path.\n\nI check this for all pairs. I also evaluate that there is a deletion for the key node. I double check, and the model holds with all inputs. The hint focuses on color properties and how they impact the changes in the images.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided image containing three training examples, here is the breakdown:\n\n## **1. Describe the observable structures**\n\n*   **Objects:**\n    *   **Nodes:** 3x3 square structures consisting of a colored \"rim\" (border) and a single distinct \"core\" (center pixel).\n    *   **Paths:** Connected lines of grey pixels linking the nodes to each other or to the image boundary.\n    *   **Background:** Solid black.\n*   **Arrangement:** The nodes are scattered across the grid. The grey paths form a network connecting specific subsets of nodes.\n*   **Changes:**\n    *   **Removal:** In the output, approximately half of the nodes from the input are removed.\n    *   **Recoloring:** The center pixels of the remaining nodes change color. The rim colors of the remaining nodes stay the same.\n    *   **Path Redrawing:** The grey paths are completely reconfigured. They now connect the remaining nodes directly to each other (or to the starting edge), ignoring the original path layout.\n*   **Preservation:** The spatial coordinates (locations) of the surviving nodes are identical to the input.\n\n## **2. Identify transformation categories**\n\n*   **Object movement:** Absent (Nodes stay in place, only paths move).\n*   **Object recoloring:** **Present** (Center pixels are updated).\n*   **Bordering / outlining:** Absent.\n*   **Filling holes or cavities:** Maybe (The center pixel acts like a cavity being filled).\n*   **Removing noise / extracting main shape:** **Present** (Unpaired nodes are removed).\n*   **Copying / pasting / repositioning:** **Present** (Color values are copied from one object to another).\n*   **Using a key anchor location:** Absent.\n*   **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors:** Absent.\n*   **Size-based filtering or selection:** Absent.\n*   **Symmetry or reflection operations:** Absent.\n*   **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion:** Absent.\n*   **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping:** Absent.\n\n## **3. Extract the key non-obvious insights**\n\n*   **The \"Key-Lock\" Color Relationship:** There is a specific functional relationship between different nodes based on color matching. A transformation occurs when the **Outer Rim Color** of one node (Node A) matches the **Center Pixel Color** of another node (Node B).\n*   **Information Transfer:** When this match occurs (Outer A == Inner B), the **Center Pixel Color** of Node A is copied to the center of Node B.\n*   **Role-Based Survival:**\n    *   **Donors (Node A):** Objects whose rim color matches another's center act as \"keys\" or \"donors.\" They are removed after the operation.\n    *   **Receivers (Node B):** Objects whose center matches another's rim act as \"locks\" or \"receivers.\" They survive and update their center color.\n    *   **Inert Objects:** Objects that do not fit into a valid donor/receiver pair are treated as noise and removed (e.g., the central green node in Input 3).\n*   **Exclusion Principle:** A node that acts as a donor (and is thus removed) cannot simultaneously act as a receiver. This resolves potential chains (e.g., A->B->C becomes just B->C if B is consumed to update C).\n*   **Pathing is Secondary:** The grey lines in the input hint at connectivity but are not strictly followed. The output grey lines are simply a new path generated to connect the surviving receivers.\n\n## **4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)**\n\nThe task creates a system of \"keys\" and \"locks\" among the square nodes.\n1.  Identify pairs of nodes where the **border color** of the first node matches the **center color** of the second node.\n2.  For every such pair, transfer the **center color** of the first node (the key) into the center of the second node (the lock).\n3.  Delete all \"key\" nodes and any unmatched nodes.\n4.  Retain only the \"lock\" nodes in their original positions with their updated centers.\n5.  Draw a new grey path connecting the remaining nodes.\n\n## **5. List checks you would perform when solving**\n\n1.  **Iterate all pairs:** Programmatically check every combination of Node A and Node B to see if `A.border_color == B.center_color`.\n2.  **Verify transfer consistency:** Ensure that in every output example, `Survivor.new_center_color == Deleted_Partner.old_center_color`.\n3.  **Check for conflicts:** Test what happens if a node could theoretically be both a key and a lock. (Observation from Input 3 suggests \"being a key\" takes precedence, causing removal).\n4.  **Path validation:** Check if the output path is a minimal connector (like a Minimum Spanning Tree or simple pathfinding) between the survivors, or if it strictly follows the input topology (it appears to simply connect survivors).\n\n## **6. Summarize final insights**\n\nHINT_START\n*   The transformation is driven by a match between the **outer rim color** of one object and the **inner center color** of another.\n*   This match triggers a transfer: the inner color of the \"rim-matching\" object replaces the inner color of the \"center-matching\" object.\n*   Objects that provide the color (donors) are deleted; objects that receive the color (acceptors) are kept.\n*   The final grey lines are merely connectors drawn between the surviving objects.\nHINT_END",

The color 5 path divides 3x3 framed squares into \"sources\" (enclosed/inside) and \"targets\" (outside/corners)\n2. Source squares are completely removed (replaced with 0)\n3.

The 5-path structure is preserved unchanged\n\n**Pattern:** Information flows from removed (source) squares to surviving (target) squares through the frame-center color relationship chain. Each surviving square's original center acts as a \"pointer\" to which removed square provides its new center value.\n\n**For Test Input:**\n- Frame 6 (center 1) and partial Frame 7 (center 2) should survive (outside 5-path enclosure)\n- Frames 1, 2, 3 should be removed (enclosed by 5-path)\n- Frame 6: center 1\u21923 (from removed Frame 1's center)\n- Frame 7: center 2\u21924 (from removed Frame 2's center)\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Task Decomposition and Solution Strategy**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The user wants me to tackle an ARC problem with a test grid, some example grids, and specific transformation rules. My first step is to dive into the test grid and really understand what's there. The input is a 10x10 grid with numbers representing colors. We've got 3x3 \"framed squares\" \u2013 the outside is one color, the center another \u2013 and a structure built with color '5'.\n\nI'll start by identifying all the framed squares in the test input. Then, I will focus on understanding how the color '5' path divides the grid. The problem description mentions that the 5's form \"sources\" (enclosed) and \"targets\" (outside/corners), and that these 5s aren't touched.\n\nI can make a list of these framed squares, label each one, and identify their position and colors. Then, I need to classify the framed squares. The prompt gives clear rules: \"Sources are removed\" and \"Targets survive\". I can sort the squares into these two categories based on their enclosure by the '5' color. I want to pay attention to that the prompt instructions about removing \"sources\" and what to do with the \"targets\".\n\nOnce I've got this source/target classification, I can apply the actual transformation rules. Source squares vanish (their pixels become 0). Target squares remain, but their center colors might change. This change is the key transformation. Target centers are updated by the \"pointer\" rule: If a target's original center color matches a source's frame color, that target's new center becomes the source's center color.\n\nI'll reconstruct the output grid from scratch. Keep the 5-structure in place. The target squares are set where they were previously. Then, I'll go through the output grid, one row at a time. The sources are 0s. The 5s are preserved, and I set the target squares with updated centers.\n\nFinally, I will compare the final grid against some edge-case checks. I'm looking for a perfect match, and that everything aligns with the user's description.\n\n\nBased on the provided examples and the detailed object/transformation description, here is the step-by-step solution for the test input:\n\n### Logic Explanation\n\n1.  **Identify Objects**:\n    *   **5-Path**: The fixed structure made of color 5 cells forms enclosures and lines throughout the grid. This structure is preserved in the output.\n    *   **3x3 Framed Squares**: There are 5 such squares (some partial) in the input grid.\n        *   **Square A**: Top-middle (Rows 0-2, Cols 3-5). Frame color **1**, Center color **3**.\n        *   **Square B**: Top-right (Rows 0-2, Cols 7-9). Frame color **6**, Center color **1**.\n        *   **Square C**: Middle-left (Rows 4-6, Cols 1-3). Frame color **2**, Center color **4**.\n        *   **Square D**: Middle-right (Rows 5-7, Cols 5-7). Frame color **3**, Center color **9**.\n        *   **Square E**: Bottom-left (Rows 8-9, partial). Frame color **7**, Center color **2**.\n\n2.  **Classify Sources and Targets**:\n    *   According to the prompt instructions for the Test Input:\n        *   **Sources (Remove)**: Frames 1, 2, and 3 are enclosed by the 5-path. Thus, Square A (Frame 1), Square C (Frame 2), and Square D (Frame 3) are sources.\n        *   **Targets (Keep)**: Frame 6 and Frame 7 are outside/partial. Thus, Square B (Frame 6) and Square E (Frame 7) are targets.\n\n3.  **Apply Transformation Rules**:\n    *   **Remove Sources**: The cells occupied by Square A, Square C, and Square D are cleared to background color 0 (except where they might overlap the 5-path, but here the 5-path borders them).\n    *   **Update Targets**: The centers of the surviving targets are updated based on the \"pointer\" logic:\n        *   **Target B**: Original center is **1**. We look for the removed Source with Frame **1**. That is Square A, which had a center of **3**. So, Target B's center becomes **3**.\n        *   **Target E**: Original center is **2**. We look for the removed Source with Frame **2**. That is Square C, which had a center of **4**. So, Target E's center becomes **4**.\n\n4.  **Construct Output**:\n    *   Copy the **5-path** exactly as it appears in the input.\n    *   Place **Target B** at its original location with the new center (Frame 6, Center 3).\n    *   Place **Target E** at its original location with the new center (Frame 7, Center 4).\n    *   Fill all other areas (including where Sources A, C, D were) with **0**.\n\n### Completed Output Grid\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,7,7,7,0,5,5,0,0,5\n0,7,4,7,0,0,0,5,5,0\n```",

Multiple instances appear per grid at various positions.\n\n2. **Color 5 Path Structures**: Linear or angular arrangements of color 5 cells forming diagonal lines, L-shapes, or partial outlines that traverse the grid space between the framed squares.\n\n3. **Background**: Color 0 cells filling all remaining empty space.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n**Rules:**\n1. The color 5 path divides 3x3 framed squares into \"sources\" (enclosed/inside) and \"targets\" (outside/corners)\n2. Source squares are completely removed (replaced with 0)\n3. Target squares survive with updated centers\n4. Center update rule: If a target's center color C matches a removed source's frame color, the target's center becomes that source's center value\n5. The 5-path structure is preserved unchanged\n\n**Pattern:** Information flows from removed (source) squares to surviving (target) squares through the frame-center color relationship chain. Each surviving square's original center acts as a \"pointer\" to which removed square provides its new center value.\n\n**For Test Input:**\n- Frame 6 (center 1) and partial Frame 7 (center 2) should survive (outside 5-path enclosure)\n- Frames 1, 2, 3 should be removed (enclosed by 5-path)\n- Frame 6: center 1\u21923 (from removed Frame 1's center)\n- Frame 7: center 2\u21924 (from removed Frame 2's center)\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

Multiple instances appear per grid at various positions.\n\n2. **Color 5 Path Structures**: Linear or angular arrangements of color 5 cells forming diagonal lines, L-shapes, or partial outlines that traverse the grid space between the framed squares.\n\n3. **Background**: Color 0 cells filling all remaining empty space.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n**Rules:**\n1. The color 5 path divides 3x3 framed squares into \"sources\" (enclosed/inside) and \"targets\" (outside/corners)\n2. Source squares are completely removed (replaced with 0)\n3. Target squares survive with updated centers\n4. Center update rule: If a target's center color C matches a removed source's frame color, the target's center becomes that source's center value\n5. The 5-path structure is preserved unchanged\n\n**Pattern:** Information flows from removed (source) squares to surviving (target) squares through the frame-center color relationship chain. Each surviving square's original center acts as a \"pointer\" to which removed square provides its new center value.\n\n**For Test Input:**\n- Frame 6 (center 1) and partial Frame 7 (center 2) should survive (outside 5-path enclosure)\n- Frames 1, 2, 3 should be removed (enclosed by 5-path)\n- Frame 6: center 1\u21923 (from removed Frame 1's center)\n- Frame 7: center 2\u21924 (from removed Frame 2's center)\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "First, infer the rule from the examples, then apply it to the test grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Transformation rule (from the examples)\n\nFrom Examples 1\u20133 and the description:\n\n1. **Detect 3\u00d73 framed squares**  \n   A 3\u00d73 block where the 8 perimeter cells all share the same color (the *frame color*) and the center cell has a different color (the *center color*).\n\n2. **Color-5 path as a divider**  \n   The cells of color 5 form a path that topologically separates the grid into regions.  \n   - Squares on one side of this path are considered **sources** (they will be removed).  \n   - Squares on the other side are **targets** (they survive).\n\n3. **Sources \u2192 Targets mapping**  \n   - For every source square with frame color `F` and center `S`, record a mapping `F \u2192 S`.\n   - For each target square, let its original center color be `C`.  \n     If there exists a source with frame color `C`, then the target\u2019s center is replaced by that source\u2019s center `S`.\n   - Only the **original** center of the target is used as the key `C`. No chaining: you do not re-interpret the updated center.\n\n4. **Removal of sources and preservation of path**  \n   - All cells of source squares (all 9 cells of each such 3\u00d73) are set to 0.\n   - Color-5 cells are never altered.\n   - Everything else not part of surviving squares or the path becomes 0 as a side effect of removing sources.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identify framed squares in the test input\n\nTest input:\n\n1: 0,0,0,1,1,1,0,6,6,6  \n2: 0,0,0,1,3,1,0,6,1,6  \n3: 0,0,0,1,1,1,0,6,6,6  \n4: 5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0  \n5: 5,2,2,2,5,0,0,0,5,0  \n6: 5,2,4,2,5,3,3,3,5,0  \n7: 5,2,2,2,5,3,9,3,0,5  \n8: 0,5,5,0,5,3,3,3,0,5  \n9: 0,7,7,7,0,5,5,0,0,5  \n10:0,7,2,7,0,0,0,5,5,0  \n\nClear 3\u00d73 framed squares:\n\n- **Square S1 (frame 1, center 3)** at rows 1\u20133, cols 4\u20136:\n\n  ```\n  1 1 1\n  1 3 1\n  1 1 1\n  ```\n\n- **Square S2 (frame 6, center 1)** at rows 1\u20133, cols 8\u201310:\n\n  ```\n  6 6 6\n  6 1 6\n  6 6 6\n  ```\n\n- **Square S3 (frame 2, center 4)** at rows 5\u20137, cols 2\u20134:\n\n  ```\n  2 2 2\n  2 4 2\n  2 2 2\n  ```\n\n- **Square S4 (frame 3, center 9)** at rows 6\u20138, cols 6\u20138:\n\n  ```\n  3 3 3\n  3 9 3\n  3 3 3\n  ```\n\nAdditionally, there is a **partial frame of 7s** at the bottom:\n\nRows 8\u201310, cols 2\u20134:\n\n```\n5 5 0\n7 7 7\n7 2 7\n```\n\nThis is an interrupted 7-frame whose intended center is the `2` at **(10,3)**. The color-5 path overwrote its top row, so it appears partial. We still treat it as a target square with:\n\n- **Frame ~7, center 2**, logically centered at (10,3).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Classify squares as sources or targets\n\nAs per the problem description for the test case:\n\n- **Sources (to be removed):**\n  - Frame 1 (S1, center 3)\n  - Frame 2 (S3, center 4)\n  - Frame 3 (S4, center 9)\n\n- **Targets (survive):**\n  - Frame 6 (S2, center 1)\n  - Partial frame 7 (center 2 at (10,3))\n\nFrom the sources, we build the mapping:\n\n- Frame color `1` \u2192 center `3`  (from S1)\n- Frame color `2` \u2192 center `4`  (from S3)\n- Frame color `3` \u2192 center `9`  (from S4)\n\n---\n\n## 4. Update centers of surviving targets\n\n### Target 1: Frame 6 square (S2)\n\n- Original center color: `1` (at cell (2,9)).\n- Look up frame color `1` in the source mapping: `1 \u2192 3` (from S1).\n- New center = `3`.\n\nResulting 3\u00d73 block at rows 1\u20133, cols 8\u201310 becomes:\n\n```\n6 6 6\n6 3 6\n6 6 6\n```\n\n### Target 2: Partial frame 7\n\n- Center cell is the `2` at (10,3).\n- Original center color: `2`.\n- Look up frame color `2` in mapping: `2 \u2192 4` (from S3).\n- New center = `4` at (10,3).\n\nNo other surviving square has center equal to `3`, so the `3 \u2192 9` mapping (from S4) is unused.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Remove all source squares\n\nSet all 9 cells of each source 3\u00d73 to 0:\n\n- **Remove S1** (rows 1\u20133, cols 4\u20136):\n\n  All these positions \u2192 0:\n  - (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)\n  - (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)\n  - (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)\n\n- **Remove S3** (rows 5\u20137, cols 2\u20134):\n\n  All these \u2192 0:\n  - (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)\n  - (6,2), (6,3), (6,4)\n  - (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)\n\n- **Remove S4** (rows 6\u20138, cols 6\u20138):\n\n  All these \u2192 0:\n  - (6,6), (6,7), (6,8)\n  - (7,6), (7,7), (7,8)\n  - (8,6), (8,7), (8,8)\n\nCrucially, none of those cells are color 5, so the 5-path remains exactly as it was.\n\n---\n\n## 6.

Multiple instances appear per grid at various positions.\n\n2. **Color 5 Path Structures**: Linear or angular arrangements of color 5 cells forming diagonal lines, L-shapes, or partial outlines that traverse the grid space between the framed squares.\n\n3. **Background**: Color 0 cells filling all remaining empty space.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n**Rules:**\n1. The color 5 path divides 3x3 framed squares into \"sources\" (enclosed/inside) and \"targets\" (outside/corners)\n2. Source squares are completely removed (replaced with 0)\n3. Target squares survive with updated centers\n4. Center update rule: If a target's center color C matches a removed source's frame color, the target's center becomes that source's center value\n5. The 5-path structure is preserved unchanged\n\n**Pattern:** Information flows from removed (source) squares to surviving (target) squares through the frame-center color relationship chain. Each surviving square's original center acts as a \"pointer\" to which removed square provides its new center value.\n\n**For Test Input:**\n- Frame 6 (center 1) and partial Frame 7 (center 2) should survive (outside 5-path enclosure)\n- Frames 1, 2, 3 should be removed (enclosed by 5-path)\n- Frame 6: center 1\u21923 (from removed Frame 1's center)\n- Frame 7: center 2\u21924 (from removed Frame 2's center)\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "To solve these grids I first look for the distinctive 3\u00d73 hollow squares: eight perimeter cells all the same colour with a different centre. Those are the only non\u20115, non\u20110 structures. The colour\u20115 cells form a barrier or \u201cpath\u201d that splits the set of squares into two groups. The squares on the inside of that path are treated as sources and are completely erased to background 0. The squares on the outside remain; their centres are changed by following a mapping: if a surviving square\u2019s original centre value equals the frame colour of one of the removed squares, its centre is replaced by that removed square\u2019s centre value. The colour\u20115 path itself is left untouched.\n\nIn the test input the 3\u00d73 squares are:\n- colour\u202f1 frame with centre\u202f3,\n- colour\u202f6 frame with centre\u202f1,\n- colour\u202f2 frame with centre\u202f4,\n- colour\u202f3 frame with centre\u202f9,\n- a partial colour\u202f7 frame at the bottom with centre\u202f2.\n\nFollowing the same pattern as the examples, the frames with colours\u202f1,\u202f2 and\u202f3 are inside the 5\u2011path and are removed; the colour\u202f6 and colour\u202f7 squares survive. The removed squares give a mapping 1\u21923 and 2\u21924. The centre of the colour\u202f6 square (originally 1) changes to\u202f3, and the centre of the partial colour\u202f7 square (originally 2) changes to\u202f4. All cells of the removed frames are set to 0; all colour\u20115 cells are preserved.\n\nThe resulting grid is:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,7,7,7,0,5,5,0,0,5\n0,7,4,7,0,0,0,5,5,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task Analysis and Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC problem involving the manipulation of 3x3 colored squares within a grid, connected by gray structures (color 5). The task revolves around object descriptions, transformation descriptions, and three solved examples to guide the process.\n\nMy immediate focus is on the transformation rules: understanding how \"source\" squares transfer their center color to \"destination\" squares. The descriptions highlight \"enclosed\" sources and the concept of vertical \"flows\" which is key. The grey color (color 5) structure is critical to trace the flow and identify sources and destinations.\n\nThe examples are used to validate the rules. Initially, Example 1 appears tricky, but by careful tracing and analysis, the pattern emerges. The core of the logic is: an enclosed square is a source, squares are source if they start a vertical stream on the grid half, and destinations take the source's color, while the structure remains.\n\nExample 2 is interesting as it seems to challenge the vertical flow rule, but further thought suggests that the \"enclosed\" rule might apply, so I re-evaluate the \"start of flow\" rule. Example 3 solidifies my hypothesis, and I derive a more robust hypothesis.\n\nBased on these observations, a refined strategy emerges: I must determine \"Sources\" and \"Destinations\" for a given configuration. I need to identify if a square is enclosed by a gray structure or positioned at the start of a vertical flow. If a square is enclosed, it\u2019s a source. If a square is at the start of a flow, it is also a source. Then, the center color of the sources are passed to the destinations.\n\nNow, I'll analyze the test input using this refined set of rules.\n\nIn the test input I identify, the main challenge involves interpreting the wire structure, and the potential relationships between the boxes. I observe a connection between three boxes on the left side of the grid (blue, enclosed red and bottom orange), and two boxes on the right side of the grid (magenta and green). The wires form an enclosure around the red box. The hypothesis is that color is passed upwards, so a key component is tracing the \"flow\" and interpreting whether boxes are sources or not. Through careful tracing, I determine the sources and the destinations.\n\nApplying my logic to the test input, I can derive the exact final output. I can now transform the boxes according to my identified flow rules. Now I construct the Output Grid to give to the ARC system.\n\n\nThe transformation involves moving the center color from \"Source\" 3x3 squares to \"Destination\" 3x3 squares via the gray (color 5) structure.\n\n**Rules inferred from examples:**\n1.  **Source Identification:**\n    *   **Enclosed Squares:** Any 3x3 square enclosed by the color 5 structure is a Source.\n    *   **Flow Start:** On the **left side** of the grid, the vertical flow is Bottom-to-Top (Bottom is Source, Top is Destination). On the **right side**, the flow is Top-to-Bottom (Top is Source, Bottom is Destination).\n2.  **Destination Identification:** Connected 3x3 squares at the receiving end of the flow become Destinations.\n3.  **Transfer:** The center pixel color of the Source is copied to the center of the Destination.\n4.  **Cleanup:** Source squares and unconnected/isolated squares are removed (replaced by background 0). Destination squares and the color 5 structure remain.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Left Side System:**\n    *   **Source:** The Red box (center 4) in the middle-left is enclosed by the gray structure. (The Orange box at bottom-left appears isolated from the main structure or is a secondary source overridden by the enclosed one).\n    *   **Destination:** The Blue box (center 3) at the top-left is connected to the structure. Based on \"Enclosed\" priority and \"Bottom-to-Top\" flow on the left, the Enclosed Red box transfers its color to the Top Blue box.\n    *   **Action:** Top-left Blue box center changes from 3 to **4**. The Red box and Orange box are removed.\n*   **Right Side System:**\n    *   **Source:** The Magenta box (center 1) is at the top-right. According to the \"Top-to-Bottom on the right\" rule, it is the Source.\n    *   **Destination:** The Green box (center 9) is in the middle-right. It acts as the Destination.\n    *   **Action:** Middle-right Green box center changes from 9 to **1**. The Magenta box is removed.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n*   **Retain:** All gray (5) pixels.\n*   **Update:**\n    *   Top-Left Square (rows 0-2, cols 3-5): Border 1, new Center **4**.\n    *   Middle-Right Square (rows 5-7, cols 5-7): Border 3, new Center **1**.\n*   **Remove:**\n    *   Top-Right Square (rows 0-2, cols 7-9).\n    *   Middle-Left Square (rows 4-6, cols 1-3).\n    *   Bottom-Left Square (rows 8-9, cols 1-3).\n\n0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,1,4,1,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0\n5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,3,3,3,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,3,1,3,0,5\n0,5,5,0,5,3,3,3,0,5\n0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0",

Source squares are typically those enclosed by the structure or positioned at the start of a vertical flow (Bottom-to-Top on the left, Top-to-Bottom on the right). Destination squares update their center pixel to match the Source's center pixel. After the transfer, Source squares and any unconnected squares are removed (replaced by background color 0), while Destination squares and the color 5 structure remain.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

Analyze the 5-structure and classify sources/destinations\n\nList all 5s:\n\n- r3: c0,1,2,3,4,8\n- r4: c0,4,8\n- r5: c0,4,8\n- r6: c0,4,9\n- r7: c1,2,4,9\n- r8: c5,6,9\n- r9: c7,8\n\nThese are all 8-connected, forming a single \u201cwire\u201d network.\n\nNow look at how the 3\u00d73 squares sit relative to this network.\n\n#### Square C (2-border, center 4)\n\nC (rows 4\u20136, cols 1\u20133) is clearly **enclosed** by a rectangular frame of 5s:\n\n- Left side: 5s at c0, rows 3\u20136.\n- Right side: 5s at c4, rows 3\u20136.\n- Top: 5s at row 3, cols 0\u20134.\n- Bottom: 5s at row 6, col0 & col4, plus more directly below.\n\nThis matches the \u201cenclosed by the structure\u201d prototype \u2192 **C is a source**.\n\nAlso, A and C are vertically aligned in overlapping columns with a 5 in between:\n\n- A uses columns 3\u20135; C uses 1\u20133.\n- Intersection: column 3.\n- Column 3 values: 1,1,1,5,2,2,2,0,7,7.\n- Between A (rows 0\u20132) and C (rows 4\u20136) we have row 3 value 5.\n\nSo there is a vertical 5-segment between them in col 3, making a left-side vertical flow **C \u2192 A** (bottom-to-top on the left, as seen in example 3).\n\nThus:\n- **Source** C (center 4) \u2192 **Destination** A (center becomes 4).\n\n#### Square B (6-border, center 1)\n\nB is at the top-right, and directly **above a vertical run of 5s** in column 8:\n\n- Column 8: 6,1,6,5,5,5,0,0,0,5.\n- A block of 5s at rows 3\u20135 is just below B (rows 0\u20132).\n\nThis matches \u201cstart of a vertical flow on the right (top-to-bottom)\u201d. In the examples:\n\n- Example 3: top-right square is source flowing down.\n- Example 2: a right-top square also acts as a source.\n\nSo we treat **B as a right-side source**.\n\nThe natural destination for B, on the right side and lower in the grid, is **D**: the 3-border 3\u00d73 at rows 5\u20137, cols 5\u20137, which is well-connected to the same 5-network (via 5s at (5,4), (6,4), (7,4), (8,5), (8,6), etc.). As in the examples, the right-side flow goes **top\u2192down**, so:\n\n- **Source** B (center 1) \u2192 **Destination** D (center becomes 1).\n\n#### Squares used and removed\n\nSo, in this interpretation:\n\n- Sources: **B** and **C**.\n- Destinations: **A** and **D**.\n- There are no 3\u00d73 squares left unpaired (so no additional \u201cunconnected\u201d squares to erase).\n\nConsistent with examples:\n\n- All 5s remain unchanged.\n- Sources\u2019 3\u00d73 regions are erased (to 0).\n- Destinations\u2019 borders remain; only their centers change to the appropriate source center color.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Apply the transformation\n\nStart from the input and update as follows.\n\n#### Change destination centers\n\n- A (rows 0\u20132, cols 3\u20135), center at (1,4):\n  - Old center: 3 \u2192 new center: **4** (from C).\n\n  So A becomes:\n  ```\n  1 1 1\n  1 4 1\n  1 1 1\n  ```\n\n- D (rows 5\u20137, cols 5\u20137), center at (6,6):\n  - Old center: 9 \u2192 new center: **1** (from B).\n\n  So D becomes:\n  ```\n  3 3 3\n  3 1 3\n  3 3 3\n  ```\n\n#### Erase source squares (set their 3\u00d73 to 0)\n\n- Erase C (rows 4\u20136, cols 1\u20133):\n\n  C region before:\n  ```\n  r4: 5 2 2 2 5 ...\n  r5: 5 2 4 2 5 ...\n  r6: 5 2 2 2 5 ...\n  ```\n\n  Only the 2/4/2 block at cols 1\u20133 is erased; the 5s at col 0 and col 4 stay.\n\n  After erasing C:\n\n  - r4: 5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0  \n  - r5: 5,0,0,0,5,3,3,3,5,0  \n  - r6: 5,0,0,0,5,3,1,3,0,5  (including D\u2019s updated center)\n\n- Erase B (rows 0\u20132, cols 7\u20139):\n\n  B region before:\n  ```\n  r0: ... 6 6 6\n  r1: ... 6 1 6\n  r2: ... 6 6 6\n  ```\n\n  After erasing B (set cols 7\u20139 to 0 in rows 0\u20132):\n\n  - r0: 0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0\n  - r1: 0,0,0,1,4,1,0,0,0,0\n  - r2: 0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0\n\nAll other cells (including all 5s and other colors outside these 3\u00d73 squares) remain as in the input.\n\n---\n\n### 4.

Color 5 Structures: Variable shapes including diagonal lines, \"C\" shapes, and rectangular frames that often enclose the 3x3 squares.\n3. Background: A field of color 0.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nThe transformation involves passing the center color from a \"Source\" 3x3 square to a connected \"Destination\" 3x3 square via the color 5 structure. Source squares are typically those enclosed by the structure or positioned at the start of a vertical flow (Bottom-to-Top on the left, Top-to-Bottom on the right). Destination squares update their center pixel to match the Source's center pixel. After the transfer, Source squares and any unconnected squares are removed (replaced by background color 0), while Destination squares and the color 5 structure remain.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "To reproduce the seen behaviour, start by finding all 3\u00d73 blocks with a uniform border colour and a distinct centre \u2013 these are the only \u201csquares\u201d of interest. Build a directed relation between squares: there is an arrow from square\u202fS to square\u202fT if the border colour of\u202fS equals the original centre colour of\u202fT. This gives disjoint chains of squares. For each chain, walk backwards from any sink (a square with no outgoing arrow) provided it has a predecessor; keep the sink and then every other predecessor, updating each kept square\u2019s centre to the original centre of its immediate predecessor. As soon as you reach a square with no predecessor you stop; all squares not kept this way, including isolated ones, are removed. The colour\u20115 structure is left untouched, and all other non\u2011kept colours are cleared to background 0.\n\nOn the test grid the squares are:\n- border\u202f6/centre\u202f1 at rows\u202f0\u20112, cols\u202f7\u20119,\n- border\u202f1/centre\u202f3 at rows\u202f0\u20112, cols\u202f3\u20115,\n- border\u202f2/centre\u202f4 at rows\u202f4\u20116, cols\u202f1\u20113,\n- border\u202f3/centre\u202f9 at rows\u202f5\u20117, cols\u202f5\u20117.\n\nThe arrows are 3\u21921 (from border\u202f1 square to the 6\u2011border square) and 9\u21923 (from the 3\u2011border square to the 1\u2011border square), forming the chain 9\u21923\u21921. The only sink with a predecessor is the 6\u2011border square, so it is kept with its centre set to 3; the other squares are removed. All non\u20115, non\u2011kept cells are set to 0.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0",

                "response": "**Here's how I see the objects in these grids:**\n\nOkay, so the task is to describe the *types* of objects in these grids, focusing on what they *are* rather than any inferred rules or relationships between grids. I'm limited to using numeric color values only, which means I'll be describing everything in terms of \"color X\" instead of, say, \"grey\" or \"red\".\n\nMy initial thought is to look for recurring patterns.  The first thing that jumps out are these 3x3 blocks. They seem to be everywhere, often with a different color in the center pixel compared to the surrounding eight pixels. That's a key attribute. It looks like they might be building blocks or even \"targets\" of a sort.\n\nThen there's this other object: it's made up *exclusively* of color 5. Sometimes it's a line or a zigzag, other times it forms an open shape like a \"C\" or even a complete box. Interesting! It seems to act as a divider or enclosure.\n\nFinally, there's the color 0, which is always the background. Not much to say there, but it's clearly there.\n\nLooking closer at Grid 7's complex shape, I see that this Color 5 structure can enclose the 3x3 block.\n\nSo, in short, I'm seeing three object types:\n\n*   **3x3 Blocks:** These have a border color and a center color.\n*   **Color 5 Structures:** These can take the form of lines, diagonals, or enclosing shapes like \"C\"s and rectangles.\n*   **Background:** Color 0.\n\nI think that gives a clear, objective summary, staying well within the provided constraints. No assumptions about the *meaning* of the patterns, just what they *are* in terms of color and basic structure.\n\n\nBased on the visual data provided in the grids, the objects can be categorized as follows:\n\n**1. 3x3 Multi-Color Squares**\nThe most common distinct objects are square blocks with dimensions of 3x3 pixels. These objects possess a specific internal structure:\n*   **Border:** The outer ring of 8 pixels consists of a single uniform color. Observed border colors include 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8.\n*   **Center:** The single central pixel (the distinct core) is usually a different color from the border. Observed center colors include 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9.\n*   **Attributes:** These squares appear in various locations throughout the grids. They exist independently or can be contained within other structures.\n\n**2. Color 5 Structures**\nThere is a distinct class of objects made exclusively of color 5. These shapes vary significantly in geometry compared to the uniform 3x3 squares:\n*   **Linear/Diagonal Patterns:** In some grids, color 5 appears as diagonal lines or zigzagging chains of pixels traversing the grid.\n*   **Enclosures/Containers:** In other instances, color 5 forms \"C\" shapes, open rectangles, or complete rectangular rings.\n*   **Interaction:** These enclosures often surround or \"hold\" one of the 3x3 Multi-Color Squares described above.\n\n**3. Background**\n*   The entire grid is set against a field of color 0, which serves as the negative space surrounding the objects.\n\n<objects_summary>\n1. 3x3 Squares: Blocks with a uniform single-color border and a distinct single-color center pixel.\n2.

                "response": "Okay, here\u2019s my understanding of how to transform these grids, based on the examples and test input. This is what I\u2019ve figured out:\n\n**Analysis of the Transformations**\n\n1.  **Object Identification**: I need to recognize 3x3 squares (defined by border and center colors) and the color 5 structures that connect or surround them.\n2.  **Connectivity via 5-Structures**: These structures are the \"wires\" that link the squares. They determine which squares are related.\n3.  **Source and Destination**: Key to the transformation is identifying which squares are sources of color and which are destinations.\n    *   **Enclosed Squares**: A big clue is if a square is completely enclosed within the 5-structure. These enclosed squares are always sources.\n    *   **Flow Direction:** The examples suggest a directional flow. In the examples the left side of the grid flows *upwards* (from bottom/mid to top), and the right side flows *downwards* (from top to bottom).\n4.  **Pairing and Transfer**:\n    *   I need to pair sources with destinations. The pairings are determined by the 5-structure connectivity.\n    *   A destination square will take on the center color of its source.\n    *   The source square disappears.\n5.  **Unused Squares Disappear**: If a square isn't paired up in a source-destination relationship, it\u2019s removed.\n6.  **Color 5 Structure Preservation**: The color 5 structure itself is largely static. It remains in the output, except where it overlaps a removed square.\n7.  **Overlapping Pixels:** When a surviving square has a pixel in the same place as the 5 structure, it overrules the 5 structure; otherwise, 5s are preserved.\n\n**Specific Transformation Steps for Test Input**\n\n1.  Keep the Color 5 Structure unchanged in the output.\n2.  Identify a Left Cluster (B, C, D) and a Right Cluster (A, E).\n3.  The enclosed Square C is always a Source. Apply the \"Upward flow\" from C to its vertical neighbors, B or D. From the enclosure rule C pairs with B.\n4.  Apply the \"Downward flow\" to the other cluster: Pair A (Source) flows to E (Destination)\n5.  Change the center color of the destination squares (B and E) to the center color of their respective source squares (C and A, respectively).\n6.  Remove the source squares (C and A) from the output.\n7.  Remove the unused square D.\n8.  Everything else will become the background color.\n\nThis will give the correct output grid, preserving the correct structure.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the examples and the test input, the transformations follow these rules:\n\n1.  **Object Identification**: The grid contains **3x3 Squares** (defined by a border color and a center color) and **Color 5 Structures** (acting as connecting wires or frames).\n2.  **Connectivity & Pairing**: The Color 5 structures connect the 3x3 squares. The squares form **Source-Destination pairs**.\n    *   **Enclosed Squares**: Squares fully or partially enclosed by the Color 5 structure act as **Sources**.\n    *   **Directional Flow**:\n        *   On the **Left side** of the grid, the flow tends to be **Upward** (Bottom/Middle $\\rightarrow$ Top).\n        *   On the **Right side** of the grid, the flow tends to be **Downward** (Top $\\rightarrow$ Bottom).\n    *   **Unpaired/Disconnected Squares**: Squares that are not part of a valid pairing (or are unused Sources/Destinations) are removed.\n3.  **Color Transfer**: The **Center Color** of the Source square is transferred to the Destination square.\n4.  **Final State**:\n    *   **Destination Squares** remain in the grid with their borders intact and their centers updated to the Source's center color.\n    *   **Source Squares** and **Unpaired Squares** are removed (pixels become 0).\n    *   **Color 5 Structures** persist in the output.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Left Cluster**:\n    *   **Square C** (Middle Left, Border 2, Center 4) is enclosed by 5s. It acts as a **Source**.\n    *   **Square B** (Top Left, Border 1, Center 3) and **Square D** (Bottom Left, Border 7, Center 2) are connected.\n    *   Following the **Upward flow** rule (and Enclosed $\\rightarrow$ Outside precedence), Source C connects to Destination B (Top).\n    *   **Transfer**: Square B's center changes from 3 to **4** (from C).\n    *   **Removal**: Square C (Source) and Square D (Unpaired) are removed.\n*   **Right Cluster**:\n    *   **Square A** (Top Right, Border 6, Center 1) and **Square E** (Middle Right, Border 3, Center 9) are connected by a vertical 5-structure.\n    *   Following the **Downward flow** rule, Source A (Top) connects to Destination E (Bottom).\n    *   **Transfer**: Square E's center changes from 9 to **1** (from A).\n    *   **Removal**: Square A (Source) is removed.\n\n<transformation_summary>\nThe transformation involves passing the center color from a \"Source\" 3x3 square to a connected \"Destination\" 3x3 square via the color 5 structure.

Color 5 Structures: Variable shapes including diagonal lines, \"C\" shapes, and rectangular frames that often enclose the 3x3 squares.\n3. Background: A field of color 0.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nThe transformation involves passing the center color from a \"Source\" 3x3 square to a connected \"Destination\" 3x3 square via the color 5 structure. Source squares are typically those enclosed by the structure or positioned at the start of a vertical flow (Bottom-to-Top on the left, Top-to-Bottom on the right). Destination squares update their center pixel to match the Source's center pixel. After the transfer, Source squares and any unconnected squares are removed (replaced by background color 0), while Destination squares and the color 5 structure remain.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
