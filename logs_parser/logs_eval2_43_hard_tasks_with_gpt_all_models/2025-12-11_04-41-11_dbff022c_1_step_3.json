Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**Solution Discovery and Verification**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm thinking about this. The user wants me to solve an ARC task, and I need to figure out the pattern.\n\n**Understanding the Task**\n\nThe input is a 2D grid, and the output is another 2D grid of the same size. Seems straightforward.\n\n**Initial Observations**\n\nLooking at the first example, I'm noticing \"frames\" of color - basically, shapes with borders and an inside area, like rectangles or 'C' shapes. Then there's this block of numbers nearby, but I'm not sure what it is yet.\n\nI'm seeing that these frames might be getting filled with a color, but *why*? It seems related to this block nearby. I\u2019m thinking there must be some mapping between colors happening. I'm noting, some frames aren't getting filled. Looks like only shapes with a \"closed\" interior get filled.\n\n**Hypothesis Formation**\n\nI'm starting to think this nearby \"block\" of numbers is a key. Each input color is linked to some output color based on pairs of numbers within the block. I\u2019m imagining that the frames (closed shapes) are filled with a specific color from these \"keys\" when they match the key colors.\n\n**Refining the Hypothesis**\n\nI looked at the second and third examples and confirmed it - this block is *key*, but its orientation is important. Its dimensions influence whether pairs of colors are interpreted vertically (top-to-bottom) or horizontally (left-to-right). I think the orientation is defined by key block\u2019s geometry.\n\n**The Rule**\n\nHere's the rule:\n1.  Identify the rectangular Key Block within the grid (it's separate from the shapes).\n2.  Check the dimensions: if width >= height, pairs are vertical, otherwise pairs are horizontal.\n3.  The top or left color is the key/target color. The bottom or right color is the fill color.\n4.  For closed shapes, if the shape color matches a color *key*, then fill it with the paired fill color.\n5.  Everything else stays the same.\n\n**Applying to Test Input**\n\nFor the test input, there's a key block at the bottom. Since its width is greater than its height, pairs go vertical. So, 5 maps to 9, 4 maps to 8, and so on.\n\nThe grid has blue, green, grey, and red shapes, but only the gray shape color matches the key. This makes sense from the provided examples. The gray shape interior becomes 9. The other shapes remain untouched (or 0).\n\n**Detailed Checks**\n\nI double-checked that the fill area correctly identified a closed area.\nI carefully reviewed everything, including color mapping.\n\n**Output Grid Structure**\n\nFor the final answer, I\u2019m giving a human-readable explanation, with the final filled grid.\n\n\nTo solve this task, we need to understand the relationship between the \"key\" block and the hollow shapes present in the grid.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Examples**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Shapes:** A yellow (4) frame, a green (3) shape, and an orange (7) shape.\n    *   **Key Block:** A 2x5 block of numbers at the top-right.\n        Row 0: `3, 4, 6, 9, 5`\n        Row 1: `3, 6, 7, 2, 9`\n        Dimensions: Width 5, Height 2. Since Width $\\ge$ Height, the mapping is **vertical** (Top Row $\\to$ Bottom Row).\n    *   **Mapping:** `3->3`, `4->6`. (Other keys `6, 9, 5` do not match any shape colors).\n    *   **Result:** The Yellow (4) frame is filled with `6`. The Green (3) frame is filled with `3` (solid). The Orange (7) frame is unchanged because `7` is not in the top row of the key.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Shapes:** A teal (8) frame, a gray (5) shape, and a yellow (4) frame.\n    *   **Key Block:** A 4x2 block at the top-left.\n        `2, 6`\n        `4, 5`\n        `6, 8`\n        `8, 1`\n        Dimensions: Height 4, Width 2. Since Height $>$ Width, the mapping is **horizontal** (Left Column $\\to$ Right Column).\n    *   **Mapping:** `2->6`, `4->5`, `6->8`, `8->1`.\n    *   **Result:** The Yellow (4) frame is filled with `5`. The Teal (8) frame is filled with `1`. The Gray (5) shape is unchanged because `5` is not in the left column.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Shapes:** A yellow (4) frame and a red (2) frame.\n    *   **Key Block:** A 2x2 block at the top-left.\n        `2, 6`\n        `7, 1`\n        Dimensions: Width 2, Height 2. Following the logic from Ex 1 (W$\\ge$H), mapping is **vertical**.\n    *   **Mapping:** `2->7`, `6->1`.\n    *   **Result:** The Red (2) frame is filled with `7`. The Yellow (4) frame is unchanged.\n\n**Rule:** \n1.  Identify the rectangular **Key Block** (a solid block of digits distinct from the hollow shapes).\n2.  Determine orientation:\n    *   If **Width $\\ge$ Height**: Map **Top Row** (Shape Color) $\\to$ **Bottom Row** (Fill Color).\n    *   If **Height $>$ Width**: Map **Left Column** (Shape Color) $\\to$ **Right Column** (Fill Color).\n3.  For each hollow shape in the grid, if its color exists as a Key, fill its enclosed `0`s with the corresponding Fill Color.\n\n**Step 2: Apply to Test Input**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:**\n    *   **Key Block:** Located at the bottom-left (Rows 11-12, Cols 0-4).\n        `5, 4, 6, 7, 8`\n        `9, 8, 3, 1, 2`\n        Dimensions: Width 5, Height 2.\n    *   **Shapes:**\n        *   Blue (1) frame at top-left.\n        *   Green (3) frame at top-right.\n        *   Gray (5) frame at middle-right.\n        *   Red (2) shapes at middle-left and bottom-right.\n\n2.  **Determine Mapping:**\n    *   Since Width (5) $\\ge$ Height (2), the mapping is **vertical** (Top $\\to$ Bottom).\n    *   Pairs: `5->9`, `4->8`, `6->3`, `7->1`, `8->2`.\n\n3.  **Execute Transformation:**\n    *   **Shape 1 (Blue):** Key `1` is not in the map. No change.\n    *   **Shape 3 (Green):** Key `3` is not in the map. No change.\n    *   **Shape 5 (Gray):** Key `5` is in the map (`5->9`). **Fill interior with 9.**\n    *   **Shape 2 (Red):** Key `2` is not in the map. No change.\n\n4.  **Fill Shape 5:**\n    *   The Gray (5) shape encloses `0`s at:\n        *   Row 6: Columns 8, 9, 10.\n        *   Row 7: Columns 8, 9, 10, 11.\n    *   These pixels change from `0` to `9`.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\nThe grid remains identical to the input, except for the 7 pixels inside the gray loop which become `9`.\n\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,5,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,9,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Strategy for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task. The user wants me to identify a pattern and apply it. I see three examples provided, and my task is to understand the transformation happening in each, especially related to the input and output grids.\n\nI start by looking at Example 1. I notice the size of the input and output grids is identical. I observe different shapes in each example: a hollow yellow rectangle-ish shape, a green one that looks like a container, and an orange one. My initial thought is to analyze the pixel values of the shapes and how they change (or don't) between input and output.\n\nI hone in on the changes in Example 1. I figure out that filled pixels change their color based on some key, a pixel of the same color, or something adjacent to said pixels, I'm not yet sure. I try to establish a connection between \"noise\" pixels outside the shapes and the transformation. I am particularly curious about why the yellow shape changes, the green shape fills with its own color, and the orange shape remains unchanged. I notice that the filled pixels are not from the interior of the input shape, but adjacent (or not at all). I attempt to correlate the output color to the input color.\n\nMoving to Example 2, I try to identify a logic to the color mapping. I notice the presence of \"noise\" pixels near the shapes. I realize the fill color has something to do with a pixel in these non-shape regions. I try to determine what the noise might represent: a key, a pattern, something. I look at Example 2, and again, I see the noise pixels. I see shapes of different colors that undergo transformation. I'm keen to determine a general logic.\n\nI try to make a rule based on what I observe. I think about possible correlations between the color of a shape and the color used to fill it. I hypothesize that the color of the neighboring pixel next to this shape is the defining element of what the shape's hole is filled with.\n\nI test this hypothesis. I go back to Example 1, check the \"noise\", and compare it to the changes in the shapes. I consider the specific location of the shape's original color in relation to adjacent pixels in the non-shape block. I see that this does not fully explain why some shapes fill and others do not. This reveals a problem. I attempt to make other rules, for example, self-mapping if a rule does not work, but then the original problem of shapes that remain unchanged remains.\n\nI try to build a more complex theory. I observe that the \"noise block\" (non-shape pixels) has varying dimensions. Maybe the noise block's dimensions define the direction for a certain mapping. I then think it's possible that the orientation of this block matters - whether it's more wide or tall. I hypothesize that the orientation of this noise block is what determines how the color changes from the input to the output.\n\nI test this hypothesis. I start with Example 1, consider that if the block is wide, then the mapping is directional. For Example 1 I realize this \"Neighbor Below\" direction works perfectly. I then test the same hypothesis on the other examples.\n\nOn Example 2, it fails. So I test another idea, which leads to \"Neighbor Right\" direction, which is related to the noise block being \"tall\". And I get a strong result.\n\nOn Example 3, I am able to use the \"Neighbor Below\" idea. So I test again the wide/tall mapping theory. I realize it holds. If wide, \"Down\", and if tall, \"Right\", and if square, \"Down\". This theory works - the orientation of this noise block determines the mapping.\n\nSo, I revise my rule: I look at the noise block to identify its dimensions and the colors involved. The wider/taller rule defines the fill. Now I need to define the fill method. Is it symmetric? No. Is it the neighbor? Yes. This also applies to the Test Input.\n\nSo I analyze the test input. There are shapes with enclosed spaces. There is also a noise block at the bottom. This is wide (5x2). It implies a mapping from top to bottom. This direction is crucial. I check the pixels and decide how the fill will work. Only one shape fills with this specific rule.\n\nTo confirm I understood, I go back to the previous examples, confirm that the direction is important, and make sure that this rule is consistent with what I have seen. I also try to create a set of actions: locate, fill, leave holes as they are.\n\nThe last step is to build the output grid with the shapes and holes. And the code is ready.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on a rule inferred from the solved examples.\n\n**1. Analyze the Input and Output**\nThe grids contain \"shapes\" (hollow, closed loops of a specific color containing 0s) and a \"noise block\" (a rectangular cluster of various colored pixels).\n- **Goal:** Fill the hollow interiors of the shapes with a specific color derived from the noise block.\n\n**2. Infer the Transformation Rule**\nLet's analyze the relationship between the shapes, the noise block, and the fill colors in the examples.\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Noise Block:** 2 rows x 5 columns (Width > Height). It is a \"wide\" block.\n    *   **Mapping:** The shapes are filled based on a vertical correspondence in the noise block.\n        *   Yellow (4) shape: Color 4 is in the top row of the noise. Below it is 6. The shape fills with 6.\n        *   Green (3) shape: Color 3 is in the top row. Below it is 3. The shape fills with 3.\n        *   Orange (7) shape: Color 7 is in the bottom row. There is no row below it. The shape is *not* filled (remains 0).\n    *   **Rule inferred:** If the noise block is wide, map **Top Row Color -> Bottom Row Color**. Only colors found in the top row trigger a fill.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Noise Block:** 4 rows x 2 columns (Height > Width). It is a \"tall\" block.\n    *   **Mapping:** The shapes are filled based on a horizontal correspondence.\n        *   Teal (8) shape: Color 8 is in the left column. To its right is 1. Shape fills with 1.\n        *   Yellow (4) shape: Color 4 is in the left column. To its right is 5. Shape fills with 5.\n        *   Grey (5) shape: Color 5 is in the right column. There is no column to its right. Shape is *not* filled.\n    *   **Rule inferred:** If the noise block is tall, map **Left Column Color -> Right Column Color**. Only colors found in the left column trigger a fill.\n\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Noise Block:** 2 rows x 2 columns (Square).\n    *   **Mapping:** Red (2) shape fills with 7. In the noise block, 2 is in the top row, 7 is directly below it.\n    *   **Rule inferred:** Square blocks follow the \"wide\" rule (Top -> Bottom).\n\n**General Rule:**\n1.  Identify the **Noise Block**.\n2.  Determine direction:\n    *   If **Width >= Height**: The mapping is **Down** (Top Row Value -> Bottom Row Value).\n    *   If **Height > Width**: The mapping is **Right** (Left Column Value -> Right Column Value).\n3.  For each shape in the grid:\n    *   Find its color in the **Source** (Top Row or Left Column) of the noise block.\n    *   If found, fill the shape's interior with the corresponding **Target** color (Bottom Row or Right Column).\n    *   If the color is not in the source position (e.g., it's in the bottom row/right column or missing), do not fill the shape.\n\n**3. Apply to Test Input**\n*   **Noise Block:** Located at the bottom-left (Rows 11-12, Cols 0-4).\n    *   Row 11 (Top): `5, 4, 6, 7, 8`\n    *   Row 12 (Bottom): `9, 8, 3, 1, 2`\n    *   Dimensions: 5x2 (Width > Height).\n    *   **Direction:** Down (Top -> Bottom).\n    *   **Mapping Pairs:** 5->9, 4->8, 6->3, 7->1, 8->2.\n\n*   **Shapes:**\n    1.  **Shape 5 (Grey):** Color 5 is in the Top Row of the noise block. Its partner below is 9. **Fill with 9.**\n    2.  **Shape 1 (Blue):** Color 1 is NOT in the Top Row (it is in the bottom). **No Fill.**\n    3.  **Shape 3 (Green):** Color 3 is NOT in the Top Row. **No Fill.**\n    4.  **Shape 2 (Red):** Color 2 is NOT in the Top Row. **No Fill.**\n\n*   **Execution:**\n    *   Locate the interior of the Grey (5) shape. It spans rows 6-7 and columns 8-11.\n    *   Change the 0s inside this shape to 9s.\n    *   Leave all other pixels unchanged.\n\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,5,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,9,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0",

For shapes whose border color is a **key** in the lookup table, fill their interior with the corresponding **value**\n\n**Analyzing the examples:**\n\nIn Example 1: Key pairs are at top-right (cols 7-11, rows 0-1), read vertically: (4,6), (6,7), (9,2), (5,9), (3,3). The 4-rectangle gets filled with 6, the 3-rectangle with 3.\n\nIn Example 2: Key pairs at top-left (cols 0-1, rows 0-3): (2,6), (4,5), (6,8), (8,1). The 8-rectangle gets filled with 1, the 4-rectangle with 5.\n\nIn Example 3: Key pairs at cols 1-2: (2,7), (6,1). The 2-rectangle gets filled with 7.\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n\nThe key-value table is at bottom-left (rows 11-12, cols 0-4):\n```\n5,4,6,7,8\n9,8,3,1,2\n```\nGiving pairs: (5\u21929), (4\u21928), (6\u21923), (7\u21921), (8\u21922)\n\n**Keys: 5, 4, 6, 7, 8**\n\nShapes in the grid:\n- **1-shape** (border color 1): 1 is NOT a key (it's a value for 7)\n- **3-shape** (border color 3): 3 is NOT a key (it's a value for 6)  \n- **5-shape** (border color 5): 5 IS a key \u2192 fill interior with 9\n- **2-shapes** (border color 2): 2 is NOT a key (it's a value for 8)\n\nThe 5-shape spans rows 5-9, cols 7-12. Its interior cells (enclosed 0s) are:\n- Row 6, cols 8-10 (between left boundary at col 7 and right at col 11)\n- Row 7, cols 8-11 (between left boundary at col 7 and right at col 12)\n\nThese get filled with 9.\n\n```\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,5,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,9,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify:\n1. A **key/lookup table** that maps colors to fill colors\n2. **Shapes** made of a single color with enclosed interior 0s\n3. The rule: if a shape's color appears as a \"source\" in the key, fill its interior 0s with the corresponding \"target\" color\n\n**Analyzing the examples:**\n\n- Example 1: Key is at top-right (horizontal format: row 0 = sources [3,4,6,9,5], row 1 = targets [3,6,7,2,9]). The 4-shape gets filled with 6 (4\u21926), 3-shape with 3 (3\u21923), but 7-shape stays unfilled (7 not a source).\n\n- Example 2: Key is at top-left (vertical format). Mappings: 2\u21926, 4\u21925, 6\u21928, 8\u21921. The 8-shape fills with 1, 4-shape fills with 5, but 5-shape stays unfilled (5 not a source).\n\n- Example 3: Key at top-left. Column reading: 2\u21927, 6\u21921. The 2-shape gets filled with 7.\n\n**For the test input:**\n\nThe key is at rows 11-12, cols 0-4:\n```\n5,4,6,7,8\n9,8,3,1,2\n```\nMappings: 5\u21929, 4\u21928, 6\u21923, 7\u21921, 8\u21922\n\n**Shapes identified:**\n- 1-shape (rows 0-3, cols 1-5): Color 1 is NOT a source \u2192 no fill\n- 3-shape (rows 0-3, cols 8-11): Color 3 is NOT a source \u2192 no fill  \n- 5-shape (rows 5-9, cols 7-12): Color 5 IS a source (5\u21929) \u2192 fill interior with 9\n\n**Finding the 5-shape interior:**\nThe 5s form a boundary at:\n- Row 5: cols 8,9,10\n- Row 6: cols 7,11\n- Row 7: cols 7,12\n- Row 8: cols 8,9,10,11,12\n\nThe enclosed 0s that cannot reach the exterior are at: (6,8), (6,9), (6,10), (7,8), (7,9), (7,10), (7,11). These get filled with 9.\n\n```\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,5,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,9,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "First, I'll describe the pattern I extracted from the training examples, then show how I apply it to the test input.\n\n---\n\n## Reasoning from the examples\n\nAcross the examples there is a consistent sub\u2011pattern concerning *hollow rectangular loops* (\u201cframes\u201d):\n\n- A single color forms a 1\u2011pixel thick rectangular frame.\n- The interior of the frame is all 0s.\n- That color also appears **elsewhere** in the grid as some other (non\u2011frame) occurrence.\n- In the output, the **interior zeros of that frame** are turned into a *single other color*, while everything else remains unchanged.\n\nExamples:\n\n- **Example 2**\n  - Color 8: a 4\u00d74 rectangular frame at top\u2011right, and other 8s elsewhere.\n    - Interior 2\u00d72 zeros are changed to 1.\n  - Color 4: a 5\u00d73 rectangular frame at bottom\u2011right, and another 4 at (2,1).\n    - Its two interior zeros are changed to 5.\n- **Example 3**\n  - Color 2: a 4\u00d74 rectangular frame at the right, and another 2 at (1,2).\n    - Two interior zeros are changed to 7.\n\nIn each such case, we:\n1. Detect a hollow rectangular loop of a given color.\n2. Confirm that color also occurs elsewhere, not just in the loop.\n3. Replace all 0s inside that loop by a **single nonzero color**, determined by the example\u2011specific pairing between colors.\n4. Leave everything else unchanged.\n\nThere are other effects in the training tasks (e.g. the 3\u2011region in Example 1 being \u201csolidified\u201d), but for the purpose of the new test input, the repeatable and relevant part is *only* the \u201cfill the interior of a hollow frame with a single color\u201d operation.\n\n---\n\n## Applying this to the test input\n\n### 1. Identify hollow rectangular loops\n\nLooking at the test grid:\n\nTop\u2011right, rows 1\u20134 and columns 9\u201312:\n\n- Rows 1\u20134, cols 9\u201312:\n\n  - r1: 3 3 3 3  \n  - r2: 3 0 0 3  \n  - r3: 3 0 0 3  \n  - r4: 3 3 3 3  \n\nThis is exactly a 4\u00d74 frame of color **3** with a 2\u00d72 block of zeros inside: a classic hollow rectangle.\n\nAlso, there is at least one other 3 elsewhere (e.g. row 13, column 3), so 3 satisfies the \u201ccolor also appears elsewhere\u201d condition.\n\nThe 1\u2011shape on the left is not a simple rectangular frame; it\u2019s irregular, so under the pattern I\u2019m extracting (which targets clean rectangular frames as in Examples 2 and 3), I do **not** treat it as one of these \u201cfill\u2011the\u2011hole\u201d frames.\n\nLikewise, the 5\u2011region below is not a 1\u2011thick axis\u2011aligned rectangle enclosing a single interior void; it\u2019s a more complex plus\u2011like shape, and in the examples, such irregular shapes (like the 5\u2011region in Example 2) were left unchanged.\n\nSo in the test input, the **only** clear \u201cframe to be filled\u201d of the kind used in the repeatable examples is the 3\u2011frame at rows 1\u20134, cols 9\u201312.\n\n### 2. Choose the fill color\n\nFrom the training examples, every such frame is filled with a **single** non\u2011zero color that is present somewhere else in the grid, paired to the frame color. The exact pairing mechanism between colors is not fully uniform across all examples, but for a new frame color not previously seen in a frame (here, 3), the safest generalization that respects:\n\n- \u201cInterior becomes a single, distinct color\u201d\n- \u201cThat color already exists in the grid, and is associated (adjacent) with the frame color elsewhere\u201d\n\nis:\n\n> Pick a color that already appears adjacent to another occurrence of the frame color and use that as the interior color.\n\nIn the test grid, there is a non\u2011frame occurrence of 3 at (13,3). Its vertical neighbor above at (12,3) is color **6**. This gives a natural pairing (3,6). Following the pattern \u201cuse an existing color paired with the frame color as the fill,\u201d I fill the 3\u2011frame interior with **6**.\n\nThus, cells inside the 3\u2011frame that are 0 become 6; all other cells remain unchanged.\n\n### 3. Actual modifications\n\nThe 3\u2011frame interior cells are:\n\n- (row 2, col 10)\n- (row 2, col 11)\n- (row 3, col 10)\n- (row 3, col 11)\n\nThey are 0s in the input and become 6s in the output.\n\nEverything else stays the same.\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\nHere is the completed output grid:\n\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0  \n0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,6,6,3,0  \n0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,6,6,3,0  \n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0  \n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0  \n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5  \n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0  \n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0  \n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "First, I\u2019ll describe the pattern I infer from the three training examples, then apply it to the test grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the training examples are doing\n\nAcross the three examples, two consistent ideas appear:\n\n1. **Some colors act as \u201cframe\u201d or \u201cregion\u201d colors**:  \n   They form a closed shape (often roughly rectangular or at least surrounding an area) where there are 0-cells fully enclosed by that color.\n\n2. **For some of these frame colors, there is a *paired* \u201cfill color\u201d**:  \n   This pairing is specified somewhere else in the grid by a small arrangement of colored cells \u2013 essentially a miniature \u201clegend\u201d.\n\nThen the transformation is:\n\n> For each frame color that has a defined mapping (frame \u2192 fill), fill the 0-cells that are *enclosed* by that frame color with the mapped fill color.\n\nThis is exactly what happens in the training grids:\n\n### Example 1\n\n- There is a **2\u00d75 legend block** in the top right: rows 1\u20132, columns 8\u201312:\n\n  ```\n  row1: 3 4 6 9 5\n  row2: 3 6 7 2 9\n  ```\n\n  Interpret row1 \u2192 row2, columnwise, as mappings:\n  - 3 \u2192 3\n  - 4 \u2192 6\n  - 6 \u2192 7\n  - 9 \u2192 2\n  - 5 \u2192 9\n\n- Frame/region colors with enclosed zeros:\n  - Color 4 forms a perfect rectangular frame (rows 1\u20133, cols 2\u20136) enclosing two zeros.\n  - Color 3 forms a larger irregular region that encloses a cluster of zeros (a \u201chole\u201d).\n\n- Apply mappings:\n  - 4 has mapping 4 \u2192 6, so the two enclosed zeros become 6.\n  - 3 has mapping 3 \u2192 3, so its enclosed \u201chole\u201d of zeros is filled with 3.\n  - Color 7 also has an enclosed hole region, but 7 is **not** a source in the legend, so its zeros are left as 0.\n\nThat exactly matches the Example 1 output.\n\n### Example 2\n\n- The most conspicuous \u201clegend\u201d area is the 4\u00d72 block at rows 1\u20134, columns 1\u20132:\n\n  ```\n  col1  col2\n   2     6\n   4     5\n   6     8\n   8     1\n  ```\n\n  Interpret column 1 \u2192 column 2, rowwise:\n  - 2 \u2192 6\n  - 4 \u2192 5\n  - 6 \u2192 8\n  - 8 \u2192 1\n\n- Frame/region colors with enclosed zeros:\n  - Color 8: the rectangular frame at rows 1\u20134, cols 5\u20138, with a 2\u00d72 block of zeros inside.\n  - Color 4: the rectangular frame at rows 6\u201310, cols 8\u201310, with two isolated 0-cells inside.\n  - Color 5 also has an internal 0-cluster, but 5 is **not** a \u201cfrom\u201d color in this legend.\n\n- Apply mappings:\n  - 8 \u2192 1, so the internal 0s in the 8-frame become 1.\n  - 4 \u2192 5, so the internal 0s in the 4-frame become 5.\n  - 5 has no entry on the left side of the legend, so its internal zeros are left unchanged.\n\nThis matches Example 2\u2019s output exactly.\n\n### Example 3\n\n- A small 2\u00d72 legend block appears at rows 1\u20132, columns 2\u20133:\n\n  ```\n  row1: 2 6\n  row2: 7 1\n  ```\n\n  Read row1 \u2192 row2, columnwise:\n  - 2 \u2192 7\n  - 6 \u2192 1\n\n- Frame/region colors with enclosed zeros:\n  - Color 2: a rectangular frame at columns 11\u201314, rows 1\u20134, with two internal zeros.\n  - Color 4 also forms a frame-like band, but it has no mapping in this legend.\n\n- Apply:\n  - 2 \u2192 7, so the internal 0s in the 2-frame become 7.\n  - 4 has no mapping, so its internal zeros remain 0.\n\nAgain, this matches the Example 3 output.\n\nKey observation:  \nAcross all examples, **only those colors that appear as \u201cfrom\u201d colors in the legend are used to fill holes**, and they are filled with the corresponding \u201cto\u201d color. If a color has no entry in the legend, its enclosed zeros are left unchanged.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying the rule to the test input\n\n### 2.1. Identify the legend\n\nIn the test grid, the obvious legend is in the last two rows (rows 12 and 13):\n\nRow 12:\n`5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0`\n\nRow 13:\n`9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0`\n\nTake columns where both entries are non-zero and map row 12 \u2192 row 13:\n\n- Column 1: 5 \u2192 9\n- Column 2: 4 \u2192 8\n- Column 3: 6 \u2192 3\n- Column 4: 7 \u2192 1\n- Column 5: 8 \u2192 2\n- Column 10: 2 \u2192 0 (we can note this, but filling with 0 doesn\u2019t change anything)\n- Column 11: 0 \u2192 2 (source is 0 \u2013 we don\u2019t treat 0 as a frame color)\n- Column 12: 2 \u2192 0\n\nSo the relevant mappings for non-zero frame colors are:\n\n- 5 \u2192 9  \n- 4 \u2192 8  \n- 6 \u2192 3  \n- 7 \u2192 1  \n- 8 \u2192 2  \n- 2 \u2192 0  (effectively \u201cno-op\u201d if applied to zeros)\n\n### 2.2. Find frame/region colors with enclosed zeros\n\nNow examine each color that appears as a source in the legend: {5,4,6,7,8,2}.\n\nWe are looking for connected components of that color that **enclose one or more 0-cells**, such that those 0-cells are 4-connectedly surrounded by that color (i.e., they are \u201choles\u201d for that color).\n\n#### Color 5\n\nThe 5s (ignoring the legend rows) are in rows 6\u201310, around columns 8\u201313:\n\nSubgrid rows 6\u201310, cols 8\u201313:\n\n```\nr6: 0 5 5 5 0 0\nr7: 5 0 0 0 5 0\nr8: 5 0 0 0 0 5\nr9: 0 5 5 5 5 5\nr10:0 5 0 0 0 0\n     c8 c9 c10 c11 c12 c13\n```\n\nCompute the 0-clusters relative to color 5. The central 0-region comprising:\n\n- (7,9), (7,10), (7,11),\n- (8,9), (8,10), (8,11), (8,12)\n\nis completely surrounded (in the 4-neighborhood sense) by 5s. No path of 0s leads from these cells out of the 5 region to the background.\n\nHence this set of 7 cells is a **hole inside the 5-region**.\n\nOther zeros near 5s (e.g., at (10,10) and below) *do* have paths through zeros to the outside background, so they are not enclosed and therefore **not** filled.\n\nSince 5 has a legend mapping 5 \u2192 9, this is precisely the region we must fill with 9.\n\n#### Other legend \u201cfrom\u201d colors\n\n- Color 4: appears only at (12,2); single pixel, no enclosed zeros.\n- Color 6: appears at (12,3); no region, no hole.\n- Color 7: at (12,4); single pixel.\n- Color 8: at (12,5) and (13,2); no frame-like region, no enclosed zeros.\n- Color 2: scattered (rows 7,8,9,11,12,13) but no closed frame or region that encloses zero-only holes.\n\nSo **only color 5** has an enclosed 0-hole region in the main body of the test grid.\n\nColors 1 and 3 at the top form shapes with internal zeros, but there is **no legend entry using 1 or 3 as source colors**, so by the rule inferred from the examples, their internal zeros are *not* filled and remain 0.\n\n### 2.3. Apply mapping to fill the 5-hole\n\nUsing the mapping 5 \u2192 9, recolor the enclosed zeros:\n\n- Row 7, columns 9\u201311: 0 \u2192 9\n- Row 8, columns 9\u201312: 0 \u2192 9\n\nAll other cells remain unchanged.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

        "Full raw LLM response": "The solved examples show that the transformation acts on connected components that form axis\u2011aligned rectangles: the component\u2019s bounding box has all four corners in the component, and there are zeroes inside that box. Such a \u201cframe\u201d is only processed if the same colour occurs in a separate component elsewhere. To determine the fill colour, pick one of those external components such that the neighbour in a fixed direction is non\u2011zero: if the external component lies on the top row, take the cell below it; otherwise take the cell to its right. All zero cells within the bounding box of the rectangular frame, including on its edges, are then set to this neighbour colour; other cells remain unchanged.\n\nIn the test input there is one such frame: the block of 3s at rows\u202f1\u20134, cols\u202f9\u201312. It has an external 3 at (13,\u202f3); since it is not on the top row, we take its right neighbour, which is 1, as the fill colour. The four interior zeroes are changed to 1.\n\nApplying this gives:\n\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,1,1,3,0\n0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,1,1,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "I looked for the pattern behind the changes in the given examples. In the cases that were changed there were exactly two connected components of a given colour: a larger, frame\u2011like component with gaps along a horizontal span, and a single \u201cclue\u201d pixel of the same colour elsewhere. The colour to fill the gaps is taken from a non\u2011zero neighbour of the clue pixel (in these examples the neighbour to the right was used unless the clue pixel was on the top row).\n\nFor the test grid there are two such colours:\n\n- Colour\u202f3: a rectangular frame at rows\u202f1\u20134, cols\u202f9\u201312, and a single 3 at (13,\u202f3) with a right neighbour 1. Fill the zeros between 3\u2019s in rows\u202f2 and\u202f3 of that frame with 1.\n\n- Colour\u202f1: the top\u2011left block at rows\u202f1\u20134, cols\u202f2\u20136, and a single 1 at (13,\u202f4) with a right neighbour 2. Fill the zeros between 1\u2019s in rows\u202f2 and\u202f3 of that block with 2.\n\nAll other cells remain as in the input.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,2,2,2,1,0,0,3,1,1,3,0\n0,1,1,2,2,1,0,0,3,1,1,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0",
