        "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, here's my breakdown of how I'm approaching this ARC task. Essentially, I'm trying to figure out how these 20x20 grids are being transformed, focusing on a few key ideas.**\n\nFirst, I see that the inputs and outputs are grids of numbers, specifically 0-9. My goal is to deduce the transformation rule that connects them. I'm noticing \"agents,\" which seem to be pixels with the value '4', and they are moving within \"rooms\" defined by other pixel values like '5' and '7'. The goal is to figure out the exact logic behind their movement based on what is happening in the provided examples.\n\nMy initial hypothesis is that '4's are moving in a particular direction within a container based on a specific logic.  I'm looking for patterns, especially in the areas immediately surrounding these '4's.\n\nI'm checking out Example 1 and examining each of the grids, both input and output, side-by-side to understand the transformation in steps. I'm focusing on the movement of these '4's and how they are changing between the input and output grids. Also, I'm looking for a \"legend,\" that I believe describes this movement, especially in the 5x5 colored boxes present in the upper corners.\n\nI noticed that sometimes the '4's move horizontally (right or left) and sometimes vertically (up/down). I'm also finding that 4s can be moved diagonally. To further refine my guess, I'm noting that the movement seems related to the color of the \"container\" surrounding the '4's and the position of the 1s and 2s inside the container. My hypothesis is that there is a \"direction\" implied by the position of '1' and '2' in the container's legend, with the '2' representing the goal. The '4' always tries to move as far as possible in that implied direction before being stopped.\n\nLooking at Example 2, this vertical component, specifically a diagonal move to the bottom-right, further solidifies this theory, with the legend box serving as a guide for the direction of movement. I'm seeing that the '4' moves until it hits a wall. I'm noting this is also related to the structure and that there are often '0's (empty space) that influence the movement.\n\nExample 3 tests my theory further and confirms that the movement is always towards a direction determined by the legend.\n\nBased on the three provided examples, I'm settling on a set of rules: I'll locate the legend box, then calculate the direction by locating the 1s and 2s in that legend box and then move the '4' in a diagonal direction as far as possible within its defined \"room\" until it hits a blocking pixel. I am confident that these are the required steps to resolve the transformation.\n\nFinally, I'll apply these rules to the test input by carefully identifying the legends for each color. I'm going to then follow the rules to generate the output grid.\n\n\nThe task requires identifying transformation rules for \"items\" (yellow pixels, represented by the integer 4) inside \"containers\" (enclosed regions of other colors). The transformation depends on the color of the container, which is associated with a \"Legend\" box that defines the direction of movement for the items.\n\n**Logic Derivation:**\n1.  **Identify Legends:** There are square boxes (usually 5x5) that act as legends. They contain a specific background color and a pattern of `1`s (blue) and `2`s (red).\n    *   The direction of movement for an item inside a container of color $C$ is determined by the vector from the \"Start\" marker to the \"End\" marker in the legend of color $C$.\n    *   Typically, `1` represents Start and `2` represents End.\n    *   Example 1 (Color 7): `1`s on left, `2` on right $\\rightarrow$ Move Right.\n    *   Example 1 (Color 5): `2` on left, `1`s on right (implies 1 $\\rightarrow$ 2 is Left) $\\rightarrow$ Move Left.\n    *   Example 2 (Color 5): `1`s at top-left, `2`s at bottom-right $\\rightarrow$ Move South-East (Diagonally Down-Right).\n    *   Example 3 (Color 5): `1`s at top, `2`s at bottom $\\rightarrow$ Move Down.\n\n2.  **Apply to Test Input:**\n    *   **Legend 1 (Color 5):** Located at the top-left. The pattern shows `1`s clustered in the top-left and `2`s in the bottom-right/right-center. This defines the direction as **South-East (Diagonal Down-Right)**.\n    *   **Legend 2 (Color 1):** Located at the bottom-left (rows 15-19). The background is 1. The markers are `5` (gray) and `2` (red). Based on standard patterns where `2` is the target, and observing the positions (`5`s at bottom, `2`s at top), the direction is `5` $\\rightarrow$ `2`, which is **Up**.\n\n3.  **Process Items (4s):**\n    *   **Item at (3, 11):** Inside a Color 5 container. Moves South-East.\n        *   Path: (3,11) $\\rightarrow$ (4,12) $\\rightarrow$ (5,13) $\\rightarrow$ (6,14) $\\rightarrow$ (7,15) $\\rightarrow$ (8,16).\n        *   Next step (9,17) is blocked by a 5.\n        *   **New Position: (8, 16).**\n    *   **Item at (6, 11):** Inside a Color 5 container. Moves South-East.\n        *   Path: (6,11) $\\rightarrow$ (7,12) $\\rightarrow$ (8,13) $\\rightarrow$ (9,14).\n        *   Next step (10,15) is blocked by a 5.\n        *   **New Position: (9, 14).**\n    *   **Item at (12, 9):** Inside a Color 1 container.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Task Dissection and Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task. The user wants me to essentially move some yellow pixels (\"4\"s) in a large grid based on a set of examples and a test input. The grids are 20x20 and have a few distinct shapes or \"rooms\" delineated by color.\n\nMy initial thought is that there must be some geometric or pattern-based rule governing these yellow pixels' movements. My hypothesis is that there are \"legends\" or \"instructions\" based on the patterns inside small color-coded regions that will determine the move.\n\nAfter looking at the first example, I'm noting that yellow pixels *do* move, and that movement seems to be constrained within certain colored shapes. These colored shapes act as \"rooms\".\n\nI'm zeroing in on this idea of shapes/rooms and I think there might be a color-coded legend to tell me *how* the yellow pixels should move within the room. In example 1, I find 5x5 colored boxes (e.g., orange, grey) that seem to contain a pattern of \"1\"s and \"2\"s. I figure these must influence the yellow pixels.\n\nI also see that some of the yellow pixels are not in the rooms at first. Let's look at the patterns in these boxes.\n\nI'm thinking: The position of the \"2\" (red) in these little patterns *must* relate to the movement. If the \"2\" is on the right-hand edge, the yellow pixels shift to the right-hand edge, and if it's on the left, the yellow pixels move left.\n\nExample 2 reinforces this. Yellow pixels move. Now I'm carefully analyzing the grid, looking at the layout and patterns in the grid, the shape of these \"rooms\" and these \"legends\" to try to figure out what is defining the movement.\n\nExample 3: Here, I notice that in addition to a \"left\" to \"right\" rule, it's also about moving the dot to the bottom of the shape if the 2 is in the bottom of the shape. I'm starting to formalize the rule: *The \"2\" (red pixel) indicates the target direction within its corresponding colored shape, and that I'm supposed to slide the yellow pixel within the direction indicated in the legend until it hits a wall.*\n\nTesting with the given example confirms:\n1.  **Legend Identification:** There are color-coded \"Legend\" boxes or patterns.\n2.  **Direction Determination:** Within the Legend, the relative position of the red pixel \"2\" against the blue pixels \"1\" gives direction.\n3.  **Pixel Transformation:** The yellow pixels are supposed to slide in the direction given by the Legend until the \"4\" pixel touches the room's wall.\n\nLet me see how this works in the test input. There's an orange box and a blue box.\n\nThe strategy seems to work, let's process the pixels. Now that I have the rules, the work is simply to follow the instructions step by step. I'll need to double check with the output to see if there is any corner hit in the test grid.\n\n\nThe goal is to determine the final position of yellow pixels (`4`) based on the layout of \"legend\" shapes for the enclosing room's color.\n\n### Reasoning\n\n1.  **Identify Legends**:\n    *   In all examples, there are specific 5x5 blocks (or similar distinctive shapes) acting as legends. These legends contain a pattern of `1`s (blue) and `2`s (red).\n    *   The relative position of the `2` (red) with respect to the `1`s (blue) or the box itself indicates a **direction**.\n        *   Example 1 (Orange Legend): `2` is on the right side of the pattern `1, 1, 2`. Direction: **Right**.\n        *   Example 1 (Grey Legend): `2` is on the left side of the pattern `2, 1, 1`. Direction: **Left**.\n        *   Example 3 (Grey Legend): `2` is at the bottom of the column pattern. Direction: **Down**.\n        *   Example 2 (Grey Legend): The legend forms a diamond/arrow shape where `2`s are at the bottom and right. The movement observed is **Diagonal Down-Right**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Test Input Legends**:\n    *   **Grey Legend (`5`)**: Located at the top-left (rows 0-5). The pattern inside matches the Example 2 legend exactly.\n        *   Direction: **Diagonal Down-Right**.\n    *   **Blue Legend (`1`)**: Located at the bottom-left (rows 15-19). The pattern inside the box is:\n        ```\n        1,2,1,2,1\n        1,5,1,5,1\n        ...\n        ```\n        The `2`s are in the top row of the interior pattern.\n        *   Direction: **Up**.\n\n3.  **Apply Transformation**:\n    *   Move each yellow pixel (`4`) in the direction determined by its enclosing room's color.\n    *   The pixel slides in that direction until it is adjacent to a wall (a non-zero pixel of the room's color) or hits a wall.\n\n    **Processing Grey (`5`) Dots (Direction: Down-Right):**\n    *   **Dot at (3, 11)**: Slides diagonally down-right through empty space.\n        *   Path: (4,12) -> (5,13) -> (6,14) -> (7,15) -> (8,16).\n        *   Next step (9,17) is blocked by a wall at (9,17) or adjacent walls.\n        *   **New Position: (8, 16)**.\n    *   **Dot at (6, 11)**: Slides diagonally down-right.\n        *   Path: (7,12) -> (8,13) -> (9,14).\n        *   Next step (10,15) is a wall (`5`).\n        *   **New Position: (9, 14)**.\n\n    **Processing Blue (`1`) Dots (Direction: Up):**\n    *   **Dot at (12, 9)**: Slides up.\n        *   Path: (11,9) -> (10,9).\n        *   Next step (9,9) is a wall (`1`).\n        *   **New Position: (10, 9)**.\n    *   **Dot at (17, 16)**: Slides up.\n        *   Path: (16,16) -> (15,16) -> (14,16).\n        *   Next step (13,16) is a wall (`1`).\n        *   **New Position: (14, 16)**.\n    *   **Dot at (18, 11)**: Slides up.\n        *   Path: (17,11) -> (16,11).\n        *   Next step (15,11) is a wall (`1`).\n        *   **New Position: (16, 11)**.\n\n4.  **Construct Output**:\n    *   Remove `4`s from original locations.\n    *   Place `4`s at the calculated new locations.\n\n### Output Grid\n\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n5,5,5,1,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n5,1,5,5,1,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0\n5,5,1,5,5,2,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0\n5,5,5,2,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,5,5,5,0,4,5,5,5,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,1,1,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,1,1,0\n1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0\n1,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0\n1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0\n1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0\n1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. Each grid has template rectangles (solid bordered rectangles with internal patterns)\n2. Each grid has irregular shapes made of the same border colors (5, 7, or 1)\n3. There are 4s placed inside these irregular shapes\n4. The transformation moves each 4 to be adjacent to an interior concave corner (where the boundary turns inward) of its enclosing shape\n\nLet me trace the 4s in the test input and find their target positions:\n\n**4 at (3,11) - inside 5-shape:**\nThe 5-boundary has a concave feature at row 2 where col 10 is a gap between 5s at cols 9 and 11. The 4 should move to (3,10) to be adjacent to this corner.\n\n**4 at (6,11) - inside 5-shape:**\nThe 5-boundary has a concave corner at (7,10) where the boundary steps from col 9 to col 10. The 4 should move to (6,10) to be adjacent.\n\n**4 at (12,9) - inside 1-shape:**\nThe 1-boundary has a concave corner at (13,8) where the boundary shifts. The 4 should move to (12,8) to be adjacent.\n\n**4 at (17,16) - inside 1-shape:**\nThe 1-boundary extends from col 18 (row 17) to cols 12-18 (row 18), creating a concave corner at (18,12). The 4 should move to (17,12).\n\n**4 at (18,11) - inside 1-shape:**\nThe 1-boundary has a concave corner at (18,10). The 4 should move to (17,10) to be adjacent.\n\n```\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n5,5,5,1,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n5,1,5,5,1,5,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n5,5,1,5,5,2,5,0,0,5,4,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0\n5,5,5,2,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,4,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0\n1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0\n1,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0\n1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,1,0\n1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0\n1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this puzzle, I need to understand the transformation rule from the examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1. There are \"template\" patterns - small bordered regions with specific colors (1s, 2s inside borders of 5s, 7s, or 1s)\n2. There are irregular enclosed shapes made of the same border color (5s, 7s, or 1s)\n3. Yellow markers (4s) appear inside these irregular shapes\n4. The 2s in the templates indicate a direction - where the 2 appears (top, bottom, left, right) tells us which direction the 4s should move\n\n**Rule:** Each 4 marker moves within its enclosed region toward the wall in the direction indicated by the 2's position in the corresponding template, stopping when adjacent to that wall.\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\n**5-template (rows 0-5, cols 0-6):** The 2s are at bottom-right positions, so 4s in 5-bounded regions move diagonally toward bottom-right.\n\n**1-template (rows 15-19, cols 0-4):** The 2s are at the top (row 16), so 4s in 1-bounded regions move upward.\n\n**Tracking the 4s:**\n\n1. **(3,11)** in 5-region \u2192 moves diagonally down-right to **(8,16)** (adjacent to wall at (9,17)=5)\n\n2. **(6,11)** in 5-region \u2192 moves diagonally down-right to **(9,14)** (adjacent to wall at (10,15)=5)\n\n3. **(12,9)** in 1-region \u2192 moves up to **(11,9)** (adjacent to wall at (10,9)=1)\n\n4. **(17,16)** in 1-region \u2192 moves up to **(14,16)** (adjacent to wall at (13,16)=1)\n\n5. **(18,11)** in 1-region \u2192 moves up to **(13,11)** (adjacent to wall at (12,11)=1)\n\n```\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n5,5,5,1,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n5,1,5,5,1,5,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n5,5,1,5,5,2,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0\n5,5,5,2,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,5,5,5,0,4,5,5,5,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,1,1,0\n1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0\n1,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0\n1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0\n1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0\n1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**High\u2011level description**\n\nAll three training pairs behave the same way:\n\n1. There is at least one *framed pattern*: a solid rectangular border of a single color (e.g. 5, 7, or 1) which contains a specific arrangement of two other colors (usually 1 and 2, or 2 and 5) inside.\n2. The arrangement of those two inner colors defines a **direction vector** \\(D\\) for that border color:\n   - Take the centroid (average position) of the lower\u2011valued inner color.\n   - Take the centroid of the higher\u2011valued inner color.\n   - The vector from the first centroid to the second (rounded to the nearest of the 8 grid directions) gives \\(D\\).\n   - Example:\n     - In Example 2\u2019s top\u2011right 5\u2011frame, the 1s are up\u2011left of the 2s; the overall vector from 1s\u21922s points **down\u2011right**, so \\(D=(+1,+1)\\).\n     - In Example 3\u2019s top\u2011right 5\u2011frame, the 2s sit *below* the 1s, so \\(D\\) is **straight down**.\n     - In Example 1:\n       - the 7\u2011frame has 2s to the **right** of the 1s \u2192 \\(D=(0,+1)\\) (right).\n       - the 5\u2011frame has 2s to the **left** of the 1s \u2192 \\(D=(0,-1)\\) (left).\n\n3. Every color\u20114 cell is associated with one of these border colors, and then **slides** along that border\u2019s direction \\(D\\) through zeros until it hits something non\u2011zero. It stops on the last zero cell before the obstacle.\n\n   - Association rule for a 4:\n     - Look at its 4\u2011neighbours (up/down/left/right). If any neighbour has a \u201cborder color\u201d (like 5, 7, or 1 used as a frame), the 4 belongs to that border color.\n     - If none, look along the four cardinal directions; in each direction walk through zeros until the first non\u2011zero. If any of those first non\u2011zeros is a border color, we can associate the 4 to that border color. (In all given tasks this yields a unique choice.)\n   - Sliding rule for a 4 with direction \\(D=(dr,dc)\\):\n     - From its current position \\((r,c)\\), repeatedly move to \\((r+dr,c+dc)\\) as long as:\n       - the new cell is inside the grid; and  \n       - the cell is **0** in the *input* grid.\n     - As soon as the next step would be outside the grid or land on any non\u2011zero (1,2,4,5,7,\u2026), stop.  \n       The 4\u2019s new position is the **last zero** cell it visited.  \n       If the very first step in direction \\(D\\) is blocked (non\u2011zero), the 4 does not move.\n   - All 4s use their directions computed from the *input* and move simultaneously (we do not let them pass through other 4s, but in the given grids no two 4s are directly in each other\u2019s way along \\(D\\)).\n\nThis rule reproduces all three training examples:\n\n- Example 1:\n  - Border colors: 7 (left frame) with \\(D=\\) right, and 5 (right frame) with \\(D=\\) left.\n  - Every 4 is classified as belonging either to the 7\u2011region or the 5\u2011region (by nearest border color along rows/columns).\n  - Sliding each 4 horizontally in its region\u2019s direction through zeros until it meets 5/7 gives exactly the given output positions.\n\n- Example 2:\n  - Single border color 5 with \\(D=(+1,+1)\\) (down\u2011right).\n  - 4s at (10,4) and (16,12) slide diagonally down\u2011right through zeros until they would hit a 5, landing at (12,6) and (17,13), as in the output.\n\n- Example 3:\n  - Single border color 5 with \\(D=(+1,0)\\) (straight down).\n  - 4s slide down columns through zeros until the first 5, matching the output positions.\n\n---\n\n## Applying the rule to the **test** grid\n\n### 1. Find border patterns and their directions\n\nIn the test input we see two framed patterns:\n\n1. **Top\u2011left 5\u2011frame** (rows 1\u20135, cols 1\u20137) with inner colors 1 and 2:\n\n   ```\n   5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n   5 5 5 1 5 5 5\n   5 1 5 5 1 5 5\n   5 5 1 5 5 2 5\n   5 5 5 2 5 5 5\n   ```\n\n   Inner 1s: at (2,4), (3,2), (3,5)  \n   Inner 2s: at (4,6), (5,4)\n\n   Centroid(1) \u2248 (2.67, 3.67), Centroid(2) \u2248 (4.5, 5.0)  \n   Vector \u2248 ( +1.83 rows, +1.33 cols ) \u2192 direction **down\u2011right**, i.e. \\(D_5 = (+1,+1)\\).\n\n2. **Bottom\u2011left 1\u2011frame** (rows 16\u201320, cols 1\u20135) with inner colors 2 and 5:\n\n   ```\n   1 1 1 1 1\n   1 2 1 2 1\n   1 5 1 5 1\n   1 5 1 5 1\n   1 1 1 1 1\n   ```\n\n   Treat 2 as the \u201csmaller\u201d interior color, 5 as \u201clarger\u201d:\n\n   - 2s at (2,2) and (2,4)\n   - 5s at (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4)\n\n   Centroid(2) = (2,3), Centroid(5) = (3.5,3)  \n   Vector = ( +1.5 rows, 0 cols ) \u2192 direction **down**, i.e. \\(D_1=(+1,0)\\).\n\nSo we have two border colors and their sliding directions:\n\n- Border color **5** \u2192 \\(D_5 = ( +1, +1 )\\) (down\u2011right).\n- Border color **1** \u2192 \\(D_1 = ( +1, 0 )\\) (down).\n\n### 2. List the 4s in the test input\n\nCoordinates of 4s in the test input (1\u2011indexed row, col):\n\n- \\(P_1 = (4,12)\\)\n- \\(P_2 = (7,12)\\)\n- \\(P_3 = (13,10)\\)\n- \\(P_4 = (18,17)\\)\n- \\(P_5 = (19,12)\\)\n\n### 3. Associate each 4 with a border color\n\nUse adjacency / line\u2011of\u2011sight as in the training grids.\n\n- **\\(P_1 = (4,12)\\)**:\n  - Up neighbour (3,12) is 5 \u2192 directly touching border color 5.\n  - So \\(P_1\\) uses **\\(D_5=(+1,+1)\\)**.\n\n- **\\(P_2 = (7,12)\\)**:\n  - Direct neighbours are all 0; so check along cardinal directions through zeros to first non\u2011zero:\n    - Left: 11=0, 10=5 \u2192 sees 5.\n    - Right: 13=0, 14=0, 15=0, 16=0, 17=0, 18=0, 19=5 \u2192 sees 5.\n    - Up: 6,12=0; 5,12=0; 4,12=4 (non\u2011border).\n    - Down: 8,12=0; 9,12=0; 10,12=5 \u2192 sees 5.\n  - The relevant border color is **5**, so \\(P_2\\) also uses \\(D_5 = (+1,+1)\\).\n\n- **\\(P_3 = (13,10)\\)**:\n  - Direct neighbours all 0; look along cardinal directions:\n    - Left: 9=0, 8=1 \u2192 sees 1.\n    - Right: 11=0, 12=1 \u2192 sees 1.\n    - Up: 12,10=0, 11,10=1 \u2192 sees 1.\n    - Down: 14,10=0, 15,10=1 \u2192 sees 1.\n  - Only border color seen is **1**, so \\(P_3\\) uses \\(D_1=(+1,0)\\).\n\n- **\\(P_4 = (18,17)\\)**:\n  - Down neighbour (19,17) is 1 \u2192 directly touching border color 1.\n  - So \\(P_4\\) uses \\(D_1=(+1,0)\\).\n\n- **\\(P_5 = (19,12)\\)**:\n  - Neighbours: (20,12)=1; (19,11)=1; (19,13)=1.\n  - So \\(P_5\\) also uses border color 1 and \\(D_1=(+1,0)\\).\n\nSummary:\n\n- \\(P_1, P_2\\): slide along \\(D_5=(+1,+1)\\) (down\u2011right).\n- \\(P_3, P_4, P_5\\): slide along \\(D_1=(+1,0)\\) (down).\n\n### 4. Slide each 4 along its direction\n\nUse the original input grid as the obstacle map; 4s are not allowed to pass through any non\u2011zero, including other 4s.\n\n#### 4.1. \\(P_1 = (4,12)\\), direction \\(D_5 = (+1,+1)\\)\n\nFollow the path \\((r+1,c+1)\\) through zeros until a non\u2011zero is hit:\n\n- (5,13) = 0 \u2192 ok\n- (6,14) = 0 \u2192 ok\n- (7,15) = 0 \u2192 ok\n- (8,16) = 0 \u2192 ok\n- (9,17) = 0 \u2192 ok\n- (10,18) = 5 \u2192 non\u2011zero, so we must **stop before** this.\n\nThus \\(P_1\\) moves from (4,12) to **(9,17)**.\n\nWe will later set (4,12) to 0 and (9,17) to 4.\n\n#### 4.2. \\(P_2 = (7,12)\\), direction \\(D_5 = (+1,+1)\\)\n\n- (8,13) = 0 \u2192 ok\n- (9,14) = 0 \u2192 ok\n- (10,15) = 0 \u2192 ok\n- (11,16) = 5 \u2192 non\u2011zero; stop one step earlier.\n\nSo \\(P_2\\) moves from (7,12) to **(10,15)**.\n\n#### 4.3. \\(P_3 = (13,10)\\), direction \\(D_1 = (+1,0)\\) (down)\n\n- (14,10) = 0 \u2192 ok\n- (15,10) = 1 \u2192 non\u2011zero; stop before.\n\nSo \\(P_3\\) moves from (13,10) to **(14,10)**.\n\n#### 4.4. \\(P_4 = (18,17)\\), direction \\(D_1 = (+1,0)\\)\n\n- The immediate cell below (19,17) is 1 (non\u2011zero).\n- So there is no zero cell in the direction; \\(P_4\\) **does not move** and stays at **(18,17)**.\n\n#### 4.5. \\(P_5 = (19,12)\\), direction \\(D_1 = (+1,0)\\)\n\n- The immediate cell below (20,12) is 1 (non\u2011zero).\n- Again, no movement is possible; \\(P_5\\) stays at **(19,12)**.\n\n### 5. Construct the output grid\n\nNow we update the grid:\n\n- Set the original moving 4 positions to 0:\n  - (4,12), (7,12), (13,10) \u2192 become 0.\n- Set the new positions to 4:\n  - (9,17), (10,15), (14,10) \u2192 become 4.\n- Keep the unchanged 4s:\n  - (18,17) and (19,12) remain 4.\n\nAll other cells are identical to the input.\n\nResulting **output grid**:\n\nRow1:  5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \nRow2:  5,5,5,1,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \nRow3:  5,1,5,5,1,5,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0  \nRow4:  5,5,1,5,5,2,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0  \nRow5:  5,5,5,2,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0  \nRow6:  5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0  \nRow7:  0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0  \nRow8:  0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0  \nRow9:  0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,5,0  \nRow10: 0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,5,5,5,0,4,5,5,5,5,0  \nRow11: 0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0  \nRow12: 0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \nRow13: 0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0  \nRow14: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0  \nRow15: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0  \nRow16: 1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0  \nRow17: 1,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0  \nRow18: 1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,0  \nRow19: 1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0  \nRow20: 1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "The solved examples show that the only changes are movements of the cells with value `4`.  \nEach grid contains one or more \u201clegend\u201d blocks: a solid coloured frame containing a small pattern of `1`s and `2`s.  \nFor each legend, take the vector from the average position of the `1`s to the average position of the `2`s; its sign gives a unit direction associated with the legend\u2019s frame colour.\n\nTo move a `4`, look in each legend\u2019s direction and find the first non\u2011zero cell. If the colour of that first obstacle matches the legend colour, slide the `4` step by step in that direction until just before the obstacle. If several legends exist, choose the one that yields a matching obstacle. The original position is cleared to `0`.\n\nIn the test grid there are two legends:\n- the top\u2011left `5`\u2011framed block gives direction down\u2011right (`+1,+1`);\n- the bottom\u2011left `1`\u2011framed block gives direction up (`-1,0`).\n\nApplying the rule to each `4` gives the following output:\n\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n5,5,5,1,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n5,1,5,5,1,5,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n5,5,1,5,5,2,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0\n5,5,5,2,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,5,5,5,0,4,5,5,5,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,1,1,0\n1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0\n1,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0\n1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0\n1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0\n1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "I'll explain the transformation I inferred and then give the resulting output grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Observations from the training pairs\n\nAcross all three examples:\n\n- The only color that ever changes is `4`.\n- Colors `0,1,2,5,7` stay exactly where they are.\n- Each input `4` either:\n  - moves along a straight line through zeros to end up adjacent to a block of `5`s (or `7`s in example 1), or\n  - is removed (example 2, one of the 4s),\n  - and sometimes new `4`s appear just above / beside those main-color blocks.\n\nThe clearest, simplest behavior is in **Example 3**, where:\n\n- Every `4` lies in a column that has a block of `5`s *below* it, separated only by zeros.\n- Each such `4` \u201cfalls\u201d straight down through zeros to sit just above the first `5` in that column:\n  - `(7,6) \u2192 (10,6)` (stops above the `5` at row 11)\n  - `(14,7) \u2192 (19,7)` (stops above the `5` at row 20)\n  - `(14,11)` produces `4`s further down the same column, immediately above the vertical `5`-run.\n\nSo a robust pattern from Example 3 is:\n\n> Slide each `4` **down its column** through zeros until just before the first `5` below it (if such a `5` is reachable without crossing any non-zero other than `4`). Put the `4` in the last zero before that `5`. If no such vertical corridor to a `5` exists, leave the `4` where it is.\n\nIn the **test input**, the main colored \u201csolid\u201d regions below the `4`s are again built out of `5`s (and `1`s, `2`s), as in Examples 2 and 3. The simplest and most consistent extrapolation, given how clear the vertical behavior is in Example 3, is to apply this **vertical sliding-to-5** rule.\n\nI\u2019ll use that rule on the test grid.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying the rule to the test input\n\nThe test grid has 4\u2019s at:\n\n- A: `(4,12)`\n- B: `(7,12)`\n- C: `(13,10)`\n- D: `(18,17)`\n- E: `(19,12)`\n\nCoordinates are 1-based: `(row, column)`.\n\n### 2.1 Determine vertical corridors\n\nWe look **downwards** from each `4` in its column, stopping if we hit a non-zero that is not a `4` before any `5`. A valid corridor is: zeros (and possibly other `4`s) then a `5`.\n\n#### B: `(7,12)`\n\nColumn 12, rows \u2265 8:\n\n- r8c12 = 0\n- r9c12 = 0\n- r10c12 = 5  \u2190 first `5`\n\nEverything between row 8 and row 9 is zero; no blocking non-zero appears before that `5`.\n\nSo B has a valid vertical corridor to a 5 at row 10. By the rule, we place the `4` at the **last zero before that 5**, i.e., at row 9:\n\n- B: `(7,12) \u2192 (9,12)`\n\nWe then clear the original `(7,12)` back to `0`.\n\n#### A: `(4,12)`\n\nColumn 12, rows \u2265 5:\n\n- r5c12 = 0\n- r6c12 = 0\n- r7c12 = 4  \u2190 another 4 (non-zero)\n- below that: eventually 5s, but the first non-zero after A is this 4\n\nWe treat any non-zero other than a 5 as a blocker. So A\u2019s downward path is blocked by B\u2019s 4; A has **no unobstructed 0\u21925 corridor** downward. It also doesn\u2019t have a pure 0\u21925 corridor upward (above are `5`s and other non-zero values).\n\nSo A remains where it is: `(4,12)` unchanged.\n\n#### C: `(13,10)`\n\nColumn 10, rows \u2265 14:\n\n- r14c10 = 0\n- r15c10 = 1  \u2190 non-zero, not 5\n\nSo downward corridor is blocked by a `1`, not a `5`. Upwards, above the 4, there are `5`s and `1`s mixed; no pure 0-chain leading directly into a `5`.\n\nSo C stays at `(13,10)`.\n\n#### D: `(18,17)`\n\nColumn 17, rows \u2265 19:\n\n- r19c17 = 1  \u2190 non-zero, not 5\n\nSo no valid 0\u21925 corridor downward; upwards we hit `1`s too. D stays at `(18,17)`.\n\n#### E: `(19,12)`\n\nColumn 12, rows \u2265 20:\n\n- r20c12 = 1  \u2190 non-zero, not 5\n\nSo no valid vertical 0\u21925 corridor either; E stays at `(19,12)`.\n\n### 2.2 Summary of moves\n\n- `(7,12)` moves down to `(9,12)`.\n- `(4,12)`, `(13,10)`, `(18,17)`, `(19,12)` remain unchanged.\n- Every other cell stays as in the input.\n\nSo only two cells change value:\n\n- Row 7, col 12: `4 \u2192 0`\n- Row 9, col 12: `0 \u2192 4`\n\n---\n\n## 3.

        "Full raw LLM response": "After comparing the examples, the movement of the cells coloured `4` is controlled by the little \u201clegend\u201d block at the top of the grid made of a solid border with internal `1` and `2` forming an arrow. In the test grid the only such block is the 5\u2011coloured block in the top\u2013left; its internal diagonals of `1,1,2` point down and to the right. The rule is to slide every `4` along that arrow direction through zeros until the next step would hit a non\u2011zero cell; place the `4` in the last empty cell and clear its original position.\n\nApplying a down\u2011right slide to the five `4`s in the test input moves them to `(9,17)`, `(10,15)` and `(15,12)`, while the ones at `(18,17)` and `(19,12)` are already blocked and stay put. All other cells remain unchanged. The resulting grid is:\n\n```\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n5,5,5,1,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n5,1,5,5,1,5,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n5,5,1,5,5,2,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0\n5,5,5,2,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,5,5,5,0,4,5,5,5,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0\n1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0\n1,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0\n1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,0\n1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0\n1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",
