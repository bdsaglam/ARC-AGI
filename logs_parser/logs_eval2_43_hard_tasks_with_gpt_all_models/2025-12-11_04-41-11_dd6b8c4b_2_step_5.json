            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning and Final Answer for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, I've got the task: solve an ARC puzzle based on these three examples and apply the rule to a new input. Let's break this down. My goal is to figure out the transformation rule and apply it.\n\n**The Strategy:**\n\nFirst, I'll closely examine each example. I'm looking for patterns, especially how the input grid changes. I'll pay attention to the colors (7 is background, 6 is the wall, 9 are the pixels), the positions, and how they relate.  I'll test different hypotheses, like \"do the pixels move or are they part of a larger canvas?\".  I'll check for \"Line of Sight\", geometric symmetries, and how \"walls\" (6-pixels) influence the transformation. I will consider if the output is just an aggregation of the input. I will test a few heuristics (\"Gravity\",\"Projectile\") and then consider \"Gaps\" (like a door in the walls).\n\n**Example Analysis**\n\nLet's begin with example 1: This is 11x11 grid with orange background (7), magenta structures (6), a green box of 3's inside with a red pixel (2), plus some maroon (9) pixel distributed in the grid. The output is a modified grid, and it looks like the 3x3 green block got altered. It appears that the 9s from somewhere have moved into the green structure. My analysis leads me to a testable hypothesis where the 9s are \"projected\" or \"inverted\" across the central 2. I have to think about whether the 9 is really a \"target\" that disappears, and whether this transformation is due to gaps, or by looking at the input 9 and output positions relative to the center 2.\n\nIn example 2,  I try to apply the same strategies but I see different behavior. It has 9s everywhere. The initial center is filled with 9s too. This gives a simpler result. Perhaps it's just a matter of \"filling\" based on density.\n\n**Test Input application:**\n\nThe examples are the foundation to solve the test input. In this input, the center starts as 2, a 3x3 block, and there are many distributed pixels (9). It has walls (6) and has gaps in the wall too. My strategy will be to carefully analyze this test input structure, look for patterns from examples 1 and 2, and determine the central 3x3 grid changes and then apply it to the input. I hypothesize that with walls with gaps in place, those 9 pixels might project into those gaps, and the gaps will cause a change. I will create a rule to transform the input based on those examples.\nBased on the high density of 9s, the center area should become fully 9s or a ring of 9s around 2.\n\nAfter much trial and error, I found a decent rule!\n\n**The Transformation:**\n\n*   **The 3x3 block changes to (5-7, 5-7):**\n    *   Row 5: 9, 9, 9\n    *   Row 6: 9, 2, 9\n    *   Row 7: 9, 9, 9\n*   **Keep the rest of the grid the same.**\n\n**The Final Answer Grid (Test Input):**\n\n```\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,7\n6,6,9,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,9\n7,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,2,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,7\n6,6,9,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n```\n\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the transformation rule for an 11x11 grid containing a central 3x3 box (the \"core\") and various scattered pixels (color 9). The core is surrounded by a structure of \"walls\" (color 6), although in Example 3 the walls are absent. The core itself initially consists of 3s (green) with a 2 (red) in the center.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **The Core Transformation**: The primary change occurs in the 3x3 core (rows 5-7, columns 5-7). The digit 3s are replaced by 9s based on the configuration of 9s in the surrounding grid. The center pixel (6,6) is a 2; in Examples 1 and 3, it remains a 2. In Example 2, it becomes a 9.\n    *   *Observation*: In Example 2, there are 9s surrounding the core in a very dense pattern, including directly adjacent cells (e.g., (6,3)). In Examples 1 and 3, the 9s are sparser or blocked. The Test Input has a 2 in the center and no direct horizontal 9 neighbors in the middle row (Row 6), similar to Ex 1 and 3. Thus, the center will likely remain 2.\n\n2.  **Mapping Rule (Symmetry/Inversion)**:\n    *   In **Example 1**, 9s at the Southeast (9,8), (9,9) disappear, and marks appear at the Northwest of the core (5,5), (5,6). This suggests an inversion through the center: a source at $(r, c)$ paints the cell corresponding to $(-r, -c)$ relative to the center, provided there is a path or \"line of sight\".\n    *   In **Example 3**, 9s at the Northeast (2,10) cause a mark at the Northeast (5,7). 9s at the Northwest (3,3) cause a mark at the Northwest (5,5). 9s at the Southeast (10,9) cause a mark at the Northwest (5,5) [via inversion].\n    *   *Synthesis*: There are two mechanisms. One is direct mapping (seen in Ex 3 with NE->NE), and one is inverted mapping (SE->NW). The presence of walls (color 6) with gaps likely dictates which 9s can \"enter\" and how they impinge on the core.\n\n3.  **Application to Test Input**:\n    *   **Walls**: The test input has walls at Row 4 and Row 8.\n    *   **Gaps**: There is a gap in the top wall at (4,6) (North) and in the bottom wall at (8,7) (Southeast).\n    *   **Sources**: The grid is filled with 9s in the corners and specifically heavy concentrations at the bottom (Row 11) and top (Rows 1-2).\n    *   **North Gap (4,6)**: 9s from the North (e.g., (1,5)) can flow through this gap. Following the pattern where \"flow through a gap hits the opposite side\", North 9s hitting through a North gap will strike the South side of the box (Row 7). Thus, Row 7 becomes 9s.\n    *   **Southeast Gap (8,7)**: 9s from the Southeast (e.g., Row 11) flow through this gap. SE is opposite to NW. The \"stream\" enters from SE and hits the NW wall of the box. Thus, the Top-Left pixels (5,5) become 9s.\n    *   **Density Argument**: Unlike the sparse Example 1, the Test Input has 9s in all quadrants (NE, NW, SE, SW) and heavy bands at the top and bottom. In Example 2, which had a high density of 9s, the entire 3x3 ring became 9s. The Test Input's density suggests a saturation of the 3x3 target area. Specifically, the \"North\" gap allows painting the bottom row, and the \"South-East\" gap allows painting the top-left. The high density of surrounding 9s (including the diagonals) combined with the logic from Example 2 implies the remaining 3s in the ring will also be converted.\n    *   **Conclusion for the Core**: The 3x3 area will become a ring of 9s surrounding the central 2. (Row 5: 9,9,9; Row 6: 9,2,9; Row 7: 9,9,9).\n\n4.  **Handling Outside Pixels**:\n    *   In Example 1 and 3, \"source\" 9s disappeared. In Example 2, many outside 9s remained. The rule for disappearance is complex and inconsistent across examples (likely distance or obstruction-dependent). However, generally, the problem focuses on the *central transformation*. In Example 2, edge 9s remained. The Test Input has 9s at the very edges (Rows 1, 11). It is safest to assume the background structure (including the wall 9s and edge 9s) remains largely static unless they are clearly \"consumed\" projectiles. Given the ambiguity and the visual pattern of Ex 2 (where the environment persisted), I will retain the outer grid configuration exactly as is, only modifying the core.\n\n**Final Plan**:\nCopy the input grid.\nReplace the 3x3 center core (rows 5-7, cols 5-7) with:\n9, 9, 9\n9, 2, 9\n9, 9, 9\n\n**Output Grid Generation**:\nRows 1-4: Unchanged.\nRow 5: ...6, 9, 9, 9, 6...

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to identify the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n1. Each grid contains a 3\u00d73 pattern with a center cell of 2 surrounded by 3s\n2. The grids have 6s forming boundary walls and 9s scattered around\n3. Some 9s get \"absorbed\" (become 7) and corresponding cells in the 3\u00d73 become 9\n4. The number of absorbed 9s equals the number of cells in the 3\u00d73 that change to 9\n5. The 3\u00d73 fills with 9s in reading order (top-left to bottom-right)\n\n**The Rule:**\n9s that are connected to the 3\u00d73 region (reachable without crossing 6-walls) get absorbed. The same count of 3\u00d73 cells become 9s in reading order.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\nThe 3\u00d73 pattern is at rows 4-6, cols 4-6.\n\nTracing connectivity through gaps in the 6-walls:\n- Through gap at (3,5): connects to upper region\n- Through gap at (7,6): connects to lower region\n\nConnected 9s found:\n- Upper left: (1,2), (3,2) - accessible through path via row 2\n- Upper right: (1,10), (3,10) - accessible through path via rows 1-2, cols 8-10\n- Lower center: (10,4), (10,6) - accessible through gap at (7,6)\n\nNote: (0,4) and (0,6) are isolated by the wall at row 1, cols 3-7.\n\nTotal: 6 connected 9s \u2192 6 cells in 3\u00d73 become 9 (positions 0-5 in reading order)\n\nThe 3\u00d73 becomes:\n```\n9,9,9\n9,9,9\n3,3,3\n```\n\nThe 6 absorbed 9s change to 7.\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,7,7\n6,6,9,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n9,9,9,6,7,7,7,6,9,9,9\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**My Core Thought Process:**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I've got this ARC task to solve, and the user's given me some examples to figure out the rules. My initial impulse is to dive right in, but I see a prompt that looks like it's trying to get me to act like a specific AI persona (a \"neuro-symbolic logic engine\"). It seems like the user wants me to *simulate* internal thought processes before just spitting out the answer. I have to make sure to respond in the *correct format*. I'm also noticing some conflicting instructions in the prompt about whether to hide my reasoning or explain it \u2013 a bit of a head-scratcher!\n\nI decide it's best to prioritize the explicit instruction to explain my thinking, even if that means temporarily ignoring the \"no explanation\" part. I think the user is most likely interested in how I solve the problem.\n\nThe real challenge is understanding the core logic behind the task. It's a pattern recognition game. I carefully analyze the provided examples, looking for repeating patterns. In this particular task, the pattern seems to revolve around how the colored pixels (maroon 9s) interact with the central target shape (green 3s and red 2s). These 9s \"shoot\" and change the shape of that target by turning its parts to 9. The critical part is figuring out WHEN the 9s transform the target (not just any time). This is the key. The *persistence* of the 9s (do they disappear, or stay?) and the role of the frame (6s) in the logic seem important.\n\nSo, I start by looking at a specific example, and I figure that the 9s are acting like missiles that \"hit\" the central block and then change that block. I create a hypothesis around this \"shoot-and-paint\" logic, checking to see if a color moves to the target. Then, I look at the test input and try to apply this model to figure out where the 9s will go to, and how the pattern is completed. I look at each pixel to see if a shoot \"ray\" is made.\n\nThe biggest difficulty is determining under which conditions the \"missiles\" remain on the field or disappear (persist). The examples provide clues, but there are some contradictions. I have to think in all cases to ensure the pattern is correct.\n\nI examine the test input and use the logic to predict the new pixels.\nI double-check to make sure all elements of the problem (target pixels, \"shoots\" pixels) are covered, and I generate the output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to deduce a transformation rule from three examples and apply it to a test input.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:**\n    *   **Target Object:** A central 3x3 box containing Green (3) pixels surrounding a Red (2) center. In some examples (1 and 2), this box is enclosed in a Magenta (6) frame.\n    *   **Agents:** Maroon (9) pixels scattered around the grid.\n\n2.  **Transformation Logic (Ray Casting/Shooting):**\n    *   The Maroon (9) pixels act as \"shooters\" or sources of projectiles.\n    *   They emit rays in **cardinal and diagonal directions** (8 directions).\n    *   These rays travel through Background (7) and Frame (6) pixels.\n    *   When a ray intercepts a pixel of the **Target Object** (specifically the Green 3s), that pixel changes color to Maroon (9).\n    *   The Red (2) center can also be changed if hit (as seen in Example 2), but if no ray targets it directly, it remains Red.\n\n3.  **Verification with Examples:**\n    *   **Example 1:**\n        *   Source (3,3) shoots Diagonal Down-Right $\\rightarrow$ Hits (5,5). (5,5) becomes 9.\n        *   Source (3,4) shoots Diagonal Down-Right $\\rightarrow$ Hits (5,6). (5,6) becomes 9.\n        *   Other 9s (like 9,8) do not have a clear trajectory to a target 3/2 and thus cause no change to the box.\n    *   **Example 3 (No Frame):**\n        *   Source (3,3) shoots Diagonal Down-Right $\\rightarrow$ Hits (5,5).\n        *   Source (10,9) shoots Diagonal Up-Left $\\rightarrow$ Hits (6,5).\n        *   Source (2,10) shoots Diagonal Down-Left $\\rightarrow$ Hits (5,7).\n        *   Other changes (5,6) and (6,5) are accounted for by valid diagonal paths from the available 9s (e.g. 10,9 hits 6,5).\n        *   Pixels not hit (like the Red 2 at the center, or the 3 at 7,7 which was missed by 3,11) remain unchanged.\n\n4.  **Persistence of Sources:**\n    *   In the examples, some 9s disappear and some stay.\n    *   However, in the **Test Input**, the 9s are arranged in a highly symmetric and structural pattern, interlocked with the Magenta (6) frame (e.g., Row 1, Row 11). This suggests they are part of the permanent structure, similar to the persisting 9s in Example 1 (which were inside the frame) and Example 2 (which were a block). We will assume the source 9s in the Test Input persist.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Target Box:** Rows 5-7, Cols 5-7. Center at (6,6).\n    *   Grid:\n        3 3 3\n        3 2 3\n        3 3 3\n*   **Ray Tracing:**\n    *   (1,5) [Down] $\\rightarrow$ Hits (5,5).\n    *   (2,3) [Diag SE] $\\rightarrow$ Hits (5,6).\n    *   (1,7) [Down] $\\rightarrow$ Hits (5,7).\n    *   (4,3) [Diag SE] and (8,3) [Diag NE] $\\rightarrow$ Hit (6,5).\n    *   (2,11) [Diag SW] $\\rightarrow$ Hits (6,7).\n    *   (11,5) [Up] and (11,9) [Diag NW] $\\rightarrow$ Hit (7,5).\n    *   (11,2) [Diag NE] $\\rightarrow$ Hits (7,6).\n    *   (11,3) [Diag NE] and (11,7) [Up] $\\rightarrow$ Hit (7,7).\n*   **Result:** All surrounding Green (3) pixels are hit and turn into Maroon (9).\n*   **Center (6,6):** No 9 has a direct line of sight to the center (6,6). It remains Red (2).\n*   **Sources:** The sources remain in place as they are part of the frame structure.\n\n**Final Output Description:**\nThe central 3x3 area transforms from a Green box with a Red center to a Maroon box with a Red center. The surrounding grid remains identical to the input.\n\n```\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,9,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,9\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,9,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,2,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n6,6,9,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n9,9,9,6,9,7,9,6,9,9,9\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this puzzle, I need to understand the transformation rule from the examples:\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1. Each input has a 3\u00d73 pattern of 3s with a center 2, surrounded by a background of 7s.\n2. Some inputs have 6s forming border structures.\n3. 9s are scattered throughout the grid.\n\n**Transformation Rule:**\n- Find 9s that are connected to the 3\u00d73 pattern through non-6 cells (flood fill from the 3\u00d73)\n- These connected 9s get \"collected\" and moved into the 3\u00d73 pattern\n- The 3\u00d73 fills with 9s row-by-row, left-to-right (starting top-left)\n- If there are 9+ collected 9s, even the center 2 becomes 9\n- Collected 9s are removed (replaced with 7) from original positions\n- Isolated 9s (blocked by 6s from reaching the 3\u00d73) remain unchanged\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\nThe 3\u00d73 pattern is at rows 4-6, cols 4-6. I traced connectivity from the 3\u00d73:\n- Top exit at (3,5) connects to rows 0-2 via all-7s row 2\n- Bottom exit at (7,6) connects to lower portions\n\n**Reachable 9s:** (1,2), (1,10), (3,2), (3,10), (7,2), (7,10), (10,0), (10,1), (10,2), (10,4), (10,6), (10,8), (10,9), (10,10) = 14 total\n\n**Isolated 9s:** (0,4) and (0,6) are trapped in a pocket at row 0, cols 4-6, blocked by 6s at cols 3 and 7.\n\nWith 14 reachable 9s and 9 cells to fill, the 9 closest (by Manhattan distance) are collected:\n(3,2), (7,2), (10,4), (10,6), (1,2), (3,10), (7,10), (10,2), (10,8)\n\nThe 3\u00d73 fills completely with 9s. Remaining 9s stay in place: (0,4), (0,6), (1,10), (10,0), (10,1), (10,9), (10,10).\n\n```\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,9\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n9,9,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,9,9\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "To solve the task, I first identified the 3\u00d73 pattern of `3`s and the central `2` in the grid. Observing the examples, I noticed that `9`s are moved from elsewhere in the grid to replace cells in this 3\u00d73 pattern, filling it from the top-left in row-major order. To keep the total count of `9`s unchanged, the same number of `9`s must be removed from their original positions, turning those cells back to the background color `7`. The removal in the examples is done starting from the bottom-right of the grid, scanning upward and leftward (reverse row-major).\n\nApplying this rule to the test input:\n\n1. Count all `9`s in the grid (16).\n2. The 3\u00d73 block has 9 cells, so move `min(16, 9) = 9` `9`s.\n3. Remove the 9 bottom-most `9`s in reverse row-major order, converting them to `7`.\n4.

            "Full raw LLM response": "To solve this task, I identified the central 3\u00d73 pattern of 3s with a 2 in the middle and treated it as a \u201ccontainer.\u201d Treating cells with value 6 as walls and starting from this container, I performed a flood fill through open cells (7,3,2). As the search reached cells with value 9, I collected them in breadth\u2011first order, turned those locations into 7s, and allowed the search to continue through them. This continued until either there were no more reachable 9s or nine had been collected. The collected 9s were then used to fill the 3\u00d73 container in reading order; any remaining 9s stayed in place. Applying this to the test grid collects nine 9s and fills the entire central block.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,9,9,6,7,7,7,6,9,9,9",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning**\n\n1. In all three training examples there is a central 3\u00d73 \u201cgreen\u201d square made of color `3` with a single `2` in its center.  \n   The rest of the grid is filled mainly with background color `7`, plus some magenta `6` tiles (a maze / frame) and several dark\u2011red `9` tiles.\n\n2. Between each input\u2013output pair the following always happens:\n   * The magenta `6` structure and the orange `7` background are unchanged.\n   * Some of the dark\u2011red `9` tiles disappear from their original places.\n   * An equal number of `9` tiles appear inside the 3\u00d73 green square, replacing `3`\u2019s (and, if necessary, the central `2`).  \n   * Within the 3\u00d73 square, the added `9`\u2019s always fill from the top\u2011left, going row by row:\n     - Cell order:  \n       (row, col) = (r5,c5), (r5,c6), (r5,c7), (r6,c5), (r6,c6), (r6,c7), (r7,c5), (r7,c6), (r7,c7).\n     - First the `3` cells are changed to `9`; if more `9`\u2019s must be placed after all eight `3` cells are used, the center `2` is then changed to `9` (this occurs in Example 2).\n\n3. Intuitively, the task is: \u201ccollect movable `9` tiles from the scene and pack them into the green 3\u00d73 square, starting at its top\u2011left, while leaving the magenta maze unchanged.\u201d\n\n4. For the test grid, there is no obvious special off\u2011limits cluster of `9`\u2019s (unlike the clearer top\u2011right clusters in some examples).  \n   I therefore take all `9` cells as movable:\n   * Remove every `9` in the grid (turn it to `7`).\n   * There are 16 such cells; the 3\u00d73 square can hold at most 9.\n   * Refill the 3\u00d73 square in row\u2011major order with `9`\u2019s until either we run out of `9`\u2019s or we fill all 9 positions.\n   * Since 16 \u2265 9, the entire 3\u00d73 square (including the center) becomes `9`.\n\n5. Applying this to the test input:\n\n   - First clear all `9`\u2019s to `7`.\n   - Then set rows 5\u20137, columns 5\u20137 to `9`.\n\nThe magenta `6` structure and all other colors remain unchanged.\n\n---\n\n**Resulting output grid**\n\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7  \n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7  \n7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6  \n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7  \n6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7  \n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7  \n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6  \n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Final Solution and Reasoning**\n\nOkay, here's what I've figured out after meticulously analyzing the ARC task and the provided examples. The task seems to involve a rule-based transformation of a grid containing numbers 0-9, with each number corresponding to a specific color (e.g., 0 is black, 1 is blue, etc.).\n\nMy goal is to translate the logic derived from examples to a Test case.\n\n*   **The Big Picture:** The core of the problem lies in figuring out how certain digits (specifically, the number '9') move around and how these movements affect a predefined \"target\" region within the grid. This motion is not a simple direct translation.\n*   **Target:** The target is a 3x3 square typically defined by a specific pattern (e.g., a green square with a red center, or the presence of 3s and 2). This box in Example 1 had 3s in its structure.\n\n*   **Mobile '9's:** Not all '9's move. We need to identify which ones are \"free\" to move and which ones remain static.\n\n    *   I initially tried several hypotheses: being \"connected to the edge\", \"being a certain distance from the target\", being \"surrounded\" by walls, being a color in a particular connected component, but none consistently explained the behavior across all examples.\n    *   **The Key:** The mobile 9s are those that are NOT connected to any kind of edge of the grid. This applies to the top, bottom, left and right edges. 9s that are isolated are free to move.\n    *   The \"Boundary\" is the edges of the box.\n\n*   **'9' Movement:**  The free '9's move to the Target section.\n\n*   **Logic:**\n    1.  Copy the Input Grid to the Output grid.\n    2.  Identify which 9s are 'free', namely, not connected to any grid Boundary.\n    3.  Change these '9's to 7' in the Output.\n    4.  The Target is set. Take the first few free \"9s\" and turn the appropriate entries in the target to \"9\".\n    5.  The target gets 9s in a specific order starting with the top row, and going left to right (this was determined from the examples provided) until the 3x3 box is filled, or you run out of 9s to fill the Target with.\n\nThis solution should be robust to any grid.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the grid based on patterns observed in the examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Target Identification:** In all examples, there is a specific 3x3 structure composed of green cells (3) with a red cell (2) in the center. This structure is surrounded by pink walls (6) in various configurations (or no walls in Ex 3). The coordinates of this target square are generally in the center of the grid (Rows 4-6, Cols 4-6).\n2.  **Moving Objects:** The maroon cells (9) act as a resource or \"movable blocks\".\n3.  **Transformation Logic:**\n    *   We count the number of \"movable\" maroon blocks (9s) in the grid.\n    *   A maroon block is considered **movable** if it is **not connected to the edge of the grid** (either directly or through a chain of other 9s). In Example 2, 9s connected to the top-right corner cluster stayed, while isolated 9s and those not connected to the edge moved. In Example 1, 9s connected to the edge-touching cluster at the bottom-left stayed, while the others (bottom-right) moved.\n    *   The **number of movable 9s** determines how many cells in the target 3x3 square are converted into 9s.\n    *   The filling order for the target square is Row-major: Top-Left, Top-Middle, Top-Right, Middle-Left, Center, Middle-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Middle, Bottom-Right.\n    *   The movable 9s are removed from their original positions and replaced by the background color orange (7).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Locate Target:** The 3x3 target square (3s with center 2) is at Rows 4-6, Columns 4-6.\n2.  **Identify 9s:**\n    *   (0,4), (0,6): On Top Edge. **Stay.**\n    *   (10,4), (10,6), (10,0-2), (10,8-10): On Bottom Edge. **Stay.**\n    *   (1,10), (3,10), (7,10): On Right Edge. **Stay.**\n    *   (1,2): Located at Row 1, Col 2. Not connected to any edge. **Moves.**\n    *   (3,2): Located at Row 3, Col 2. Sandwiched in a wall, but not connected to edge (walls don't count as edge connection for the 9s themselves). **Moves.**\n    *   (7,2): Located at Row 7, Col 2. Sandwiched in a wall, not connected to edge. **Moves.**\n3.  **Count Movable 9s:** There are **3** movable 9s: (1,2), (3,2), and (7,2).\n4.  **Transform Target:** We fill the first 3 cells of the target square with 9s.\n    *   Target indices (relative): (0,0), (0,1), (0,2).\n    *   Grid coordinates: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6).\n    *   These cells change from 3 to 9.\n5.  **Remove Sources:** The 9s at (1,2), (3,2), and (7,2) become 7s.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n*   Copy Test Input.\n*   Set (1,2) = 7.\n*   Set (3,2) = 7.\n*   Set (7,2) = 7.\n*   Set (4,4) = 9.\n*   Set (4,5) = 9.\n*   Set (4,6) = 9.\n\noutput:\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,9\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,3,2,3,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n9,9,9,6,9,7,9,6,9,9,9",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**My Thinking on this ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this ARC problem, and it's all about transforming grids based on some examples.  I see a background color and some other colors, mainly green, red, maroon, and pink. It's got me thinking, the grids seem to always have this core structure made of green and red, often surrounded by pink.  And there are these maroon pixels scattered around, sometimes they form patterns, sometimes they don't, but they're critical.\n\nFirst, I looked at a sample case and tried to work through it. I started by getting the exact coordinates and shapes down. From here I started examining the input vs. output and noted what changed in the central structure and why. The maroon pixels seemed to migrate toward the central core.\n\nIn example 1, I saw that two green pixels became maroon. Okay, why? What's the link? Perhaps the maroon pixels are \"falling\" or being \"pushed\" toward the core. I had to investigate if the pink structure was acting like a wall and I had to see where the orange background might be. The pink structure looks like a container! I realized there might be a \"hole\" in the container for some of the green to change to maroon.\n\nThen, example 2, the container is slightly different. The container seems to be U-shaped. But the pattern is the whole core area transformed. Maybe the whole pink structure represents a new shape? What happened to the wall? This led me to really focus on the relationship between these different structures.\n\nBy example 3, there's no pink structure at all. No walls, no containers, nothing. In this case, it appears just specific colors and there's a simple, predictable pattern of the core changing. I needed a deeper understanding about what these maroon pixels represent, or why they are special. The different configurations are a good clue.\n\nSo I got this idea, that the 6 colors define a \"stencil\". The 9 colors \"ink\" or fill in the core. The pattern could be something like a stamp or stencil, with the container defining the stamp.\n\nBased on these observations, it seemed to me that a connection exists that involves counting the maroon pixels inside or near a \"room\" or \"chamber\" formed by the pink structure. But sometimes the count wasn't correct. And then if the number of maroon pixels became a certain number then it changes everything in that chamber. And at the same time, is there some sort of alignment? The more I investigate, the clearer it becomes that the 6 color represents a \"wire\".\n\nSo I formed a new theory of \"directional projection\". But then it seems to go beyond that, and perhaps, the count isn't the total count, but only what's connected through the \"wires\". I started to see \"connected 9s\" (maroon) as key. Where they are located in relation to the core seems essential. And there is a clear rule:  **the color 2 will only change if the wires or 9s are vertically aligned.** This must mean that if a particular grid input can meet this rule, all that grid's contents are replaced.\n\nIn short, there must be a defined rule: 1) Count connected maroon pixels, 2) check alignment of maroon pixels, 3) change pixels based on those rules. This should be the solution.  Let's see if this rule fits...\n\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the transformation rule based on three examples and apply it to a test input.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Structure:** Each grid features a central \"core\" composed of Green (3) pixels surrounding a single Red (2) pixel. This core is typically 3x3.\n    *   Surrounding the core are Pink (6) structures acting as walls.\n    *   There are Maroon (9) pixels scattered in the grid.\n    *   The Background is Orange (7).\n\n2.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The Green/Red core is partially or fully filled with Maroon (9) pixels.\n    *   **Example 1:** 2 pixels of the core turn Maroon (Top-Left and Top-Middle).\n    *   **Example 2:** All 9 pixels of the core turn Maroon (including the center).\n    *   **Example 3:** 4 pixels of the core turn Maroon (Top row and Middle-Left).\n\n3.  **Logic Deduction:**\n    *   **Connectivity:** We look for Maroon (9) pixels that are \"connected\" to the Green/Red core via the Orange (7) background (acting as open space). The Pink (6) pixels act as barriers.\n    *   **Example 1:** The core has an opening at the bottom. The Maroon pixels at (8,7) and (8,8) are connected to the core through this opening. There are exactly **2** such connected pixels. This matches the **2** pixels filled in the core.\n    *   **Example 3:** There are no Pink walls. All **4** Maroon pixels in the grid are connected to the core. This matches the **4** pixels filled in the core.\n    *   **Example 2:** The core is inside an inverted U-shape. The bottom is open. Inside the U-shape (and connected to the bottom), there are **2** Maroon pixels: (8,5) and (9,5). However, the result is a **full fill** (9 pixels).\n    *   **Explosion Rule:** Notice that in Example 2, the connected Maroon pixels (8,5) and (9,5) are in **Column 5**, which is the same column as the Red center pixel (5,5). They have a direct vertical line of sight (path) to the center. In Examples 1 and 3, none of the connected Maroon pixels are aligned with the center pixel's column or row.\n    *   **Hypothesis:**\n        1.  Count the number of Maroon (9) pixels connected to the core ($N$).\n        2.  If any connected Maroon pixel is vertically (or horizontally) aligned with the Red center pixel and has a straight path to it, the **entire core** becomes Maroon.\n        3.  Otherwise, change the first $N$ Green pixels of the core to Maroon (in reading order: top-left to bottom-right), skipping the center Red pixel.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Core:** Rows 4-6, Cols 4-6. Center at (5,5).\n2.  **Analyze Connectivity:**\n    *   **Top Path:** There is a gap in the Pink wall above the core at (3,5). However, the region above (Rows 0-2) is blocked by a solid Pink wall at Row 1 (Cols 3-7). The Maroon pixels at (0,4) and (0,6) are blocked.\n    *   **Bottom Path:** There is a gap in the Pink wall below the core at (7,6).\n        *   Path: Core -> (7,6) -> (8,6) (Orange) -> (8,5) -> (8,4) -> (9,4) (Orange Gap).\n        *   This path leads to the bottom area (Row 10) between columns 3 and 7.\n        *   In this area, we find Maroon pixels at **(10,4)** and **(10,6)**.\n    *   **Count:** There are **2** connected Maroon pixels.\n3.  **Check Alignment:**\n    *   The connected pixels are at Col 4 and Col 6.\n    *   The Center is at Col 5.\n    *   There is NO alignment. (Also, no connected 9s in Row 5).\n4.  **Apply Transformation:**\n    *   Since there is no \"explosion\", we fill $N=2$ pixels.\n    *   We fill the first 2 pixels of the core in reading order: (4,4) and (4,5).\n    *   The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n**Final Output Grid Construction:**\n*   Input Row 4: `7,7,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,7,7`\n*   Output Row 4: `7,7,7,6,9,9,3,6,7,7,7` ((4,4) and (4,5) changed to 9).\n*   All other rows are identical to the input.\n\noutput:\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,9,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,9\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,9,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,6,9,9,3,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,3,2,3,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,7,7\n6,6,9,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n9,9,9,6,9,7,9,6,9,9,9",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Identify the special green \u201ccross\u201d**  \n   In every example there is exactly one 3\u00d73 pattern of green cells (color `3`) with a single center cell of color `2`:\n\n   ```\n   3 3 3\n   3 2 3\n   3 3 3\n   ```\n\n   This is always at rows 5\u20137 and columns 5\u20137 of the 11\u00d711 grid.\n\n2. **Treat color 6 as walls, everything else as open space**  \n   For connectivity we use 4\u2011neighbour moves and consider cells of color `6` as impassable walls.  \n   All other colors (`0\u20139` except `6`) are passable.\n\n3. **Find the connected component that contains the green cross**  \n   Starting from any cell of the cross (e.g. the center `2`), do a BFS/Flood\u2011Fill through all non\u20116 cells.  \n   This gives a region `A` of cells connected to the cross without crossing any `6`.\n\n   - Example 1: only the bottom\u2011right 9\u2011pair is in `A`; other 9\u2019s are separated by walls.\n   - Example 2: walls leave a gap at the bottom, so *all* non\u20116 cells are in one big component; every 9 is in `A`.\n   - Example 3: there are no 6\u2019s, so again every cell is in `A`.\n\n4. **Inside this component, examine red cells (color 9)**  \n   Collect all cells of color `9` that lie in component `A`.  \n   Split these into 4\u2011connected components of 9\u2019s and measure their sizes.\n\n   - Example 1: only one 9\u2011component in `A`, of size 2.\n   - Example 2: two big components (sizes 4 and 2) and nine singletons (size 1).\n   - Example 3: four singletons (all size 1).\n\n5. **Select the smallest 9\u2011components to move**  \n   Let `s` be the minimum size among the 9\u2011components in `A`.  \n   Mark **all** 9\u2011components whose size is exactly `s` as \u201cmovable\u201d:\n\n   - Example 1: min size `s=2` \u2192 the only 2\u2011cell component is movable (the bottom\u2011right pair).\n   - Example 2: min size `s=1` \u2192 all nine single 9\u2019s are movable; the larger clusters stay.\n   - Example 3: min size `s=1` \u2192 all four 9\u2019s are movable.\n\n   For each movable component, we will:\n   - Turn its cells into background (`7`) in the output.\n   - Keep a count `k` of how many 9\u2011cells we removed altogether.\n\n6. **Create target positions inside the green cross**  \n   Inside the 3\u00d73 cross region we define a fixed row\u2011major ordering of its 9 cells:\n\n   1. (5,5)\n   2. (5,6)\n   3. (5,7)\n   4. (6,5)\n   5. (6,6)\n   6. (6,7)\n   7. (7,5)\n   8. (7,6)\n   9. (7,7)\n\n   Now we place the `k` moved 9\u2019s into the cross by recoloring the first `k` positions in this order to `9`.  \n   Positions beyond `k` stay as they were (3 or 2).\n\n   This reproduces the examples:\n\n   - Example 1: `k=2` \u2192 (5,5) and (5,6) become 9.\n   - Example 2: `k=9` \u2192 every cell of the 3\u00d73 cross becomes 9.\n   - Example 3: `k=4` \u2192 (5,5),(5,6),(5,7),(6,5) become 9; the center 2 stays 2.\n\n   Note: the total number of 9\u2019s stays constant\u2014each moved 9 just changes position.\n\n7. **Apply to the test input**\n\n   a. Find the cross at rows 5\u20137, cols 5\u20137.\n\n   b. Flood\u2011fill from the cross through all non\u20116 cells to get component `A`.  \n      All 9\u2019s except the pair at the very top row (cells (1,5) and (1,7)) are in `A`.\n\n   c. 9\u2019s in component `A` are at:\n      ```\n      (2,3), (4,3), (8,3),\n      (11,1), (11,2), (11,3),\n      (11,5), (11,7),\n      (2,11), (4,11), (8,11),\n      (11,9), (11,10), (11,11)\n      ```\n      Their 4\u2011connected components:\n\n      - { (2,3) } size 1\n      - { (4,3) } size 1\n      - { (8,3) } size 1\n      - { (11,1),(11,2),(11,3) } size 3\n      - { (11,5) } size 1\n      - { (2,11) } size 1\n      - { (4,11) } size 1\n      - { (8,11) } size 1\n      - { (11,7) } size 1\n      - { (11,9),(11,10),(11,11) } size 3\n\n      Minimum size `s = 1`, so the movable 9\u2011components are all eight singletons:\n\n      ```\n      (2,3), (4,3), (8,3),\n      (11,5),\n      (2,11), (4,11), (8,11),\n      (11,7)\n      ```\n\n      Thus `k = 8`.\n\n   d. Set these movable positions to `7` in the output.\n\n   e. Inside the cross, recolor the first `k=8` cells in row\u2011major order to `9`:\n\n      - (5,5),(5,6),(5,7),\n      - (6,5),(6,6),(6,7),\n      - (7,5),(7,6) \u2192 become 9.\n      - (7,7) stays 3.\n\n   f. All other cells (7\u2019s, 6\u2019s, non\u2011movable 9\u2019s, and remaining 3/2) stay unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### Final output grid\n\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7  \n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7  \n7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6  \n7,7,7,6,9,9,3,6,7,7,7  \n6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7  \n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7  \n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6  \n9,9,9,6,7,7,7,6,9,9,9",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. Each grid has a 3x3 block of color 3 (green) with a center of color 2 (red)\n2. Color 9 (maroon) dots are scattered around the grid\n3. Color 6 (magenta/pink) forms frame-like boundaries\n4. Color 7 (orange) is the background\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n- The transformation moves some 9s into the 3x3 green block\n- 9s that are \"connected\" to the 3x3 region (reachable without crossing 6s) AND not in the top rows (0-2) get absorbed\n- The absorbed 9s fill the 3x3 block starting from top-left, going row by row\n- The original positions of absorbed 9s become 7\n\n**For the test input:**\n- The 3x3 block is at rows 4-6, columns 4-6\n- Tracing connectivity from the 3x3 (treating 6s as walls), I can reach: (0,4), (0,6), (1,2), (1,10), (3,2), (3,10), (10,4), (10,6)\n- Filtering out rows 0-2 (which stay like in Example 2): \n  - Moved 9s: (3,2), (3,10), (10,4), (10,6) = 4 total\n\n**Filling pattern for 4 positions:**\nFollowing Example 3's pattern: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4) become 9\n\n**Output grid:**\n\n```\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,9,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,9\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,2,3,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,7,7\n6,6,9,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n9,9,9,6,7,7,7,6,9,9,9\n```",

You first consider only the maroons that are in the same non\u20116 connected region as the green block; if there are more than nine, you take the bottom\u2011most ones until you have nine. Remove those maroons (set them to background 7) and then repaint the green block cells in row\u2011major order with the same number of 9s. In the test case the connected component containing the green block includes all maroons except the two isolated at the top; there are at least nine, so the entire 3\u00d73 block is repainted 9. The nine maroons removed are the eight on the bottom row and the one at (8,3).\n\nApplying this to the test input yields:\n\n```\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,9,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,9\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,9,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n```",

You repaint some of those 3s to 9s starting at the top\u2011left of the block and working in reading order, but you never repaint the cell immediately to the right of the 2. The maximum number you can repaint is seven cells (all the 3s except that protected one).\n- The number of 3s you repaint is balanced by removing the same number of existing 9s elsewhere. The 9s that are removed are taken from the end of the list of all 9s when the grid is read row by row; the rest of the original 9s are left in place.\n\nFor the test case the component containing the centre cell has plenty of 9s, so all seven convertible positions in the 3\u2011block are repainted: (5,5),(5,6),(5,7),(6,5),(7,5),(7,6),(7,7) become 9, and (6,7) stays 3.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, here's the game plan, as I see it:**\n\nI've got this ARC task to tackle, and it seems like the key is understanding how these maroon (9) agents move and influence the green (3) target area. The examples are vital for figuring out the rules. I'm thinking about:\n\n*   **Grid Size:** It's an 11x11 grid, with each cell representing a specific color. Easy enough.\n*   **Colors:** These colors represent different objects like black (0), blue (1), red (2), green (3), yellow (4), gray (5), magenta (6), orange (7), azure (8), and maroon/dark red (9).\n*   **Target (Green area) and Agent (Maroon/9 pixels)**. The core concept here.\n\nThe hints are helping, but they're not always straightforward. I need to make sure I understand the interaction between the agents and their environment. Some key observations:\n\n1.  **Maroon Agents are the Movers**: They are the key to this. They move from their starting position.\n2.  **Magenta = Obstacles**: Magenta (6) pixels are walls, forming enclosed areas or channels.\n3.  **Green = Central target**: The area with connected green (3) pixels, and sometimes the surrounding red (2) pixels, is the target. The goal is likely to somehow 'fill' the target with the moving agent's color.\n4.  **Clear Path**: A path to the target must exist for the agent to move.  Obstacles are walls (6) and possibly other agents?\n5.  **Cavity Fill?** If the agents reach the target which is enclosed by the walls, then something special happens (I'm still figuring this part out)\n\nI started by looking at each example and tried to trace paths and what happens to them. The key seem to be the difference between if the target area has an \"open\" path vs a \"closed\" path, and how that changes the \"filling\" of pixels.\n\nNow let's delve into the examples:\n\n*   **Example 1**: I'm really taking my time here, tracing where all the moving agents start from, which pixels turn into magenta (9), and how those new magenta pixels are connected to everything.\n*   **Example 2**: I'm really curious here about these enclosed structures! This seems to be some kind of critical rule, where agents get the *target is inside, the whole thing fills with agents*. Something about the channel shape seems to matter.\n*   **Example 3**: No more walls! The lack of walls might imply a simpler rule at work, but it's hard to tell without the walls.\n\nI have a hypothesis now: It's all about if the agent has a clear path to the target and if they were enclosed in some sort of box when they got there. If it's a \"box\", maybe everything goes in that box.\n\n**Here's what I'm thinking now:**\n\nI've started to form a rule. There seem to be two ways of filling the target area. The *filling* process is determined by how the green target area is connected to the other agents and also where the agent is starting from:\n\n*   **Case 1: \"Cavity Fill\"** (Ex 2): Agents get \"inside\" an enclosed structure or channel, the entire cavity or container is going to be filled with agents.\n\n    *   For this to happen, 9s had to be *in* a particular place. They needed to move from a channel to a target.\n*   **Case 2: \"Normal/count Fill\"**: In case, for example, the walls are not there (Ex 3), or the agent just enters through a specific hole. In this, case, there's no filling everything.\n\n    *   Only *some* of the pixels are filled up to a set amount. The number is related to how many movers started.\n\nI had doubts because, in some of the Examples, some agents seem to not count. I think I know why:\n\n*   Agents at the edge/boundary of the grid cannot move. This has been a source of some consternation (I thought they moved too!).\n\nNow, time to move towards solving the test input!\n\n\nThe goal of this task is to simulate the movement of \"mobile agents\" (maroon/9) towards a \"central target\" (green/3 and red/2).\n\n**Rules derived from examples:**\n1.  **Target:** The central structure consisting of green (3) and red (2) pixels.\n2.  **Agents:** Maroon (9) pixels are agents.\n3.  **Movement:** Agents move towards the target if there is a valid path. A path consists of adjacent (up/down/left/right) steps through non-wall pixels. Magenta (6) pixels are walls.\n4.  **Active Agents:** An agent is \"active\" if it has a valid path to any pixel of the target.\n    *   Agents blocked by walls are inactive and remain in place.\n    *   Agents that are **active** count towards filling the target.\n5.  **Boundary Condition:** Active agents starting on the grid boundary (Row 0, Row 10, Col 0, Col 10) contribute to the count but are **preserved** (do not disappear). Active agents not on the boundary disappear (turn into background color) after moving.\n6.  **Filling Logic:**\n    *   **Cavity Fill:** If agents are inside a container structure enclosing the target (as in Example 2), the entire target area fills with 9s (including the red center).\n    *   **Count Fill:** If agents are outside the container or enter through a restricted gap (as in Examples 1 and 3, and the Test Input), the target fills incrementally.\n        *   Number of pixels filled = Number of Active Agents.\n        *   Filling Order: Reading order (Row-major: left-to-right, top-to-bottom).\n        *   The red (2) center is skipped/preserved in Count Fill mode.\n        *   Only green (3) pixels are turned to maroon (9).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Analyze Agents and Paths:**\n    *   **Top-Left (1,2) and (3,2):**\n        *   (1,2) is at `row 1, col 2`. It can move through row 2 (open) to `(2,5)` and down through the gap at `(3,5)` to reach the target. **Active.** Not on boundary -> **Remove.**\n        *   (3,2) is at `row 3, col 2`. Can move up to row 2 and follow the same path. **Active.** Not on boundary -> **Remove.**\n    *   **Top-Right (1,10) and (3,10):**\n        *   (1,10) is at `row 1, col 10`. Can move via row 2 to the gap at `(3,5)`. **Active.** On boundary -> **Keep.**\n        *   (3,10) is at `row 3, col 10`. Can move up to row 2 and follow path. **Active.** On boundary -> **Keep.**\n    *   **Bottom Channel (10,4) and (10,6):**\n        *   (10,4) is at `row 10, col 4`. Can move up through gap at `(9,4)` and `(8,4-6)` to the gap at `(7,6)` to reach the target. **Active.** On boundary -> **Keep.**\n        *   (10,6) is at `row 10, col 6`. Blocked directly above, but can move left to `(10,4)` and follow that path. **Active.** On boundary -> **Keep.**\n    *   **Blocked/Inactive Agents:**\n        *   (0,4), (0,6): Trapped by walls in row 1.\n        *   (7,2): Blocked by walls surrounding the bottom-left region.\n        *   (7,10): Blocked by walls surrounding the bottom-right region.\n    *   **Total Active Count:** 6 agents.\n\n2.  **Target Filling:**\n    *   We fill 6 pixels in reading order, skipping the red (2) at (5,5).\n    *   Target pixels (Row, Col):\n        1.  (4,4) -> Fill\n        2.  (4,5) -> Fill\n        3.  (4,6) -> Fill\n        4.  (5,4) -> Fill\n        5.  (5,5) [Red] -> Skip\n        6.  (5,6) -> Fill\n        7.  (6,4) -> Fill\n        8.  (6,5) -> Remains 3\n        9.  (6,6) -> Remains 3\n\n3.  **Grid Update:**\n    *   Target area updated with 9s as calculated.\n    *   Agents at (1,2) and (3,2) become 7.\n    *   Agents at (1,10), (3,10), (10,4), (10,6) remain 9.\n    *   Inactive agents remain 9.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,9\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,2,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,9,3,3,6,7,7,7\n6,6,9,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n9,9,9,6,9,7,9,6,9,9,9",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, here's the breakdown of my thought process for this ARC task:**\n\nI'm starting with a deep dive into how these grids work. I'm seeing it's all about agents (the dark red 9s) moving towards a target (a central green or red structure). The walls (magenta 6s) are key, acting as obstacles. I quickly realize the dimensions (11x11) and background (orange 7) are standard, so I zero in on object behavior.\n\nThe hints are crucial, I'm interpreting them as: agents move, magenta walls are barriers, and the target is what's being \"affected.\" I analyze the examples to find patterns, and I begin to see the movement rules are linked to clear paths. \"Clear path\" means the agent can move on a route of empty space (represented by 7) that touches the target.\n\nI meticulously study the example grids and pay close attention to the coordinates and values. I notice that agents disappear if they have a clear path to the target. I'm also observing a crucial distinction: In some cases, the agents merely \"consume\" one part of the target, and in other cases, the target is filled completely with the agents' color (the 9s). I'm looking to identify the reasons for each behavior.\n\nThe core of the problem seems to be the \"cavity\" and how it triggers that complete fill. I'm trying to work out the exact conditions. Is it about a simple rule (agent reaches = fill one spot)? Or is there more to this? The fact that the entire cavity can fill points toward some sort of \"trigger.\"\n\nI break down the cases and begin by focusing on determining whether an agent is \u201creaching\u201d (can it get to the target without being blocked?). I then realize there must be another condition for the filling of the whole thing. The container is a key piece in this process. By examining the walls that form this shape in the grid, I work through the agents\u2019 movements: I verify path availability by testing them against the target and the walls (6s).\n\nThe key insight is the special role of agents \u201cinside\u201d the container. By \u201cinside,\u201d I mean agents that have to travel through the wall. If any agent that can move also *starts* inside the target\u2019s walls, then it is the key to filling the entire target structure.\n\nIf no agent starts \u201cinside,\u201d the agents fill the targets individually.\n\nAfter considering each of these components, I devise a strategy:\n\n1.  Identify target.\n2.  Determine all agents.\n3.  Figure walls.\n4.  Figure paths.\n5.  If an agent starting \u201cinside\u201d the container exists, then \u201cFill All\u201d.\n6.  Else, count the reaching agents and fill appropriately.\n\nAt last, I apply the solution to the test case, and verify the resulting grid with an exact count of reaching agents versus filled targets. I construct the final grid.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to simulate mobile agents (dark red pixels, value 9) moving towards a central target structure (green pixels 3 and red pixel 2), obstructed by walls (magenta pixels 6).\n\n### Analysis of Rules\n1.  **Agents and Target:** The agents are the 9s. The target is the central cluster of 3s and 2.\n2.  **Movement & Obstacles:** Agents can move through empty space (7s) but are blocked by walls (6s). We need to determine if a path exists from each agent to the target.\n3.  **Trapped vs. Reaching:**\n    *   Agents that are completely enclosed by walls or cannot find a path to the target are \"trapped\" and remain in their original positions.\n    *   Agents that have a clear path to the target are \"reaching\"; they disappear from their original positions (turning into background 7).\n4.  **Target Interaction (The \"Cavity\" Rule):**\n    *   Normally, agents might fill the target pixel by pixel.\n    *   However, if *any* reaching agent originates from **inside the container** defined by the vertical walls flanking the target (columns 4, 5, 6 in the examples), it triggers a \"Fill All\" event.\n    *   When \"Fill All\" is triggered, the entire target structure (all 3s and the 2) is replaced by the agent's color (9).\n\n### Application to Test Input\n\n**1. Analyze the Grid:**\n*   **Target:** A 3x3 structure of 3s with a 2 in the center, located at Rows 4-6, Columns 4-6.\n*   **Container:** Vertical walls (6) exist at Columns 3 and 7 in Rows 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 (with some gaps). This defines the \"inside\" area as Columns 4, 5, 6.\n*   **Access Points:** There are gaps in the horizontal walls above and below the target:\n    *   **Top Gap:** Row 3, Column 5 is open (7).\n    *   **Bottom Gap:** Row 7, Column 6 is open (7).\n\n**2. Evaluate Agents:**\n\n*   **Top Agents (Rows 0-3):**\n    *   **(0,4) & (0,6):** Located \"inside\" (cols 4,6). Wall at Row 1 blocks direct descent, but they can move sideways to Col 2 or 8, go down to Row 2 (which is clear), and enter the target via the Top Gap at (3,5). **Reachable.** (Start Inside -> Triggers Fill All).\n    *   **(1,2) & (1,10):** Located \"outside\". Path exists via Row 2 to the Top Gap. **Reachable.**\n    *   **(3,2) & (3,10):** Located \"outside\". Path exists via Row 2 to the Top Gap. **Reachable.**\n\n*   **Middle Agents (Row 7):**\n    *   **(7,2):** Trapped in the bottom-left quadrant walls. No path to gaps. **Trapped.**\n    *   **(7,10):** Trapped in the bottom-right quadrant walls. No path to gaps. **Trapped.**\n\n*   **Bottom Agents (Row 10):**\n    *   **(10,0), (10,1), (10,2):** Trapped in the bottom-left corner. **Trapped.**\n    *   **(10,8), (10,9), (10,10):** Trapped in the bottom-right corner. **Trapped.**\n    *   **(10,4) & (10,6):** Located \"inside\" (cols 4,6). They can move up to the Bottom Gap at (7,6). **Reachable.** (Start Inside -> Triggers Fill All).\n\n**3. Transformation:**\n*   **Target:** Since reaching agents start inside the container (e.g., (0,4), (10,4)), the entire target (3s and 2) becomes **9s**.\n*   **Reaching Agents:** (0,4), (0,6), (1,2), (1,10), (3,2), (3,10), (10,4), (10,6) become **7s**.\n*   **Trapped Agents:** (7,2), (7,10), and the groups at the bottom corners remain **9s**.\n\n### Completed Output Grid\n\n```text\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n6,6,9,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n9,9,9,6,7,7,7,6,9,9,9\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Here is the rule I inferred and how I applied it.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Interpreting the colors\n\nFrom the examples:\n\n- `9` = **mobile agents** (dark red)  \n- `6` = **walls** (magenta), impenetrable  \n- `3` and `2` form the **central target container**:\n  - There is a 3\u00d73 block of `3`s with a single `2` in the middle.\n- `7` = background / empty space\n\nOnly three things ever change between input and output:\n\n1. Some `9`s disappear (turn into `7`).\n2. Some `3`s (and sometimes the central `2`) become `9`.\n3. `6`s and `7`s are never changed directly.\n\n---\n\n## 2. High-level transformation\n\n1. **Find the central container**: the 3\u00d73 block of `3`s with a `2` in the middle.\n2. **Determine which agents can reach the container**:\n   - Treat cells of color `6` as walls.\n   - All other colors (7, 3, 2, 9) are passable.\n   - Do a flood fill / BFS from the central `2` over all non-`6` cells.\n   - Every `9` that lies in this reachable region is an **unblocked agent**; others are **blocked**.\n3. **Agents\u2019 effects**:\n   - **Blocked agents**: stay where they are (remain `9`).\n   - **Unblocked agents**:\n     - Their original cells become background (`7`).\n     - They contribute to \u201cfilling\u201d the central container.\n4. **Filling the container**:\n   - Let `n` be the number of unblocked agents found in step 2.\n   - Consider the 9 cells of the container (the 3\u00d73 around the `2`), in **row-major order**:\n     - (top row, left to right), then (middle row, left to right), then (bottom row, left to right).\n   - Change the first `n` of these cells from `3` (or `2`) to `9`.\n   - If `n \u2265 9`, the entire container (including the `2`) becomes `9`.\n\nThis matches the examples:\n\n- Example 3: 4 agents, all reachable \u2192 4 cells in the 3\u00d73 (the first four in row-major order) turn into `9`.\n- Example 1: only 2 agents in the reachable component \u2192 only the first two container cells turn to `9`.\n- Example 2: at least 9 agents reachable \u2192 the entire 3\u00d73 fills with `9` (center `2` included).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Applying to the test input\n\n### 3.1. Locate the central container\n\nThe 3\u00d73 block is at rows 5\u20137, columns 5\u20137:\n\n- Row 5: `..., 6, 3, 3, 3, 6, ...`\n- Row 6: `..., 6, 3, 2, 3, 6, ...`\n- Row 7: `..., 6, 3, 3, 3, 6, ...`\n\nSo the container cells in row-major order are:\n\n1. (5,5) = 3  \n2. (5,6) = 3  \n3. (5,7) = 3  \n4. (6,5) = 3  \n5. (6,6) = 2  \n6. (6,7) = 3  \n7. (7,5) = 3  \n8. (7,6) = 3  \n9. (7,7) = 3  \n\n### 3.2. BFS from the target through non-wall cells\n\nWe start from (6,6) and can move through any non-`6` cell.\n\nCarrying out the flood fill (as in the analysis) we find that the reachable region includes:\n\n- The entire 3\u00d73 container.\n- A downward path: (7,6) \u2192 (8,7) \u2192 (9,7) \u2192 (9,6) \u2192 (9,5) \u2192 (10,5) \u2192 (11,5) \u2192 (11,6) \u2192 (11,7).\n\nAll other directions are sealed off by `6`-walls.\n\nWithin this reachable region, the only cells with value `9` (agents) are:\n\n- (11,5)  \n- (11,7)\n\nSo:\n\n- **Unblocked agents**: (11,5), (11,7)  \u21d2  n = 2  \n- All other `9`s are **blocked** and stay put.\n\n### 3.3. Update agents\u2019 origin cells\n\nFor each unblocked agent, set its original cell to `7`:\n\n- (11,5): 9 \u2192 7  \n- (11,7): 9 \u2192 7  \n\nRow 11 changes from:\n\n`9,9,9,6,9,7,9,6,9,9,9`\n\nto\n\n`9,9,9,6,7,7,7,6,9,9,9`.\n\n### 3.4. Fill the container\n\nn = 2, so we change the **first 2** container cells in row-major order to `9`:\n\n1. (5,5): 3 \u2192 9  \n2. (5,6): 3 \u2192 9  \n\nThe rest of the 3\u00d73 (including the `2` at (6,6)) stays as-is (because there are only 2 agents).\n\nRow 5 changes from:\n\n`7,7,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,7,7`\n\nto\n\n`7,7,7,6,9,9,3,6,7,7,7`.\n\nNo other cells change.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Final output grid\n\nPutting it all together, the transformed grid is:\n\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7  \n7,7,9,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,9  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n6,6,9,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,9  \n7,7,7,6,9,9,3,6,7,7,7  \n7,6,6,6,3,2,3,6,7,6,6  \n7,7,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,7,7  \n6,6,9,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,9  \n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7  \n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6  \n9,9,9,6,7,7,7,6,9,9,9",

The 3x3 green block (with center 2) is the target\n2. Magenta (6) cells form walls/barriers\n3. 9s (agents) try to move toward the green center\n4. Blocked 9s remain in place; unblocked 9s disappear and fill the target\n5. The number of cells filled in the target generally corresponds to how many 9s can reach it\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n- Green 3x3 is at rows 4-6, cols 4-6 with center 2 at (5,5)\n- There are gaps in the walls at (3,5) and (7,6)\n\n**Tracing which 9s can reach the green:**\n- (1,2): Can path through row 2 \u2192 gap at (3,5) \u2192 green \u2713\n- (3,2): Can path through row 2 \u2192 gap at (3,5) \u2192 green \u2713\n- (1,10): Can path (1,10)\u2192(2,10)\u2192along row 2\u2192(3,5)\u2192green \u2713\n- (3,10): Can path (3,10)\u2192(2,10)\u2192along row 2\u2192(3,5)\u2192green \u2713\n- (10,4): Can path (10,4)\u2192(9,4)\u2192(8,4)\u2192(8,5)\u2192(8,6)\u2192gap at (7,6)\u2192green \u2713\n\n**Blocked 9s (remain):**\n- (0,4), (0,6): blocked by wall at row 1\n- (7,2), (7,10): blocked by surrounding walls\n- (10,0), (10,1), (10,2), (10,6), (10,8), (10,9), (10,10): blocked by walls\n\n**Applying the transformation:**\n- 5 9s reach the target \u2192 5 cells of the green 3x3 fill with 9\n- Filling follows row-major order, skipping the center 2:\n  - (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6) become 9\n- The 5 reaching 9s disappear from their original positions\n- Blocked 9s remain in place\n\n```\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,2,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,3,3,3,6,7,7,7\n6,6,9,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n9,9,9,6,7,7,9,6,9,9,9\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Below is the reasoning I used, followed by the grid I obtain.  \nNote: the true ARC rule behind this task is quite intricate; what I reconstruct here is the **simplest rule that matches the \u201ccavity filling\u201d behavior** in the examples and that I can consistently apply to the test.\n\n---\n\n## Reasoning and reconstructed rule\n\nFrom the three examples:\n\n- Color `9` = agents.\n- Color `6` = \u201cmagenta\u201d structural walls.\n- Colors `3` and `2` = parts of the central target structure (a 3\u00d73 block shaped `3,3,3 / 3,2,3 / 3,3,3`).\n- Color `7` = background, unchanged except where agents leave.\n\nAcross all examples:\n\n- The **only non\u2011wall structure that ever changes color** (aside from agents vanishing) is the **3\u00d73 block around the center**:\n  - Example 1: only some of the `3`s turn into `9`s.\n  - Example 2: the entire 3\u00d73 (all `3`s and the central `2`) become `9`.\n  - Example 3: some of the `3`s in the top/left part become `9`.\n\n- Walls `6` and the background `7` are preserved.\n- No new `9`s appear anywhere except by **recoloring the central 3\u00d73 block**.\n- The examples suggest:\n  - If the target is effectively *inside a container* that agents can reach, the **entire cavity (the 3\u00d73 block) gets filled** with `9`.  \n    (Example 2)\n  - In more open situations, only *part* of that 3\u00d73 is filled, depending on how agents approach.  \n    (Examples 1 and 3)\n\nFor the **test input**, the central 3\u00d73 structure is again present:\n\nRows 5\u20137, columns 5\u20137 of the test input:\n\n- Row 5: `..., 6, 3, 3, 3, 6, ...`\n- Row 6: `..., 6, 3, 2, 3, 6, ...`\n- Row 7: `..., 6, 3, 3, 3, 6, ...`\n\nSo the central pattern is:\n\n- Row 5, col 5\u20137: `3 3 3`\n- Row 6, col 5\u20137: `3 2 3`\n- Row 7, col 5\u20137: `3 3 3`\n\nThe surrounding `6`s form a fairly solid frame; combined with the density and distribution of agents (`9`s) all around it, the most straightforward extension of the behavior seen in **Example 2** is:\n\n> The agents, via some accessible paths around the 6\u2011walls, **successfully reach the target inside the container**, so the **entire 3\u00d73 cavity is filled with 9**.\n\nUnder this reconstructed rule, for the test:\n\n- The **only transformation** I apply is:\n  - Inside that 3\u00d73 block (rows 5\u20137, cols 5\u20137), **every `3` and the central `2` become `9`**.\n- All other cells (including all `6`s, all background `7`s, and all existing agents `9`) are left unchanged.\n\nSo we take the test input and replace:\n\n- (5,5),(5,6),(5,7) : `3 \u2192 9`\n- (6,5),(6,6),(6,7) : `3,2,3 \u2192 9,9,9`\n- (7,5),(7,6),(7,7) : `3 \u2192 9`\n\nEverything else stays as in the input.\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\nApplying that to the test input yields:\n\nRow 1: `7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7`  \nRow 2: `7,7,9,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,9`  \nRow 3: `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7`  \nRow 4: `6,6,9,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,9`  \nRow 5: `7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7`  \nRow 6: `7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6`  \nRow 7: `7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7`  \nRow 8: `6,6,9,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,9`  \nRow 9: `7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7`  \nRow10: `7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6`  \nRow11: `9,9,9,6,9,7,9,6,9,9,9`\n\nSo the completed output grid is:\n\n```\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,9,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,9\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,9,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n6,6,9,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n9,9,9,6,9,7,9,6,9,9,9\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "The solved cases show that the brown \u201cagents\u201d (9) can move through any non\u2011magenta cells; cells with value\u202f6 act as solid walls. The \u201ctarget\u201d cavity is the block of green 3s with the 2 in the middle.\n\nTo transform a grid, start a flood\u2011fill from the cavity (the 3s and the central 2), moving only through non\u20116 cells. This gives all reachable agents together with their shortest\u2010path distances. Only as many agents as there are fillable cells are moved: first the green cells (in row\u2011major order), and if there is an extra, the center 2. Agents are chosen in order of increasing distance; any further reachable or blocked agents stay put. Moved agents are removed (set to 7), and their number of slots in the cavity are set to 9.\n\nIn the test grid the cavity has 8 green cells plus the center, and 14 agents are reachable; the nine nearest are moved. All nine cavity cells are filled with 9s, and the selected agents\u2019 original positions are cleared to 7.\n\nThe resulting grid is:\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,9,9,6,7,7,7,6,9,9,9",

            "Full raw LLM response": "To solve this task I first identified the colours by their roles from the examples:\n\n- `2` is the central target, surrounded by a 3\u00d73 block of `3` cells; this block is the \u201ccavity\u201d to be filled.\n- `9` cells are the mobile agents.\n- `6` cells form the magenta walls which are impassable.\n- The background/free space for movement is `7` (and agents themselves, which sit on the background).\n\nThe transformation proceeds as follows:\n\n1. Find the cavity: the connected component of `3` cells around the single `2`. Its capacity is the number of cells in this block (always 9 in the examples).\n2. Find all free cells (value `7` or `9`) that are orthogonally adjacent to the cavity; these are the \u201centry points\u201d. Perform a breadth\u2011first search from these entry points through free cells, treating `6` and the cavity cells (`3` and `2`) as obstacles. This yields the shortest path distance from the cavity entry to each agent.\n3. Agents that are unreachable stay in place. If the number of reachable agents is less than or equal to the cavity capacity, all reachable agents move; otherwise, select the reachable agents with the smallest distances up to the cavity capacity. Moving agents disappear from their origin, which is set to the background colour `7`.\n4. Fill the cavity cells with the colour `9` in row\u2011major order using as many moved agents as available. If the number moved is at least the capacity, the entire cavity (including the central `2`) becomes `9`.\n\nApplying this to the test input, the reachable agents\u2019 distances give nine agents with the smallest distances:\n(2,3), (4,3), (11,5), (2,11), (4,11), (11,7), (8,3), (8,11), (11,1).\nThese move, their original cells become `7`, and because nine agents move the entire 3\u00d73 cavity is filled with `9`.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,9,9,6,7,7,7,6,9,9,9",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**My primary goal here is to understand the underlying logic that drives the changes between the input and output images.** I see three key elements at play: a central green object, magenta structures that act as barriers, and dark red elements that seem to move. The relationships between these elements and their interactions dictate the transformation.\n\n**Here's what I've observed:**\n\n1.  **Structure**: The green object always remains central, serving as a focal point. Magenta shapes are static walls. Dark red elements appear to be the agents of change.\n2.  **Logic**:  The movement of dark red elements appears crucial.  They are drawn toward the green object, but blocked by the magenta walls.  The layout of these elements shapes the transformation.\n3.  **Pathfinding & Containment**: Connectivity (or pathfinding) is key. The position of magenta elements affects which red elements reach the green object.  When red elements are blocked by walls, they stay in place. When the green object is reachable, it triggers a reaction.\n4.  **Transformation**:  In simple terms, I see a few key types:\n    *   **Blocking**: The magenta walls prevent the dark red elements from moving towards the green object, and thus there is no change.\n    *   **Filling**:  If the green object *can* be reached, a \"fill\" operation occurs.  This fill seems to spread to fill any adjacent (connected) space bounded by magenta walls.\n    *   **Aggregation**: If there are no walls to define a container, the red elements simply accumulate onto the green object, resulting in a shape change.\n5.  **Hypothesis**: The core is pathfinding: the red elements try to get to the green object, walls obstruct the path. If they get through, something happens at the destination which causes the changes we see.\n\n**I have some checks in mind**:\n\n1.  I want to verify my pathfinding idea: are the \"preserved\" red elements always separated from the green by walls?\n2.  I want to make sure the fill in the arch case always exactly matches the space under the arch.\n3.  I will be checking if the shape of the red on the green in the last case relates to the positions of the individual red pixels in the input.\n\n**Ultimately, I believe this is a system of attraction & filling**. The red elements move. The walls block movement. If a path exists, things change.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided image containing three training examples, here are the observations and insights:\n\n### **1. Describe the observable structures**\n*   **Static Central Object:** In every input, there is a central **green square ring** (3x3) with a single **red pixel** in the center. This appears to be the \"target\" or \"home.\"\n*   **Barriers/Walls:** There are **magenta structures** (lines/curves) forming partial or complete enclosures around the central green object.\n    *   Input 1 has a spiral/loop that encloses the center.\n    *   Input 2 has an arch or \"pi\" shape, open at the bottom.\n    *   Input 3 has no magenta structure.\n*   **Mobile Agents:** There are scattered **dark red (maroon) pixels/blocks**. Their positions vary (corners, edges, random clusters).\n*   **Background:** An orange background is constant.\n*   **Changes:**\n    *   **Input 1 \u2192 Output 1:** The scene is largely unchanged. The magenta wall and green center remain. The dark red pixels remain in their original spots.\n    *   **Input 2 \u2192 Output 2:** The scattered dark red pixels on the left are **gone**. A large **dark red rectangular block** appears inside the magenta arch, replacing the green square. The dark red pixels on the top right are **preserved**.\n    *   **Input 3 \u2192 Output 3:** The scattered dark red pixels are **gone**. The green square remains but is **partially covered/overlapped** by a dark red shape.\n\n### **2. Identify transformation categories**\n*   **Object movement:** **Present**. Dark red pixels appear to move or be consumed.\n*   **Object recoloring:** **Absent** (Objects are replaced or moved, not just recolored).\n*   **Bordering / outlining:** **Maybe** (The magenta shape acts as a border/container).\n*   **Filling holes or cavities:** **Present** (The arch in Input 2 gets filled).\n*   **Removing noise:** **Maybe** (Scattered pixels are removed if they \"move\").\n*   **Connectivity / Pathfinding:** **PRESENT** (Crucial: behavior depends on whether a path to the center exists).\n\n### **3. Extract the key non-obvious insights**\n*   **Selective Filtering of \"Noise\":** Not all scattered dark red pixels are removed. In Output 2, the pixels on the top right remain, while those on the left disappear. This suggests removal depends on **reachability** relative to the center.\n*   **Walls act as Barriers:** The magenta shapes act as solid walls. In Input 1, the wall fully protects the center; nothing changes. In Input 2, the wall protects the top-right pixels from reaching the center (or protects the center from them), but the left/bottom is open.\n*   **Attraction to Center:** The transformation implies that dark red pixels \"travel\" towards the central green object. If they are blocked by a magenta wall (Input 1, Input 2 top-right), they stay put. If they have a clear path (Input 2 left, Input 3), they move to the center.\n*   **Cavity Filling vs. Accumulation:** When dark red pixels reach the center:\n    *   If the center is inside a semi-enclosed area (Input 2's arch), the entire cavity fills with dark red, consuming the green square.\n    *   If the center is in the open (Input 3), the pixels simply accumulate on top of the green square without generating a massive fill.\n\n### **4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)**\nThe task simulates a \"flow\" or \"attack\" where scattered **dark red agents attempt to move towards the central green target**. The **magenta shapes act as impermeable barriers**.\n*   Any agent that is **blocked** by a barrier remains in its initial position (e.g., Input 1, Input 2 top-right).\n*   Any agent that has a **clear path** moves to the target and merges with it.\n*   If agents successfully reach the target inside a defined enclosure (like the arch in Input 2), they trigger a **flood fill** that occupies the negative space of the enclosure. If there is no enclosure (Input 3), they simply settle on the target.\n\n### **5. List checks you would perform when solving**\n*   Check connectivity for every dark red pixel: \"Can this pixel reach the green center using only orange (empty) space?\"\n*   If `connected == true`, remove the pixel and flag the center as \"hit\".\n*   If `connected == false`, keep the pixel in the output.\n*   Determine the fill logic: If the center is hit, does the output shape match the convex hull of the container, or is it just a precise fill of the \"room\" connected to the center?\n*   Verify if the \"partial red\" on the green square in Output 3 corresponds to the number/direction of the incoming pixels from Input 3.\n\n### **6. Summarize final insights**\n\nHINT_START\n*   The transformation simulates **mobile agents** (dark red) moving towards a **central target** (green).\n*   **Magenta shapes act as walls**: Agents blocked by walls remain in their original positions (preserved).\n*   Agents with a **clear path** to the center disappear from their origin and affect the target.\n*   If agents reach the target inside a container/cavity, the entire **cavity fills** with the agent's color.\nHINT_END",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**I've got this!** I'm tasked with solving an ARC problem where I'm given three examples and a test case. My goal is to understand how the input grid is transformed into the output grid. Based on my analysis, I've identified several key elements.\n\nFirst, I look at the grid's objects: there's a background color (7), a container or wall color (6), a specific 3x3 feature (usually a ring of 3s with a center 2, sometimes a 9), and scattered objects (9s).\n\nThe transformation involves identifying these elements and applying a specific set of rules. I start by locating the 3x3 feature and all the scattered 9s.  Then I determine path-connectedness between these 9s and the feature. A \"path\" here means a sequence of non-6 cells; the 6s are walls that block the path.\n\nThe rules are pretty clear: any connected 9 can be moved into the 3x3 feature, replacing the 3s. There's a catch: I can move at most 8 of these 9s, matching the number of 3s. The original position of the moved 9s becomes the background color. If and only if all 8 positions are filled, then the center '2' is also changed to a '9'. If fewer than 8 are available, then the center remains.\n\nThrough careful analysis of the provided examples, I've refined my approach:\n\n1.  **Grid Parsing**: I'll locate the 3x3 feature, storing the positions of '3's (targets) and the center '2'.\n2.  **Scatter 9s**: Find all 9s in the input grid.\n3.  **Connectivity Check**: I'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from the feature to see which 9s are reachable, considering 6s as blocking elements. I determine the distances from each 9 to the 3x3 feature.\n4.  **Select & Sort Reachable 9s**: I sort reachable 9s based on distance (shortest first). Ties are broken using \"Reverse Reading Order\" (bottom-to-top, right-to-left) to get the correct order. I select the top N (capped at 9).\n5.  **Move**: I'll select up to 9 `9`s, convert original location into a `7`, and place the selected `9`s in the 3x3 feature (by reading order of the targets). The center becomes a `9` if there are 9 selected.\n6.  **Output**: I generate the output grid.\n\nI've tested this on a test input and I am confident that my approach is correct. I have carefully traced the input/output grid, the reachable nine locations, and distance calculations to arrive at a solution. I am ready to implement and provide an output.",

All other colors (0\u20139 except 6) are traversable for connectivity purposes.\n\n3. **Find which scatter 9s are connected to the 3\u00d73 feature**\n\n   We perform a flood-fill (BFS/DFS) starting from all 9 cells of the 3\u00d73 feature (its 8 border 3s and the central 2) and expand through all non-6 cells (7, 9, 3, 2, etc.).\n\n   For the test grid, that flood fill from the feature can reach **all** of the scatter 9s:\n\n   - Row 1: (1,5), (1,7)\n   - Row 2: (2,3), (2,11)\n   - Row 4: (4,3), (4,11)\n   - Row 8: (8,3), (8,11)\n   - Row 11: (11,1), (11,2), (11,3), (11,5), (11,7), (11,9), (11,10), (11,11)\n\n   So there are 16 connected scatter 9s.\n\n4. **Choose which 9s to move**\n\n   The 3\u00d73 feature has 9 cells to fill (8 border cells originally `3`, plus center originally `2`). We move at most 9 scatter 9s into it.\n\n   To make the choice deterministic, we order the connected scatter 9s in **reading order (row-major)** and take the first 9:\n\n   Connected 9s in reading order:\n\n   1. (1,5)\n   2. (1,7)\n   3. (2,3)\n   4. (2,11)\n   5. (4,3)\n   6. (4,11)\n   7. (8,3)\n   8. (8,11)\n   9. (11,1)\n   10. (11,2)\n   11. (11,3)\n   12. (11,5)\n   13. (11,7)\n   14. (11,9)\n   15. (11,10)\n   16. (11,11)\n\n   We move the first 9 of these.\n\n5. **Fill the 3\u00d73 feature with these 9s**\n\n   We also fix an order for filling the 3\u00d73, using reading order over the 3\u00d73 but placing the center last:\n\n   1. (5,5)\n   2. (5,6)\n   3. (5,7)\n   4. (6,5)\n   5. (6,7)\n   6. (7,5)\n   7. (7,6)\n   8. (7,7)\n   9. (6,6)  \u2190 center\n\n   Since we have \u22659 connected 9s, all these 9 positions become `9`.

            "Full raw LLM response": "The grid consists of a background of\u202f7s with walls of\u202f6s, a 3\u00d73 feature made of\u202f3s with a central\u202f2, and scattered\u202f9s. To transform you:\n\n1. Locate the 3\u00d73 block (rows\u202f5\u20137, cols\u202f5\u20137 here).\n2. Treat all non\u20116 cells as passable and run a BFS from the 3\u00d73 block to find which 9s are connected and their shortest path lengths.\n3. Select the connected 9s with the smallest distances, up to the number of cells in the 3\u00d73 (nine). Turn their source cells into 7.\n4. Fill the 3\u00d73 block in row\u2011major order with those 9s; because enough were available, all nine cells including the center become\u202f9.\n\nApplying this to the test input, the nine nearest connected 9s are moved into the feature, their original spots become 7, and the isolated top\u2011row 9s remain.

                "response": "**Analysis and Object Identification in the Grid Data**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at these grids, and the primary thing I notice is that the background is consistently color 7. That's our base, our starting point.  Now, the most prominent object, the thing that immediately jumps out at me, is this distinctive 3x3 square. It's usually a border of color 3 with a single pixel of color 2 in the center. But sometimes it's got a color 9 mixed in. The position of this block seems significant, but I'm not inferring rules, just describing the objects.\n\nThen, there are these structures made of color 6. They're often connected and loop-like, sometimes rectangular, enclosing an area. I'll describe them as containers. They create an \"inside\" area. The shape of the container can vary.\n\nFinally, there's this \"noise\" of color 9 pixels. They are scattered about \u2013 single pixels, small clusters, sometimes lines. They don't seem to have a defined pattern, just these scattered pixels on the background or within the color 6 containers.  Now, to sum this up using only numeric values:\n\n`<objects_summary> background: 7, container: 6, 3x3 feature: 3 and 2 (sometimes 9), scatter: 9 </objects_summary>`\n\n\nBased on the provided grids, the objects can be described as follows:\n\n**Background**\nThe grids are primarily composed of a field of color 7. This serves as the canvas upon which other objects are placed.\n\n**3x3 Feature Squares**\nThere is a recurring distinct square object with dimensions of 3x3. The most common configuration of this object is a perimeter ring of color 3 surrounding a single center pixel of color 2. In some instances, this 3x3 region may contain or consist of color 9s. This object is typically treated as a singular coherent entity.\n\n**Linear Boundaries / Containers**\nMany grids feature connected structures made of color 6. These structures form linear segments that connect to create shapes, often forming closed loops, rectangles, or irregular polygons. These objects act as containers or boundaries, partitioning the grid into an \"interior\" space and the surrounding \"exterior\" background. These containers vary in shape and size but consistently use color 6.\n\n**Scattered Elements**\nPixels of color 9 appear frequently throughout the grids. These act as scattered elements or markers. They appear as:\n*   Single isolated pixels on the color 7 background.\n*   Small clusters or short lines.\n*   Fill within or adjacent to the color 6 containers.\n*   Components interacting with the 3x3 feature squares.\n\n<objects_summary>\n1. Background: Large field of color 7.\n2. Feature Squares: 3x3 blocks, typically composed of a color 3 border and a color 2 center.\n3. Containers: Irregular or rectangular closed loops made of connected color 6 pixels.\n4. Scattered Elements: Isolated pixels, lines, or clusters of color 9 situated inside containers or on the background.\n</objects_summary>",

                "response": "**Grid Transformation Summary**\n\nMy task is to decipher the rules governing the transformation of input grids into output grids. I've been focusing on identifying patterns related to a 3x3 feature (a center element surrounded by others), scatter elements (9s), and container structures (6s). \n\nHere's what I've discovered:\n\n1.  **The Target:** A 3x3 region with a center element (initially '2' surrounded by '3's) is the focus of the transformation.\n2.  **Container Presence:** Walls (defined by '6's) influence this transformation by creating or blocking paths.\n3.  **Scatter Element Movement:** '9's, scattered across the grid, can move towards the 3x3 feature. Movement is restricted by container walls.\n4.  **Pathfinding:** '9's will move to fill this 3x3 feature only if they are connected to it through a path of 7s and/or 9s (the background color). Wall elements block movement.\n5.  **Filling order:** '9's are moved to fill the '3' cells of this feature, in a specific order starting from the top-left and moving row by row, left to right.\n6.  **Box Fullness Trigger:** If at least eight '9's successfully move into the 3x3 feature, it will then get filled with 9s.\n7.  **Center Element Transformation:** Once the eight '3' cells have been filled with '9's, the center element ('2') also transforms into a '9'. This does not consume a ninth '9'.\n8.  **Conservation:**  When '9's move into the 3x3 feature, the original positions of those moved '9's are changed to '7's. \n9.  **Connected 9s** Scatter 9s are 'connected' if there is an unbroken chain of 7s/9s from the location of the 9 to the outside 3x3 feature.\n\n**Specific Transformation Details (Example: Test Input)**\n\n*   The 3x3 feature in the test input transforms to contain all '9's\n*   Eight scatter '9's are converted into '7's.\n*   The selection of which 8 scatter 9s to use is likely to be based on closeness (in terms of path length) to the feature and if the position of the 9 is inside the tube-shaped connection. \n\nIn summary, the grid transformations are governed by the movement of scatter elements toward a 3x3 feature that fills the feature and its own center with nines as long as it has access to the correct number of elements.\n\n\nThe input grids contain a background of color 7 (orange). Within this background, there are several objects:\n1.  **3x3 Feature**: A 3x3 square located typically in the center-left or center. Its pattern is a ring of 3s (green) surrounding a center 2 (red).\n2.  **Container/Walls**: Structures made of color 6 (magenta) that form walls, lines, or enclosures around the 3x3 feature. These walls constrain movement.\n3.  **Scatter**: Single cells or small clumps of color 9 (maroon) scattered across the grid.\n\nThe transformations observed are as follows:\n-   **Movement of Scatter 9s**: The 9s scattered around the grid move into the 3x3 feature. This movement is constrained by the walls (6). Only 9s that have a valid path (through 7s or other non-wall cells) to the 3x3 feature can move. 9s that are completely enclosed by walls or grid boundaries (like the ones in the top \"bucket\" in the test input) cannot move and remain in place.\n-   **Filling the 3x3 Feature**: The moving 9s occupy the positions of the 3s (green) in the 3x3 feature. They fill these spots, effectively turning the 3s into 9s.\n-   **Transformation of Center 2**: If the 3x3 feature's ring of 3s (8 cells) is completely filled by incoming 9s (meaning at least 8 connected 9s were available and moved), the center 2 (red) also transforms into a 9. If fewer than 8 nines move (as in Example 1 and 3), the center 2 remains as 2.\n-   **Disappearance of Source 9s**: The 9s that move to the box leave their original positions, which become background 7s. The number of 9s that disappear from the scatter matches the number of slots filled in the 3x3 feature (up to 8). In Example 2, exactly 8 scatter 9s disappeared to fill the 8 '3' slots, and the center turned to 9 as a consequence of the ring being full.\n\n**Application to Test Input**:\n-   **3x3 Feature**: Located at rows 4-6, columns 4-6. It has 8 '3's and 1 '2'.\n-   **Trapped 9s**: The 9s at (0,4) and (0,6) are enclosed by 6s at R0 C3/C7 and R1 C3-7. They cannot move.\n-   **Connected 9s**: There are at least 14 other 9s on the grid (e.g., at (1,2), (3,2), (10,4), etc.) that have a clear path to the 3x3 feature (entering through gaps in the walls, such as the bottom opening at row 10 or side gaps).\n-   **Result**: Since there are more than 8 connected 9s, the 3x3 feature will completely fill with 9s. The 8 '3's become '9's, and the center '2' becomes '9'. Accordingly, 8 of the connected scatter 9s will be removed (turn to 7).\n\n<transformation_summary>\n1. Identify the 3x3 feature (ring of 3s, center 2) and all scatter 9s.\n2. Determine which scatter 9s are path-connected to the 3x3 feature (blocked by 6s).\n3. Move connected 9s into the 3x3 feature, replacing the 3s with 9s.\n4. Limit the number of moved 9s to 8 (the number of 3s). The original positions of these 9s become 7.\n5. If all 8 '3's are replaced by 9s, change the center '2' to '9'.\n</transformation_summary>",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Algorithm Synthesis and Validation**\n\nOkay, here's the game plan, based on those examples and that user-provided text.  The task is to transform a grid with scattered \"9\"s, potentially bounded by \"6\"s, and containing a central \"3x3\" structure with either a \"2\" or \"3\" at its center.  We're going to use this connected component and close-by distances, applying the rules of the connected 9s.\n\n1.  **Frame and Interior Identification:** Figure out what 6s enclose the 3x3 pattern.  I'm going to determine a main frame structure based on 6s around the central pattern.  This *frame* might not be a closed box.\n\n2.  **Compartment Definition:**  Define a compartment.  The critical compartment includes the cells of the *frame*, AND any \"nearby\" cells, even if not physically adjacent.  This is a critical part, as it dictates what 9s are *active*.\n\n3.  **Active 9s Classification:** A 9 is Active if it is:\n    *   Inside the compartment.\n    *   \"Close\" to the frame (within a distance of 2 based on grid steps). The \"within 2 cells\" rule makes more sense when working the examples.\n\n4.  **Transformation:**\n    *   Count the active 9s.\n    *   Remove (change to 7) those Active 9s.\n    *   Fill the 3x3 pattern with this *count* of 9s.\n\nIn summary, this approach correctly identified that the position of the 9s relative to the structure determines whether to remove them. This is the crucial aspect of this ARC.\n\nTo solve this problem, I will apply the transformation rules inferred from the examples and the provided description.\n\n**1. Identify the Central Pattern and Frame Structure**\nThe central 3x3 pattern (containing 3s and a 2) is located in rows 4-6, columns 4-6.\n- Row 4: `...6,3,3,3,6...`\n- Row 5: `...6,3,2,3,6...`\n- Row 6: `...6,3,3,3,6...`\n\nThe \"Frame\" consists of the color 6 cells surrounding this pattern and extending through the grid.\n- In the test input, the frame structure is complex, appearing in rows 0, 1, 3, 4-6, 7, 8, 9, 10.\n- Key observation: The frame forms barriers. Specifically, Row 1 has a solid segment of 6s from column 3 to 7 (`6,6,6,6,6`), and Row 3, 7, 8, 9 have 6s at columns 3 and 7 (forming vertical walls).\n\n**2. Classify 9s (Active vs. Protected)**\nI need to determine connectivity of each 9 to the central pattern region (R4-6, C4-6).\n- **Connectivity check:** The central pattern connects to Row 2 via a gap in Row 3 at (3,5). Row 2 is all 7s, so it connects to the left (cols 0-2) and right (cols 8-10) sides of the grid. The pattern also connects downwards via a gap in Row 7 at (7,6) to the bottom regions.\n- **Protected 9s:** The 9s at **(0,4)** and **(0,6)** are in Row 0 inside the vertical frame lines (cols 3 and 7). However, Row 1 has a solid wall of 6s at cols 3-7. This wall completely isolates the region (R0, C4-6) from the rest of the grid (specifically from Row 2 and the pattern below). Since these 9s are in a **separate enclosed compartment**, they are **protected**.\n- **Active 9s:** All other 9s are connected to the central pattern (either through the open Row 2 or the bottom gaps) and are adjacent to the frame structure (not \"distant\").\n  - Row 1: (1,2), (1,10)\n  - Row 3: (3,2), (3,10)\n  - Row 7: (7,2), (7,10)\n  - Row 10: (10,0), (10,1), (10,2), (10,4), (10,6), (10,8), (10,9), (10,10)\n  Total Active 9s = 14.\n\n**3. Transformation**\n- **Remove Active 9s:** Replace the 14 active 9s with background color 7.\n- **Fill Pattern:** Replace the cells in the 3x3 pattern (R4-6, C4-6) with color 9. Since we removed 14 nines and the pattern has only 9 cells, we fill all 9 cells with 9s.\n- **Preserve Protected 9s:** The 9s at (0,4) and (0,6) remain unchanged.\n\n**Output Construction:**\n- **Row 0:** `7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7` (Protected 9s remain)\n- **Row 1:** `7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7` (9s at cols 2,10 removed)\n- **Row 2:** `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7` (Unchanged)\n- **Row 3:** `6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7` (9s at cols 2,10 removed)\n- **Row 4:** `7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7` (Pattern filled with 9s)\n- **Row 5:** `7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6` (Pattern filled with 9s)\n- **Row 6:** `7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7` (Pattern filled with 9s)\n- **Row 7:** `6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7` (9s at cols 2,10 removed)\n- **Row 8:** `7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7` (Unchanged)\n- **Row 9:** `7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6` (Unchanged)\n- **Row 10:** `7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7` (All 9s removed)\n\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7",

The central 3\u00d73 pattern (3s surrounding 2) defines the \"target\" region.\n\n2. **Classify 9s**: \n   - 9s connected to the pattern region (same compartment, inside frame, or within 2 cells of frame interior) are \"active\"\n   - 9s in separate enclosed compartments or distant from the frame are \"protected\"\n\n3. **Remove active 9s**: Replace all active 9s with color 7 (background)\n\n4. **Fill pattern**: Replace pattern cells with color 9 in reading order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom), replacing 3s before 2. Number of replacements equals number of removed 9s (up to 9 maximum).\n\n5. **Preserve protected 9s**: 9s in isolated compartments remain unchanged\n\n6. **No frame case**: Without 6-boundaries, all 9s are active and removed\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to:\n1. Find the central 3\u00d73 pattern (3s surrounding 2)\n2. Identify the frame (6s) structure\n3. Classify 9s as \"active\" (to be removed) or \"protected\" (to stay)\n4. Remove active 9s and fill pattern cells with 9s\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n\nThe central pattern is at rows 4-6, cols 4-6 (3s around 2).\n\n**Frame structure analysis:**\n- Vertical walls at cols 3 and 7 throughout\n- Horizontal bars: Row 1 has 6s at cols 3-7, creating an enclosed compartment above\n- Row 0 has 6s at cols 3 and 7, sealing the top compartment\n\n**Identifying compartments:**\nThe top compartment (row 0, cols 4-6) is enclosed:\n- Bottom: Row 1 frame (cols 3-7)\n- Sides: 6s at cols 3 and 7 in row 0\n- The 9s at (0,4) and (0,6) are **protected** (in separate enclosed compartment)\n\n**Connectivity analysis from pattern:**\nThrough gaps at (3,5) and (7,6), I trace which 9s are connected to the pattern interior:\n\nActive 9s (connected to pattern, will be removed):\n- (1,2), (1,10) - via row 2 path\n- (3,2), (3,10) - via side paths\n- (7,2), (7,10) - via extended paths through cols 2 and 8-10\n- (10,0), (10,1), (10,2), (10,4), (10,6), (10,8), (10,9), (10,10) - bottom row\n\nTotal: 14 active 9s removed\n\n**Transformation:**\n- Remove 14 active 9s (replace with 7)\n- Fill pattern cells with 9 in reading order (max 9 cells)\n- Since 14 > 9, all 9 pattern cells become 9\n- Protected 9s at (0,4) and (0,6) remain\n\n**Output grid:**\n\n```\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n```",

The central 3\u00d73 pattern (3s surrounding 2) defines the \"target\" region.\n\n2. **Classify 9s**: \n   - 9s connected to the pattern region (same compartment, inside frame, or within 2 cells of frame interior) are \"active\"\n   - 9s in separate enclosed compartments or distant from the frame are \"protected\"\n\n3. **Remove active 9s**: Replace all active 9s with color 7 (background)\n\n4. **Fill pattern**: Replace pattern cells with color 9 in reading order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom), replacing 3s before 2. Number of replacements equals number of removed 9s (up to 9 maximum).\n\n5. **Preserve protected 9s**: 9s in isolated compartments remain unchanged\n\n6. **No frame case**: Without 6-boundaries, all 9s are active and removed\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning (high\u2011level)**\n\n1. **What the training examples do**\n\n   Across the three examples, the consistent behavior is:\n\n   - There is a fixed central 3\u00d73 \u201cpattern\u201d (rows 5\u20137, columns 5\u20137) made of 3s with a 2 in the center.\n   - Some 9s elsewhere in the grid are **removed** (turned into 7s).\n   - The central 3\u00d73 is then filled with 9s in reading order (left\u2011to\u2011right, top\u2011to\u2011bottom), turning 3s into 9s first and the center 2 only after all 3s, using as many 9s as were removed, up to 9 cells.\n   - Some 9s are **protected** and left where they are.  \n   - Color 6 forms \u201cwalls\u201d; regions (compartments) of non\u20116 cells separated by 6s behave independently.  \n     - Example 1: pattern sits inside a closed compartment; only the 9s in that same enclosed region are removed (2 of them).\n     - Example 3: there are no 6s, so there is effectively a single global region; all 9s are removed (4 of them).\n     - Example 2: the 6s form an open frame; there is one big region, but a top\u2011right 9 cluster is far from the frame and is treated as protected, while a bunch of other 9s are removed (9 total).\n\n   So in words:\n\n   - Use 6s to define **compartments**.\n   - In the compartment containing the 3\u00d73 pattern, most of the 9s are **active** and get moved into the pattern, except any that lie in clearly separate \u201csmall rooms\u201d fully enclosed by 6s.\n   - 9s in other compartments are protected.\n\n2. **Compartments in the test grid**\n\n   For the test input (11\u00d711), we again take 6 as walls and consider 4\u2011connected regions of all non\u20116 cells (colors 0\u20139 except 6).\n\n   - The central 3\u00d73 pattern is at rows 5\u20137, columns 5\u20137, exactly as in the examples.\n   - If you conceptually flood\u2011fill from any pattern cell across non\u20116 cells, you find:\n     - One large region containing:\n       - All 9s at\n         (2,3), (2,11),\n         (4,3), (4,11),\n         (8,3), (8,11),\n         (11,1), (11,2), (11,3), (11,5), (11,7), (11,9), (11,10), (11,11),\n       - plus all the 3s/2/7s around them and around the pattern.\n     - A **separate small enclosed pocket** at the top, defined by 6s at:\n       - Row 1: column 4 and 8\n       - Row 2: columns 4\u20138\n       This pocket contains exactly three non\u20116 cells: (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), among which (1,5) and (1,7) are 9s.\n       There is no 4\u2011connected path from any pattern cell to these two 9s without crossing a 6.\n\n   Therefore:\n   - The compartment containing the pattern has **14** 9s.\n   - The separate top pocket has **2** 9s at (1,5) and (1,7).\n\n   By the rule inferred from the examples:\n\n   - 9s in the **same compartment as the pattern** are **active** (eligible to be removed and fed into the center).\n   - 9s in a **different enclosed compartment** are **protected**.\n\n   So in the test:\n   - **Active 9s** (in the pattern\u2019s compartment):  \n     (2,3), (2,11), (4,3), (4,11), (8,3), (8,11),  \n     (11,1), (11,2), (11,3), (11,5), (11,7), (11,9), (11,10), (11,11)  \u2192 14 cells.\n   - **Protected 9s** (separate pocket):  \n     (1,5), (1,7)  \u2192 2 cells.\n\n3. **Moving 9s into the central pattern**\n\n   - We remove all **active** 9s by turning them to 7.\n   - We have 14 removed 9s, but the central 3\u00d73 can hold at most 9 cells.\n   - So we place **9** 9s into the central pattern, in reading order, turning 3s first and then the 2 if needed:\n     - The pattern has 8 cells with color 3 and 1 cell with color 2.\n     - Since 9 \u2265 9, we turn **all nine** central cells to 9.\n   - Any remaining surplus removed 9s (14 \u2013 9 = 5) simply disappear (they were turned into 7 and not re\u2011used), which is allowed by the \u201cup to 9 maximum\u201d behavior.\n\n4. **Applying the changes**\n\n   Start from the test input and:\n\n   - Set the central 3\u00d73 (rows 5\u20137, cols 5\u20137) entirely to 9.\n   - Everywhere else, turn the **active** 9s to 7 and leave the **protected** 9s at (1,5) and (1,7) as 9.\n\n   Concretely:\n\n   - Row 1: two protected 9s at columns 5 and 7; unchanged.\n   - Row 2: 9s at (2,3) and (2,11) become 7.\n   - Row 4: 9s at (4,3) and (4,11) become 7.\n   - Row 8: 9s at (8,3) and (8,11) become 7.\n   - Row 11: all 9s (columns 1,2,3,5,7,9,10,11) become 7.\n\n   The central pattern (rows 5\u20137, columns 5\u20137) becomes all 9s.\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7",

The central 3\u00d73 pattern (3s surrounding 2) defines the \"target\" region.\n\n2. **Classify 9s**: \n   - 9s connected to the pattern region (same compartment, inside frame, or within 2 cells of frame interior) are \"active\"\n   - 9s in separate enclosed compartments or distant from the frame are \"protected\"\n\n3. **Remove active 9s**: Replace all active 9s with color 7 (background)\n\n4. **Fill pattern**: Replace pattern cells with color 9 in reading order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom), replacing 3s before 2. Number of replacements equals number of removed 9s (up to 9 maximum).\n\n5. **Preserve protected 9s**: 9s in isolated compartments remain unchanged\n\n6. **No frame case**: Without 6-boundaries, all 9s are active and removed\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "To reproduce the transformations in the examples I treated the \u201cwalls\u201d (colour\u202f6) as impassable and did a breadth\u2013first search starting from the central 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 pattern. The search expands through cells of colours 7/3/2; whenever the wavefront meets a 9 that 9 is \u201ccollected\u201d (the cell is turned to background 7 and becomes part of the reachable region). Collection stops when no more 9s are reachable or when nine have been taken. The collected count is then written back into the 3\u202f\u00d7\u202f3 pattern in reading order (row by row, left to right), turning those 3/2 cells into 9s; any leftover 3/2 remain unchanged. All other cells stay as they were.\n\nApplying this to the test grid, the first nine reachable 9s are at (2,3),(4,3),(11,5),(2,11),(4,11),(11,7),(8,3),(8,11),(11,1). These are set to 7, and the central block is filled completely with nine 9s. The resulting grid is:\n\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,9,9,6,7,7,7,6,9,9,9",

The central 3\u00d73 pattern (3s surrounding 2) defines the \"target\" region.\n\n2. **Classify 9s**: \n   - 9s connected to the pattern region (same compartment, inside frame, or within 2 cells of frame interior) are \"active\"\n   - 9s in separate enclosed compartments or distant from the frame are \"protected\"\n\n3. **Remove active 9s**: Replace all active 9s with color 7 (background)\n\n4. **Fill pattern**: Replace pattern cells with color 9 in reading order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom), replacing 3s before 2. Number of replacements equals number of removed 9s (up to 9 maximum).\n\n5. **Preserve protected 9s**: 9s in isolated compartments remain unchanged\n\n6. **No frame case**: Without 6-boundaries, all 9s are active and removed\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
