        "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task Summary - My Approach:**\n\nAlright, I'm facing an ARC task where I need to take two examples and a test input to figure out a rule for transforming a grid. The grids are always 16x16 with a mostly teal background. Inside, there are lines or shapes colored in a different color. The goal seems to be to \"fill\" or \"paint\" certain areas within those shapes.\n\nI started by looking for patterns in Example 1 and Example 2. In Example 1, yellow pixels (color 4) make diagonal lines. In Example 2, green pixels (color 3) also create diagonal structures. The test input shows maroon (color 9) diagonal patterns. The key here is to find the connection between these pattern colors and the rule for where to change the background to the fill color (color 2).\n\nThe first attempt was to consider the patterns as boundaries, and \"flood fill\" inside them. But, there were gaps, so I changed to \"closed regions\", however, they were not fully closed in these simple examples. Then, I realized that the diagonal lines must be crucial. I tried to apply the geometry (angles) to the rules, but it was not successful at that stage. So, I went to another method.\n\nThen came the idea of horizontal projections to build a theory. However, this was also incorrect.\n\nThen I realized a hidden geometric structure, and the pattern looks like a shadow or a \"diamond\" shape. I figured there had to be more to the story. I needed a better approach.\n\nI then realized that the problem involves connecting endpoints. In this case, the main diagonal lines represent the pattern.\n\nI then started to identify key aspects, which were to identify the segments, how the ends were connected, the shape it takes, and what pixels get filled.\n\nAfter trying several rules and examples, I now believe I've cracked it. The segments are not just the individual, they form a bigger structure. I call it the projection.\n\nHere's my logic:\n\n1.  **Identify Segments:** Identify continuous connected pixels of the specific pattern color (e.g., 4, 3, or 9). They are diagonals and can be represented by constant-sum equations (x+y= C). I stored that information.\n\n2.  **Define Regions:** The task is to fill the area between parallel lines of the specific color. The filled region is within those lines. For any pair of segments on either side, I'll project them across rows. The pixels to fill are those between the segments.\n\n3.  **Project and Intersect:** I'll look at the range of the difference between the $x$ and $y$ (y-x=K). These are the 'Projectors'. And for filling pixels, I'll project the lines to form a range, and all pixels in-between will be filled.\n\nThis projection creates a new structure between the lines, and the rule will decide where to fill, and where not.\n\nI can make it more clear with an example in a Test Input:\n\n1.  $S_1$: (4,4), (5,3) -> $C=8$. Range $[0, 2]$.\n2.  $S_2$: (4,9)...(9,4) -> $C=13$. Range $[-5, 5]$.\n3.  $S_3$: (5,13)...(13,5). $C=18$. Range $[-8, 8]$.\n4.  $S_4$: (7,15)...(15,7). $C=22$. Range $[-8, 8]$.\n\n*   Then, between Segment 1 and Segment 2, the pixels will be between 8 and 13 where $y-x$ is $[0, 2]$ which means those are points (5,4),(5,5),(6,4),(6,5),(6,6),(7,5) which will be 'filled'\n*   Then, between Segment 2 and 3, I get a range of the Projectors [-5, 5]. In other words,  all pixels with $x+y$ between 13 and 18, and $y-x$ in $[-5, 5]$.\n*   For segment 3 and 4, all pixels with $x+y$ between 18 and 22, and $y-x$ in $[-8, 8]$ are filled.\n\nBy looking into these structures, I will get accurate results!\n\n\nThe task requires analyzing the pattern formed by a specific non-background color (4 in Example 1, 3 in Example 2, 9 in the Test Input) and filling certain regions with color 2 (red).\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Pattern Analysis**: In all examples, the special color pixels form parallel line segments. By observing the coordinates, we can see these segments lie on diagonals where the sum of the row and column indices ($x+y$) is constant.\n    *   Example 1 has segments with $x+y \\approx 8, 12, 16, 12, 17, 23$.\n    *   The Test Input has '9's forming segments.\n        *   Segment 1: (4,4), (5,3). $x+y=8$.\n        *   Segment 2: (4,9) to (9,4). $x+y=13$.\n        *   Segment 3: (5,13) to (13,5). $x+y=18$.\n        *   Segment 4: (7,15) to (15,7). $x+y=22$.\n\n2.  **Transformation Logic**: The transformation fills the space between adjacent parallel segments.\n    *   Let $C = x+y$ (identifying the diagonal band).\n    *   Let $K = y-x$ (identifying the position along the diagonal).\n    *   For each segment, we determine its constant $C$ and the range of $K$ values it covers, $[K_{min}, K_{max}]$.\n    *   Regions are filled between adjacent segments $S_A$ and $S_B$ (with $C_A < C_B$).\n    *   The filled region consists of pixels where:\n        1.  $x+y$ is strictly between $C_A$ and $C_B$.\n        2.  $y-x$ is within the **intersection** of the $K$-ranges of segments $S_A$ and $S_B$. i.e., $K \\in [K_{min}^A, K_{max}^A] \\cap [K_{min}^B, K_{max}^B]$. (Based on Example 1's \"diamond\" shape).\n\n3.  **Application to Test Input**:\n    *   **Segment 1 ($S_1$)**: $C=8$. Endpoints (4,4), (5,3).\n        *   $K$ values: $4-4=0$, $3-5=-2$ (Wait, $y-x$: $4-4=0$, $3-5=-2$).\n        *   $K \\in [-2, 0]$. (Correction: Earlier I used index order. (4,4) is $y=4,x=4$. (5,3) is $y=5,x=3$. $5-3=2$. Range $[0, 2]$. Let's re-verify coordinates: Input grid provided is `row, col`. (4,4) is row 4, col 4. $y=4, x=4$. $K=0$. (5,3) is row 5, col 3. $y=5, x=3$. $K=2$. Range is $[0, 2]$).\n    *   **Segment 2 ($S_2$)**: $C=13$. Endpoints (4,9) ($K=4-9=-5$), (9,4) ($K=9-4=5$). Range $[-5, 5]$.\n    *   **Segment 3 ($S_3$)**: $C=18$. Endpoints (5,13) ($K=-8$), (13,5) ($K=8$). Range $[-8, 8]$.\n    *   **Segment 4 ($S_4$)**: $C=22$. Endpoints (7,15) ($K=-8$), (15,7) ($K=8$). Range $[-8, 8]$.\n\n    **Fills:**\n    *   **Region 1 (Between $S_1, S_2$)**:\n        *   $C \\in (8, 13) \\rightarrow \\{9, 10, 11, 12\\}$.\n        *   $K \\in [0, 2] \\cap [-5, 5] = [0, 2]$.\n        *   Pixels with $y+x \\in \\{9..12\\}$ and $y-x \\in \\{0..2\\}$.

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Analysis and Approach**\n\nOkay, the task is to solve an ARC puzzle using two provided examples. My immediate thought is to start by carefully analyzing the given inputs and outputs, looking for repeating patterns, symmetries, and any correlations between the two. The objective is to identify a general rule that applies to both examples and can solve other instances of this puzzle. I will be looking for how the inputs transform to the outputs to derive a more complete set of features of the problem and the rules to be used.\n\n**Example 1: Feature Extraction**\n\nWith Example 1, I noticed it involves a 16x16 grid and two colors: background (8) and a specific pattern color (4). My first instinct is to trace the pattern formed by the 4s. I tried identifying patterns in the row and column coordinates. I started listing coordinates of pattern color (row, column). It appears that the 4s form diagonal lines. I saw that specific locations within the 4s were filled with color 2. I initially suspected a flood-fill or \"coloring inside the lines\" type problem, so I started looking at the 2s, where they appear, and the shapes they form.\n\nI then started thinking of these shapes as a \"bounding box.\" I looked for the distance of all points to a central point. I then tried to find a relationship between the sum or the differences. Initially, it seemed like the number of pixels filled with 2 was based on the horizontal distance between the 4s, but this was contradicted by inconsistencies in the example. I tried to establish any patterns in the values, based on modulo math. It looked like the 2s would fill horizontally between the 4s, and then not. I couldn't find a direct correlation. I thought that maybe it was based on an overlay, maybe a kind of projection that could create a pattern that would explain the seemingly haphazard filling. The numbers being filled seem to shift over the rows.\n\nMy attention then turned to understanding the shapes formed by the 4s. Specifically, how many 2s appear inside. This led me to view it as \"lines,\" with those cells between lines being filled with 2s. This is when I started noting the connection. I saw the repeating 2,2,8 pattern and made connections. I then focused on the repeating pattern in the data and how it shifted with each row. I tried various computations, such as looking for symmetries and the coordinates of all elements.\n\n**Geometric Interpretation and Diagonal Lines**\n\nI then looked at the arrangement of the 4s again. They formed diagonals, so I shifted my thinking to diagonal sums. This led me to define diagonal lines using the x+y values. By considering these diagonal lines, I began to see regions or \"bands\" created by these diagonal lines of 4s. Within each band, I observed the behavior of the 2s - like a textured pattern: \"2, 2, 8\" repeating. So, I figured the bands are a key. The background is a \"weave\" pattern. I came up with an idea where I used 2 diagonals of different slopes, that is, another diagonal to define the pattern.\n\n**Holes, Stripes, and Filling Logic**\n\nI started trying to define the pattern of the holes. These are the locations that were not filled with 2. I found that I could characterize these as lines that were perpendicular to the initial pattern. So, if there was a \"band\" formed, I found that I should try to fill any blank space within a band. It then came to me that it was an x+y=k pattern with gaps. The \"holes\" within these gaps were also periodic. If I wanted to find any patterns, I then had to see what was behind the \"holes\".\n\nI then realized that this could be a \"projected\" grid or Moir\u00e9 pattern. The periodic \"Holes\" were the \"gaps\" in the weave. This led me to come up with another rule for determining where the \"Holes\" would be. This was the \"weave\" I was looking for. To define this, I tried a simple coordinate shift to generate the \"weave\" pattern. By looking at all of the numbers, it led to a set of rules: if the distance was even, fill all. Odd: just fill a few. If the distance was less than 3, just fill. This helped me get a specific algorithm.\n\nThen, there was the additional issue that sometimes the regions were not a simple strip and were \"jagged\". I looked at each location and defined the regions. I tried to do it without an algorithm, and the pattern was visible but difficult to explain. I then had the idea of a 3x3 pattern in all the spaces. I used a smaller rectangle. The main principle was to project onto a weave and fill those lines that would be formed. This involved\n\nTo solve this task, we identify the structure as a filling problem where regions defined by diagonal boundary lines of the pattern color are filled with the new color (2).\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Geometric Structure**\nThe input grid contains a background color (8) and a pattern color (9). The pattern pixels form diagonal lines with a slope of -1 (i.e., cells $(r, c)$ where $r+c = k$).\nBy analyzing the coordinates of the 9s in the Test Input:\n- Line 1: Sum $r+c = 8$. Segment from (4,4) to (5,3).\n- Line 2: Sum $r+c = 13$. Segment from (4,9) to (9,4).\n- Line 3: Sum $r+c = 18$. Segment from (5,13) to (13,5).\n- Line 4: Sum $r+c = 22$. Segment from (7,15) to (15,7).\n\nThese lines define three \"bands\" or strips between them:\n1.  **Band 1:** Between Line 8 and Line 13.\n2.  **Band 2:** Between Line 13 and Line 18.\n3.  **Band 3:** Between Line 18 and Line 22.\n\n**Step 2: Define Filling Logic**\nBased on the solved examples, the filling behavior depends on the position within the band (Top, Middle, or Bottom row of the specific strip overlap).\n-   **Middle Rows:** If a row is strictly inside the start and end of the strip segment, the entire gap between the two pattern pixels is filled with 2.\n-   **Top Row:** The first row where the band exists. The fill is \"Partial Left\". We fill the first 2 pixels to the right of the left boundary, leaving the rest as 8.\n-   **Bottom Row:** The last row where the band exists. The fill is \"Partial Right\". We fill the last 2 pixels to the left of the right boundary, leaving the rest as 8.\n\n**Step 3: Apply Logic to Test Input**\n\n**Band 1 (Sum 8 to 13):**\n*Exists in rows 4 and 5.*\n-   **Row 4 (Top):** 9s at (4,4) and (4,9). Gap indices 5,6,7,8. Partial Left $\\rightarrow$ Fill 5,6.\n-   **Row 5 (Bottom):** 9s at (5,3) and (5,8). Gap indices 4,5,6,7. Partial Right $\\rightarrow$ Fill 6,7.\n\n**Band 2 (Sum 13 to 18):**\n*Exists in rows 5 to 9.*\n-   **Row 5 (Top):** 9s at (5,8) and (5,13). Gap indices 9,10,11,12. Partial Left $\\rightarrow$ Fill 9,10.\n-   **Row 6 (Middle):** 9s at (6,7) and (6,12). Gap indices 8,9,10,11. Full Fill $\\rightarrow$ 2,2,2,2.\n-   **Row 7 (Middle):** 9s at (6,...) wait, Line 13 at R7 is (7,6). Line 18 at R7 is (7,11). Gap 7,8,9,10. Full Fill $\\rightarrow$ 2,2,2,2.\n-   **Row 8 (Middle):** 9s at (8,5) and (8,10). Gap 6,7,8,9. Full Fill $\\rightarrow$ 2,2,2,2.\n-   **Row 9 (Bottom):** 9s at (9,4) and (9,9). Gap indices 5,6,7,8. Partial Right $\\rightarrow$ Fill 7,8.\n\n**Band 3 (Sum 18 to 22):**\n*Exists in rows 7 to 13.*\n-   **Row 7 (Top):** 9s at (7,11) and (7,15). Gap indices 12,13,14. Partial Left $\\rightarrow$ Fill 12,13.\n-   **Row 8 (Middle):** 9s at (8,10) and (8,14). Gap indices 11,12,13. Full Fill $\\rightarrow$ 2,2,2.\n-   **Row 9 (Middle):** 9s at (9,9) and (9,13). Full Fill $\\rightarrow$ 10,11,12 are 2.\n-   **Row 10 (Middle):** 9s at (10,8) and (10,12). Full Fill $\\rightarrow$ 9,10,11 are 2.\n-   **Row 11 (Middle):** 9s at (11,7) and (11,11). Full Fill $\\rightarrow$ 8,9,10 are 2.\n-   **Row 12 (Middle):** 9s at (12,6) and (12,10). Full Fill $\\rightarrow$ 7,8,9 are 2.\n-   **Row 13 (Bottom):** 9s at (13,5) and (13,9). Gap indices 6,7,8. Partial Right $\\rightarrow$ Fill 7,8.\n\n**Rows 14-15:** No bands exist (only single lines or no lines), so no filling.\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,2,2,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,2,2,9,2,2,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,2,9,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,2,9,2,2,8,9\n8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,9,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,2,2,9,2,2,2,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,2,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation pattern:\n\n1. In both examples, colored cells (4s in Example 1, 3s in Example 2) form diagonal line segments going down-left (row increases, column decreases).\n\n2. The transformation fills the interior regions between pairs of diagonal lines with 2s.\n\n3. The fill appears to be bounded by the diagonal lines, forming triangular or trapezoidal regions. The fill expands from where the diagonals start (apex), growing wider as you move down.\n\nFor the test input, I identify the diagonal lines of 9s:\n- D1: (4,4)\u2192(5,3) - 2 points\n- D2: (4,9)\u2192(9,4) - 6 points  \n- D3: (5,13)\u2192(13,5) - 9 points\n- D4: (7,15)\u2192(15,7) - 9 points\n\nThe fill regions:\n- **D1-D2 region**: At row 5 (one row below apex at row 4), fill cols 4-5\n- **D2-D3 region**: Starts at row 5, expands downward. At row 5: cols 9-10, row 6: cols 8-11, row 7: cols 7-10, etc.\n- **D3-D4 region**: Starts at row 7 (where D4 begins), fills between the two parallel diagonals\n\nAt the apex row (row 4 where both D1 and D2 start), no fill occurs - matching Example 1's row 0 behavior.\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,2,2,8,8,9,2,2,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,2,9,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,9\n8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,9,8\n8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Below is my reasoning and the resulting guess. I want to be transparent that, after a lot of analysis, the exact underlying rule is still ambiguous from only the two examples, so the inferred rule (and therefore the test output) may be incorrect.\n\n---\n\n## Reasoning summary\n\nWe are given two 16\u00d716 examples:\n\n- Background color is 8.\n- There is a \u201clinework\u201d color (4 in Example 1, 3 in Example 2).\n- The output preserves that linework color and introduces new cells of color 2 in certain regions around it.\n\nCommonalities:\n\n- The new color is always 2, independent of whether the linework is 3 or 4.\n- 2s appear only in areas \u201cbetween\u201d or \u201cinside\u201d the structures formed by the linework color, never far away.\n- The linework generally lies on diagonals or near-diagonals, often forming V-shapes or wedges, and the 2s form contiguous wedge- or diamond-like regions between \u201carms\u201d of those structures.\n\nHowever, when I tried to distill a precise, globally consistent rule \u2013 e.g., \u201cfill the polygon interior formed by the special color\u201d, or \u201cfill all cells between pairs of lines on diagonal X and diagonal Y\u201d, or \u201cmorphologically thicken the special-color graph under some condition\u201d \u2013 none of those hypotheses matched *both* training examples in detail without contradictions. In particular:\n\n- Simple local rules (like \u201ccolor 2 any 8-cell with \u22652 neighbors of color 3/4 within a 3\u00d73\u201d) would create 2s in places where the examples do *not* show them (especially near the top of Example 2).\n- Straight \u201cconvex hull\u201d or \u201cclosed-boundary interior fill\u201d interpretations also fail: the patterns of 3s in Example 2 are not a single simple closed ring around the 2s; there are disjoint chains of 3s, and the filled area is only part of the geometric hull.\n- Rules based purely on \u201cfill between same-row special cells\u201d or \u201cfill along diagonals between special cells\u201d likewise do not reproduce the detailed placements of 2s in both examples.\n\nAfter extensive attempts (analyzing diagonals with constant `r+c` and with `c\u2212r`, row-wise min/max special-color positions, apparent wedge shapes, and so on), I could not derive a clean, single algorithm that:\n\n1. Reconstructs both Example 1 and Example 2 exactly, and  \n2. Clearly determines what should happen in the test case.\n\nIn the **test input with color 9**, the 9s form three main `/` diagonals (constant `r+c` = 13, 18, 22) plus a shorter one at `r+c = 8`. Visually, they look like a set of parallel slanted lines, rather than a clearly closed wedge or a clearly bounded interior region similar to either training example. From all the candidate rules I tried to reconcile with the training data, the only one that fits the test *consistently* and unambiguously is:\n\n> New color-2 cells appear only when the special color forms certain \u201cenclosing\u201d wedge-like or interior-defining configurations. In the test, the 9s do not form such a configuration; hence no 2s are added.\n\nUnder that interpretation, the test output would simply be identical to the input: all 9s stay, and no 2s appear, because the 9s do not sufficiently approximate the enclosing wedge shapes seen in the 4- and 3-examples.\n\nGiven the ambiguity and my inability to derive a more precise rule that both:\n- matches Examples 1 and 2 exactly, and\n- yields a definite nontrivial fill for the test case,\n\nthe most defensible guess I can give is that **no additional 2s are added in the test grid**.\n\n---\n\n## Guessed output grid\n\nSo my final proposed output for the test input is the unchanged grid:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,9  \n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,9,8  \n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,9,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,9,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "To work out what is happening, note first that the only non\u2011background pixels in the inputs are a few diagonals of a single colour \u2013 in the first example they are colour\u202f4, in the second example colour\u202f3. In all cases those markers are left unchanged in the output. The only change made is the insertion of colour\u202f2 in regions between those marked diagonals. The filled\u2011in regions grow out from the start of a diagonal, fill the open gap between a pair of adjacent diagonals, and then taper down again towards the end of a diagonal.\n\nFor the test grid there are four diagonals of 9s at r+c\u202f=\u202f8,\u202f13,\u202f18 and\u202f22. Applying the same fill logic gives narrow strips of 2s between the 8/13 pair, the 13/18 pair, and the 18/22 pair, with a short ramp\u2011up at the very start and a taper near the end of each strip. The 9s themselves remain unchanged.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,2,2,8,8,9,2,2,2,2,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,2,9,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,9\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,2,2,9,2,2,2,9,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,2,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Below is how I arrived at a (necessarily approximate) transformation and then applied it to the test.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Interpreting the solved examples\n\nIn both examples:\n\n- Background is color `8`.\n- There is a second color (`4` in example 1, `3` in example 2) forming several **oblique (diagonal) chains**.\n- The output introduces a new color `2` that:\n  - Never overwrites the original non\u2011background color.\n  - Fills a **continuous \u201cwedge\u201d/band between two roughly parallel diagonal chains** of the non\u2011background color.\n  - The band appears where **two main diagonals of the special color run near each other**, and then gradually tapers off as those diagonals separate.\n\nIn example 2, the `3`s lie on four NE\u2013SW diagonals (lines of constant `r+c` = 6, 11, 15, 23). The `2`\u2019s occupy a fat band between an inner pair of those diagonals, giving a diamond/hexagon\u2011like filled area. Example 1 does something very similar but in two separate regions for the `4`s.\n\nSo an abstracted rule is:\n\n> Identify two main diagonal chains of the special color (same `r+c` constant).  \n> Between these chains, fill interior background cells with color `2`, row by row, forming a wedge/band.  \n> Never overwrite the original special color.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying the idea to the test input\n\nIn the test:\n\n- Background is `8`.\n- Special color is `9`.\n- The `9`s form several NE\u2013SW diagonals (constant `r+c`):\n  - `r+c = 13`: `(4,9), (5,8), (6,7), (7,6), (8,5), (9,4)` \u2013 call this diagonal **L**.\n  - `r+c = 18`: `(5,13), (6,12), (7,11), (8,10), (9,9), (10,8), (11,7), (12,6), (13,5)` \u2013 call this diagonal **R**.\n  - There are outer diagonals at `r+c = 8` and `r+c = 22` as well, but L and R are the inner pair that define the central wedge.\n\nFollowing the behavior from the examples:\n\n- For rows where both diagonals L and R have `9`s (rows 5\u20139), we fill all background cells **strictly between** them (exclusive), i.e. columns from `L+1` up to `R\u22121`.\n  - Row 5: L=8, R=13 \u2192 fill columns 9\u201312.\n  - Row 6: L=7, R=12 \u2192 fill 8\u201311.\n  - Row 7: L=6, R=11 \u2192 fill 7\u201310.\n  - Row 8: L=5, R=10 \u2192 fill 6\u20139.\n  - Row 9: L=4, R=9  \u2192 fill 5\u20138.\n- Below row 9 the left diagonal L leaves the grid (no more `9`s on that `r+c=13` line). In the solved examples, the band then **tapers**. To mimic that:\n  - Row 10: place a shorter interior strip just left of the `9` on R \u2192 columns 6\u20137.\n  - Row 11: a single interior cell left of the `9` on R \u2192 column 8.\n  - Row 12: a further single interior cell between the two `9`s at 6 and 10 \u2192 column 7.\n- No `2`s are placed above row 5 or below row 12.\n- In all cases, if a planned `2` position already contains `9`, we leave it as `9` (we never overwrite the special color).\n\nApplying that to the test grid gives the following output.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

In the outputs, the anchors are preserved and colour\u202f2 is used to fill along NW\u2013SE diagonals between anchors; when a diagonal has only a single anchor on the \u201cleft\u201d side of the figure, a run of 2s is extended along that diagonal toward the right\u2010hand boundary one step inside the outermost anchors.\n\nTo apply this to the test grid, I kept all the 9s, then for each diagonal with multiple 9s I filled the intermediate cells with 2. For diagonals that had a single 9 at the minimal offset, I extended 2s along the diagonal up to just before the rightmost line of 9s.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,2,8,8,9,8,2,8,8,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,2,9,8,2,8,2,9,8,2,8\n8,8,8,8,8,2,9,2,2,8,2,9,2,2,8,9\n8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,9,8\n8,8,8,8,9,8,2,2,2,9,2,2,2,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,2,8,2,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,2,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,9,2,2,2,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,2,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",
