My job is to figure out *what* the \"something\" is. There are a few examples to look at, and a test input to apply the rule to.\n\n**Initial Assessment:** The key is to find the pattern and apply it.\n\n**Diving into the Examples:**\n\n**Example 1:**\nI immediately see a central structure with a 3x3 box in the middle. The color inside the box transforms.  It also seems like the other things in the grid \u2013 the scattered '9's - might be important.  There's a bunch of '9's scattered around the background color (Orange, 7), some inside the structure some outside. The output has changed the 3x3 box, and some of the 9's near the box (or inside the boundaries).\n\nI'm starting to think about the '9's.  Are they moving? Are they being attracted to the box?  I trace the scattered '9's to see if I can find a pattern: are they 'inside' the bigger shape?  Aha! The '6's (Magenta) seem to define a boundary.  It's looking like *only* the '9's *inside* this boundary are changing. Let's trace it and see if the '9's near the box are the ones that actually move and change something in the 3x3 box.\n\nI start counting the number of '9's in the input and output. I'm focusing on the center box; that's where the most obvious change happens.  I examine specific rows to confirm the change. The scattered '9's disappear from the original grid (the source) but I am not clear if they stay in the final form. Where the \u20189\u2019s in the structure disappear, and the '3's in the center box become \u20189\u2019. The original number of '9's seem to be re-positioned. Now, it looks like a 'gravity' of sorts.\n\nIt seems the box is the \"sink\", and the number of moving '9's affect it. It appears some '9's 'move' into the center box, replacing the '3's. So let me look deeper at the '6's: there are two kinds of areas, and the key change is between them.\n\n**Example 2:**\nHere, there are similar structures, but now the number of '9's seem important! There are a lot of the '9's here. I start looking for '9's. Ok, again there's a 3x3 center box. The 6 boundaries are at different positions. And the 9 are scattered differently. And the central 3x3 box color (3 and 2) changes to 9. And the \u20186\u2019s make some kind of \u201cwalls\u201d in the grid. If a 9 is \u201cconnected\u201d it will move, and others won\u2019t. Let me find all of the connected 9's to confirm this theory!\n\n**Connectivity Theory Emerges:**\n\nI start to formulate a connectivity hypothesis: The grid is divided into \u201ccompartments\u201d by walls of \u20186\u2019. There\u2019s a \u201ctarget\u201d compartment, where the 3x3 box lives. Any '9's in compartments *connected* to the target compartment (via gaps in the \u20186\u2019 walls) will \"move\". I double-check this: the number of 9s affect if the color is replaced or not. I'm checking, like, is the number of '9's enough to fill the 3x3? Maybe I'm starting to see a pattern!\n\n**Testing the Hypothesis:**\n\nI go back to Example 2 and start tracing those 6s. The number of 9s has to be at least the same as the available space in the middle. I look at Example 2. There seem to be more 9\u2019s that should have moved, but I can't confirm a pattern. Now, I'm thinking, is that \"number\" important? Or is it something more spatial?\n\nAha! There's something important about connectivity. I check the '6' boundary to see where there are gaps. Are all 9\u2019s connected? I look for 6 boundaries that are either vertical or horizontal. I confirm that only 9's within certain \"compartments\" are the ones moving. The '9's must be accessible. The accessibility is defined by the spaces between the 6s! I'm making progress here!\n\nI'm thinking, is there a simple rule that defines which 9\n\nTo solve this ARC task, we need to infer the transformation rule by analyzing the provided examples and then applying that rule to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:**\n    *   The grid contains a background of Orange (7).\n    *   There are structures formed by Magenta (6) \"walls\".\n    *   There is a specific \"target chamber\" or \"box\" defined by a 3x3 region containing Green (3) pixels and a central Red (2) pixel.\n    *   There are Maroon (9) pixels scattered throughout the grid.\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule (Inferred):**\n    *   The core mechanic is a \"flow\" or \"attraction\" of the Maroon (9) pixels into the target 3x3 box.\n    *   **Connectivity:** Only Maroon (9) pixels that are *topologically connected* to the 3x3 box via \"open\" space (pixels of color 7 or other 9s, passing through gaps in the Magenta 6 walls) are moved. Pixels enclosed in isolated chambers formed by Magenta (6) walls do not move.\n    *   **Movement:** The connected Maroon (9) pixels are removed from their original positions (turning into the background color 7) and \"moved\" into the 3x3 box.\n    *   **Filling Order:** The arriving Maroon (9) pixels replace the existing Green (3) and Red (2) pixels in the box. The filling order appears to be row-major (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).\n    *   **Capacity:** The 3x3 box has 9 slots. If the number of connected 9s is less than 9, they fill the slots partially (preserving the remaining 3s or 2s). If the number of connected 9s is greater than or equal to 9, the entire box becomes 9s.\n\n3.  **Application to Test Input:**\n\n    *   **Identify the Target Box:** The 3x3 box containing 3s and a 2 is located at **Rows 4-6, Columns 4-6**.\n    *   **Analyze Connectivity:** We perform a flood-fill or pathfinding analysis starting from the box to see which 9s are reachable.\n        *   **Box Connections:** The box connects to the top section via a gap in the wall at (3,5) and to the bottom section via a gap at (7,6).\n        *   **Top Region (Rows 0-3):**\n            *   The gap at (3,5) connects to Row 2, which is entirely open (7s).\n            *   From Row 2, we can reach the 9s at **(1,2)**, **(1,10)**, **(3,2)**, and **(3,10)**.\n            *   The 9s at **(0,4)** and **(0,6)** are enclosed by walls at (0,3), (0,7) and a solid floor of walls at Row 1 (cols 3-7). They are isolated from the box and will **not** move.\n        *   **Bottom Region (Rows 7-10):**\n            *   The gap at (7,6) connects to the open area in Row 8.\n            *   Row 8 connects to Row 9 via a gap at (9,4).\n            *   Row 9 connects to Row 10 (which is mostly 9s).\n            *   From this central bottom area, paths extend to the 9s at the sides and bottom corners. Specifically, the 9s at **(7,2)**, **(7,10)**, and the clusters at **Row 10 (cols 0-2, 4-6, 8-10)** are all reachable.\n    *   **Count Moving 9s:**\n        *   Top/Middle: (1,2), (1,10), (3,2), (3,10) -> **4 pixels**.\n        *   Bottom Sides: (7,2), (7,10) -> **2 pixels**.\n        *   Bottom Row: (10,0), (10,1), (10,2), (10,4), (10,6), (10,8), (10,9), (10,10) -> **8 pixels**.\n        *   **Total Moving:** 14 pixels.\n    *   **Execute Transformation:**\n        1.  **Remove Source 9s:** All the reachable 9s listed above are changed to background (7). The isolated 9s at (0,4) and (0,6) remain 9.\n        2.  **Fill Target Box:** Since 14 > 9, the entire 3x3 box (Rows 4-6, Cols 4-6) is filled with 9s.\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\n- **Row 0:** Unchanged (Isolated 9s remain).\n- **Row 1:** 9s become 7s.\n- **Row 2:** Unchanged (All 7s).\n- **Row 3:** 9s become 7s.\n- **Rows 4-6:** The central 3x3 area (Cols 4-6) becomes all 9s.\n- **Row 7:** 9s become 7s.\n- **Rows 8-9:** Unchanged (7s and walls).\n- **Row 10:** All 9s become 7s.\n\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n<REASONING_MODEL_B model_id=\"gemini-3-high_12_step_5_opus_gen_sol\">\n**Algorithm Synthesis and Validation**\n\nOkay, here's the game plan, based on those examples and that user-provided text.  The task is to transform a grid with scattered \"9\"s, potentially bounded by \"6\"s, and containing a central \"3x3\" structure with either a \"2\" or \"3\" at its center.  We're going to use this connected component and close-by distances, applying the rules of the connected 9s.\n\n1.  **Frame and Interior Identification:** Figure out what 6s enclose the 3x3 pattern.  I'm going to determine a main frame structure based on 6s around the central pattern.  This *frame* might not be a closed box.\n\n2.  **Compartment Definition:**  Define a compartment.  The critical compartment includes the cells of the *frame*, AND any \"nearby\" cells, even if not physically adjacent.  This is a critical part, as it dictates what 9s are *active*.\n\n3.  **Active 9s Classification:** A 9 is Active if it is:\n    *   Inside the compartment.\n    *   \"Close\" to the frame (within a distance of 2 based on grid steps). The \"within 2 cells\" rule makes more sense when working the examples.\n\n4.  **Transformation:**\n    *   Count the active 9s.\n    *   Remove (change to 7) those Active 9s.\n    *   Fill the 3x3 pattern with this *count* of 9s.\n\nIn summary, this approach correctly identified that the position of the 9s relative to the structure determines whether to remove them. This is the crucial aspect of this ARC.\n\nTo solve this problem, I will apply the transformation rules inferred from the examples and the provided description.\n\n**1. Identify the Central Pattern and Frame Structure**\nThe central 3x3 pattern (containing 3s and a 2) is located in rows 4-6, columns 4-6.\n- Row 4: `...6,3,3,3,6...`\n- Row 5: `...6,3,2,3,6...`\n- Row 6: `...6,3,3,3,6...`\n\nThe \"Frame\" consists of the color 6 cells surrounding this pattern and extending through the grid.\n- In the test input, the frame structure is complex, appearing in rows 0, 1, 3, 4-6, 7, 8, 9, 10.\n- Key observation: The frame forms barriers. Specifically, Row 1 has a solid segment of 6s from column 3 to 7 (`6,6,6,6,6`), and Row 3, 7, 8, 9 have 6s at columns 3 and 7 (forming vertical walls).\n\n**2. Classify 9s (Active vs. Protected)**\nI need to determine connectivity of each 9 to the central pattern region (R4-6, C4-6).\n- **Connectivity check:** The central pattern connects to Row 2 via a gap in Row 3 at (3,5). Row 2 is all 7s, so it connects to the left (cols 0-2) and right (cols 8-10) sides of the grid. The pattern also connects downwards via a gap in Row 7 at (7,6) to the bottom regions.\n- **Protected 9s:** The 9s at **(0,4)** and **(0,6)** are in Row 0 inside the vertical frame lines (cols 3 and 7). However, Row 1 has a solid wall of 6s at cols 3-7. This wall completely isolates the region (R0, C4-6) from the rest of the grid (specifically from Row 2 and the pattern below). Since these 9s are in a **separate enclosed compartment**, they are **protected**.\n- **Active 9s:** All other 9s are connected to the central pattern (either through the open Row 2 or the bottom gaps) and are adjacent to the frame structure (not \"distant\").\n  - Row 1: (1,2), (1,10)\n  - Row 3: (3,2), (3,10)\n  - Row 7: (7,2), (7,10)\n  - Row 10: (10,0), (10,1), (10,2), (10,4), (10,6), (10,8), (10,9), (10,10)\n  Total Active 9s = 14.\n\n**3. Transformation**\n- **Remove Active 9s:** Replace the 14 active 9s with background color 7.\n- **Fill Pattern:** Replace the cells in the 3x3 pattern (R4-6, C4-6) with color 9. Since we removed 14 nines and the pattern has only 9 cells, we fill all 9 cells with 9s.\n- **Preserve Protected 9s:** The 9s at (0,4) and (0,6) remain unchanged.\n\n**Output Construction:**\n- **Row 0:** `7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7` (Protected 9s remain)\n- **Row 1:** `7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7` (9s at cols 2,10 removed)\n- **Row 2:** `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7` (Unchanged)\n- **Row 3:** `6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7` (9s at cols 2,10 removed)\n- **Row 4:** `7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7` (Pattern filled with 9s)\n- **Row 5:** `7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6` (Pattern filled with 9s)\n- **Row 6:** `7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7` (Pattern filled with 9s)\n- **Row 7:** `6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7` (9s at cols 2,10 removed)\n- **Row 8:** `7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7` (Unchanged)\n- **Row 9:** `7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6` (Unchanged)\n- **Row 10:** `7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7` (All 9s removed)\n\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n</REASONING_MODEL_B>\n<REASONING_MODEL_C model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_12_step_5_opus_gen_sol\">\nLooking at this problem, I need to:\n1.

regions (compartments) of non\u20116 cells separated by 6s behave independently.  \n     - Example 1: pattern sits inside a closed compartment; only the 9s in that same enclosed region are removed (2 of them).\n     - Example 3: there are no 6s, so there is effectively a single global region; all 9s are removed (4 of them).\n     - Example 2: the 6s form an open frame; there is one big region, but a top\u2011right 9 cluster is far from the frame and is treated as protected, while a bunch of other 9s are removed (9 total).\n\n   So in words:\n\n   - Use 6s to define **compartments**.\n   - In the compartment containing the 3\u00d73 pattern, most of the 9s are **active** and get moved into the pattern, except any that lie in clearly separate \u201csmall rooms\u201d fully enclosed by 6s.\n   - 9s in other compartments are protected.\n\n2. **Compartments in the test grid**\n\n   For the test input (11\u00d711), we again take 6 as walls and consider 4\u2011connected regions of all non\u20116 cells (colors 0\u20139 except 6).\n\n   - The central 3\u00d73 pattern is at rows 5\u20137, columns 5\u20137, exactly as in the examples.\n   - If you conceptually flood\u2011fill from any pattern cell across non\u20116 cells, you find:\n     - One large region containing:\n       - All 9s at\n         (2,3), (2,11),\n         (4,3), (4,11),\n         (8,3), (8,11),\n         (11,1), (11,2), (11,3), (11,5), (11,7), (11,9), (11,10), (11,11),\n       - plus all the 3s/2/7s around them and around the pattern.\n     - A **separate small enclosed pocket** at the top, defined by 6s at:\n       - Row 1: column 4 and 8\n       - Row 2: columns 4\u20138\n       This pocket contains exactly three non\u20116 cells: (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), among which (1,5) and (1,7) are 9s.\n       There is no 4\u2011connected path from any pattern cell to these two 9s without crossing a 6.\n\n   Therefore:\n   - The compartment containing the pattern has **14** 9s.\n   - The separate top pocket has **2** 9s at (1,5) and (1,7).\n\n   By the rule inferred from the examples:\n\n   - 9s in the **same compartment as the pattern** are **active** (eligible to be removed and fed into the center).\n   - 9s in a **different enclosed compartment** are **protected**.\n\n   So in the test:\n   - **Active 9s** (in the pattern\u2019s compartment):  \n     (2,3), (2,11), (4,3), (4,11), (8,3), (8,11),  \n     (11,1), (11,2), (11,3), (11,5), (11,7), (11,9), (11,10), (11,11)  \u2192 14 cells.\n   - **Protected 9s** (separate pocket):  \n     (1,5), (1,7)  \u2192 2 cells.\n\n3. **Moving 9s into the central pattern**\n\n   - We remove all **active** 9s by turning them to 7.\n   - We have 14 removed 9s, but the central 3\u00d73 can hold at most 9 cells.\n   - So we place **9** 9s into the central pattern, in reading order, turning 3s first and then the 2 if needed:\n     - The pattern has 8 cells with color 3 and 1 cell with color 2.\n     - Since 9 \u2265 9, we turn **all nine** central cells to 9.\n   - Any remaining surplus removed 9s (14 \u2013 9 = 5) simply disappear (they were turned into 7 and not re\u2011used), which is allowed by the \u201cup to 9 maximum\u201d behavior.\n\n4. **Applying the changes**\n\n   Start from the test input and:\n\n   - Set the central 3\u00d73 (rows 5\u20137, cols 5\u20137) entirely to 9.\n   - Everywhere else, turn the **active** 9s to 7 and leave the **protected** 9s at (1,5) and (1,7) as 9.\n\n   Concretely:\n\n   - Row 1: two protected 9s at columns 5 and 7;

I need to take three example ARC grids, analyze the changes, and figure out the general rule to apply to a new one.  I'm seeing a pattern where certain \"maroon\" pixels, represented by the value 9, move to a specific \"target\" area in the grid, replacing existing colors.\n\n**Initial Observations**\n\nIn the examples, there's always a background color (7), a \"frame\" color (6), and this 3x3 square in the middle, initially green (3) with a red (2) dot.  I noticed that maroon (9) pixels are scattered around the grid, and the output shows the central 3x3 block changing, sometimes completely, sometimes only partially, and the 9s from outside filling it up.\n\n**Key Rule: Connecting and Counting**\n\nThe critical breakthrough is that *only* those maroon (9) pixels that are \"connected\" to the central 3x3 target area (the box of 3s with a 2 in the middle) are the ones that move.  Here's how this \"connected\" idea works:  A pixel is considered reachable if it's connected to the target without going through any magenta-colored (6) pixels. We must \"walk\" only on pixels with values: 9, 3, 2, or 7. I found that I needed to use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to identify all walkable 9s. Then, those reachable pixels are pulled, or \"sucked\", into the central area. The rule is that the *closest* 9s get to come.\n\n**Details: Filling and the Filling Order**\n\nAfter doing some careful counting, I realized the fill count matters.  We count how many reachable 9s we have. Then, the number of 9s we use is limited by a capacity which equals the number of pixels in the 3x3 target region. The 9s \"fill\" the target, and we can only use pixels if a path can be constructed to them. Then, we fill up our grid. If there are extra, unused 9s, then the grid is filled to full. The filling is from left-to-right, then top-to-bottom (row-major order).\n\n**Implementation**\n\nTo solve this, I'll:\n\n1.  **Identify the Target:** Find the 3x3 block and list it's pixels.\n2.  **Define Walkable Paths:** Identify all pixels that can be walked on (7, 3, 2, 9).\n3.  **Perform BFS:** Use BFS to determine which maroon pixels are \"connected\" to the target.\n4.  **Calculate Distance:** Find the distances (in terms of path-length from target to source) from the reachable 9s to the Target.\n5.  **Prioritize:** Prioritize those pixels closest to the target.\n6.  **Fill and Replace:** Convert the closest 9s to 7, and replace pixels in the Target with 9s following row-major scanline order.\n\nThis should allow me to accurately determine the correct output grid for the test case.\n\n\nThe goal of this task is to fill the central 3x3 structure (originally green/3 and red/2) with maroon (9) pixels collected from the surrounding grid. The central structure acts as a \"target\" that pulls in the nearest accessible maroon pixels.\n\n**Rules inferred from examples:**\n1.  **Identify the Target:** The target is the 3x3 square structure in the center of the grid, consisting of green (3) pixels with a red (2) pixel in the center.\n2.  **Determine Accessibility:** Maroon (9) pixels can only be moved to the target if they are connected to it by a path of non-wall pixels. The walls are magenta (6). If a maroon pixel is inside a sealed area formed by magenta walls and the grid edges, it cannot be moved.\n3.  **Find Nearest Sources:** Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the target pixels to find all reachable maroon (9) pixels. Calculate the path distance from the target to each reachable maroon pixel.\n4.  **Select Sources:** The target has a capacity of 9 pixels. Select the up to 9 closest reachable maroon pixels. If there is a tie in distance, select based on reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).\n5.  **Apply Transformation:**\n    *   Change the selected reachable maroon (9) pixels in the grid to background (7).\n    *   Change all 9 pixels in the target 3x3 area to maroon (9).\n    *   Any maroon pixels that were not selected (either because they are unreachable/sealed or because they were too far and the target was full) remain as 9.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Target:** The 3x3 area is at rows 4-6, columns 4-6.\n2.  **Connectivity Analysis:**\n    *   The target is enclosed by magenta (6) walls but has two openings: one at the top via `(3,5)` leading to Row 2, and one at the bottom via `(7,6)` leading to the bottom area.\n    *   **Sealed:** The 9s at `(0,4)` and `(0,6)` are enclosed by walls and grid edges with no opening. They cannot be moved.\n    *   **Reachable:**\n        *   **Top Area (via `(3,5)`):** `(1,2)`, `(3,2)`, `(1,10)`, `(3,10)`.

The task seems to involve transforming a grid where maroon (9) pixels are scattered around, but the core mechanic revolves around a central \"Green Box,\" a 3x3 square composed primarily of green (3) pixels, with a red (2) pixel in the center. Let's break this down.\n\n**Initial Analysis and the \"Magenta Frame\"**\n\nWe've got an orange background (7), and the green box. My first instinct is that there's some kind of rule about collecting the maroon pixels and putting them in the box. Now, the key seems to be the magenta (6) pixels. These form \"rooms\" or enclosures and it looks like a sort of capture mechanism.\n\n**Discovering the Algorithm**\n\nI realized the basic idea is a flood-fill from the green box, moving through any pixels that aren't magenta. Once all reachable maroons are found (within the 3x3 box limit), we count them. That count tells us how many pixels in the Green Box we'll overwrite. If we have 5 maroon pixels, we take the 5.  This explains why the center (the red 2) doesn't always become a maroon.\n\n**Applying the Rules to the Test Input**\n\n1. Locate the Green Box in the test input. It's Rows 4-6, Columns 4-6.\n\n2.  Next, look for any magenta pixels creating walls.\n\n3.  The algorithm then collects any maroon pixels that can be reached from the Green Box without going through a wall.\n\n4.  Calculate the distances to all the valid maroons (BFS).\n\n5.  Here's where it gets interesting: you're capped by the number of box pixels. If there are 12 maroon pixels, but you only have a 3x3 box, you only take the first 9 pixels!\n\n6. Remove from the Grid these pixels, set to the background (7).\n\n7. Then, fill the green box with these maroons in order.\n\n**Applying this to the Input**\n\nWe've located the Box and we have the reachability. Now, let's look at the example input.\n\nWe need to calculate the distance of each 9 and start collecting based on path length and box constraints. We calculate each distance from the Green Box. And at last, we start moving. We will collect only a certain number of pixels, per the above.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the grid by moving \"noise\" pixels (maroon, 9) into a specific \"container\" object (a green box with a red center). Based on the examples, the transformation follows these rules:\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Container:** Locate the 3x3 box composed of green (3) pixels with a central red (2) pixel.\n2.  **Determine Reachability:** Identify all maroon (9) pixels in the grid that are \"reachable\" from this green box. Movement is allowed horizontally and vertically (4-way connectivity) through \"permeable\" pixels.\n    *   **Permeable pixels:** Background (7), Green (3), Red (2), and Maroon (9).\n    *   **Blocking pixels:** Magenta (6) acts as a wall.\n    *   The examples show that 9s inside closed magenta enclosures are not collected if the box cannot reach them. Conversely, if the box is in a magenta tube open at one end, 9s accessible from that opening are collected.\n3.  **Collect and Limit:** Calculate the number of reachable 9s. Let this number be $N$. The capacity of the 3x3 container is 9 pixels. We collect the reachable 9s, prioritizing those closest to the box (Breadth-First Search distance), up to a maximum of 9.\n4.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The collected 9s are removed from their original positions (replaced by the background color 7).\n    *   The 3x3 Green Box is filled with the collected 9s in reading order (row by row, left to right).\n    *   If $N < 9$, the remaining pixels in the box (3s and 2) stay as they are.\n    *   If $N \\ge 9$, the entire box becomes 9s (including the center). Any reachable 9s beyond the count of 9 remain in their original positions.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Green Box:** Located at Rows 4-6, Columns 4-6.\n2.  **Reachability Analysis:**\n    *   **Walls:** There is a magenta (6) structure.\n    *   **Exits:** The box has two openings: one at the top (Row 3, Col 5) and one at the bottom (Row 7, Col 6).\n    *   **Reachable 9s (BFS order approx):**\n        *   **Close (via R7C6):** (10,4), (10,6).\n        *   **Close (via R3C5):** (1,2), (3,2), (1,10), (3,10).\n        *   **Medium (via left/right paths):** (7,2), (7,10).\n        *   **Far (via extended left path):** (10,0).\n        *   **Further (remaining left cluster):** (10,1), (10,2).\n    *   **Unreachable 9s:**\n        *   (0,4), (0,6): Inside a closed top enclosure (Row 1 C3-7 is a solid wall).\n        *   (10,8), (10,9), (10,10): Inside a closed bottom-right pocket (isolated by walls at R7-9, C7-9).\n3.  **Collection (Max 9):**\n    *   We collect the closest 9 reachable 9s.\n    *   The set includes: (10,4), (10,6), (1,2), (3,2), (1,10), (3,10), (7,2), (7,10), (10,0).\n    *   Total Collected = 9.\n    *   Remaining reachable 9s (excess): (10,1), (10,2).\n4.  **Output Generation:**\n    *   **Fill Box:** The box (R4-6, C4-6) is completely filled with 9s.\n    *   **Clear Collected:** Change the collected 9s listed above to 7s.\n    *   **Preserve Others:** Keep unreachable 9s and excess reachable 9s as 9.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n*   Row 0: `7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7` (Unreachable 9s stay).\n*   Row 1: `7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7` (9s at C2, C10 removed).\n*   Row 2: `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7`\n*   Row 3: `6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7` (9s at C2, C10 removed).\n*   Row 4: `7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7` (Box filled).\n*   Row 5: `7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6` (Box filled).\n*   Row 6: `7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7` (Box filled).\n*   Row 7: `6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7` (9s at C2, C10 removed).\n*   Row 8: `7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7`\n*   Row 9: `7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6`\n*   Row 10: `7,9,9,6,7,7,7,6,9,9,9` (C0, C4, C6 removed.

The central 3\u00d73 \u201cplus\u201d region is always the *only* place where 3\u2019s and the single 2 appear.\n2. In the outputs, some of these 3/2 cells turn into 9\u2019s in a very specific order: always starting at the top-left corner of the 3\u00d73 block, then going left-to-right, top-to-bottom (\u201creading order\u201d).\n\nConcretely, label the 3\u00d73 plus bounding box relative to the grid as:\n\n- Top row:    (r\u2080, c\u2080), (r\u2080, c\u2080+1), (r\u2080, c\u2080+2)\n- Middle row: (r\u2080+1, c\u2080), (r\u2080+1, c\u2080+1), (r\u2080+1, c\u2080+2)\n- Bottom row: (r\u2080+2, c\u2080), (r\u2080+2, c\u2080+1), (r\u2080+2, c\u2080+2)\n\nThe examples show:\n\n- Example 1: 2 cells in this block become 9\u2019s: the first two in reading order \u2192 positions (r\u2080,c\u2080) and (r\u2080,c\u2080+1).\n- Example 2: all 9 cells in this block become 9\u2019s \u2192 full 3\u00d73 of 9\u2019s.\n- Example 3: 4 cells become 9\u2019s: the first four in reading order \u2192 (r\u2080,c\u2080), (r\u2080,c\u2080+1), (r\u2080,c\u2080+2), (r\u2080+1,c\u2080).\n\nSo:\n- The number of newly placed 9\u2019s inside the plus, call it `K`, varies between examples.\n- Once `K` is determined, **which** cells in the plus get 9\u2019s is always the same prefix order (reading order) of length `K`.\n\nDetermining `K` exactly from the three examples is nontrivial; multiple features of the 9-distribution change, and the training set is too small to pin down a unique robust rule. However, a simple, consistent way to construct a transformation is:\n\n- Erase all original 9\u2019s in the grid (turn them to 7).\n- Let `K = min(total_number_of_original_9s, 9)`.\n- In the 3\u00d73 plus bounding box, change the first `K` cells in reading order to color 9 (overwriting 3 or 2).\n- Leave all other non-9 colors (6,3,2,7) unchanged.\n\nThis rule:\n- Always preserves the recognizable 3\u00d73 central motif, now partially or fully filled with 9\u2019s.\n- Ensures that the number of placed 9\u2019s in/around the plus reflects the overall amount of original 9\u2019s (capped at 9).\n- Produces a deterministic output for the test case.\n\nApplying this to the **test**:\n\n1. Count 9\u2019s in the input:\n\n   Positions of 9\u2019s:\n   - Row 1: (1,5), (1,7)\n   - Row 2: (2,3), (2,11)\n   - Row 4: (4,3), (4,11)\n   - Row 8: (8,3), (8,11)\n   - Row 11: (11,1),(11,2),(11,3),(11,5),(11,7),(11,9),(11,10),(11,11)\n\n   Total = 16.\n\n   So `K = min(16, 9) = 9`.\n\n2. Identify the 3\u00d73 plus bounding box:\n\n   In the test, the plus has center `2` at row 6, col 6, with 3\u2019s around it:\n\n   - Rows 5\u20137, Cols 5\u20137:\n\n     ```\n     r5: c5,c6,c7 = 3,3,3\n     r6: c5,c6,c7 = 3,2,3\n     r7: c5,c6,c7 = 3,3,3\n     ```\n\n   So the 3\u00d73 bounding box is rows 5\u20137, columns 5\u20137.\n\n3. Place 9\u2019s into plus bounding, first 9 cells in reading order:\n\n   Reading order for these 9 positions:\n\n   - (5,5), (5,6), (5,7),\n   - (6,5), (6,6), (6,7),\n   - (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)\n\n   Since `K = 9`, all 9 of these get set to 9.\n\n4.

In all three training examples there is a central 3\u00d73 \u201cgreen\u201d square made of color `3` with a single `2` in its center.  \n   The rest of the grid is filled mainly with background color `7`, plus some magenta `6` tiles (a maze / frame) and several dark\u2011red `9` tiles.\n\n2. Between each input\u2013output pair the following always happens:\n   * The magenta `6` structure and the orange `7` background are unchanged.\n   * Some of the dark\u2011red `9` tiles disappear from their original places.\n   * An equal number of `9` tiles appear inside the 3\u00d73 green square, replacing `3`\u2019s (and, if necessary, the central `2`).  \n   * Within the 3\u00d73 square, the added `9`\u2019s always fill from the top\u2011left, going row by row:\n     - Cell order:  \n       (row, col) = (r5,c5), (r5,c6), (r5,c7), (r6,c5), (r6,c6), (r6,c7), (r7,c5), (r7,c6), (r7,c7).\n     - First the `3` cells are changed to `9`; if more `9`\u2019s must be placed after all eight `3` cells are used, the center `2` is then changed to `9` (this occurs in Example 2).\n\n3. Intuitively, the task is: \u201ccollect movable `9` tiles from the scene and pack them into the green 3\u00d73 square, starting at its top\u2011left, while leaving the magenta maze unchanged.\u201d\n\n4. For the test grid, there is no obvious special off\u2011limits cluster of `9`\u2019s (unlike the clearer top\u2011right clusters in some examples).  \n   I therefore take all `9` cells as movable:\n   * Remove every `9` in the grid (turn it to `7`).\n   * There are 16 such cells; the 3\u00d73 square can hold at most 9.\n   * Refill the 3\u00d73 square in row\u2011major order with `9`\u2019s until either we run out of `9`\u2019s or we fill all 9 positions.\n   * Since 16 \u2265 9, the entire 3\u00d73 square (including the center) becomes `9`.\n\n5.

Let's break this down. My goal is to figure out the transformation rule and apply it.\n\n**The Strategy:**\n\nFirst, I'll closely examine each example. I'm looking for patterns, especially how the input grid changes. I'll pay attention to the colors (7 is background, 6 is the wall, 9 are the pixels), the positions, and how they relate.  I'll test different hypotheses, like \"do the pixels move or are they part of a larger canvas?\".  I'll check for \"Line of Sight\", geometric symmetries, and how \"walls\" (6-pixels) influence the transformation. I will consider if the output is just an aggregation of the input. I will test a few heuristics (\"Gravity\",\"Projectile\") and then consider \"Gaps\" (like a door in the walls).\n\n**Example Analysis**\n\nLet's begin with example 1: This is 11x11 grid with orange background (7), magenta structures (6), a green box of 3's inside with a red pixel (2), plus some maroon (9) pixel distributed in the grid. The output is a modified grid, and it looks like the 3x3 green block got altered. It appears that the 9s from somewhere have moved into the green structure. My analysis leads me to a testable hypothesis where the 9s are \"projected\" or \"inverted\" across the central 2. I have to think about whether the 9 is really a \"target\" that disappears, and whether this transformation is due to gaps, or by looking at the input 9 and output positions relative to the center 2.\n\nIn example 2,  I try to apply the same strategies but I see different behavior. It has 9s everywhere. The initial center is filled with 9s too. This gives a simpler result. Perhaps it's just a matter of \"filling\" based on density.\n\n**Test Input application:**\n\nThe examples are the foundation to solve the test input. In this input, the center starts as 2, a 3x3 block, and there are many distributed pixels (9). It has walls (6) and has gaps in the wall too. My strategy will be to carefully analyze this test input structure, look for patterns from examples 1 and 2, and determine the central 3x3 grid changes and then apply it to the input. I hypothesize that with walls with gaps in place, those 9 pixels might project into those gaps, and the gaps will cause a change. I will create a rule to transform the input based on those examples.\nBased on the high density of 9s, the center area should become fully 9s or a ring of 9s around 2.\n\nAfter much trial and error, I found a decent rule!\n\n**The Transformation:**\n\n*   **The 3x3 block changes to (5-7, 5-7):**\n    *   Row 5: 9, 9, 9\n    *   Row 6: 9, 2, 9\n    *   Row 7: 9, 9, 9\n*   **Keep the rest of the grid the same.**\n\n**The Final Answer Grid (Test Input):**\n\n```\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,7\n6,6,9,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,9\n7,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,2,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,7\n6,6,9,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n```\n\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the transformation rule for an 11x11 grid containing a central 3x3 box (the \"core\") and various scattered pixels (color 9). The core is surrounded by a structure of \"walls\" (color 6), although in Example 3 the walls are absent. The core itself initially consists of 3s (green) with a 2 (red) in the center.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **The Core Transformation**: The primary change occurs in the 3x3 core (rows 5-7, columns 5-7). The digit 3s are replaced by 9s based on the configuration of 9s in the surrounding grid. The center pixel (6,6) is a 2; in Examples 1 and 3, it remains a 2. In Example 2, it becomes a 9.\n    *   *Observation*: In Example 2, there are 9s surrounding the core in a very dense pattern, including directly adjacent cells (e.g., (6,3)). In Examples 1 and 3, the 9s are sparser or blocked. The Test Input has a 2 in the center and no direct horizontal 9 neighbors in the middle row (Row 6), similar to Ex 1 and 3. Thus, the center will likely remain 2.\n\n2.  **Mapping Rule (Symmetry/Inversion)**:\n    *   In **Example 1**, 9s at the Southeast (9,8), (9,9) disappear, and marks appear at the Northwest of the core (5,5), (5,6). This suggests an inversion through the center: a source at $(r, c)$ paints the cell corresponding to $(-r, -c)$ relative to the center, provided there is a path or \"line of sight\".\n    *   In **Example 3**, 9s at the Northeast (2,10) cause a mark at the Northeast (5,7). 9s at the Northwest (3,3) cause a mark at the Northwest (5,5). 9s at the Southeast (10,9) cause a mark at the Northwest (5,5) [via inversion].\n    *   *Synthesis*: There are two mechanisms. One is direct mapping (seen in Ex 3 with NE->NE), and one is inverted mapping (SE->NW). The presence of walls (color 6) with gaps likely dictates which 9s can \"enter\" and how they impinge on the core.\n\n3.  **Application to Test Input**:\n    *   **Walls**: The test input has walls at Row 4 and Row 8.\n    *   **Gaps**: There is a gap in the top wall at (4,6) (North) and in the bottom wall at (8,7) (Southeast).\n    *   **Sources**: The grid is filled with 9s in the corners and specifically heavy concentrations at the bottom (Row 11) and top (Rows 1-2).\n    *   **North Gap (4,6)**: 9s from the North (e.g., (1,5)) can flow through this gap. Following the pattern where \"flow through a gap hits the opposite side\", North 9s hitting through a North gap will strike the South side of the box (Row 7). Thus, Row 7 becomes 9s.\n    *   **Southeast Gap (8,7)**: 9s from the Southeast (e.g., Row 11) flow through this gap. SE is opposite to NW. The \"stream\" enters from SE and hits the NW wall of the box. Thus, the Top-Left pixels (5,5) become 9s.\n    *   **Density Argument**: Unlike the sparse Example 1, the Test Input has 9s in all quadrants (NE, NW, SE, SW) and heavy bands at the top and bottom. In Example 2, which had a high density of 9s, the entire 3x3 ring became 9s. The Test Input's density suggests a saturation of the 3x3 target area. Specifically, the \"North\" gap allows painting the bottom row, and the \"South-East\" gap allows painting the top-left. The high density of surrounding 9s (including the diagonals) combined with the logic from Example 2 implies the remaining 3s in the ring will also be converted.\n    *   **Conclusion for the Core**: The 3x3 area will become a ring of 9s surrounding the central 2. (Row 5: 9,9,9; Row 6: 9,2,9; Row 7: 9,9,9).\n\n4.  **Handling Outside Pixels**:\n    *   In Example 1 and 3, \"source\" 9s disappeared. In Example 2, many outside 9s remained. The rule for disappearance is complex and inconsistent across examples (likely distance or obstruction-dependent). However, generally, the problem focuses on the *central transformation*. In Example 2, edge 9s remained. The Test Input has 9s at the very edges (Rows 1, 11). It is safest to assume the background structure (including the wall 9s and edge 9s) remains largely static unless they are clearly \"consumed\" projectiles. Given the ambiguity and the visual pattern of Ex 2 (where the environment persisted), I will retain the outer grid configuration exactly as is, only modifying the core.\n\n**Final Plan**:\nCopy the input grid.\nReplace the 3x3 center core (rows 5-7, cols 5-7) with:\n9, 9, 9\n9, 2, 9\n9, 9, 9\n\n**Output Grid Generation**:\nRows 1-4: Unchanged.\nRow 5: ...6, 9, 9, 9, 6...

I've got this ARC task to solve, and the user's given me some examples to figure out the rules. My initial impulse is to dive right in, but I see a prompt that looks like it's trying to get me to act like a specific AI persona (a \"neuro-symbolic logic engine\"). It seems like the user wants me to *simulate* internal thought processes before just spitting out the answer. I have to make sure to respond in the *correct format*. I'm also noticing some conflicting instructions in the prompt about whether to hide my reasoning or explain it \u2013 a bit of a head-scratcher!\n\nI decide it's best to prioritize the explicit instruction to explain my thinking, even if that means temporarily ignoring the \"no explanation\" part. I think the user is most likely interested in how I solve the problem.\n\nThe real challenge is understanding the core logic behind the task. It's a pattern recognition game. I carefully analyze the provided examples, looking for repeating patterns. In this particular task, the pattern seems to revolve around how the colored pixels (maroon 9s) interact with the central target shape (green 3s and red 2s). These 9s \"shoot\" and change the shape of that target by turning its parts to 9. The critical part is figuring out WHEN the 9s transform the target (not just any time). This is the key. The *persistence* of the 9s (do they disappear, or stay?) and the role of the frame (6s) in the logic seem important.\n\nSo, I start by looking at a specific example, and I figure that the 9s are acting like missiles that \"hit\" the central block and then change that block. I create a hypothesis around this \"shoot-and-paint\" logic, checking to see if a color moves to the target. Then, I look at the test input and try to apply this model to figure out where the 9s will go to, and how the pattern is completed. I look at each pixel to see if a shoot \"ray\" is made.\n\nThe biggest difficulty is determining under which conditions the \"missiles\" remain on the field or disappear (persist). The examples provide clues, but there are some contradictions. I have to think in all cases to ensure the pattern is correct.\n\nI examine the test input and use the logic to predict the new pixels.\nI double-check to make sure all elements of the problem (target pixels, \"shoots\" pixels) are covered, and I generate the output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to deduce a transformation rule from three examples and apply it to a test input.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:**\n    *   **Target Object:** A central 3x3 box containing Green (3) pixels surrounding a Red (2) center. In some examples (1 and 2), this box is enclosed in a Magenta (6) frame.\n    *   **Agents:** Maroon (9) pixels scattered around the grid.\n\n2.  **Transformation Logic (Ray Casting/Shooting):**\n    *   The Maroon (9) pixels act as \"shooters\" or sources of projectiles.\n    *   They emit rays in **cardinal and diagonal directions** (8 directions).\n    *   These rays travel through Background (7) and Frame (6) pixels.\n    *   When a ray intercepts a pixel of the **Target Object** (specifically the Green 3s), that pixel changes color to Maroon (9).\n    *   The Red (2) center can also be changed if hit (as seen in Example 2), but if no ray targets it directly, it remains Red.\n\n3.  **Verification with Examples:**\n    *   **Example 1:**\n        *   Source (3,3) shoots Diagonal Down-Right $\\rightarrow$ Hits (5,5). (5,5) becomes 9.\n        *   Source (3,4) shoots Diagonal Down-Right $\\rightarrow$ Hits (5,6). (5,6) becomes 9.\n        *   Other 9s (like 9,8) do not have a clear trajectory to a target 3/2 and thus cause no change to the box.\n    *   **Example 3 (No Frame):**\n        *   Source (3,3) shoots Diagonal Down-Right $\\rightarrow$ Hits (5,5).\n        *   Source (10,9) shoots Diagonal Up-Left $\\rightarrow$ Hits (6,5).\n        *   Source (2,10) shoots Diagonal Down-Left $\\rightarrow$ Hits (5,7).\n        *   Other changes (5,6) and (6,5) are accounted for by valid diagonal paths from the available 9s (e.g. 10,9 hits 6,5).\n        *   Pixels not hit (like the Red 2 at the center, or the 3 at 7,7 which was missed by 3,11) remain unchanged.\n\n4.  **Persistence of Sources:**\n    *   In the examples, some 9s disappear and some stay.\n    *   However, in the **Test Input**, the 9s are arranged in a highly symmetric and structural pattern, interlocked with the Magenta (6) frame (e.g., Row 1, Row 11). This suggests they are part of the permanent structure, similar to the persisting 9s in Example 1 (which were inside the frame) and Example 2 (which were a block). We will assume the source 9s in the Test Input persist.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Target Box:** Rows 5-7, Cols 5-7. Center at (6,6).\n    *   Grid:\n        3 3 3\n        3 2 3\n        3 3 3\n*   **Ray Tracing:**\n    *   (1,5) [Down] $\\rightarrow$ Hits (5,5).\n    *   (2,3) [Diag SE] $\\rightarrow$ Hits (5,6).\n    *   (1,7) [Down] $\\rightarrow$ Hits (5,7).\n    *   (4,3) [Diag SE] and (8,3) [Diag NE] $\\rightarrow$ Hit (6,5).\n    *   (2,11) [Diag SW] $\\rightarrow$ Hits (6,7).\n    *   (11,5) [Up] and (11,9) [Diag NW] $\\rightarrow$ Hit (7,5).\n    *   (11,2) [Diag NE] $\\rightarrow$ Hits (7,6).\n    *   (11,3) [Diag NE] and (11,7) [Up] $\\rightarrow$ Hit (7,7).\n*   **Result:** All surrounding Green (3) pixels are hit and turn into Maroon (9).\n*   **Center (6,6):** No 9 has a direct line of sight to the center (6,6). It remains Red (2).\n*   **Sources:** The sources remain in place as they are part of the frame structure.\n\n**Final Output Description:**\nThe central 3x3 area transforms from a Green box with a Red center to a Maroon box with a Red center. The surrounding grid remains identical to the input.\n\n```\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,9,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,9\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,9,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,2,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n6,6,9,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n9,9,9,6,9,7,9,6,9,9,9\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_B>\n</CANDIDATE 18>\n</INPUT_DATA>\n\n<AUDIT_PROTOCOL>\nExecute this pipeline sequentially for every Candidate.

                "response": "**My Audit of ARC Puzzle Solutions**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. I've been tasked with evaluating a bunch of candidate solutions for this ARC puzzle.  The goal is to understand how these grids transform and see if the solutions make sense.\n\nFirst, I need to get the lay of the land. The input grids are 11x11, and they have the usual suspects: orange background, magenta walls, a green-and-red target box, and maroon '9' pixels acting as actors.  My initial observation is this: it seems like the '9' pixels are the key to the transformations. The task is to identify the 'active' pixels. My hypothesis is that walls and distance play a part.\n\nI started by studying the solved examples. Example 1 showed how a '9' pixel inside a wall can move into the target box, in reading order. Key insight: Pixels not reachable via a path are 'protected'. Then I moved to Example 2. It's a bit more complicated with many '9' pixels, but the pattern is still there: some '9' pixels disappear, the target box is filled, but importantly *some* '9' pixels remain untouched. That suggests there's some kind of capacity limit or perhaps a distance rule here. Example 3 solidifies my initial understanding: no walls, '9' pixels move to target box, and that's it. It's time to refine my logic.\n\nBased on the examples, my \"core logic\" is starting to form.  I think the rule is something like this: Identify 'active' pixels - likely those connected to the box, perhaps defined by walls. Count these 'active' '9' pixels ($N$). Then, move $N$ pixels into the box filling it in row-major order. The box only has a max capacity of 9 pixels. If $N < 9$, fill $N$ spots. If $N \\ge 9$, fill all 9 spots.  And crucial point: those pixels that were \"active\" (moved into the box) are *replaced* by the orange background (7). 'Inactive' pixels (isolated by walls) remain as '9'.\n\nWith my logic framed, I analyzed the test input, very carefully. I noted that I had to parse the walls. I identified the walls and found which pixels were \"reachable\". There are '9' pixels at the top, bottom and at the second row. The wall at the first row blocks the '9' at the first row, so they are not reachable. The '9' at the second row is inside a horizontal wall. The '9' at the bottom row is free, so is 'active'.\nThe test input has some walls and the target box is at R4-R6, C4-C6. There's a gap above and below this box. So, any '9' pixels connected to this box via a gap are \"reachable\". And with the reachable pixels identified, I counted. I found that I can select many '9's, more than 9, to feed to the box, so I would expect it to be full.\n\nNow the real fun begins: evaluating the candidate solutions. Candidate 0 seemed pretty good at first.  It used walls to define \"compartments\", and said that all active 9s will move.  The problem with Candidate 0 is that it fails the capacity constraint seen in Example 2 and with the test grid.\n\nCandidate 1 is a lot more interesting. It used a concept of \"Connect and Count,\" even using BFS (Breadth First Search, a common distance algorithm in Computer Science), which prioritizes \"close\" 9s. And it *explicitly* accounts for the box's capacity. Crucially, the solution proposed by Candidate 1 for the test input is perfectly in line with how many 9 pixels there should be.\nLet's make some simple checks: Is the Box complete? Check. Have all the walls protected pixels that should be there? Check.\n\nI carefully examined Candidate 1, comparing it to the examples. Example 2 was the clincher. In example 2 some distant connected 9s are *not* included. This means Candidate 1's \"distance\" and \"capacity\" rule seems to be right. This is confirmed by checking the proposed solutions for test input. After double checking the grid and pixel-by-pixel, and a re-check of distance calculation, my conclusion is that it is correct.\n\nI looked at the other candidates. Candidate 2's logic makes all original 9s disappear. This contradicts the examples. Candidate 5 is wrong about geometry and distance, ignoring the pattern. Candidate 16 doesn't remove the 9s at all. Candidate 18 makes a strange assumption.\n\nSo, Candidate 1 wins. It'\n\n<AUDIT_LOG>\n### PHASE 1: LOGIC SELECTION & CRYSTALLIZATION\n\n**Candidate 0**\n- **Logic:** Divides the grid into compartments using `6` walls. Identifies the \"target compartment\" containing the 3x3 pattern. All `9`s in this compartment are \"active\" and get removed/moved to the center. `9`s in isolated compartments (like the top pocket in the test grid) are \"protected\".\n- **Rule:**\n  1. Identify the connected region (compartment) containing the 3x3 box (R4-6, C4-6).\n  2. Count all `9`s in this region ($N$).\n  3. Remove all $N$ `9`s (set to `7`).\n  4. Fill the 3x3 box with $\\min(N, 9)$ `9`s in reading order.\n  5. Isolated `9`s remain `9`.\n\n**Candidate 1**\n- **Logic:** Uses BFS distance. `9`s are \"Agents\". Calculate shortest path distance from the 3x3 box to all reachable `9`s. Prioritize the closest `9`s. The box has a capacity of 9. Stop collecting after 9 agents or when no more are reachable. Unselected `9`s (excess or unreachable) remain.\n- **Rule:**\n  1. Identify all `9`s reachable from the 3x3 box via non-`6` cells.\n  2. Sort reachable `9`s by distance.\n  3. Select the top $K$ closest `9`s, where $K = \\min(\\text{ReachableCount}, 9)$.\n  4. Set selected `9`s to `7`.\n  5. Fill the first $K$ cells of the 3x3 box with `9`.\n  6. Remaining `9`s (unreachable or ranked > 9) stay `9`.\n\n**Candidate 5**\n- **Logic:** Geometrically limited \"Absorption\". Only `9`s within the column range of the box (Cols 4-6) and inside the bordered region are absorbed.\n- **Rule:**\n  1. Identify `9`s in Columns 4-6 bounded by vertical walls.\n  2. Remove these `9`s.\n  3. Fill 3x3 box with count.\n\n**Candidate 16**\n- **Logic:** The agents reach the container and fill it. The agents themselves are NOT removed.\n- **Rule:**\n  1. If reachable, fill 3x3 box with `9`s.\n  2. Leave original `9`s unchanged.\n\n**Candidate 18**\n- **Logic:** \"Ray Casting\". `9`s shoot rays. If a ray hits the box, paint it.\n- **Rule:**\n  1. Trace rays from `9`s.\n  2. If intercept box, color box.\n  3. Source `9`s persist.\n\n---\n\n### PHASE 2: THE GROUND TRUTH AUDIT\n\n**Test Candidate 1 (Capacity/BFS Rule):**\n- **Example 1:**\n  - Input: 2 `9`s inside the frame, others outside.\n  - Logic: Inside `9`s are closest. Outside `9`s are further/blocked (depending on connectivity).\n  - Output: Inside `9`s removed. Box filled 2 spots. Matches.\n- **Example 2:**\n  - Input: Many `9`s. Some near box, some far (top right cluster).\n  - Logic: Box capacity is 9. There are >9 reachable `9`s.\n  - Prediction: The 9 closest `9`s are removed. Distant `9`s (top right) remain.\n  - Observation: Box is full. `9`s near the box are gone. Top-right cluster mostly remains, but *partially eroded* (one `9` at R1C6 disappeared).\n  - Verdict: **PASS**. The partial erosion of the distant cluster confirms the \"Capacity Limit\" logic over a binary \"Compartment\" logic.\n- **Example 3:**\n  - Input: 4 scattered `9`s. No walls.\n  - Logic: All 4 are reachable. $4 < 9$.\n  - Prediction: All 4 removed. Box filled 4 spots.\n  - Observation: Matches.\n  - Verdict: **PASS**.\n\n**Test Candidate 0 (Compartment/All-Active Rule):**\n- **Example 1:** Matches (Inside `9`s active, Outside protected).\n- **Example 2:**\n  - Logic: All `9`s in the main connected component are \"active\".\n  - Prediction: Since the top-right cluster is connected to the main area (via open R2), the *entire* cluster should be removed. Or, if it's considered a separate compartment, *none* should be removed.\n  - Observation: The cluster is *partially* removed (R1C6 gone, R1C7 stays).\n  - Verdict: **FAIL**. A binary compartment rule cannot explain partial removal based on distance/count.\n\n**Test Candidate 5 (Column Geometry Rule):**\n- **Example 1:** Source `9`s at Cols 7,8. Rule restricts to Cols 4-6. **FAIL**.\n- **Example 3:** Source `9`s scattered at cols 3, 10. Rule restricts to Cols 4-6. **FAIL**.\n\n**Test Candidate 16 & 18 (Persistence Rule):**\n- **Example 1:** Source `9`s disappear in Ground Truth. Rule says they stay. **FAIL**.\n\n---\n\n### PHASE 3: EXECUTION CONSISTENCY\n\n**Candidate 1 (BFS Rule)** on Test Input:\n- **Test Input Analysis:**\n  - Trapped `9`s at R0 (C4, C6) behind R1 wall. Correctly identified as unreachable.\n  - Reachable `9`s: ~14 total.\n  - Capacity: 9.\n  - Action: Remove the 9 closest reachable `9`s.\n- **Proposed Grid Check:**\n  - The grid removes exactly 9 `9`s.\n  - It keeps the trapped R0 `9`s.\n  - It keeps the \"excess\" distant `9`s at R10 (10,1), (10,2), etc.\n  - *Note on Distance:* I initially doubted the removal of (10,0) over (10,1), but a wall at (10,3) forces the path to (10,0-2) to come from the far left (Col 0), making (10,0) actually closer than (10,1). The execution appears strictly consistent with the BFS logic.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n**Candidate 0 (Compartment Rule)** on Test Input:\n- **Rule:** Remove all connected `9`s.\n- **Proposed Grid:** Removes 14 `9`s. Fills box.\n- **Verdict:** Consistent with its *own* logic, but the logic was flawed (failed Ex 2).\n\n---\n\n### PHASE 4: STACK RANKING\n\n1.  **Candidate 1 (GOLD):** The only candidate that accounts for the **Capacity Limit** (9 pixels) observed in Example 2. The partial erosion of the distant cluster in Ex 2 is the \"smoking gun\" that disproves the binary compartment logic of Candidate 0. Candidate 1's execution on the test grid is precise and logical.\n2.  **Candidate 0 (BRONZE):** Correctly identifies connectivity/compartments but fails to apply the capacity limit, leading to an \"over-clean\" solution. It is logically superior to the remaining candidates but inferior to Candidate 1.\n3.  **Candidate 2, 5, 16, 18 (INVALID):** All fail multiple examples due to wrong geometry (5) or failure to remove source pixels (16, 18).\n\n</AUDIT_LOG>\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 1,\n      \"score\": 9.5,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Correctly identifies that the 'moving' 9s are limited by the target box's capacity (9 pixels).

My job is to figure out *what* the \"something\" is. There are a few examples to look at, and a test input to apply the rule to.\n\n**Initial Assessment:** The key is to find the pattern and apply it.\n\n**Diving into the Examples:**\n\n**Example 1:**\nI immediately see a central structure with a 3x3 box in the middle. The color inside the box transforms.  It also seems like the other things in the grid \u2013 the scattered '9's - might be important.  There's a bunch of '9's scattered around the background color (Orange, 7), some inside the structure some outside. The output has changed the 3x3 box, and some of the 9's near the box (or inside the boundaries).\n\nI'm starting to think about the '9's.  Are they moving? Are they being attracted to the box?  I trace the scattered '9's to see if I can find a pattern: are they 'inside' the bigger shape?  Aha! The '6's (Magenta) seem to define a boundary.  It's looking like *only* the '9's *inside* this boundary are changing. Let's trace it and see if the '9's near the box are the ones that actually move and change something in the 3x3 box.\n\nI start counting the number of '9's in the input and output. I'm focusing on the center box; that's where the most obvious change happens.  I examine specific rows to confirm the change. The scattered '9's disappear from the original grid (the source) but I am not clear if they stay in the final form. Where the \u20189\u2019s in the structure disappear, and the '3's in the center box become \u20189\u2019. The original number of '9's seem to be re-positioned. Now, it looks like a 'gravity' of sorts.\n\nIt seems the box is the \"sink\", and the number of moving '9's affect it. It appears some '9's 'move' into the center box, replacing the '3's. So let me look deeper at the '6's: there are two kinds of areas, and the key change is between them.\n\n**Example 2:**\nHere, there are similar structures, but now the number of '9's seem important! There are a lot of the '9's here. I start looking for '9's. Ok, again there's a 3x3 center box. The 6 boundaries are at different positions. And the 9 are scattered differently. And the central 3x3 box color (3 and 2) changes to 9. And the \u20186\u2019s make some kind of \u201cwalls\u201d in the grid. If a 9 is \u201cconnected\u201d it will move, and others won\u2019t. Let me find all of the connected 9's to confirm this theory!\n\n**Connectivity Theory Emerges:**\n\nI start to formulate a connectivity hypothesis: The grid is divided into \u201ccompartments\u201d by walls of \u20186\u2019. There\u2019s a \u201ctarget\u201d compartment, where the 3x3 box lives. Any '9's in compartments *connected* to the target compartment (via gaps in the \u20186\u2019 walls) will \"move\". I double-check this: the number of 9s affect if the color is replaced or not. I'm checking, like, is the number of '9's enough to fill the 3x3? Maybe I'm starting to see a pattern!\n\n**Testing the Hypothesis:**\n\nI go back to Example 2 and start tracing those 6s. The number of 9s has to be at least the same as the available space in the middle. I look at Example 2. There seem to be more 9\u2019s that should have moved, but I can't confirm a pattern. Now, I'm thinking, is that \"number\" important? Or is it something more spatial?\n\nAha! There's something important about connectivity. I check the '6' boundary to see where there are gaps. Are all 9\u2019s connected? I look for 6 boundaries that are either vertical or horizontal. I confirm that only 9's within certain \"compartments\" are the ones moving. The '9's must be accessible. The accessibility is defined by the spaces between the 6s! I'm making progress here!\n\nI'm thinking, is there a simple rule that defines which 9\n\nTo solve this ARC task, we need to infer the transformation rule by analyzing the provided examples and then applying that rule to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:**\n    *   The grid contains a background of Orange (7).\n    *   There are structures formed by Magenta (6) \"walls\".\n    *   There is a specific \"target chamber\" or \"box\" defined by a 3x3 region containing Green (3) pixels and a central Red (2) pixel.\n    *   There are Maroon (9) pixels scattered throughout the grid.\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule (Inferred):**\n    *   The core mechanic is a \"flow\" or \"attraction\" of the Maroon (9) pixels into the target 3x3 box.\n    *   **Connectivity:** Only Maroon (9) pixels that are *topologically connected* to the 3x3 box via \"open\" space (pixels of color 7 or other 9s, passing through gaps in the Magenta 6 walls) are moved. Pixels enclosed in isolated chambers formed by Magenta (6) walls do not move.\n    *   **Movement:** The connected Maroon (9) pixels are removed from their original positions (turning into the background color 7) and \"moved\" into the 3x3 box.\n    *   **Filling Order:** The arriving Maroon (9) pixels replace the existing Green (3) and Red (2) pixels in the box. The filling order appears to be row-major (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).\n    *   **Capacity:** The 3x3 box has 9 slots. If the number of connected 9s is less than 9, they fill the slots partially (preserving the remaining 3s or 2s). If the number of connected 9s is greater than or equal to 9, the entire box becomes 9s.\n\n3.  **Application to Test Input:**\n\n    *   **Identify the Target Box:** The 3x3 box containing 3s and a 2 is located at **Rows 4-6, Columns 4-6**.\n    *   **Analyze Connectivity:** We perform a flood-fill or pathfinding analysis starting from the box to see which 9s are reachable.\n        *   **Box Connections:** The box connects to the top section via a gap in the wall at (3,5) and to the bottom section via a gap at (7,6).\n        *   **Top Region (Rows 0-3):**\n            *   The gap at (3,5) connects to Row 2, which is entirely open (7s).\n            *   From Row 2, we can reach the 9s at **(1,2)**, **(1,10)**, **(3,2)**, and **(3,10)**.\n            *   The 9s at **(0,4)** and **(0,6)** are enclosed by walls at (0,3), (0,7) and a solid floor of walls at Row 1 (cols 3-7). They are isolated from the box and will **not** move.\n        *   **Bottom Region (Rows 7-10):**\n            *   The gap at (7,6) connects to the open area in Row 8.\n            *   Row 8 connects to Row 9 via a gap at (9,4).\n            *   Row 9 connects to Row 10 (which is mostly 9s).\n            *   From this central bottom area, paths extend to the 9s at the sides and bottom corners. Specifically, the 9s at **(7,2)**, **(7,10)**, and the clusters at **Row 10 (cols 0-2, 4-6, 8-10)** are all reachable.\n    *   **Count Moving 9s:**\n        *   Top/Middle: (1,2), (1,10), (3,2), (3,10) -> **4 pixels**.\n        *   Bottom Sides: (7,2), (7,10) -> **2 pixels**.\n        *   Bottom Row: (10,0), (10,1), (10,2), (10,4), (10,6), (10,8), (10,9), (10,10) -> **8 pixels**.\n        *   **Total Moving:** 14 pixels.\n    *   **Execute Transformation:**\n        1.  **Remove Source 9s:** All the reachable 9s listed above are changed to background (7). The isolated 9s at (0,4) and (0,6) remain 9.\n        2.  **Fill Target Box:** Since 14 > 9, the entire 3x3 box (Rows 4-6, Cols 4-6) is filled with 9s.\n\n**Final Output Generation:**\n- **Row 0:** Unchanged (Isolated 9s remain).\n- **Row 1:** 9s become 7s.\n- **Row 2:** Unchanged (All 7s).\n- **Row 3:** 9s become 7s.\n- **Rows 4-6:** The central 3x3 area (Cols 4-6) becomes all 9s.\n- **Row 7:** 9s become 7s.\n- **Rows 8-9:** Unchanged (7s and walls).\n- **Row 10:** All 9s become 7s.\n\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7\n      7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n      7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6\n      7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n      6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7\n      7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n      7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n      7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"B\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_12_step_5_opus_gen_sol\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Algorithm Synthesis and Validation**\n\nOkay, here's the game plan, based on those examples and that user-provided text.  The task is to transform a grid with scattered \"9\"s, potentially bounded by \"6\"s, and containing a central \"3x3\" structure with either a \"2\" or \"3\" at its center.  We're going to use this connected component and close-by distances, applying the rules of the connected 9s.\n\n1.  **Frame and Interior Identification:** Figure out what 6s enclose the 3x3 pattern.  I'm going to determine a main frame structure based on 6s around the central pattern.  This *frame* might not be a closed box.\n\n2.  **Compartment Definition:**  Define a compartment.  The critical compartment includes the cells of the *frame*, AND any \"nearby\" cells, even if not physically adjacent.  This is a critical part, as it dictates what 9s are *active*.\n\n3.  **Active 9s Classification:** A 9 is Active if it is:\n    *   Inside the compartment.\n    *   \"Close\" to the frame (within a distance of 2 based on grid steps). The \"within 2 cells\" rule makes more sense when working the examples.\n\n4.  **Transformation:**\n    *   Count the active 9s.\n    *   Remove (change to 7) those Active 9s.\n    *   Fill the 3x3 pattern with this *count* of 9s.\n\nIn summary, this approach correctly identified that the position of the 9s relative to the structure determines whether to remove them. This is the crucial aspect of this ARC.\n\nTo solve this problem, I will apply the transformation rules inferred from the examples and the provided description.\n\n**1. Identify the Central Pattern and Frame Structure**\nThe central 3x3 pattern (containing 3s and a 2) is located in rows 4-6, columns 4-6.\n- Row 4: `...6,3,3,3,6...`\n- Row 5: `...6,3,2,3,6...`\n- Row 6: `...6,3,3,3,6...`\n\nThe \"Frame\" consists of the color 6 cells surrounding this pattern and extending through the grid.\n- In the test input, the frame structure is complex, appearing in rows 0, 1, 3, 4-6, 7, 8, 9, 10.\n- Key observation: The frame forms barriers. Specifically, Row 1 has a solid segment of 6s from column 3 to 7 (`6,6,6,6,6`), and Row 3, 7, 8, 9 have 6s at columns 3 and 7 (forming vertical walls).\n\n**2. Classify 9s (Active vs. Protected)**\nI need to determine connectivity of each 9 to the central pattern region (R4-6, C4-6).\n- **Connectivity check:** The central pattern connects to Row 2 via a gap in Row 3 at (3,5). Row 2 is all 7s, so it connects to the left (cols 0-2) and right (cols 8-10) sides of the grid. The pattern also connects downwards via a gap in Row 7 at (7,6) to the bottom regions.\n- **Protected 9s:** The 9s at **(0,4)** and **(0,6)** are in Row 0 inside the vertical frame lines (cols 3 and 7). However, Row 1 has a solid wall of 6s at cols 3-7. This wall completely isolates the region (R0, C4-6) from the rest of the grid (specifically from Row 2 and the pattern below). Since these 9s are in a **separate enclosed compartment**, they are **protected**.\n- **Active 9s:** All other 9s are connected to the central pattern (either through the open Row 2 or the bottom gaps) and are adjacent to the frame structure (not \"distant\").\n  - Row 1: (1,2), (1,10)\n  - Row 3: (3,2), (3,10)\n  - Row 7: (7,2), (7,10)\n  - Row 10: (10,0), (10,1), (10,2), (10,4), (10,6), (10,8), (10,9), (10,10)\n  Total Active 9s = 14.\n\n**3. Transformation**\n- **Remove Active 9s:** Replace the 14 active 9s with background color 7.\n- **Fill Pattern:** Replace the cells in the 3x3 pattern (R4-6, C4-6) with color 9. Since we removed 14 nines and the pattern has only 9 cells, we fill all 9 cells with 9s.\n- **Preserve Protected 9s:** The 9s at (0,4) and (0,6) remain unchanged.\n\n**Output Construction:**\n- **Row 0:** `7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7` (Protected 9s remain)\n- **Row 1:** `7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7` (9s at cols 2,10 removed)\n- **Row 2:** `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7` (Unchanged)\n- **Row 3:** `6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7` (9s at cols 2,10 removed)\n- **Row 4:** `7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7` (Pattern filled with 9s)\n- **Row 5:** `7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6` (Pattern filled with 9s)\n- **Row 6:** `7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7` (Pattern filled with 9s)\n- **Row 7:** `6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7` (9s at cols 2,10 removed)\n- **Row 8:** `7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7` (Unchanged)\n- **Row 9:** `7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6` (Unchanged)\n- **Row 10:** `7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7` (All 9s removed)\n\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7\n      7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n      7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6\n      7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n      6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7\n      7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n      7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n      7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"C\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_12_step_5_opus_gen_sol\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at this problem, I need to:\n1.

regions (compartments) of non\u20116 cells separated by 6s behave independently.  \n     - Example 1: pattern sits inside a closed compartment; only the 9s in that same enclosed region are removed (2 of them).\n     - Example 3: there are no 6s, so there is effectively a single global region; all 9s are removed (4 of them).\n     - Example 2: the 6s form an open frame; there is one big region, but a top\u2011right 9 cluster is far from the frame and is treated as protected, while a bunch of other 9s are removed (9 total).\n\n   So in words:\n\n   - Use 6s to define **compartments**.\n   - In the compartment containing the 3\u00d73 pattern, most of the 9s are **active** and get moved into the pattern, except any that lie in clearly separate \u201csmall rooms\u201d fully enclosed by 6s.\n   - 9s in other compartments are protected.\n\n2. **Compartments in the test grid**\n\n   For the test input (11\u00d711), we again take 6 as walls and consider 4\u2011connected regions of all non\u20116 cells (colors 0\u20139 except 6).\n\n   - The central 3\u00d73 pattern is at rows 5\u20137, columns 5\u20137, exactly as in the examples.\n   - If you conceptually flood\u2011fill from any pattern cell across non\u20116 cells, you find:\n     - One large region containing:\n       - All 9s at\n         (2,3), (2,11),\n         (4,3), (4,11),\n         (8,3), (8,11),\n         (11,1), (11,2), (11,3), (11,5), (11,7), (11,9), (11,10), (11,11),\n       - plus all the 3s/2/7s around them and around the pattern.\n     - A **separate small enclosed pocket** at the top, defined by 6s at:\n       - Row 1: column 4 and 8\n       - Row 2: columns 4\u20138\n       This pocket contains exactly three non\u20116 cells: (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), among which (1,5) and (1,7) are 9s.\n       There is no 4\u2011connected path from any pattern cell to these two 9s without crossing a 6.\n\n   Therefore:\n   - The compartment containing the pattern has **14** 9s.\n   - The separate top pocket has **2** 9s at (1,5) and (1,7).\n\n   By the rule inferred from the examples:\n\n   - 9s in the **same compartment as the pattern** are **active** (eligible to be removed and fed into the center).\n   - 9s in a **different enclosed compartment** are **protected**.\n\n   So in the test:\n   - **Active 9s** (in the pattern\u2019s compartment):  \n     (2,3), (2,11), (4,3), (4,11), (8,3), (8,11),  \n     (11,1), (11,2), (11,3), (11,5), (11,7), (11,9), (11,10), (11,11)  \u2192 14 cells.\n   - **Protected 9s** (separate pocket):  \n     (1,5), (1,7)  \u2192 2 cells.\n\n3. **Moving 9s into the central pattern**\n\n   - We remove all **active** 9s by turning them to 7.\n   - We have 14 removed 9s, but the central 3\u00d73 can hold at most 9 cells.\n   - So we place **9** 9s into the central pattern, in reading order, turning 3s first and then the 2 if needed:\n     - The pattern has 8 cells with color 3 and 1 cell with color 2.\n     - Since 9 \u2265 9, we turn **all nine** central cells to 9.\n   - Any remaining surplus removed 9s (14 \u2013 9 = 5) simply disappear (they were turned into 7 and not re\u2011used), which is allowed by the \u201cup to 9 maximum\u201d behavior.\n\n4. **Applying the changes**\n\n   Start from the test input and:\n\n   - Set the central 3\u00d73 (rows 5\u20137, cols 5\u20137) entirely to 9.\n   - Everywhere else, turn the **active** 9s to 7 and leave the **protected** 9s at (1,5) and (1,7) as 9.\n\n   Concretely:\n\n   - Row 1: two protected 9s at columns 5 and 7;

I need to take three example ARC grids, analyze the changes, and figure out the general rule to apply to a new one.  I'm seeing a pattern where certain \"maroon\" pixels, represented by the value 9, move to a specific \"target\" area in the grid, replacing existing colors.\n\n**Initial Observations**\n\nIn the examples, there's always a background color (7), a \"frame\" color (6), and this 3x3 square in the middle, initially green (3) with a red (2) dot.  I noticed that maroon (9) pixels are scattered around the grid, and the output shows the central 3x3 block changing, sometimes completely, sometimes only partially, and the 9s from outside filling it up.\n\n**Key Rule: Connecting and Counting**\n\nThe critical breakthrough is that *only* those maroon (9) pixels that are \"connected\" to the central 3x3 target area (the box of 3s with a 2 in the middle) are the ones that move.  Here's how this \"connected\" idea works:  A pixel is considered reachable if it's connected to the target without going through any magenta-colored (6) pixels. We must \"walk\" only on pixels with values: 9, 3, 2, or 7. I found that I needed to use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to identify all walkable 9s. Then, those reachable pixels are pulled, or \"sucked\", into the central area. The rule is that the *closest* 9s get to come.\n\n**Details: Filling and the Filling Order**\n\nAfter doing some careful counting, I realized the fill count matters.  We count how many reachable 9s we have. Then, the number of 9s we use is limited by a capacity which equals the number of pixels in the 3x3 target region. The 9s \"fill\" the target, and we can only use pixels if a path can be constructed to them. Then, we fill up our grid. If there are extra, unused 9s, then the grid is filled to full. The filling is from left-to-right, then top-to-bottom (row-major order).\n\n**Implementation**\n\nTo solve this, I'll:\n\n1.  **Identify the Target:** Find the 3x3 block and list it's pixels.\n2.  **Define Walkable Paths:** Identify all pixels that can be walked on (7, 3, 2, 9).\n3.  **Perform BFS:** Use BFS to determine which maroon pixels are \"connected\" to the target.\n4.  **Calculate Distance:** Find the distances (in terms of path-length from target to source) from the reachable 9s to the Target.\n5.  **Prioritize:** Prioritize those pixels closest to the target.\n6.  **Fill and Replace:** Convert the closest 9s to 7, and replace pixels in the Target with 9s following row-major scanline order.\n\nThis should allow me to accurately determine the correct output grid for the test case.\n\n\nThe goal of this task is to fill the central 3x3 structure (originally green/3 and red/2) with maroon (9) pixels collected from the surrounding grid. The central structure acts as a \"target\" that pulls in the nearest accessible maroon pixels.\n\n**Rules inferred from examples:**\n1.  **Identify the Target:** The target is the 3x3 square structure in the center of the grid, consisting of green (3) pixels with a red (2) pixel in the center.\n2.  **Determine Accessibility:** Maroon (9) pixels can only be moved to the target if they are connected to it by a path of non-wall pixels. The walls are magenta (6). If a maroon pixel is inside a sealed area formed by magenta walls and the grid edges, it cannot be moved.\n3.  **Find Nearest Sources:** Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the target pixels to find all reachable maroon (9) pixels. Calculate the path distance from the target to each reachable maroon pixel.\n4.  **Select Sources:** The target has a capacity of 9 pixels. Select the up to 9 closest reachable maroon pixels. If there is a tie in distance, select based on reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).\n5.  **Apply Transformation:**\n    *   Change the selected reachable maroon (9) pixels in the grid to background (7).\n    *   Change all 9 pixels in the target 3x3 area to maroon (9).\n    *   Any maroon pixels that were not selected (either because they are unreachable/sealed or because they were too far and the target was full) remain as 9.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Target:** The 3x3 area is at rows 4-6, columns 4-6.\n2.  **Connectivity Analysis:**\n    *   The target is enclosed by magenta (6) walls but has two openings: one at the top via `(3,5)` leading to Row 2, and one at the bottom via `(7,6)` leading to the bottom area.\n    *   **Sealed:** The 9s at `(0,4)` and `(0,6)` are enclosed by walls and grid edges with no opening.

Every other colour (7,\u202f3,\u202f2,\u202f9) is passable.\n- Starting from the centre cell (the 2), compute which 9s are reachable by a 4\u2011connected path that never crosses a 6.

For each taken 9, place a 9 into the next block cell in row\u2011major order; set the original 9 cell to 7.

The task seems to involve transforming a grid where maroon (9) pixels are scattered around, but the core mechanic revolves around a central \"Green Box,\" a 3x3 square composed primarily of green (3) pixels, with a red (2) pixel in the center. Let's break this down.\n\n**Initial Analysis and the \"Magenta Frame\"**\n\nWe've got an orange background (7), and the green box. My first instinct is that there's some kind of rule about collecting the maroon pixels and putting them in the box. Now, the key seems to be the magenta (6) pixels. These form \"rooms\" or enclosures and it looks like a sort of capture mechanism.\n\n**Discovering the Algorithm**\n\nI realized the basic idea is a flood-fill from the green box, moving through any pixels that aren't magenta. Once all reachable maroons are found (within the 3x3 box limit), we count them. That count tells us how many pixels in the Green Box we'll overwrite. If we have 5 maroon pixels, we take the 5.  This explains why the center (the red 2) doesn't always become a maroon.\n\n**Applying the Rules to the Test Input**\n\n1. Locate the Green Box in the test input. It's Rows 4-6, Columns 4-6.\n\n2.  Next, look for any magenta pixels creating walls.\n\n3.  The algorithm then collects any maroon pixels that can be reached from the Green Box without going through a wall.\n\n4.  Calculate the distances to all the valid maroons (BFS).\n\n5.  Here's where it gets interesting: you're capped by the number of box pixels. If there are 12 maroon pixels, but you only have a 3x3 box, you only take the first 9 pixels!\n\n6. Remove from the Grid these pixels, set to the background (7).\n\n7. Then, fill the green box with these maroons in order.\n\n**Applying this to the Input**\n\nWe've located the Box and we have the reachability. Now, let's look at the example input.\n\nWe need to calculate the distance of each 9 and start collecting based on path length and box constraints. We calculate each distance from the Green Box. And at last, we start moving. We will collect only a certain number of pixels, per the above.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the grid by moving \"noise\" pixels (maroon, 9) into a specific \"container\" object (a green box with a red center). Based on the examples, the transformation follows these rules:\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Container:** Locate the 3x3 box composed of green (3) pixels with a central red (2) pixel.\n2.  **Determine Reachability:** Identify all maroon (9) pixels in the grid that are \"reachable\" from this green box. Movement is allowed horizontally and vertically (4-way connectivity) through \"permeable\" pixels.\n    *   **Permeable pixels:** Background (7), Green (3), Red (2), and Maroon (9).\n    *   **Blocking pixels:** Magenta (6) acts as a wall.\n    *   The examples show that 9s inside closed magenta enclosures are not collected if the box cannot reach them. Conversely, if the box is in a magenta tube open at one end, 9s accessible from that opening are collected.\n3.  **Collect and Limit:** Calculate the number of reachable 9s. Let this number be $N$. The capacity of the 3x3 container is 9 pixels. We collect the reachable 9s, prioritizing those closest to the box (Breadth-First Search distance), up to a maximum of 9.\n4.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The collected 9s are removed from their original positions (replaced by the background color 7).\n    *   The 3x3 Green Box is filled with the collected 9s in reading order (row by row, left to right).\n    *   If $N < 9$, the remaining pixels in the box (3s and 2) stay as they are.\n    *   If $N \\ge 9$, the entire box becomes 9s (including the center). Any reachable 9s beyond the count of 9 remain in their original positions.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Green Box:** Located at Rows 4-6, Columns 4-6.\n2.  **Reachability Analysis:**\n    *   **Walls:** There is a magenta (6) structure.\n    *   **Exits:** The box has two openings: one at the top (Row 3, Col 5) and one at the bottom (Row 7, Col 6).\n    *   **Reachable 9s (BFS order approx):**\n        *   **Close (via R7C6):** (10,4), (10,6).\n        *   **Close (via R3C5):** (1,2), (3,2), (1,10), (3,10).\n        *   **Medium (via left/right paths):** (7,2), (7,10).\n        *   **Far (via extended left path):** (10,0).\n        *   **Further (remaining left cluster):** (10,1), (10,2).\n    *   **Unreachable 9s:**\n        *   (0,4), (0,6): Inside a closed top enclosure (Row 1 C3-7 is a solid wall).\n        *   (10,8), (10,9), (10,10): Inside a closed bottom-right pocket (isolated by walls at R7-9, C7-9).\n3.  **Collection (Max 9):**\n    *   We collect the closest 9 reachable 9s.\n    *   The set includes: (10,4), (10,6), (1,2), (3,2), (1,10), (3,10), (7,2), (7,10), (10,0).\n    *   Total Collected = 9.\n    *   Remaining reachable 9s (excess): (10,1), (10,2).\n4.  **Output Generation:**\n    *   **Fill Box:** The box (R4-6, C4-6) is completely filled with 9s.\n    *   **Clear Collected:** Change the collected 9s listed above to 7s.\n    *   **Preserve Others:** Keep unreachable 9s and excess reachable 9s as 9.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n*   Row 0: `7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7` (Unreachable 9s stay).\n*   Row 1: `7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7` (9s at C2, C10 removed).\n*   Row 2: `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7`\n*   Row 3: `6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7` (9s at C2, C10 removed).\n*   Row 4: `7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7` (Box filled).\n*   Row 5: `7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6` (Box filled).\n*   Row 6: `7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7` (Box filled).\n*   Row 7: `6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7` (9s at C2, C10 removed).\n*   Row 8: `7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7`\n*   Row 9: `7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6`\n*   Row 10: `7,9,9,6,7,7,7,6,9,9,9` (C0, C4, C6 removed.

The central 3\u00d73 \u201cplus\u201d region is always the *only* place where 3\u2019s and the single 2 appear.\n2. In the outputs, some of these 3/2 cells turn into 9\u2019s in a very specific order: always starting at the top-left corner of the 3\u00d73 block, then going left-to-right, top-to-bottom (\u201creading order\u201d).\n\nConcretely, label the 3\u00d73 plus bounding box relative to the grid as:\n\n- Top row:    (r\u2080, c\u2080), (r\u2080, c\u2080+1), (r\u2080, c\u2080+2)\n- Middle row: (r\u2080+1, c\u2080), (r\u2080+1, c\u2080+1), (r\u2080+1, c\u2080+2)\n- Bottom row: (r\u2080+2, c\u2080), (r\u2080+2, c\u2080+1), (r\u2080+2, c\u2080+2)\n\nThe examples show:\n\n- Example 1: 2 cells in this block become 9\u2019s: the first two in reading order \u2192 positions (r\u2080,c\u2080) and (r\u2080,c\u2080+1).\n- Example 2: all 9 cells in this block become 9\u2019s \u2192 full 3\u00d73 of 9\u2019s.\n- Example 3: 4 cells become 9\u2019s: the first four in reading order \u2192 (r\u2080,c\u2080), (r\u2080,c\u2080+1), (r\u2080,c\u2080+2), (r\u2080+1,c\u2080).\n\nSo:\n- The number of newly placed 9\u2019s inside the plus, call it `K`, varies between examples.\n- Once `K` is determined, **which** cells in the plus get 9\u2019s is always the same prefix order (reading order) of length `K`.\n\nDetermining `K` exactly from the three examples is nontrivial; multiple features of the 9-distribution change, and the training set is too small to pin down a unique robust rule. However, a simple, consistent way to construct a transformation is:\n\n- Erase all original 9\u2019s in the grid (turn them to 7).\n- Let `K = min(total_number_of_original_9s, 9)`.\n- In the 3\u00d73 plus bounding box, change the first `K` cells in reading order to color 9 (overwriting 3 or 2).\n- Leave all other non-9 colors (6,3,2,7) unchanged.\n\nThis rule:\n- Always preserves the recognizable 3\u00d73 central motif, now partially or fully filled with 9\u2019s.\n- Ensures that the number of placed 9\u2019s in/around the plus reflects the overall amount of original 9\u2019s (capped at 9).\n- Produces a deterministic output for the test case.\n\nApplying this to the **test**:\n\n1. Count 9\u2019s in the input:\n\n   Positions of 9\u2019s:\n   - Row 1: (1,5), (1,7)\n   - Row 2: (2,3), (2,11)\n   - Row 4: (4,3), (4,11)\n   - Row 8: (8,3), (8,11)\n   - Row 11: (11,1),(11,2),(11,3),(11,5),(11,7),(11,9),(11,10),(11,11)\n\n   Total = 16.\n\n   So `K = min(16, 9) = 9`.\n\n2. Identify the 3\u00d73 plus bounding box:\n\n   In the test, the plus has center `2` at row 6, col 6, with 3\u2019s around it:\n\n   - Rows 5\u20137, Cols 5\u20137:\n\n     ```\n     r5: c5,c6,c7 = 3,3,3\n     r6: c5,c6,c7 = 3,2,3\n     r7: c5,c6,c7 = 3,3,3\n     ```\n\n   So the 3\u00d73 bounding box is rows 5\u20137, columns 5\u20137.\n\n3.

In all three training examples there is a central 3\u00d73 \u201cgreen\u201d square made of color `3` with a single `2` in its center.  \n   The rest of the grid is filled mainly with background color `7`, plus some magenta `6` tiles (a maze / frame) and several dark\u2011red `9` tiles.\n\n2. Between each input\u2013output pair the following always happens:\n   * The magenta `6` structure and the orange `7` background are unchanged.\n   * Some of the dark\u2011red `9` tiles disappear from their original places.\n   * An equal number of `9` tiles appear inside the 3\u00d73 green square, replacing `3`\u2019s (and, if necessary, the central `2`).  \n   * Within the 3\u00d73 square, the added `9`\u2019s always fill from the top\u2011left, going row by row:\n     - Cell order:  \n       (row, col) = (r5,c5), (r5,c6), (r5,c7), (r6,c5), (r6,c6), (r6,c7), (r7,c5), (r7,c6), (r7,c7).\n     - First the `3` cells are changed to `9`; if more `9`\u2019s must be placed after all eight `3` cells are used, the center `2` is then changed to `9` (this occurs in Example 2).\n\n3. Intuitively, the task is: \u201ccollect movable `9` tiles from the scene and pack them into the green 3\u00d73 square, starting at its top\u2011left, while leaving the magenta maze unchanged.\u201d\n\n4. For the test grid, there is no obvious special off\u2011limits cluster of `9`\u2019s (unlike the clearer top\u2011right clusters in some examples).  \n   I therefore take all `9` cells as movable:\n   * Remove every `9` in the grid (turn it to `7`).\n   * There are 16 such cells; the 3\u00d73 square can hold at most 9.\n   * Refill the 3\u00d73 square in row\u2011major order with `9`\u2019s until either we run out of `9`\u2019s or we fill all 9 positions.\n   * Since 16 \u2265 9, the entire 3\u00d73 square (including the center) becomes `9`.\n\n5. Applying this to the test input:\n\n   - First clear all `9`\u2019s to `7`.\n   - Then set rows 5\u20137, columns 5\u20137 to `9`.\n\nThe magenta `6` structure and all other colors remain unchanged.\n\n---\n\n**Resulting output grid**\n\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7  \n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7  \n7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6  \n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7  \n6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7  \n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7  \n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6  \n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      6,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,7\n      7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n      7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6\n      7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n      6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7\n      7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n      7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n      7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"5\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_3_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Example 1**: There's a 3x3 kernel (3s with 2 in center) inside a 6-bordered region.

what I reconstruct here is the **simplest rule that matches the \u201ccavity filling\u201d behavior** in the examples and that I can consistently apply to the test.\n\n---\n\n## Reasoning and reconstructed rule\n\nFrom the three examples:\n\n- Color `9` = agents.\n- Color `6` = \u201cmagenta\u201d structural walls.\n- Colors `3` and `2` = parts of the central target structure (a 3\u00d73 block shaped `3,3,3 / 3,2,3 / 3,3,3`).\n- Color `7` = background, unchanged except where agents leave.\n\nAcross all examples:\n\n- The **only non\u2011wall structure that ever changes color** (aside from agents vanishing) is the **3\u00d73 block around the center**:\n  - Example 1: only some of the `3`s turn into `9`s.\n  - Example 2: the entire 3\u00d73 (all `3`s and the central `2`) become `9`.\n  - Example 3: some of the `3`s in the top/left part become `9`.\n\n- Walls `6` and the background `7` are preserved.\n- No new `9`s appear anywhere except by **recoloring the central 3\u00d73 block**.\n- The examples suggest:\n  - If the target is effectively *inside a container* that agents can reach, the **entire cavity (the 3\u00d73 block) gets filled** with `9`.  \n    (Example 2)\n  - In more open situations, only *part* of that 3\u00d73 is filled, depending on how agents approach.  \n    (Examples 1 and 3)\n\nFor the **test input**, the central 3\u00d73 structure is again present:\n\nRows 5\u20137, columns 5\u20137 of the test input:\n\n- Row 5: `..., 6, 3, 3, 3, 6, ...`\n- Row 6: `..., 6, 3, 2, 3, 6, ...`\n- Row 7: `..., 6, 3, 3, 3, 6, ...`\n\nSo the central pattern is:\n\n- Row 5, col 5\u20137: `3 3 3`\n- Row 6, col 5\u20137: `3 2 3`\n- Row 7, col 5\u20137: `3 3 3`\n\nThe surrounding `6`s form a fairly solid frame; combined with the density and distribution of agents (`9`s) all around it, the most straightforward extension of the behavior seen in **Example 2** is:\n\n> The agents, via some accessible paths around the 6\u2011walls, **successfully reach the target inside the container**, so the **entire 3\u00d73 cavity is filled with 9**.\n\nUnder this reconstructed rule, for the test:\n\n- The **only transformation** I apply is:\n  - Inside that 3\u00d73 block (rows 5\u20137, cols 5\u20137), **every `3` and the central `2` become `9`**.\n- All other cells (including all `6`s, all background `7`s, and all existing agents `9`) are left unchanged.\n\nSo we take the test input and replace:\n\n- (5,5),(5,6),(5,7) : `3 \u2192 9`\n- (6,5),(6,6),(6,7) : `3,2,3 \u2192 9,9,9`\n- (7,5),(7,6),(7,7) : `3 \u2192 9`\n\nEverything else stays as in the input.\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\nApplying that to the test input yields:\n\nRow 1: `7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7`  \nRow 2: `7,7,9,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,9`  \nRow 3: `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7`  \nRow 4: `6,6,9,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,9`  \nRow 5: `7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7`  \nRow 6: `7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6`  \nRow 7: `7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7`  \nRow 8: `6,6,9,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,9`  \nRow 9: `7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7`  \nRow10: `7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6`  \nRow11: `9,9,9,6,9,7,9,6,9,9,9`\n\nSo the completed output grid is:\n\n```\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,9,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,9\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,9,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n6,6,9,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n9,9,9,6,9,7,9,6,9,9,9\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n      7,7,9,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,9\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      6,6,9,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,9\n      7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n      7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6\n      7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n      6,6,9,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,9\n      7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n      7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n      9,9,9,6,9,7,9,6,9,9,9\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"B\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-high_5_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,9,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,9\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,9,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n6,6,9,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n9,9,9,6,9,7,9,6,9,9,9\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n      7,7,9,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,9\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      6,6,9,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,9\n      7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n      7,6,6,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,6\n      7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n      6,6,9,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,9\n      7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n      7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n      9,9,9,6,9,7,9,6,9,9,9\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"18\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_6_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Reasoning and Final Answer for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, I've got the task: solve an ARC puzzle based on these three examples and apply the rule to a new input. Let's break this down. My goal is to figure out the transformation rule and apply it.\n\n**The Strategy:**\n\nFirst, I'll closely examine each example. I'm looking for patterns, especially how the input grid changes. I'll pay attention to the colors (7 is background, 6 is the wall, 9 are the pixels), the positions, and how they relate.  I'll test different hypotheses, like \"do the pixels move or are they part of a larger canvas?\".  I'll check for \"Line of Sight\", geometric symmetries, and how \"walls\" (6-pixels) influence the transformation. I will consider if the output is just an aggregation of the input. I will test a few heuristics (\"Gravity\",\"Projectile\") and then consider \"Gaps\" (like a door in the walls).\n\n**Example Analysis**\n\nLet's begin with example 1: This is 11x11 grid with orange background (7), magenta structures (6), a green box of 3's inside with a red pixel (2), plus some maroon (9) pixel distributed in the grid. The output is a modified grid, and it looks like the 3x3 green block got altered. It appears that the 9s from somewhere have moved into the green structure. My analysis leads me to a testable hypothesis where the 9s are \"projected\" or \"inverted\" across the central 2. I have to think about whether the 9 is really a \"target\" that disappears, and whether this transformation is due to gaps, or by looking at the input 9 and output positions relative to the center 2.\n\nIn example 2,  I try to apply the same strategies but I see different behavior. It has 9s everywhere. The initial center is filled with 9s too. This gives a simpler result. Perhaps it's just a matter of \"filling\" based on density.\n\n**Test Input application:**\n\nThe examples are the foundation to solve the test input. In this input, the center starts as 2, a 3x3 block, and there are many distributed pixels (9). It has walls (6) and has gaps in the wall too. My strategy will be to carefully analyze this test input structure, look for patterns from examples 1 and 2, and determine the central 3x3 grid changes and then apply it to the input. I hypothesize that with walls with gaps in place, those 9 pixels might project into those gaps, and the gaps will cause a change. I will create a rule to transform the input based on those examples.\nBased on the high density of 9s, the center area should become fully 9s or a ring of 9s around 2.\n\nAfter much trial and error, I found a decent rule!\n\n**The Transformation:**\n\n*   **The 3x3 block changes to (5-7, 5-7):**\n    *   Row 5: 9, 9, 9\n    *   Row 6: 9, 2, 9\n    *   Row 7: 9, 9, 9\n*   **Keep the rest of the grid the same.**\n\n**The Final Answer Grid (Test Input):**\n\n```\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,7,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,7\n6,6,9,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,9\n7,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,2,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,7,7,7\n6,6,9,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n```\n\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the transformation rule for an 11x11 grid containing a central 3x3 box (the \"core\") and various scattered pixels (color 9). The core is surrounded by a structure of \"walls\" (color 6), although in Example 3 the walls are absent. The core itself initially consists of 3s (green) with a 2 (red) in the center.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **The Core Transformation**: The primary change occurs in the 3x3 core (rows 5-7, columns 5-7). The digit 3s are replaced by 9s based on the configuration of 9s in the surrounding grid. The center pixel (6,6) is a 2; in Examples 1 and 3, it remains a 2. In Example 2, it becomes a 9.\n    *   *Observation*: In Example 2, there are 9s surrounding the core in a very dense pattern, including directly adjacent cells (e.g., (6,3)). In Examples 1 and 3, the 9s are sparser or blocked. The Test Input has a 2 in the center and no direct horizontal 9 neighbors in the middle row (Row 6), similar to Ex 1 and 3. Thus, the center will likely remain 2.\n\n2.  **Mapping Rule (Symmetry/Inversion)**:\n    *   In **Example 1**, 9s at the Southeast (9,8), (9,9) disappear, and marks appear at the Northwest of the core (5,5), (5,6). This suggests an inversion through the center: a source at $(r, c)$ paints the cell corresponding to $(-r, -c)$ relative to the center, provided there is a path or \"line of sight\".\n    *   In **Example 3**, 9s at the Northeast (2,10) cause a mark at the Northeast (5,7). 9s at the Northwest (3,3) cause a mark at the Northwest (5,5). 9s at the Southeast (10,9) cause a mark at the Northwest (5,5) [via inversion].\n    *   *Synthesis*: There are two mechanisms. One is direct mapping (seen in Ex 3 with NE->NE), and one is inverted mapping (SE->NW). The presence of walls (color 6) with gaps likely dictates which 9s can \"enter\" and how they impinge on the core.\n\n3.  **Application to Test Input**:\n    *   **Walls**: The test input has walls at Row 4 and Row 8.\n    *   **Gaps**: There is a gap in the top wall at (4,6) (North) and in the bottom wall at (8,7) (Southeast).\n    *   **Sources**: The grid is filled with 9s in the corners and specifically heavy concentrations at the bottom (Row 11) and top (Rows 1-2).\n    *   **North Gap (4,6)**: 9s from the North (e.g., (1,5)) can flow through this gap. Following the pattern where \"flow through a gap hits the opposite side\", North 9s hitting through a North gap will strike the South side of the box (Row 7). Thus, Row 7 becomes 9s.\n    *   **Southeast Gap (8,7)**: 9s from the Southeast (e.g., Row 11) flow through this gap. SE is opposite to NW. The \"stream\" enters from SE and hits the NW wall of the box. Thus, the Top-Left pixels (5,5) become 9s.\n    *   **Density Argument**: Unlike the sparse Example 1, the Test Input has 9s in all quadrants (NE, NW, SE, SW) and heavy bands at the top and bottom. In Example 2, which had a high density of 9s, the entire 3x3 ring became 9s. The Test Input's density suggests a saturation of the 3x3 target area. Specifically, the \"North\" gap allows painting the bottom row, and the \"South-East\" gap allows painting the top-left. The high density of surrounding 9s (including the diagonals) combined with the logic from Example 2 implies the remaining 3s in the ring will also be converted.\n    *   **Conclusion for the Core**: The 3x3 area will become a ring of 9s surrounding the central 2. (Row 5: 9,9,9; Row 6: 9,2,9; Row 7: 9,9,9).\n\n4.  **Handling Outside Pixels**:\n    *   In Example 1 and 3, \"source\" 9s disappeared. In Example 2, many outside 9s remained. The rule for disappearance is complex and inconsistent across examples (likely distance or obstruction-dependent). However, generally, the problem focuses on the *central transformation*. In Example 2, edge 9s remained. The Test Input has 9s at the very edges (Rows 1, 11). It is safest to assume the background structure (including the wall 9s and edge 9s) remains largely static unless they are clearly \"consumed\" projectiles. Given the ambiguity and the visual pattern of Ex 2 (where the environment persisted), I will retain the outer grid configuration exactly as is, only modifying the core.\n\n**Final Plan**:\nCopy the input grid.\nReplace the 3x3 center core (rows 5-7, cols 5-7) with:\n9, 9, 9\n9, 2, 9\n9, 9, 9\n\n**Output Grid Generation**:\nRows 1-4: Unchanged.\nRow 5: ...6, 9, 9, 9, 6...

I've got this ARC task to solve, and the user's given me some examples to figure out the rules. My initial impulse is to dive right in, but I see a prompt that looks like it's trying to get me to act like a specific AI persona (a \"neuro-symbolic logic engine\"). It seems like the user wants me to *simulate* internal thought processes before just spitting out the answer. I have to make sure to respond in the *correct format*. I'm also noticing some conflicting instructions in the prompt about whether to hide my reasoning or explain it \u2013 a bit of a head-scratcher!\n\nI decide it's best to prioritize the explicit instruction to explain my thinking, even if that means temporarily ignoring the \"no explanation\" part. I think the user is most likely interested in how I solve the problem.\n\nThe real challenge is understanding the core logic behind the task. It's a pattern recognition game. I carefully analyze the provided examples, looking for repeating patterns. In this particular task, the pattern seems to revolve around how the colored pixels (maroon 9s) interact with the central target shape (green 3s and red 2s). These 9s \"shoot\" and change the shape of that target by turning its parts to 9. The critical part is figuring out WHEN the 9s transform the target (not just any time). This is the key. The *persistence* of the 9s (do they disappear, or stay?) and the role of the frame (6s) in the logic seem important.\n\nSo, I start by looking at a specific example, and I figure that the 9s are acting like missiles that \"hit\" the central block and then change that block. I create a hypothesis around this \"shoot-and-paint\" logic, checking to see if a color moves to the target. Then, I look at the test input and try to apply this model to figure out where the 9s will go to, and how the pattern is completed. I look at each pixel to see if a shoot \"ray\" is made.\n\nThe biggest difficulty is determining under which conditions the \"missiles\" remain on the field or disappear (persist). The examples provide clues, but there are some contradictions. I have to think in all cases to ensure the pattern is correct.\n\nI examine the test input and use the logic to predict the new pixels.\nI double-check to make sure all elements of the problem (target pixels, \"shoots\" pixels) are covered, and I generate the output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to deduce a transformation rule from three examples and apply it to a test input.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:**\n    *   **Target Object:** A central 3x3 box containing Green (3) pixels surrounding a Red (2) center. In some examples (1 and 2), this box is enclosed in a Magenta (6) frame.\n    *   **Agents:** Maroon (9) pixels scattered around the grid.\n\n2.  **Transformation Logic (Ray Casting/Shooting):**\n    *   The Maroon (9) pixels act as \"shooters\" or sources of projectiles.\n    *   They emit rays in **cardinal and diagonal directions** (8 directions).\n    *   These rays travel through Background (7) and Frame (6) pixels.\n    *   When a ray intercepts a pixel of the **Target Object** (specifically the Green 3s), that pixel changes color to Maroon (9).\n    *   The Red (2) center can also be changed if hit (as seen in Example 2), but if no ray targets it directly, it remains Red.\n\n3.  **Verification with Examples:**\n    *   **Example 1:**\n        *   Source (3,3) shoots Diagonal Down-Right $\\rightarrow$ Hits (5,5). (5,5) becomes 9.\n        *   Source (3,4) shoots Diagonal Down-Right $\\rightarrow$ Hits (5,6). (5,6) becomes 9.\n        *   Other 9s (like 9,8) do not have a clear trajectory to a target 3/2 and thus cause no change to the box.\n    *   **Example 3 (No Frame):**\n        *   Source (3,3) shoots Diagonal Down-Right $\\rightarrow$ Hits (5,5).\n        *   Source (10,9) shoots Diagonal Up-Left $\\rightarrow$ Hits (6,5).\n        *   Source (2,10) shoots Diagonal Down-Left $\\rightarrow$ Hits (5,7).\n        *   Other changes (5,6) and (6,5) are accounted for by valid diagonal paths from the available 9s (e.g. 10,9 hits 6,5).\n        *   Pixels not hit (like the Red 2 at the center, or the 3 at 7,7 which was missed by 3,11) remain unchanged.\n\n4.  **Persistence of Sources:**\n    *   In the examples, some 9s disappear and some stay.\n    *   However, in the **Test Input**, the 9s are arranged in a highly symmetric and structural pattern, interlocked with the Magenta (6) frame (e.g., Row 1, Row 11). This suggests they are part of the permanent structure, similar to the persisting 9s in Example 1 (which were inside the frame) and Example 2 (which were a block). We will assume the source 9s in the Test Input persist.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Target Box:** Rows 5-7, Cols 5-7. Center at (6,6).\n    *   Grid:\n        3 3 3\n        3 2 3\n        3 3 3\n*   **Ray Tracing:**\n    *   (1,5) [Down] $\\rightarrow$ Hits (5,5).\n    *   (2,3) [Diag SE] $\\rightarrow$ Hits (5,6).\n    *   (1,7) [Down] $\\rightarrow$ Hits (5,7).\n    *   (4,3) [Diag SE] and (8,3) [Diag NE] $\\rightarrow$ Hit (6,5).\n    *   (2,11) [Diag SW] $\\rightarrow$ Hits (6,7).\n    *   (11,5) [Up] and (11,9) [Diag NW] $\\rightarrow$ Hit (7,5).\n    *   (11,2) [Diag NE] $\\rightarrow$ Hits (7,6).\n    *   (11,3) [Diag NE] and (11,7) [Up] $\\rightarrow$ Hit (7,7).\n*   **Result:** All surrounding Green (3) pixels are hit and turn into Maroon (9).\n*   **Center (6,6):** No 9 has a direct line of sight to the center (6,6). It remains Red (2).\n*   **Sources:** The sources remain in place as they are part of the frame structure.\n\n**Final Output Description:**\nThe central 3x3 area transforms from a Green box with a Red center to a Maroon box with a Red center. The surrounding grid remains identical to the input.\n\n```\n7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n7,7,9,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,9\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,9,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,9,2,9,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n6,6,9,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,9\n7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n9,9,9,6,9,7,9,6,9,9,9\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      7,7,7,6,9,7,9,6,7,7,7\n      7,7,9,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,9\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      6,6,9,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,9\n      7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n      7,6,6,6,9,2,9,6,7,6,6\n      7,7,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,7,7\n      6,6,9,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,9\n      7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7,7\n      7,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,7,6,6\n      9,9,9,6,9,7,9,6,9,9,9\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n</CANDIDATES>\n\n<INSTRUCTIONS>\nYou must behave as an AUDITOR, not a solver.\n\nYour overall goal:\n- For each candidate, choose a representative explanation and treat it as that\n  candidate's proposed rule.\n- Audit that rule against all training examples.\n- Check whether the candidate's predicted test OUTPUT_GRID actually follows\n  that rule.\n- Assign each candidate a score from 0 to 10 and rank all candidates.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\nSTEP 1 -- CHOOSE A REPRESENTATIVE RULE PER CANDIDATE\nFor each CANDIDATE:\n\n  1.

                "response": "**My Thinking on the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm diving into this ARC task, and it seems pretty straightforward at first glance, but there are a few nuances I need to really nail down.  We've got these 11x11 grids with a central 3x3 box, and the goal is to figure out the transformation rules.  It looks like we have to determine how the \"maroon\" pixels (value 9) behave in relation to this box, especially in light of the magenta frame (value 6) that sometimes shows up.\n\nThe first thing I did was study the example cases. I noticed that the 9s *within* the frame seemed to be the most active.  In the first example, only the 9s *inside* the frame and connected to the box changed, while those outside stayed put. This led me to suspect that \"connectivity\" was key \u2013 that pixels were \"reachable\" if there was a path of non-wall pixels to the central box. But then there were instances that didn't have a frame.\n\nExample 2 threw a curveball. Many pixels disappeared, and the box filled up completely. My initial hypothesis that the frame might be the primary selector began to waver, and I began to wonder if the total *count* of \"reachable\" 9s was what mattered, not just their location relative to a frame. \n\nExample 3, with no frame, really solidified this concept. The number of removed pixels, and the filling of the target box seemed to relate in some way to the number of 9s.  So I'm leaning toward the rule: count the reachable 9s. Remove them, and fill the central box to capacity, which is 9.  If there are more than 9 reachable 9s, then some will vanish.\n\nMy working hypothesis became this:\n1.  Identify \"Active\" or \"Reachable\" 9s, where \"reachable\" means connected to the box by a path of non-6 cells.\n2.  Count the reachable 9s, call this number N.\n3.  Remove those N reachable 9s.\n4.  Fill the box with min(N, 9) 9s, in row-major order.\n\nNow, I'm analyzing the provided test input.  I've got the box location, and I'm tracing the paths to see which 9s are \"reachable.\" I see that there are gaps in the walls so more 9s are reachable, and I've got to carefully determine if the 9s are enclosed or not. There appear to be at least 9 reachable 9s.\n\nI'm now evaluating the candidate solutions. Candidate 0 seemed the best fit based on my rule, it clearly understood the importance of connectivity, accounted for the \"fill-up-to-9\" rule, and got the key test cases right.  Candidate 1 has the right idea but contradicts Example 2 by not fully removing surplus 9s. Candidate 2 misses the isolated 9s in the test grid and removes them, contradicting Example 1, where 9s outside the frame did not move. It is clearly important to keep pixels that are disconnected. Other candidates had more fundamental flaws, like not removing any pixels at all.\n\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 9.5,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Correctly identifies that all 'connected' source pixels are removed (as seen in Ex 2) while 'isolated' pixels are preserved (as seen in Ex 1).\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Identify 9s connected to the central box.
