        "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Algorithm for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this ARC task, and it seems I need to figure out a pattern based on some solved examples and a test input. Let me break down my thought process, as if I'm explaining it to myself:\n\n**Initial Observations**\n\nFirst, I look at Example 1 and try to grasp the dimensions and overall structure. It appears that the input grid is divided into vertical sections. There are horizontal separators (rows of 1s). The goal is to transform the input into a smaller output.\n\n**Example 2 and the Emergence of Patterns**\n\nMoving onto Example 2, the separators become vertical. That prompts me to consider whether Example 1's horizontal separators are simply a consequence of a rotated view.  I notice that the output dimensions aren't directly linked to any specific input section or block. Example 2 reveals that we are dealing with two separate sections: patterns and blocks.  There are two \"pattern\" sections, which seem to act as a \"template\". Two color blocks/ fills which are the color components of the output. I'm starting to think we are creating a construction, but I need to define the logic behind it.\n\n**Hypothesis Formulation:  Pattern Substitution**\n\nMy hypothesis forms: the output is constructed by something similar to a pixel-wise combination of the blocks, where the on pixels of patterns are replaced by colors.   I'm testing the concept of using the pattern 4,3 or their runs, with their respective colors to try to reconstruct the output. However, the output dimension doesn't directly map to any pattern size or block size.\n\n**Refinement through Example 1**\n\nLooking back at Example 1, my theory is further refined. The output seems to involve colors from solid blocks, but the output size comes from somewhere else. I'm focusing on the number of each color/component, and also on the output, which seems to depend on the configuration of our patterns.  I have to look deeper to see how the blocks are configured in the input to be represented by the output.\n\n**Unraveling the Substitution**\n\nThe key is in the output pattern: it looks like a repeating segment where different colors appear. I hypothesize:\n-   Two pattern sections(P1 and P2)  and two color sections (C1 and C2).\n-   Each row of Output is constructed based on the corresponding rows from P1 and P2.\n- The output row is defined by interleaved runs of C1 and C2, based on the non-zero pixel configuration.\n- The lengths of C1 and C2 segments in each output row are determined by P1 and P2.\n\n**Test Input Application**\n\nI dive into the Test Input. First, I have to find which pixels are \"active\". Second,  I have to extract the \"run lengths\" of non-zero segments from both the  patterns P1 and P2, for each row.  Third, I will alternate or interleave these lengths to determine the sequence in each row.\n\n**The Output Construction**\n\nI then apply the interleave to create each row:\n- C1 and C2 represent the colors based on P1 and P2.\n- Extract sequences from P1 (active positions of 4, or 3) and P2 (also their configuration)\n- The pattern in Output is a repetition with a predefined length.\n\nI apply this to a series of example tests. I start looking into the pattern of C1 and C2 in the generated Output. I'm focused on seeing if the width is consistent.  As an example, if the input is 4400, then the sequence in Output depends on how 4 and 0 are paired.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nThe algorithm is clearly constructed. I can define the final steps:\n1.  Identify the sections, the patterns, and the fills.\n2.  Extract, for each row: Runs of pixels for P1 (L1) and P2 (L2).\n3.  Interleave: The Output row is the interleave with a predefined width (L1[0] or L2[0] as needed).\n\nThe output is always based on the width of P2.\nI'm confident in this approach.\n\n\nThe task requires inferring a transformation rule from four solved examples and applying it to a test input.\n\n**Analysis of the Rules:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grid is composed of several sections separated by lines (rows or columns) of `1`s.\n    *   **Pattern 1 (P1):** A block containing a shape drawn with a specific color (e.g., `4`).\n    *   **Pattern 2 (P2):** A block containing a shape drawn with a specific color (e.g., `3`).\n    *   **Color Block 1 (C1):** A solid block of a specific color (e.g., `2` or `5`). This determines the \"primary\" color in the output.\n    *   **Color Block 2 (C2):** A solid block of a different color (e.g., `8` or `9`). This determines the \"secondary\" color in the output.\n\n2.  **Transformation Logic:**\n    *   The output grid is constructed row by row, corresponding to the non-empty rows of the pattern blocks P1 and P2.\n    *   For each row, we extract the **run lengths** of the non-zero pixels.\n        *   Let `L1` be the list of run lengths from the current row of P1.\n        *   Let `L2` be the list of run lengths from the current row of P2.\n    *   The output row is generated by **interleaving** these lengths and assigning colors:\n        *   Segments corresponding to lengths from `L1` are filled with the color from **C1**.\n        *   Segments corresponding to lengths from `L2` are filled with the color from **C2**.\n    *   If `L2` is empty for a row (no non-zero pixels in P2), it implies single-pixel gaps (length 1) of C2 between the C1 segments.\n    *   The sequence repeats or fills to match a target width (which appears to be the width of the pattern P2, which is 7 in the test case).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **P1 (Pattern 1):** Drawn with `4`s. Width 6.\n*   **P2 (Pattern 2):** Drawn with `3`s. Width 7.\n*   **C1 (Color 1):** Solid block of `5`s. Output Color: **5**.\n*   **C2 (Color 2):** Solid block of `2`s. Output Color: **2**.\n\nProcessing the non-empty rows (lines 1-5 of input):\n\n*   **Row 1:**\n    *   P1: `0,4,4,0,4,0` -> Runs: `[2, 1]`\n    *   P2: `0,3,3,0,3,3,0` -> Runs: `[2, 2]`\n    *   Sequence: `2` (from P1), `2` (from P2), `1` (from P1), `2` (from P2).\n    *   Colors: `5,5` (C1), `2,2` (C2), `5` (C1), `2,2` (C2).\n    *   Result: `5,5,2,2,5,2,2`\n\n*   **Row 2:**\n    *   P1: `0,0,4,0,4,0` -> Runs: `[1, 1]`\n    *   P2: `0,0,0,0,0,0,0` -> Runs: `[]`\n    *   Sequence: Interleave `1` (from P1) with default `1` (gap).\n    *   Colors: `5`, `2`, `5`, `2`, `5`, `2`, `5`.\n    *   Result: `5,2,5,2,5,2,5`\n\n*   **Row 3:**\n    *   P1: `0,0,4,4,4,0` -> Runs: `[3]`\n    *   P2: `0,3,3,0,3,3,0` -> Runs: `[2, 2]`\n    *   Sequence: `3` (from P1), `2` (from P2), `2` (remaining space/next L2).\n    *   Colors: `5,5,5`, `2,2`, `5,5` (Filling remaining width 7 with C1).\n    *   Result: `5,5,5,2,2,5,5`\n\n*   **Row 4:** Same as Row 2.\n    *   Result: `5,2,5,2,5,2,5`\n\n*   **Row 5:** Same as Row 1.\n    *   Result: `5,5,2,2,5,2,2`\n\n**Final Output Grid:**\n5,5,2,2,5,2,2\n5,2,5,2,5,2,5\n5,5,5,2,2,5,5\n5,2,5,2,5,2,5\n5,5,2,2,5,2,2",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**My approach to these ARC tasks is to break down the input grids into their components and find the logic that connects them to the output.**  I noticed a consistent structure: the input is divided into four rectangular sections separated by lines or columns of \"1\"s (blue in the example). I'm treating these as four distinct regions, which I've labeled R1, R2, R3, and R4.\n\nThe initial hunch was that R1 and R2 contained pattern instructions and R3 and R4 contained the colors used to construct the output.  R1 and R2, within these first two regions, are usually not filled with one specific colour; instead, they have more complex patterns like shapes or masks. I initially thought these patterns acted as binary masks or coordinates, guiding a tiling process. Analyzing the dimensions, it seems the width is determined by R2 while the height is determined by R1. However, this didn't quite work.\n\nThe first few examples seemed to confirm this hypothesis, but other examples revealed inconsistencies when the dimension and colours didn't match. I thought R1 and R2 are encoding a sequence. So, I switched the idea to look at the intersection between the contents in R1 and R2. Each output cell can be a composition of two values, as these patterns are overlaying.\n\nThe output construction is row-by-row. I'm examining examples and patterns, and my \"Aha!\" moment came when I realized R1 and R2 define how blocks of the solid colors are generated. Let me try. The pattern in R1 dictates the length of Color A, and the pattern in R2 dictates the length of Color B. I can express an output as blocks separated into A and B colours.\n\nI started to view the problem as a \"tile expansion\" or \"convolution\" where the patterns dictate both the tiling and output block contents. To further test this idea, I am building the output row-by-row, by identifying Pattern 1 and Pattern 2 from each R1 and R2's row respectively. Pattern 1 $T$ comes from R1 row content. Pattern 2 $M$ comes from R2 row content. The R1 becomes the $B_{active}$. Now, the R2 determines how $B_{active}$ and $B_{inactive}$ are stitched together. But it turns out, the \"gap\" in output can be a single pixel or a multi-pixel \"gap\". Thus, I needed a way to control the \"scale\", namely, \"width\" and \"offset\" when \"placing\" the Pattern.\n\nThe test input is where I believe the final realization crystallized, in understanding there are R1 and R2, and in some situations, these can determine output width. In this test input, the mapping is linear with a constant offset. It turns out the correct solution is the $y = 2x + \\text{offset}$ formula to map R2 rows to the correct indices in a pattern row.\n\nSo, in the end, it's a tile that is controlled by the values in R1 and R2.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a test input grid based on the logic inferred from four examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Task:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids are divided into four distinct sections separated by lines of `1`s.\n    *   **Section 1 (R1):** A grid containing a pattern of `4`s on a background of `0`s. This defines the **vertical pattern** or \"Tile Content\".\n    *   **Section 2 (R2):** A grid containing a pattern of `3`s on a background of `0`s. This defines the **horizontal layout** or \"Tile Positions\".\n    *   **Section 3 (R3):** A solid block of a specific color. This defines the **Primary Color (A)** for the output (replacing `4`s).\n    *   **Section 4 (R4):** A solid block of another color. This defines the **Secondary/Background Color (B)** for the output (replacing `0`s).\n\n2.  **Output Construction Logic:**\n    *   The output grid is constructed row by row, corresponding to the active rows of the input patterns.\n    *   For each active row $i$:\n        1.  **Create the Tile Pattern ($P$):** Take the $i$-th row of **R1**. Map all `4`s to Color A and all `0`s to Color B. Let the width of this pattern be $W$.\n        2.  **Determine Placement Positions:** Look at the $i$-th row of **R2**. Identify the column indices $x$ where the cell value is `3`.\n        3.  **Calculate Start Coordinates:** For each active index $x$ in R2, the Tile Pattern $P$ is placed in the output row starting at position $S_x = 2x - 3$.\n            *   *Note:* This formula ($2x - 3$) is derived from analyzing the examples (e.g., Example 2 and 4), ensuring the overlap and spacing matches the solved cases.\n        4.  **Compose the Output Row:** Initialize the output row with Color B. Place the pattern $P$ at each calculated start position. Where patterns overlap, the Primary Color (A) takes precedence over the Secondary Color (B) (i.e., perform a MAX operation or overwrite B with A).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Parameters:**\n    *   **Color A (from R3):** 5\n    *   **Color B (from R4):** 2\n    *   **R1 Width:** 6\n    *   **R2 Width:** 7\n    *   **Active Indices in R2:** The R2 pattern is `0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0` for all active rows. The indices with `3` are **1, 2, 4, 5**.\n    *   **Start Positions ($2x - 3$):**\n        *   $x=1 \\rightarrow -1$\n        *   $x=2 \\rightarrow 1$\n        *   $x=4 \\rightarrow 5$\n        *   $x=5 \\rightarrow 7$\n    *   **Valid Output Indices:** The union of placed patterns (spanning indices -1 to 12) results in an output width of **13** (indices 0 to 12).\n\n*   **Row Processing:**\n\n    *   **Row 1:** R1 is `0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0`.\n        *   Pattern $P$: `2, 5, 5, 2, 5, 2`.\n        *   Placements:\n            *   At -1: `2, 5, 5, 2, 5, 2` (Visible indices 0-4: `5, 5, 2, 5, 2`)\n            *   At 1: `2, 5, 5, 2, 5, 2` (Visible indices 1-6)\n            *   At 5: `2, 5, 5, 2, 5, 2` (Visible indices 5-10)\n            *   At 7: `2, 5, 5, 2, 5, 2` (Visible indices 7-12)\n        *   **Composition:**\n            *   Idx 0: 5 (from pos -1)\n            *   Idx 1: max(5, 2) = 5\n            *   Idx 2: max(2, 5) = 5\n            *   Idx 3: max(5, 5) = 5\n            *   Idx 4: max(2, 2) = 2\n            *   Idx 5: max(2, 2) = 5 (Wait, Block at 1 ends at 6 with '2'.

The pattern from Section 1 is repeated horizontally based on the count of 3s in Section 2\n2. Number of horizontal copies = max 3s in any row = 4\n3. Separators between copies = copies - 1 = 3\n4. Color mapping: 4\u21925 (Section 3), 0\u21922 (Section 4)\n5. Separator color uses the \"0-replacement\" color = 2\n\n**Building the output:**\n\nPattern with colors applied:\n```\n5,5,2,5\n2,5,2,5\n2,5,5,5\n2,5,2,5\n5,5,2,5\n```\n\nOutput dimensions: 5 rows \u00d7 (4\u00d74 + 3\u00d71) = 5 rows \u00d7 19 columns\n\nEach row consists of: pattern, sep(2), pattern, sep(2), pattern, sep(2), pattern\n\n```\n5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5\n2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5\n2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5\n2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5\n5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "The transformation is the same in all four examples and in the test:\n\n1. **Find the separators and segments**\n\n   - Look for lines made entirely of color `1`.\n   - If they are vertical columns (as in examples 2\u20134 and the test), they split the grid into four vertical segments:\n     - **A**: left of the first `1` column \u2013 contains a shape of color `4` on `0` background.\n     - **B**: between the first and second `1` \u2013 contains some number of `3` pixels.\n     - **C**: between the second and third `1` \u2013 a solid rectangle of some color `C`.\n     - **D**: to the right of the third `1` \u2013 a solid rectangle of some color `D`.\n   - If the separators are horizontal rows of 1\u2019s (example 1), the same four segments are stacked vertically, and the final tiling is vertical instead of horizontal.\n\n   In the **test input**, the separators are vertical (columns 6, 14, 23), so we are in the horizontal case.\n\n2. **Build the tile from the 4\u2011shape and colors C, D**\n\n   - In segment **A**, find all cells with color `4` and take their minimal bounding box.\n   - Let this bounding box have height `H` and width `W`.\n   - Create a tile `P` of size `H\u00d7W`:\n     - Wherever the bounding box has `4` \u2192 put color `C` (the color of the big solid block).\n     - Wherever the bounding box has `0` \u2192 put color `D` (the color of the rightmost block).\n\n   This rule reproduces all the tiles in examples 2\u20134 (and, rotated, example 1).\n\n   For the **test input**:\n\n   - Segment A is columns 0\u20135. The 4\u2019s there form:\n\n     ```\n     rows 1\u20135, cols 1\u20134:\n     [4,4,0,4]\n     [0,4,0,4]\n     [0,4,4,4]\n     [0,4,0,4]\n     [4,4,0,4]\n     ```\n\n     So the bounding box has `H = 5` rows and `W = 4` columns.\n\n   - Segment C (columns 15\u201322) is solid color `5`, so `C = 5`.\n   - Segment D (columns 24\u201328) is solid color `2`, so `D = 2`.\n\n   Map `4 \u2192 5`, `0 \u2192 2` inside the bounding box:\n\n   Tile `P` (5\u00d74) is:\n\n   - Row 0: `[5,5,2,5]`   (from `[4,4,0,4]`)\n   - Row 1: `[2,5,2,5]`   (from `[0,4,0,4]`)\n   - Row 2: `[2,5,5,5]`   (from `[0,4,4,4]`)\n   - Row 3: `[2,5,2,5]`\n   - Row 4: `[5,5,2,5]`\n\n3. **Decide how many times to repeat the tile (K)**\n\n   - In segment **B** (between first and second `1`), count the number of cells with color `3`.\n   - In all examples, the number of repetitions `K` equals half this count:\n     \n     \\[\n     K = \\frac{\\text{# of 3-pixels in B}}{2}\n     \\]\n\n   - The examples show that this is always an integer and matches the produced outputs (e.g. 6\u21923, 8\u21924, 4\u21922, 4\u21922, etc.).\n\n   For the **test input**, segment B is columns 7\u201313:\n\n   - Rows 1, 3, 5 each have `3` at columns 8, 9, 11, 12: 4 cells per such row.\n   - So total `3` pixels: `n3 = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12`.\n   - Thus `K = 12 / 2 = 6`.\n\n4. **Assemble the final output**\n\n   - We are in the horizontal case (vertical separators), so we tile horizontally.\n   - The output has height `H` (same as the tile) and width:\n     \n     \\[\n     W_\\text{out} = K \\cdot W + (K - 1)\n     \\]\n     \n     because we insert a single-column separator of color `D` between each pair of tiles.\n\n   - A separator column is just a column of height `H` filled with color `D`.\n\n   For the **test**:\n\n   - Tile size: `H = 5`, `W = 4`.\n   - `K = 6`.\n   - `W_out = 6\u00b74 + 5 = 29` columns.\n   - Separator column is `[2,2,2,2,2]^T`.\n\n   So horizontally:\n   - Row r of output = `P[r]`, then a `2`, then `P[r]`, then `2`, \u2026, six tiles with five separators.\n\n   Concretely, the rows are:\n\n   - Row 0: `5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5`\n   - Row 1: `2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5`\n   - Row 2: `2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5`\n   - Row 3: `2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5`\n   - Row 4: `5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5`\n\n---\n\n### Completed output grid\n\n5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5  \n2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5  \n2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5  \n2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5  \n5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5",

        "Full raw LLM response": "To tackle this ARC task I first looked for a consistent structure across the solved examples. In examples\u202f2\u20134 the inputs are divided by vertical columns of `1`s into four horizontal blocks. The third and fourth blocks are uniformly filled with single colors; these two colors are the only ones that appear in the corresponding output, so they serve as the \u201cpalette\u201d for the result. The first block contains a small shape on a `0` background, and the second block contains another pattern; in example\u202f1 the blocks are arranged vertically and the same relationship holds with roles of rows/columns swapped.\n\nFrom the examples a clear rule emerges:\n\n- Extract the bounding box of the non\u2011zero cells from block\u202f1 to get a binary mask. Map mask `1`s to the color of block\u202f3 and mask `0`s to the color of block\u202f4. This gives a row pattern of fixed width for each row of the mask.\n- Extract the bounding box of block\u202f2 and compute the maximum number of non\u2011zero cells in any row (or column if the blocks are stacked vertically). This maximum is the repetition count.\n- The output height is the height of block\u202f1\u2019s mask (or its width in the stacked case). The output width is `count * mask_width + (count\u22121)` (or the analogous height in the stacked case).\n- For each row of the block\u202f1 mask, repeat its mapped pattern `count` times horizontally, inserting a single cell of the block\u202f4 color between repeats. In the vertical case you build columns similarly.\n\nApplying this to the test input: the blocks are separated by vertical `1`s, so we use the horizontal form. Block\u202f3 is solid `5`s and block\u202f4 is solid `2`s, so those are the output colors. Block\u202f1\u2019s non\u2011zero bounding box spans rows\u202f2\u20136 and cols\u202f2\u20135, giving the mask:\n\n```\n[1,1,0,1]\n[0,1,0,1]\n[0,1,1,1]\n[0,1,0,1]\n[1,1,0,1]\n```\n\nMapped to colors (1\u21925, 0\u21922) this yields row patterns. Block\u202f2\u2019s bounding box rows have a maximum of 4 non\u2011zero cells, so each row pattern is repeated 4 times with a single `2` between repeats. This produces a 5\u00d719 output:\n\n5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5\n2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5\n2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,5\n2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5,2,2,5,2,5\n5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5,2,5,5,2,5",

        "Full raw LLM response": "To solve this kind of task you first have to understand the structure of the input. In all of the worked examples the grid is divided into four \u201cpanels\u201d by full lines of cells coloured `1`, either horizontal or vertical depending on the example. The first panel contains a small shape in some colour, the second panel is a distractor, and the third and fourth panels are solid blocks of a single colour; these two colours are what you use in the output.\n\nFrom the first panel you take the bounding box of the non\u2011zero cells and turn it into a binary mask\u202fA: 1 where the first panel has a coloured cell, 0 elsewhere. Let `h` and `w` be the height and width of this mask. If the panels are laid out horizontally (separated by vertical lines of `1`s), you build the output by repeating the rows of\u202fA horizontally `h` times; each repeat is separated by a single column of background colour. The output height is `h` (the height of\u202fA), and the output width is `w*h + (h\u22121)`. All 1s in\u202fA are coloured with the solid colour from the third panel, all 0s and the separator columns are coloured with the solid colour from the fourth panel. If the panels are stacked vertically you do the analogous thing in the vertical direction, repeating A downwards `w` times with background rows between repeats.\n\nFor the test case the separators are vertical, so we work horizontally. The first panel\u2019s bounding box is rows\u202f2\u20136, columns\u202f2\u20135, giving the mask\n```\n1 1 0 1\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1\n```\nso `h=5`, `w=4`. The third panel colour is `5` (foreground) and the fourth panel colour is `2` (background).

        "Full raw LLM response": "First I\u2019ll explain the rule inferred from the examples, then apply it to the test input, and finally give the output grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Structure of the inputs\n\nIn all examples (except for orientation in Example 1), the input grid is split vertically into four regions by full-height columns of color 1:\n\n- Region A (left): a shape made of color 4 on background 0.\n- Region B (next): a shape made of color 3 on background 0.\n- Region C (next): a solid rectangle of some color \\(P\\).\n- Region D (rightmost): a solid rectangle of some color \\(Q\\).\n\nOnly the colors from regions C and D appear in the output.\n\nFor the test input, columns with 1\u2019s are at 7, 15, and 24, so:\n\n- A: columns 1\u20136\n- B: columns 8\u201314\n- C: columns 16\u201323  \u2192 uniform color 5 (this will be \\(P\\))\n- D: columns 25\u201329 \u2192 uniform color 2 (this will be \\(Q\\))\n\nSo in the test:\n- \\(P = 5\\)\n- \\(Q = 2\\)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Which rows are used?\n\nWe only use rows that contain at least one non-zero cell in A or B.\n\nIn the test:\n\nSegment A (cols 1\u20136):\n\n- Row 1: 0,0,0,0,0,0          \u2192 no 4\u2019s\n- Row 2: 0,4,4,0,4,0          \u2192 has 4\u2019s\n- Row 3: 0,0,4,0,4,0          \u2192 has 4\u2019s\n- Row 4: 0,0,4,4,4,0          \u2192 has 4\u2019s\n- Row 5: 0,0,4,0,4,0          \u2192 has 4\u2019s\n- Row 6: 0,4,4,0,4,0          \u2192 has 4\u2019s\n- Row 7: 0,0,0,0,0,0          \u2192 none\n\nSegment B (cols 8\u201314):\n\n- Row 2: 0,3,3,0,3,3,0        \u2192 has 3\u2019s\n- Row 4: 0,3,3,0,3,3,0        \u2192 has 3\u2019s\n- Row 6: 0,3,3,0,3,3,0        \u2192 has 3\u2019s\n\nSo \u201cactive\u201d rows (A or B nonzero) are rows 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.  \nLet \\(K\\) be the number of active rows. Here \\(K = 5\\).\n\nIn all training examples with vertical separators:\n\n- Output height = \\(K\\).\n- Output width = \\(4K - 1\\).\n- Each output row is a repetition of a 4-cell \u201cmotif\u201d based on that row\u2019s pattern in A and B, repeated \\(K\\) times and with the last cell truncated (so width \\(4K - 1\\)).\n\nSo for the test:\n\n- Output height = 5\n- Output width = \\(4 \\times 5 - 1 = 19\\)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Row classification via A/B interaction\n\nFor each active row, we:\n\n1. Align A and B to the same local column index \\(j\\) from 1 to \\(W = \\max(\\text{width}(A), \\text{width}(B))\\).\n   - Here, A has width 6, B has width 7, so \\(W = 7\\).\n   - For A, columns beyond 6 are treated as 0; for B, beyond 7 as 0.\n\n2. For each \\(j\\in\\{1..W\\}\\), determine a **status**:\n   - `N`  if A[j] = 0 and B[j] = 0  \n   - `A`  if A[j] \u2260 0 and B[j] = 0  (only shape A)\n   - `B`  if A[j] = 0 and B[j] \u2260 0  (only shape B)\n   - `O`  if A[j] \u2260 0 and B[j] \u2260 0  (both present at that column)\n\n3. Form a sequence by scanning j from left to right and:\n   - skipping `N`,\n   - compressing consecutive identical statuses to a single symbol.\n   This compressed sequence is called `Elist`.\n\n4. Classify `Elist` into one of 5 **motif types**, which map to a 4-cell motif using only colors \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\):\n\n   Motif types (using P,Q):\n   - Type 1: `PPPQ` \u2192 [P, P, P, Q]\n   - Type 2: `QPQQ` \u2192 [Q, P, Q, Q]\n   - Type 3: `PPQQ` \u2192 [P, P, Q, Q]\n   - Type 4: `PQQQ` \u2192 [P, Q, Q, Q]\n   - Type 5: `PQPQ` \u2192 [P, Q, P, Q]\n\n   Decision rules (inferred from Examples 2\u20134):\n\n   - If `Elist[0] == 'B'` \u2192 Type 2 (`QPQQ`).\n   - Else if `Elist[0] == 'A'` \u2192 Type 1 (`PPPQ`).\n   - Else `Elist[0] == 'O'`:\n     - Let `anyA = ('A' in Elist)`, `anyB = ('B' in Elist)`.\n\n     - If not `anyA` and not `anyB` (only `O`s):\n       \u2192 Type 5 (`PQPQ`).\n\n     - Else if `len(Elist) >= 2` and `Elist[1] == 'B'`:\n       \u2192 Type 4 (`PQQQ`).\n\n     - Else if `anyA` and `anyB` (both appear, but second is not `B`):\n       - Let `idx_B` be index of first `'B'` in `Elist` (0-based).\n       - If `idx_B == 2` \u2192 Type 3 (`PPQQ`).\n       - Else (`idx_B > 2`) \u2192 Type 1 (`PPPQ`).\n\n     - Else (only `A` plus maybe `O`s):\n       \u2192 Type 1 (`PPPQ`).\n\nThis exactly reproduces the outputs in Examples 2\u20134.\n\n---\n\n## 4.
