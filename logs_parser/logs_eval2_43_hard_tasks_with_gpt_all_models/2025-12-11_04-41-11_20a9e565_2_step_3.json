        "Full raw LLM response": "**Reflecting on the ARC Task: From Initial Impressions to a Plausible Solution**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with these ARC tasks, and my goal is to distill the underlying logic. The challenge? Deciphering the relationships between these seemingly random grids. First, the most obvious: the inputs are huge, the outputs are minuscule. And that pesky gray color (5) appears in every input but *never* in the output. Intriguing. It's screaming \"selector\" or \"marker\" to me.\n\nI started dissecting Example 1. I saw these random blue, red, and yellow shapes, but then the gray pixels! They're forming a very specific shape near those other colored shapes. At first I thought, maybe it's just a bounding box. But why is the output red and it doesn't represent red from the bounding box or shape directly. I mean, the bounding box of those gray pixels is the size of the output. So I thought maybe the gray defines some sort of mask, a specific *region* to be copied. But then I saw that the red color (2) only occurs in the C shapes in the output, and I decided to look at the relation of those red pixels to those marked by the gray shapes. So the grey pixels aren't a direct mask. And also it's not simply a bounding box, the output doesn't seem to be a direct copy of the shapes.\n\nThen I moved to Example 2. There are more gray 5's! They're in two clusters this time. The output is tall and thin. The gray pixels are just marking the vertical span. I'm starting to think these 5's define the *size* of a target. Where does the content come from? This pattern of repeating colors... it's like the 5s are slicing out a part of the input. Maybe it's a window of some sort, a frame. What if the content is just a copy of some part of the main image. But why should those parts of the image be the same in this case? I wondered, is this another type of mirror?\n\nIn Example 3, the gray pixels are again markers (at the top and bottom). The output size matches the bounding box of the 5s again. The output is like the repeating units. This gives me a \"copy and fill\" idea. Let's see if this works.\n\nBack to the Test input, which is a bit more complex, with 3s and 2s and those annoying gray 5s again. The 5s are also split into two clusters. It really solidifies my theory: the 5s always define this target, where we have to generate the content.\n\nSo, here's the rule that seems to hold: The output grid is based on the *bounding box of the 5s*. The *content* of the output comes from *somewhere*. But the location of the pattern in the 5's is just a mask to select a specific part of the source object. So the test data suggests that those shapes, the 3s and 2s, should be extracted and somehow reflected into the area. It looks like it is mirroring the content across the empty area between the existing shapes and the 5-box. In other words, the output is a **vertical mirror** (or \"reflection\") of the source.\n\nNow, how does this mirror work? Is it a vertical flip? A translation? It must be some operation that uses the position of the 5s and other colors. It must create the output from the shapes. The position and form of those shapes can be used to reflect the content. In other words, for an input grid, for example 11221, if we do a reflection, that will be 12211, and that is a palindrome. Let's see how that applies to Test data. It seems the 5-box acts as an empty viewport, and we're reflecting part of a repeating pattern into it.\n\nI needed to test the horizontal and vertical mappings to see which makes sense. I see horizontal symmetry in the data, so it means it must copy content from the main input in a direct way. The 5s define the empty viewport. Then, the reflection is a simple scan of the content relative to that box and the shapes to reflect them inside.\n\nHere is the final approach:\n\n1.  **Define the output grid:** Its dimensions depend on the gray pixel's bounding box.\n2.  **Locate Source Row:** Take the Y coordinate from the gray's top boundary\n    *   Example: R13 in Test, and each row has repeating horizontal shapes. It will start from Row 13 in test input.\n3.  **For each output row:** Copy the corresponding source row into the target in a\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid into an output grid based on the logic inferred from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Output Size:** In all examples, the dimensions of the output grid correspond exactly to the bounding box of the gray pixels (color 5).\n    *   Example 1: The 5s occupy a 3x6 region. Output is 3x6.\n    *   Example 2: The 5s span from row 14 to 27 and columns 19 to 20. Output is 14x2.\n    *   Example 3: The 5s span from row 1 to 17 and columns 25 to 27. Output is 17x3.\n    *   **Rule:** Calculate the bounding box `(y_min, x_min)` to `(y_max, x_max)` of all pixels with color 5. The output grid has height `h = y_max - y_min + 1` and width `w = x_max - x_min + 1`.\n\n2.  **Output Content:** The content within the 5s' bounding box in the input is usually empty or just contains the markers. The actual pattern comes from elsewhere in the grid.\n    *   In Example 2 and 3, the output rows are populated by copying rows from the source pattern, but the order suggests a vertical reflection or mapping.\n    *   Example 2 (Box 14-27): Output Row 0 corresponds to Input Row 14. Output Row 1 to Input Row 13. Output Row `k` to Input Row `14 - k`. This is a reflection upwards starting from the top of the box. The pattern exists at row 14 and above.\n    *   Example 1 (Box 25-27): Output Row 0 corresponds to Input Row 27. Output Row 1 to Input Row 26. Output Row 2 to Input Row 25. This is an inversion of the box rows `27, 26, 25` mapped to `0, 1, 2`.\n    *   **Rule for Test Input:** The 5s appear in two clusters defining a box from Row 15 to Row 22 (height 8) and Column 6 to Column 22 (width 17). The source pattern (colors 2 and 3) is located *above* the box, ending at Row 13. There is a gap at Row 14.\n    *   Based on Example 2, the logic is to reflect the pattern into the box. Since the pattern is above the box, we reflect upwards.\n    *   The reflection starts from the first row of pattern above the gap.\n    *   Output Row 0 corresponds to Input Row 13.\n    *   Output Row 1 corresponds to Input Row 12.\n    *   ...\n    *   Output Row 7 corresponds to Input Row 6.\n    *   The columns are copied directly from the input using the column range `x_min` to `x_max`.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Bounding Box of 5s:**\n    *   Top: Row 15, Bottom: Row 22.\n    *   Left: Column 6, Right: Column 22.\n    *   Output Dimensions: 8 rows, 17 columns.\n*   **Mapping Rows:**\n    *   Row 0 <- Input Row 13\n    *   Row 1 <- Input Row 12\n    *   Row 2 <- Input Row 11\n    *   Row 3 <- Input Row 10\n    *   Row 4 <- Input Row 9\n    *   Row 5 <- Input Row 8\n    *   Row 6 <- Input Row 7\n    *   Row 7 <- Input Row 6\n*   **Extracting Pixels (Input Cols 6-22):**\n    *   Input Row 13 (`...3,0,2...`): `0,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,0`\n    *   Input Row 12 (`...3,3,3...`): `0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0`\n    *   Input Row 11 (`...2,0,3...`): `0,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,0`\n    *   Input Row 10 (`...2,2,2...`): `0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0`\n    *   Input Row 9  (`...3,0...`):   `0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n    *   Input Row 8  (`...3,3,3...`): `0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n    *   Input Row 7  (Empty):         `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n    *   Input Row 6  (`...3,0,2...`): `0,0,0,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0`\n\noutput:\n0,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,0\n0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0\n0,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**My approach to these ARC tasks is to break them down into smaller, manageable steps, leveraging my understanding of image processing and pattern recognition. I'll summarize my thought process here:**\n\n1.  **Initial Assessment**: I begin by analyzing the general characteristics of the input and output grids, looking for consistent elements like size, color ranges (0-9 with 0 usually being the background), and the presence of objects.\n2.  **Object Identification**: I try to identify the objects or shapes that are present in the input and output. I'm looking for repeated patterns, possible \"target\" shapes, and any elements that seem to act as indicators or selectors (like the markers or the width/height of the outputs relative to the width/height of objects).\n3.  **Example-Based Learning**: I meticulously analyze the provided examples, focusing on how the inputs are transformed into outputs. I examine each pixel, row by row and column by column, looking for correlations between the inputs and outputs.\n4.  **Marker Exploration**: I pay close attention to the significance of the markers (color 5) that appear in the examples. My goal is to understand how these markers define the crop/transform box and also how the markers relate to the target objects.\n5.  **Scaling and Width Analysis**: I try to decode how the output size relates to the structure of the input. I look for scaling factors or repetition of input pixel sequences to find the rule.\n6.  **Rule Formation**: Based on the analysis of these elements, I try to come up with a rule to transform the input into the output. I consider the possibility of row/column extraction, scaling, padding, or any form of pixel-level manipulation. I test various hypotheses (e.g., markers define a window, markers indicate an index, shape and marker relationship, etc.)\n7.  **Pattern Iteration**: I refine my hypotheses by reviewing the structure of the pattern and looking for repeating sequences or relationships.\n\nFor the Test Input:\n\n1.  **Box Determination**: From my example analysis, I know that the markers determine the crop window. For the test example, I calculate the height and width of the marker box which gives me the expected output dimensions.\n2.  **Target Source**: The location of the test markers allows me to find and \"target\" the correct object (strip) in the source image.\n3.  **Scaling/Repetition**: The source pixel sequence is then repeated with scaling based on the markers. I apply the identified scaling (horizontal x2) while making sure to preserve the pattern of the blocks.\n4.  **Construction**: Based on these identified steps, I'll generate the output grid. I am checking the width and height of all the intermediate image components as I go.\n5.  **Iteration and Verification**: I am constantly re-evaluating the current best model based on the examples and the test case. I look for any edge cases and inconsistencies to refine the rule. I verify the output at each step.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the pattern inferred from the solved examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1.  **Markers (Color 5):** In all examples, the grey pixels (color 5) act as markers defining a bounding box in the input grid.\n    *   **Example 1:** Markers define a box of size 3x6. The output is 3x6.\n    *   **Example 2:** Markers define a box of size 14x2. The output is 14x2.\n    *   **Example 3:** Markers define a box of size 17x3. The output is 17x3.\n    *   **Test Input:** Markers (at Rows 15-22, Cols 6-23) define a box of size 8x18. The output should be 8x18.\n\n2.  **Pattern Identification & Extrapolation:**\n    *   The grids contain repeating \"blocks\" of patterns or sequences of objects.\n    *   **Example 1:** There is a sequence of colored shapes (1, 2, 4, 1...). Based on the position of the markers relative to the sequence, the content \"under\" the markers corresponds to the shape of color 2. The output matches the shape of color 2, but scaled horizontally (width 3 -> width 6).\n    *   **Example 3:** There are vertical strips of patterns (7, 2, 3, 7, 2, 3...). The markers are positioned over a column where the \"7\" pattern would be. The output is a copy of that \"7\" pattern from the rows defined by the markers.\n    *   **General Rule:** The markers select a specific time/space slice of a repeating pattern. The content of the output is derived from the \"prototype\" block of that pattern found elsewhere in the grid, mapped row-by-row, and scaled horizontally to fit the marker width.\n\n3.  **Application to Test Input:**\n    *   **Pattern Block:** The input contains a repeating sequence of objects in the vertical direction.\n        *   **Block 1 (Rows 0-7):**\n            *   Rows 0-1: Center object (Yellow 3).\n            *   Row 2: Empty.\n            *   Rows 3-4: Center object (Red 2).\n            *   Rows 5-6: Side/Split objects (Yellow 3 and Red 2).\n            *   Row 7: Empty.\n        *   **Block 2 (Rows 8-15):** Starts with Center 3 again. The sequence seems to reset or cycle.\n    *   **Markers:** Located at Rows 15-22.\n        *   This corresponds to the start of a hypothetical **Block 3**.\n        *   Row 15 of Input aligns with the end of Block 2 / start of Block 3 (the empty row).\n        *   Row 16 aligns with the first row of the pattern (Center 3).\n        *   The marker height is 8, matching the block height of 8.\n    *   **Transformation:** We copy the content of **Block 1 (Rows 0-7)** into the output, corresponding to the rows relative to the start of the block.\n        *   Output Row 0 corresponds to the \"Empty\" phase (like Input Row 7 or 15).\n        *   Output Row 1 corresponds to the \"Center 3\" phase (like Input Row 0).\n        *   ...and so on.\n    *   **Scaling:**\n        *   The \"Content\" in Block 1 spans Columns 10-18 (Width 9).\n        *   The Marker Box spans Columns 6-23 (Width 18).\n        *   Width 9 -> Width 18 implies a **2x Horizontal Scaling**. Each pixel in the source row is duplicated horizontally.\n\n**Step-by-Step Construction:**\n\n*   **Mapping:**\n    *   Output Row 0 <= Source Row 7 (Empty).\n    *   Output Row 1 <= Source Row 0 (Center 3).\n    *   Output Row 2 <= Source Row 1 (Center 3, hollow).\n    *   Output Row 3 <= Source Row 2 (Empty).\n    *   Output Row 4 <= Source Row 3 (Center 2).\n    *   Output Row 5 <= Source Row 4 (Center 2, hollow).\n    *   Output Row 6 <= Source Row 5 (Side 3).\n    *   Output Row 7 <= Source Row 6 (Side 3 mixed).\n\n*   **Pixel Expansion (Source Cols 10-18 -> Output Cols 0-17):**\n    *   **Source Row 0:** `0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0` -> **Output Row 1:** `0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0`\n    *   **Source Row 1:** `0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0` -> **Output Row 2:** `0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0`\n    *   **Source Row 3:** `0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0` -> **Output Row 4:** `0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0`\n    *   **Source Row 4:** `0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0` -> **Output Row 5:** `0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0`\n    *   **Source Row 5:** `3,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3` -> **Output Row 6:** `3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3`\n    *   **Source Row 6:** `3,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,3` -> **Output Row 7:** `3,3,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,3,3`\n\n*   **Empty Rows:** Output Rows 0 and 3 are filled with 0s.\n\noutput:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,3,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,3,3",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Analyzing the 5-markers:**\nIn each example, there are two L-shaped groups of 5s that define the output dimensions:\n- First L (shaped like \u2310): marks one corner\n- Second L (shaped like \u231e): marks the opposite corner\n\nThe rectangle between these L-corners determines the output size.\n\n**Example 1:** L-corners at (26,19) and (28,24) \u2192 output is 3 rows \u00d7 6 cols\n**Example 2:** L-corners at (14,19) and (27,20) \u2192 output is 14 rows \u00d7 2 cols  \n**Example 3:** L-corners at (1,25) and (17,27) \u2192 output is 17 rows \u00d7 3 cols\n\n**For the test input:**\n- First L at rows 15-16, cols 6-7: `5,5` / `5,0`\n- Second L at rows 21-22, cols 21-22: `0,5` / `5,5`\n- Rectangle: (15,6) to (22,22)\n- Output dimensions: (22-15+1) \u00d7 (22-6+1) = **8 rows \u00d7 17 cols**\n\n**Determining the pattern content:**\nThe outputs use a base tile from the main pattern, extended to fill the output dimensions. In the test input, the base pattern uses color 3:\n```\n3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,3\n```\n\n**Extension rules:**\n- Uniform rows (all same color) extend by repeating that color\n- Frame rows (color at edges, 0s in middle) extend by keeping edges and expanding the middle\n- Vertical extension: repeat the 2-row tile pattern\n\nFor 17 columns:\n- Row type 1 (all 3s): 17 threes\n- Row type 2 (3,0,0,0,3): 3 at positions 0 and 16, zeros at positions 1-15\n\nRepeating this 2-row pattern 4 times gives 8 rows.\n\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n```",

The transformation is:\n   - Find the minimal rectangle that covers all cells with color `5`.  \n   - In the input, locate the rectangle of the same size that is directly adjacent to / aligned with that 5\u2011rectangle in the direction of the main colored pattern (above or to the side).  \n   - Copy that rectangle as the output (keeping its non\u2011zero colors as they are).\n\n   In Examples 1\u20133 this region carries the 2\u2011pattern, 9/8/4 column pattern, and 7\u2011pattern respectively, and those are exactly what appear in the outputs.\n\n---\n\n### Applying the rule to the test input\n\n1. **Find the bounding box of all 5\u2019s.**\n\n   The 5\u2019s occur at:\n   - Rows 15\u201316, columns 6\u20137 (left cluster),\n   - Rows 21\u201322, columns 21\u201322 (right cluster).\n\n   The minimal rectangle enclosing all of them spans:\n   - Rows 15 through 22 \u2192 **8 rows**,\n   - Columns 6 through 22 \u2192 **17 columns**.\n\n   So the output must be an **8\u00d717** grid.\n\n2. **Find the aligned pattern region to copy.**\n\n   Looking just above that 8\u00d717 area (same columns 6\u201322, rows 7\u201314), we get a compact block containing all the structured 2/3\u2011pattern; rows above that are mostly zero. That 8\u00d717 block is:\n\n   - Row 7 (r7): all zeros,\n   - Row 8 (r8): a horizontal bar of 3\u2019s,\n   - Row 9 (r9): 3\u2019s at the two ends,\n   - Row 10 (r10): solid 2/2/2 blocks,\n   - Row 11 (r11): interleaved 2\u2019s and 3\u2019s,\n   - Row 12 (r12): two 3\u2011blocks further left and right,\n   - Row 13 (r13): more sparse 3/2,\n   - Row 14 (r14): zeros again.\n\n   According to the inferred rule, this is the pattern we copy out as the output.\n\n---\n\n### Final output grid\n\nSo the output is exactly that 8\u00d717 region:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,2,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0\n0,0,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

What the \u201c5\u201d cells do\n\nAcross all three examples, color `5` never appears in the output.  \nInstead, all the `5` cells act as **markers**:\n\n- Take all cells of color `5`.\n- Compute their **bounding box** (min row, max row, min col, max col).\n- The dimensions of this box (height \u00d7 width) are exactly the dimensions of the output.\n\nCheck:\n\n- Example 1: 5\u2019s occupy rows 27\u201329 and columns 20\u201325 \u2192 box = 3\u00d76 \u2192 output = 3\u00d76.\n- Example 2: 5\u2019s in two clusters, together spanning rows 15\u201328 and cols 20\u201321 \u2192 14\u00d72 \u2192 output = 14\u00d72.\n- Example 3: 5\u2019s in two clusters: rows 2\u20133 & 17\u201318, cols 26\u201328 \u2192 box = rows 2\u201318 (17 rows), cols 26\u201328 (3 cols) \u2192 17\u00d73 \u2192 output = 17\u00d73.\n\nFor the **test** input:\n\n- 5\u2019s in top-left cluster: rows 16\u201317, cols 7\u20138.\n- 5\u2019s in bottom-right cluster: rows 22\u201323, cols 22\u201323.\n- Combined bounding box: rows 16\u201323, cols 7\u201323 \u2192 **8\u00d717**.\n\nSo the test output must be an 8-row by 17-column grid.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How the content is chosen (informal pattern)\n\nFrom the examples, once the output size is fixed by the `5`-box, the content is filled by extracting a patch of the **main colored pattern** (ignoring `5`s) that matches those dimensions:\n\n- In Example 2 (14\u00d72), the output is effectively a 2-column \u201csummary\u201d of each row\u2019s color structure to the left of the 5\u2019s; its size is exactly the 5-bounding box.\n- In Example 3 (17\u00d73), the chosen band is the narrow 3-column vertical strip where the principal pattern of `7`s lives, extended/tiled to match height 17.\n- In Example 1 (3\u00d76), the chosen region is the 3-row by 6-column \u201c\u0393-shaped\u201d segment of the main 1/2/4 pattern, but recolored to use a single color (`2`).\n\nThe consistent high-level behavior:\n\n1. The `5`s only determine **where** and **how big** the output should be.\n2. The **main colored motif** (non-5 colors near the center/top of the image) is what actually fills that box: a contiguous block of the global motif is selected that matches or can naturally be mapped into the 5-bounding size.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Applying this to the test input\n\n### 3.1. Main motif\n\nIn the test, the main non-zero colors are `2` and `3`, forming several symmetric cross-like motifs in the upper half of the grid (rows 1\u201314), centered horizontally around columns 11\u201319.\n\nThe 5\u2019s lie **below** this region and define the size 8\u00d717, but there is no further pattern around the 5\u2019s themselves (only 5\u2019s and zeros). So, as in the examples, we select an 8\u00d717 patch from the central 2/3 pattern above.\n\nA very natural 8\u00d717 block capturing the core of the repeating `2` / `3` pattern is:\n\n- Rows 4 through 11\n- Columns 7 through 23\n\nThis is an 8\u00d717 patch that:\n\n- Is fully inside the main 2/3 motif area.\n- Symmetrically includes the main 3-cross and 2-cross structures.\n- Matches the size dictated by the 5-bounding box.\n\nSo, following the pattern from the training tasks, we use this patch directly as the output.\n\n### 3.2. Extracting that patch\n\nFrom the given test input, rows 4\u201311, columns 7\u201323 are:\n\nRow 4 (r4, c7\u201323):\n- Original row 4: `...,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,...` centred at columns 13\u201317.\n- c7\u2013c23 slice:  \n  `0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 5 (r5, c7\u201323):\n- Original row 5: `...,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,...`\n- Slice:  \n  `0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 6 (r6, c7\u201323):\n- Original row 6: `...,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,...`\n- Slice:  \n  `0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 7 (r7, c7\u201323):\n- Original row 7: `...,3,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,...`\n- Slice:  \n  `0,0,0,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 8 (r8, c7\u201323): all zeros in those columns:\n- Slice:  \n  `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 9 (r9, c7\u201323): identical 3-row band as row1 but lower:\n- Slice:  \n  `0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 10 (r10, c7\u201323):\n- Original row10: `...,3,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,...`\n- Slice:  \n  `0,0,0,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 11 (r11, c7\u201323):\n- Original row11: `...,2,2,2,0,0,0,2,2,2,...`\n- Slice:  \n  `0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0`\n\nThis 8\u00d717 patch is what we output.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Final output grid\n\nSo the completed output grid for the test input is:\n\nRow 1:\n`0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 2:\n`0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 3:\n`0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 4:\n`0,0,0,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 5:\n`0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 6:\n`0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 7:\n`0,0,0,0,3,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 8:\n`0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0`",

with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "After examining the solved examples a consistent feature is that the dimensions of the output are determined by the bounding box of all the cells coloured `5` in the input. For the test case the `5`s occur at rows\u202f16\u201317,\u202f23\u201324 and columns\u202f7\u20138,\u202f22\u201323, so the bounding box runs from row\u202f16 to row\u202f24 and from column\u202f7 to column\u202f23. The resulting output must therefore be 9 rows high and 17 columns wide.\n\nTo populate the output, we take a vertical slice from the main patterned area of the input of the same width as this bounding box and, because the rows of the bounding box itself contain no pattern apart from `5`s, we wrap in the pattern from the top of the grid. Using the slice from columns\u202f13 to\u202f29 of the top nine rows produces the required 9\u00d717 pattern, keeping the original colours.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n```\n3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n2,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",
