        "Full raw LLM response": "**Summary of ARC Task Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's my plan to tackle this ARC task. The user is presenting three examples with input grids and their corresponding outputs. My goal is to deduce the transformation rules and be able to predict the output grid for a given test input.\n\nFirst, I'll dissect the examples.  I'll start by looking at a specific example: example 1.  I'll begin by carefully analyzing the arrangement of the distinct color \"blobs\" within the input grid. I'll meticulously note the colors, shapes, and their relative positions. I'll even write out their bounding boxes. I will also be looking for any \"markers\" within the shapes. I will note the size and contents of the output grid.\nI will also be observing how the different \"blobs\" from the input are arranged or merged in the output. I'm looking for patterns, like quadrants or swapped positions. I'm also looking for any \"intrusions,\" which would mean a solid color in an area is overlayed or adjacent to a different shape.\n\nThen, I will hypothesize transformations. It seems like the input grid is divided into quadrants, and these quadrants are then re-arranged or transformed in the output. I will test this by looking at example 2 and 3.  I'll note the coordinates of the marker within the various shape quadrants.  I may use various operations such as flipping, rotating, and swapping blocks. I will then examine how the marked shape has been transformed in the output grid. I am checking if each \"blob\" has been independently transformed in the same way, or if its transformation depends on its position.\n\nA key part of the process seems to be finding a marker within the blobs.  The goal is to move the blob containing the marker to the Top-Left. Once the transformations and relationships are clear, I will use them to build a robust algorithm that will predict the output grid from the test input grid.  I need to handle the positioning of the quadrants based on the marked blob and handle any required transformations of each quadrant.  It looks like there's an orientation rule based on the location of the marker. I also need to verify that all these operations apply to all shapes. I will test my algorithm.\n\nTo solve this task, we need to understand how the input grid, which contains four distinct colored shapes arranged in a quadrant-like structure, is transformed into the output grid.\n\n**Analysis of the Rules:**\n\n1.  **Grid Identification:** The input grid (20x20) contains four distinct shapes, roughly located in the Top-Left (TL), Top-Right (TR), Bottom-Left (BL), and Bottom-Right (BR) quadrants.\n2.  **The \"Marker\":** One of the shapes contains a unique \"marker\" pixel (a color different from the shape's main color). In the examples and the test input, this marker is often a grey pixel (color 5).\n3.  **Output Construction:** The output grid is composed of the four shapes cropped to their bounding boxes (which appear to be uniform in size for a given input, e.g., 3x3, 5x5, or 7x7). The arrangement and orientation of these shapes depend on the location of the marker in the input.\n4.  **Transformation Logic:**\n    The goal is to rearrange and orient the grid such that the **marker pixel ends up at the Top-Left (0,0)** of the output grid.\n    \n    We treat the grid as two \"Strips\" of quadrants: Top Strip (TL, TR) and Bottom Strip (BL, BR).\n    \n    *   **Step 1 (Vertical Shift):** Identify which strip contains the marker.\n        *   If the marker is in the **Bottom Strip**, the strips are swapped. The strip moving from Bottom to Top stays in its original orientation (identity). The strip moving from Top to Bottom is **Rotated 180 degrees** (both the order of quadrants in the strip and the quadrants themselves are rotated).\n        *   If the marker is in the **Top Strip**, the strips stay in their original positions.\n    *   **Step 2 (Horizontal Adjustment of Top Strip):** Once the marker strip is at the Top, we must ensure the marker is at the (0,0) position.\n        *   We apply a transformation (Flip Horizontal, Flip Vertical, or both/Swap) to the Top Strip *only* so that the marker pixel moves to the top-left corner.\n        *   Based on the examples:\n            *   If the marker is on the Right side of the shape/strip, we Flip Horizontal (and swap quadrants if necessary).\n            *   If the marker is at the Bottom of the shape, we Flip Vertical.\n            *   In the Test Input, the marker is at the Bottom-Right of the BL shape. Moving BL to Top keeps it at Bottom-Right. To get it to Top-Left, we must **Rotate 180 degrees** (Flip V + Flip H).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Shapes:**\n    *   **TL (Color 2):** 7x7 block (Rows 0-6, Cols 1-7).\n    *   **TR (Color 3):** 7x7 block (Rows 1-7, Cols 12-18).\n    *   **BL (Color 7):** 7x7 block (Rows 11-17, Cols 0-6). *Contains Marker '5' at (17, 6).* Relative to the 7x7 shape, the marker is at the bottom-right corner (6, 6).\n    *   **BR (Color 8):** 7x7 block (Rows 11-17, Cols 9-15).\n\n2.  **Apply Logic:**\n    *   **Step 1:** Marker is in the **Bottom Strip** (BL).\n        *   Move Bottom Strip (BL, BR) to Top. (Orientation preserved).\n        *   Move Top Strip (TL, TR) to Bottom. **Rotate 180**.\n        *   Current Arrangement:\n            *   Top: BL | BR\n            *   Bot: Rot180(TR) | Rot180(TL)\n    *   **Step 2:** Normalize Marker in Top Strip.\n        *   Marker is in BL at (6, 6). BL is the Left quadrant of the strip.\n        *   Target is (0, 0).\n        *   We need to rotate the Top Strip contents by 180 degrees (Flip V + Flip H) to bring (6,6) to (0,0).\n        *   Rotate180 on Strip `BL | BR` results in `Rot180(BR) | Rot180(BL)`.\n        *   So, Final Top Strip is: **TL_out = Rot180(BR)**, **TR_out = Rot180(BL)**.\n        *   Let's verify marker pos: Marker was in BL. Now in TR_out (Rot180(BL)). Marker moves from (6,6) to (0,0) inside the quadrant. Since the quadrant is at TR_out (Top-Right), the marker is at (0, 7) of the grid?\n        *   *Correction from thought process:* In Ex 1, Flip H swapped the quadrants. We need the marker at the global (0,0). If `Rot180(BL)` is at TR_out, marker is not at (0,0). We need `Rot180(BL)` to be at **TL_out**.\n        *   To get `Rot180(BL)` at TL_out, we must Swap the quadrants first? `BL | BR` -> Swap -> `BR | BL` -> Rot180 -> `Rot180(BL) | Rot180(BR)`.\n        *   Final Top Strip: **TL_out = Rot180(BL)**, **TR_out = Rot180(BR)**.\n    *   **Bottom Strip:**\n        *   It was `TL | TR`. Moved to Bottom and Rotated 180.\n        *   Strip Rotate 180: `Rot180(TR) | Rot180(TL)`.\n        *   Final Bot Strip: **BL_out = Rot180(TR)**, **BR_out = Rot180(TL)**.\n\n3.  **Construct Output Grid (14x14):**\n    *   **TL Quadrant:** Rot180(Shape 7). Input Shape 7 (with 5) is rotated 180.\n    *   **TR Quadrant:** Rot180(Shape 8). Input Shape 8 is solid 8s, so remains solid 8s.\n    *   **BL Quadrant:** Rot180(Shape 3). Input Shape 3 (7x7) has a hole at (7, 15) -> relative (6, 3). Rot180 moves hole to (0, 3).\n    *   **BR Quadrant:** Rot180(Shape 2). Input Shape 2 (7x7) has holes. Row 0: `2,2,2,0,2,2,2`. Row 3: `0,0,0,2,2,2,2`. Rot180 flips these.\n\n**Output Grid Calculation:**\n\n*   **TL (Rot180 of Shape 7):**\n    Input 7 (Rows 11-17):\n    `7,7,7,7,7,7,7` (x3)\n    `0,0,7,7,7,7,7`\n    `7,7,7,7,7,7,7` (x2)\n    `7,7,7,7,7,7,5`\n    \n    Rot180:\n    Row 0: `5,7,7,7,7,7,7`\n    Row 1: `7,7,7,7,7,7,7`\n    Row 2: `7,7,7,7,7,7,7`\n    Row 3: `7,7,7,7,7,0,0`\n    Row 4-6: `7,7,7,7,7,7,7`\n\n*   **TR (Rot180 of Shape 8):**\n    Input 8 is solid 8s.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Thoughts and Problem Decomposition:**\n\nOkay, the user wants me to solve an ARC task that's based on example images and a test case. My initial approach is to analyze the examples to find patterns. I'll need to figure out how the input images are transformed into the output.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\nI see a 20x20 grid as input, with a few colored shapes on a black background. The output is a smaller 6x6 grid. I notice that the input seems divided into quadrants, and I will be looking closely at their dimensions, pixel patterns, and positions to see how these map to the output.\n\n**Hypothesis Building and Testing:**\n\nI start by guessing the output could be formed from extracted and possibly resized parts from the input quadrants. I consider whether the shape positions in the original grid are somehow swapped in the resulting output. The swapping seems to be a thing.  I then consider if shapes within quadrants get flipped horizontally, vertically, or both. Or they could be rotated.\n\n**Identifying the \"Key\" Shape:**\n\nA \"special pixel\" or quadrant containing a unique color is key to determine the overall transformation. The quadrant with this specific color always goes to the top-left of the output. I also determine the rotation (or flip) to apply to this specific quadrant and use the neighbor shape to find the positions of the other quadrants.\n\n**Refining the Transformation Logic:**\n\nBased on several examples, the output size is not necessarily related to the input grid size, but the input shape size. The pattern is based on arranging the colored quadrants and rotating (or flipping) them. The transformation for the primary quadrant determines the arrangement of the other parts. I then found the position of each of the other quadrants relative to the main quadrant that is moved to the top left position.\n\n**Test Case Application and Refinement:**\n\nIn the test input, the quadrant (Shape 7) containing the unique pixel has to move to the top left quadrant. Shapes are moved and also flipped or rotated. I carefully measure shape sizes, and identify core shape sizes, the non-empty bounding box region and consider if there are overlaps.\n\n**Final Solution Formulation:**\n\nI establish the procedure is for each input:\n1.  Extract cores (bounding boxes).\n2.  Identify main quadrant and its shape.\n3.  Transform main shape (rotate 180).\n4.  Move/arrange the other parts relative to this new main shape.\n5.  All shapes Rotate 180 degrees.\n6.  Handle overlaps, where color from each part overwrites zero.\n\n\nTo solve this task, we analyze the input grids to identify the transformation rules.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The input grid (20x20) contains four distinct colored shapes, roughly arranged in four quadrants. The output grid is smaller (ranging from 4x4 to 14x14) and is composed of these four shapes tightly packed together.\n2.  **Arrangement Logic:** One shape always contains a \"special\" pixel (often a different color like grey `5` within a shape of `7`s). The position of this shape in the input determines the arrangement of all shapes in the output.\n    *   **Goal:** The shape containing the special pixel is moved to the **Top-Left (TL)** quadrant of the output.\n    *   **Movement Rules:**\n        *   The shape originally horizontally adjacent to the special shape moves to the **Top-Right (TR)**.\n        *   The shape originally diagonally adjacent to the special shape moves to the **Bottom-Left (BL)**.\n        *   The shape originally vertically adjacent to the special shape moves to the **Bottom-Right (BR)**.\n3.  **Shape Transformation:**\n    *   The shapes are cropped to their \"core\" blocks (typically square blocks, e.g., 7x7 in the test case).\n    *   **Rotation:** To properly align the shapes, specifically to place the special pixel `5` at the very Top-Left of the output grid, the shapes are rotated.\n    *   Based on the test input analysis (specifically how \"tails\" of one shape fit into \"holes\" of another), the transformation rule is:\n        *   **TL (Main Shape):** Rotated 180 degrees.\n        *   **TR (Horizontal Neighbor):** Not Rotated.\n        *   **BL (Diagonal Neighbor):** Rotated 180 degrees.\n        *   **BR (Vertical Neighbor):** Not Rotated.\n    *   **Overlaps:** When shapes are packed, any \"tails\" (protruding pixels) from one shape spill over into adjacent quadrants, either filling holes or overwriting pixels.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Identify Shapes:**\n    *   **TL:** Shape `2` (Red).\n    *   **TR:** Shape `3` (Green).\n    *   **BL:** Shape `7` (Orange) containing the special pixel `5`.\n    *   **BR:** Shape `8` (Azure).\n2.  **Determine Output Arrangement:**\n    *   The Main Shape is `7` (BL). It moves to Output **TL**.\n    *   Horizontal Neighbor is `8` (BR). It moves to Output **TR**.\n    *   Diagonal Neighbor is `3` (TR). It moves to Output **BL**.\n    *   Vertical Neighbor is `2` (TL). It moves to Output **BR**.\n3.  **Apply Transformations:**\n    *   **Output TL (Shape 7):** Rotate 180\u00b0. Input has `5` at bottom-right of the block; rotation places it at top-left.\n    *   **Output TR (Shape 8):** No rotation.\n    *   **Output BL (Shape 3):** Rotate 180\u00b0. This aligns its tail (originally on the left) to the right, spilling into BR.\n    *   **Output BR (Shape 2):** No rotation. Its hole on the left (Row 3) accepts the tail from BL. Its top hole (Row 0) accepts the tail from TR.\n4.  **Construct Grid (14x14):**\n    *   **TL:** 7x7 block of `7`s, with `5` at (0,0).\n    *   **TR:** 7x7 block of `8`s.\n    *   **BL:** 7x7 block of `3`s. A tail of `7`s from TL fills the vertical hole at col 3.\n    *   **BR:** 7x7 block of `2`s. A tail of `8`s from TR fills the top hole/overwrites at col 3. A tail of `3`s from BL fills the left horizontal hole at row 3.\n\n**Output Grid Generation:**\n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,7,3,3,3,2,2,2,8,2,2,2\n3,3,3,7,3,3,3,2,2,2,8,2,2,2\n3,3,3,7,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1. Each input has 4 colored shapes in different regions of the grid\n2. One shape contains a special marker (color 5)\n3. The output combines all 4 shapes into a 2\u00d72 arrangement\n4. The shape with the 5 marker goes to the top-left corner of the output\n5. The shapes are arranged based on their relative positions, with the 5-marked shape rotated/flipped to place the 5 at position (0,0)\n6. Zeros within shapes get filled by adjacent shapes' colors or by the shape's own color\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\nIdentifying the 4 shapes:\n- **2 (red)**: Top-left region, rows 0-6, cols 1-7 (7\u00d77)\n- **3 (green)**: Top-right region, rows 1-7, cols 9-18 (7\u00d710)\n- **7 (orange) with 5**: Bottom-left region, rows 8-17, cols 0-6 (10\u00d77), 5 is at row 17, col 6\n- **8 (azure)**: Bottom-right region, rows 11-19, cols 9-16 (9\u00d78)\n\n**Transformation:**\nSince the 5 is in the 7 shape (bottom-left), 7 must move to top-left. This means swapping top and bottom:\n- 7 \u2192 top-left (needs 180\u00b0 rotation to put 5 at (0,0))\n- 8 \u2192 top-right  \n- 2 \u2192 bottom-left\n- 3 \u2192 bottom-right\n\n**Output Construction:**\n- Output dimensions: (10+7) \u00d7 (7+10) = 17\u00d717\n- Each shape fills its quadrant, with zeros filled by the shape's own color\n- After rotating 7 by 180\u00b0, the 5 ends up at (0,0)\n\n**Output:**\n```\n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Below is a plausible rule consistent with the key numerical properties of the examples, and then the concrete output I construct for the test input.\n\n---\n\n## Reasoning / Reconstruction\n\n### 1. What is preserved?\n\nFrom the three examples:\n\n- The **total number of non\u2011zero cells** in the input is always very close to (or exactly) a perfect square:\n  - Example 1: 36 non\u2011zero \u2192 6\u00d76 output.\n  - Example 3: 16 non\u2011zero \u2192 4\u00d74 output.\n  - Example 2: 104 non\u2011zero \u2192 output is 10\u00d710 (100 cells); 4 surplus cells (all color 7) are dropped.\n- In every case, the **output is a square n\u00d7n** where \\(n = \\lfloor\\sqrt{\\#\\text{non-zero}}\\rfloor\\).\n- Non\u2011zero colors are retained; zeros disappear.\n\nFor the test input, I count:\n\n- Total non\u2011zero cells:\n\n  - Row 1: 6 (2\u2019s)\n  - Row 2: 14 (7\u00d72\u2019s + 7\u00d73\u2019s)\n  - Row 3: 14\n  - Row 4: 11 (4\u00d72\u2019s + 7\u00d73\u2019s)\n  - Row 5: 17 (7\u00d72\u2019s + 10\u00d73\u2019s)\n  - Row 6: 13 (7\u00d72\u2019s + 6\u00d73\u2019s)\n  - Row 7: 13\n  - Row 8: 6  (3\u2019s)\n  - Row 9: 1  (7)\n  - Row 10:1  (7)\n  - Row 11:1  (7)\n  - Row 12:14 (7\u00d77\u2019s + 7\u00d78\u2019s)\n  - Row 13:14\n  - Row 14:14\n  - Row 15:13 (5\u00d77\u2019s + 8\u00d78\u2019s)\n  - Row 16:14\n  - Row 17:14\n  - Row 18:14 (6\u00d77\u2019s + 1\u00d75 + 7\u00d78\u2019s)\n  - Row 19:1  (8)\n  - Row 20:1  (8)\n\n  Sum = 196.\n\n- \\(196 = 14^2\\), so the output must be **14\u00d714**, fully filled with non\u2011zeros (no need to discard any cells).\n\nCount per color:\n\n- Color 2: 45\n- Color 3: 49\n- Color 7: 49\n- Color 8: 52\n- Color 5: 1\n\nThese totals must be preserved in the 14\u00d714 output.\n\n### 2. Object-level interpretation\n\nIgnoring color 0, the input decomposes into four big connected regions (\u201cobjects\u201d):\n\n1. A large **2\u2011region** in the upper\u2011left.\n2. A large **3\u2011region** in the upper\u2011right.\n3. A large **7\u2011region** in the lower\u2011left, containing a single **5** cell embedded in it (7+5 object).\n4. A large **8\u2011region** in the lower\u2011right.\n\nThis is structurally analogous to the solved examples:\n\n- Example 1: objects [9], [7+5], [4], [3].\n- Example 2: [7+5], [2], [3], [6].\n- Example 3: [2], [6], [8], [5+7].\n\nIn all given outputs:\n\n- There is always a **distinguished object that contains color 5 together with 7**, and that object dominates the **top\u2011left** of the output.\n- Each other large object is mostly confined to its own \u201cquadrant\u201d of the output; minor spillovers occur along the central borders to adjust counts.\n\nSo, for the test case, I follow the same high\u2011level organization:\n\n- Partition the 14\u00d714 output into four 7\u00d77 quadrants:\n\n  - NW (rows 1\u20117, cols 1\u20117)\n  - NE (rows 1\u20117, cols 8\u201114)\n  - SW (rows 8\u201114, cols 1\u20117)\n  - SE (rows 8\u201114, cols 8\u201114)\n\n- Place the objects in quadrants corresponding to their roles:\n\n  - **NW**: the 7+5 object \u2192 mostly 7\u2019s with one 5.\n  - **NE**: the 3\u2011object \u2192 filled with 3\u2019s.\n  - **SW**: the 2\u2011object \u2192 mostly 2\u2019s.\n  - **SE**: the 8\u2011object \u2192 mostly 8\u2019s.\n\n### 3. Matching exact color counts\n\nStart with a simple quadrant filling:\n\n- NW: 7\u00d77 = 49 cells: place 5 at (1,1), remaining 48 cells as 7.\n  - Uses: 5\u00d71, 7\u00d748.\n- NE: 7\u00d77 all 3 \u2192 3\u00d749.\n- SW: 7\u00d77 all 2 \u2192 2\u00d749.\n- SE: 7\u00d77 all 8 \u2192 8\u00d749.\n\nTotals in this naive layout:\n\n- 2: 49\n- 3: 49\n- 7: 48\n- 8: 49\n- 5: 1\n\nCompare with required counts:\n\n- Required vs current:\n  - 2: need 45, have 49 \u2192 reduce by 4.\n  - 3: need 49, have 49 \u2192 OK.\n  - 7: need 49, have 48 \u2192 add 1.\n  - 8: need 52, have 49 \u2192 add 3.\n  - 5: already correct.\n\nSo we must:\n\n- Turn **4** of the 2\u2019s into **(1\u00d77 + 3\u00d78)**.\n\nFollowing the pattern in the examples (where spillover colors appear near quadrant borders to connect regions), I adjust in the **SW** quadrant (rows 8\u201114, cols 1\u20117):\n\n- Change cell (8,7) from 2 \u2192 7.  (Bridges NW 7\u2011block downward.)\n- Change cells (12,7), (13,7), (14,7) from 2 \u2192 8.  (Bridges SW to SE 8\u2011block along the central vertical border.)\n\nAfter this adjustment:\n\n- 2: 49 \u2212 4 = 45 (correct)\n- 3: 49 (unchanged, correct)\n- 7: 48 + 1 = 49 (correct)\n- 8: 49 + 3 = 52 (correct)\n- 5: 1 (correct)\n\nNo zeros remain; total cells = 14\u00d714.\n\nThis yields a structured layout closely paralleling the example outputs: a 7+5\u2011dominated NW quadrant, pure 3\u2019s in NE, a 2\u2011dominated SW with a few bridging 7/8 cells, and an 8\u2011dominated SE.\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid (14\u00d714)\n\nRows are listed top to bottom, each row left to right:\n\nRow 1:  \n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3,3  \n\nRow 2:  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3,3  \n\nRow 3:  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3,3  \n\nRow 4:  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3,3  \n\nRow 5:  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3,3  \n\nRow 6:  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3,3  \n\nRow 7:  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3,3  \n\nRow 8:  \n2,2,2,2,2,2,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 9:  \n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 10:  \n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 11:  \n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 12:  \n2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 13:  \n2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n\nRow 14:  \n2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Below is how I inferred a rule that fits all three training examples and then applied it to the test.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Identify the \u201cmain objects\u201d and the special color 5\n\nIn every training input:\n\n- There are **exactly five non\u2011zero colors**.\n- Four of them form fairly large connected regions (\u201cmain objects\u201d).\n- Color **5** appears only as a **single pixel** and is embedded in, or touching, the **7\u2011region**.  \n  So 5 is a special marker that belongs to the 7\u2011object.\n\nWe will treat \u201c7+5\u201d as one object whose *dominant* color is 7.\n\nFor the **test** input, the non\u2011zero colors are:\n\n- 2, 3, 5, 7, 8.\n\nColor 5 appears once at (row 17, col 6), clearly inside the big 7\u2011region.  \nSo again we have four main colors/objects:\n\n- object 7 (with embedded 5),\n- object 2,\n- object 3,\n- object 8.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Compute block size and output size\n\nFor each of the four main colors, compute the **bounding box** (ignoring 5):\n\n- Color 2:\n  - rows 0\u20136 \u2192 height 7  \n  - columns 1\u20137 \u2192 width 7\n\n- Color 3:\n  - rows 1\u20137 \u2192 height 7  \n  - columns 9\u201318 \u2192 width 10\n\n- Color 7:\n  - rows 8\u201317 \u2192 height 10  \n  - columns 0\u20136 \u2192 width 7\n\n- Color 8:\n  - rows 11\u201319 \u2192 height 9  \n  - columns 9\u201316 \u2192 width 8\n\nFor each bounding box, take the **smaller side**:\n\n- minDim(2) = 7  \n- minDim(3) = 7  \n- minDim(7) = 7  \n- minDim(8) = 8 \u2192 smaller side 8, but we care about the global minimum.\n\nThe **global minimum side** among all four is:\n\n- `block_size = 7`.\n\nIn the examples, the final output is always a **2\u00d72 tiling of square blocks**, each of size `block_size \u00d7 block_size`:\n\n- Example 1: min side = 3 \u2192 output 6\u00d76 (2\u00d72 blocks of 3\u00d73),\n- Example 2: min side = 5 \u2192 output 10\u00d710,\n- Example 3: min side = 2 \u2192 output 4\u00d74.\n\nSo for the test:\n\n- Output size = `2 * block_size = 14` \u2192 **14\u00d714**.\n\nWe conceptually divide the 14\u00d714 output into 4 quadrants:\n\n- TL (top\u2011left): rows 0\u20136, cols 0\u20136,\n- TR (top\u2011right): rows 0\u20136, cols 7\u201313,\n- BL (bottom\u2011left): rows 7\u201313, cols 0\u20136,\n- BR (bottom\u2011right): rows 7\u201313, cols 7\u201313.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Decide which object goes into which quadrant\n\nFrom the training examples:\n\n1. Identify the four main color components.\n2. Sort them by **top row** of their bounding box (ascending).\n3. If the **7\u2011object** ends up in the **bottom half** of this sorted list (index 2 or 3), we **reverse** the list (flip vertical order). This ensures the 7\u2011object is always in the **top row** of quadrants.\n4. Split the (possibly reversed) list into two pairs:\n   - Top pair \u2192 top row of quadrants,\n   - Bottom pair \u2192 bottom row of quadrants.\n5. Inside each pair, decide left vs right:\n   - For the pair that contains **7**, put 7 on the **left**.\n   - For the other pair:\n     - If we **did not** reverse in step 3: order by **x\u2011coordinate** (center column) ascending \u2192 left = more left object.\n     - If we **did reverse** in step 3: order by **x\u2011coordinate descending** \u2192 left = more right object.\n\nThis rule reproduces the quadrant assignments of all three given examples.\n\nNow apply to the **test**:\n\n### 3.1. Top rows and x\u2011centers\n\nCompute **top row** (min row) of each bounding box and its **horizontal center**:\n\n- Color 2:\n  - topRow = 0,\n  - x\u2011center \u2248 (1 + 7) / 2 = 4.\n\n- Color 3:\n  - topRow = 1,\n  - x\u2011center \u2248 (9 + 18) / 2 = 13.5.\n\n- Color 7:\n  - topRow = 8,\n  - x\u2011center \u2248 (0 + 6) / 2 = 3.\n\n- Color 8:\n  - topRow = 11,\n  - x\u2011center \u2248 (9 + 16) / 2 = 12.5.\n\nSort by topRow ascending:\n\n- A = [2, 3, 7, 8].\n\n7 is at index 2 (bottom half), so we **reverse**:\n\n- A' = [8, 7, 3, 2].\n\nNow form the two pairs:\n\n- Top pair: [8, 7],\n- Bottom pair: [3, 2].\n\nAssign quadrants:\n\n- Top pair has 7; 7 must go on the **left**:\n  - TL = 7,\n  - TR = 8.\n\n- Bottom pair has no 7; since we **reversed vertically**, we now sort this pair by **x\u2011center descending**:\n\n  - x(3) \u2248 13.5,\n  - x(2) \u2248 4,\n  - descending \u2192 left = 3, right = 2.\n\nSo:\n\n- BL = 3,\n- BR = 2.\n\nThus quadrant main colors:\n\n- TL quadrant: 7 (with the embedded special 5),\n- TR quadrant: 8,\n- BL quadrant: 3,\n- BR quadrant: 2.\n\nThis matches the quadrant selection pattern from the examples (7 is always in TL, the others go to TR/BL/BR according to the above ordering logic).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Internal pattern inside the 4 blocks (orientation\u2011reversed case)\n\nStill from the examples, **when the vertical order had to be reversed to bring 7 to the top row** (this occurs in Example 3 and in our test), the internal pattern of the 2\u00d72 blocks follows the same scheme:\n\nLet `s = block_size`.\n\n- **BL block** (rows s..2s\u22121, cols 0..s\u22121):\n  - Completely filled with the BL color (no \u201cbleeding\u201d into it in any example).\n- **TL block** (rows 0..s\u22121, cols 0..s\u22121), with base color TL:\n  - Normally TL everywhere,\n  - Except:\n    - Cell (0,0) is the special color **5**, marking the embedded 5\u2011pixel in the 7\u2011object.\n    - Cell (s\u22121, s\u22121) is set to the **TR color**.\n- **TR block** (rows 0..s\u22121, cols s..2s\u22121), with base color TR:\n  - Base color TR everywhere,\n  - Except:\n    - Local cell (0,0) (global (0, s)) is set to the **TL color**.\n- **BR block** (rows s..2s\u22121, cols s..2s\u22121), with base color BR:\n  - Base color BR everywhere,\n  - Except:\n    - Local cell (0,0) (global (s, s)) is set to the **TR color**.\n\nThis reproduces Example 3 exactly when `s = 2`, and is the natural generalization for the \u201corientation reversed\u201d configuration we have in the test.\n\nFor our test:\n\n- `s = 7`,\n- TL = 7,\n- TR = 8,\n- BL = 3,\n- BR = 2.\n\nSo:\n\n- TL block (7\u00d77):\n  - Start with all 7.\n  - Put 5 at (0,0).\n  - Put 8 (TR color) at (6,6).\n- TR block (7\u00d77):\n  - Start with all 8.\n  - Put 7 at its local (0,0) = global (0,7).\n- BL block (7\u00d77):\n  - All 3.\n- BR block (7\u00d77):\n  - Start with all 2.\n  - Put 8 at its local (0,0) = global (7,7).\n\n---\n\n## 5.

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to understand how the four distinct colored shapes are combined into the output.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n1. Each example has 4 colored shapes scattered in the input grid\n2. One shape contains a \"5\" marker, indicating it should be positioned in the top-left of the output\n3. The shapes are arranged in a 2x2 layout and combined/overlaid\n4. Where shapes overlap and one has a \"hole\" (0), the adjacent shape fills that position\n5. The shape with the 5 marker has priority when conflicts occur\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n- **Shape 2** (top-left area): rows 0-6, cols 1-7 (7\u00d77)\n- **Shape 3** (top-right area): rows 1-7, cols 9-18 (7\u00d710)  \n- **Shape 7** (bottom-left, with 5 marker at position 17,6): rows 8-17, cols 0-6 (10\u00d77)\n- **Shape 8** (bottom-right area): rows 11-19, cols 9-16 (9\u00d78)\n\n**Transformation:**\n1. The 5 marker in shape 7 is at the bottom-right, so shape 7 must be rotated 180\u00b0 to place 5 at top-left\n2. Shapes are arranged: 2 (top-left), 3 (top-right), 7 (bottom-left), 8 (bottom-right)\n3. Output dimensions: 7 rows (top) + 10 rows (bottom) - 1 overlap = 16 rows; 7 cols (left) + 10 cols (right) - 1 overlap = 16 cols\n4. Holes in each shape are filled by adjacent shapes at overlap boundaries\n\n**Output Construction:**\n- Rows 0-5: Shape 2 and 3 patterns, with 2's holes filled and 3's left-edge holes filled by 2\n- Row 6: Overlap row where all four shapes meet; 7 takes priority at overlap, 8 fills 3's holes\n- Rows 7-15: Shape 7 and 8 patterns; 7's right-edge holes filled by 8, 8's left-edge filled by 7\n\n```\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "After examining the solved examples, one clear property emerges: the output grid contains no zeros, has an area equal to the number of non\u2011zero cells in the input, and preserves the multiset of non\u2011zero values. A reasonable way to construct such an output is to list the non\u2011zero entries row by row, starting from the anchor row containing the single 5 and then moving upwards through the grid (wrapping around at the top), and within each row list the non\u2011zeros from left to right, with the anchor row\u2019s 5 placed at the start. This concatenated list is then written out row\u2011major into a square whose side length is the square root of the non\u2011zero count.\n\nApplying this to the test input, there are 196 non\u2011zero cells, so the output is 14\u00d714. The anchor is at row\u00a017; listing the rows as described and filling the square gives:\n\n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n7,7,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2\n2,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3\n3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8",
