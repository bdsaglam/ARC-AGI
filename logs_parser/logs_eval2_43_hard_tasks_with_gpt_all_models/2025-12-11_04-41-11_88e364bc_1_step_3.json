        "Full raw LLM response": "**Okay, let's break down this ARC task!** I need to figure out the pattern in these grids of colored pixels.  The goal is to analyze the examples, understand how the \"4\" pixels move, and then apply that knowledge to a new test grid.\n\nFirst, I looked at Example 1. I saw patterns: Rectangular \"rooms\" or enclosures defined by the colors 7 and 5. Yellow pixels (4s) are scattered inside. I realized the yellow pixels are the key element of the transformation.  Where did they *go*?  I traced their movements, noting they seem to move horizontally within their color-defined enclosure.  This seemed to suggest a *mirroring* effect, but then I realized it's not simple mirroring. I needed to know the interior pixels.  I quickly looked at \"1\" and \"2\" pixels, and the idea of \"action at a distance\" for the four pixels. The next step was looking at the \"Test Input\" and Example 2 and 3. I needed some way to predict these shifts using the information available in an input image.\n\nThen, the diagonal, vertical, or horizontal movement became apparent.  The location of the 2's inside the color-boxes seems to tell us the direction.  Is the 2 to the right, down, or left from the center? That became the direction of agent movement. I now see the \"2\" pixel is the key for movement.\n\n*   **Rule:** For the yellow agents (4s), locate the containing box of a given color, find the interior 2 pixels, and the average vector offset from the center of that box (normalized, up, down, left, right), and move the agent by following it within the bounds of this shape to the nearest wall of this enclosure.\n    This direction applies to each four.  It became evident that I need to calculate this per box.\n\nI worked through that in several examples. Once I had an effective rule, I verified it with all examples.\nThen the test input.  I needed the colors and the vector for this and applied the new rules.\n\nI constructed the final output grid to finish the solution.\n\n\nThe transformation rule involves moving yellow pixels (represented by the integer `4`) within their enclosing colored regions. The direction of movement is determined by a \"Control Block\" of the same color as the enclosure.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n\n1.  **Identify Enclosures and Agents:**\n    *   Locate all yellow pixels (`4`) in the grid. These are the \"Agents\".\n    *   Identify the color of the enclosure surrounding each Agent.\n    *   **Test Input Agents:**\n        *   Agent 1 at `(3, 11)`: Inside a **Grey (5)** enclosure.\n        *   Agent 2 at `(6, 11)`: Inside a **Grey (5)** enclosure.\n        *   Agent 3 at `(12, 9)`: Inside a **Blue (1)** enclosure.\n        *   Agent 4 at `(17, 16)`: Inside a **Blue (1)** enclosure.\n        *   Agent 5 at `(18, 11)`: Inside a **Blue (1)** enclosure.\n\n2.  **Determine Movement Vectors:**\n    *   Find the \"Control Block\" for each relevant enclosure color. A Control Block is a rectangular region of that color containing a pattern of `1`s and `2`s.\n    *   **Vector Calculation:** Find the center of the Control Block and the average position of the `2`s within it. The vector points from the center to the `2`s.\n    \n    *   **Grey (5) Control Block:** Located at top-left `(0,0)` to `(5,6)`.\n        *   Center: Row ~2.5, Col 3.\n        *   `2`s are at `(3,5)` and `(4,3)`.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Task Breakdown & Example Analysis**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this ARC task, and it seems like I need to transform a grid of numbers based on a few examples and a test case. The grid sizes are pretty big, like 20x20. My first thought is to dive into the examples to understand the core logic.\n\nI noticed that the inputs and outputs are grids of numbers 0-9. The examples have interesting patterns. The first example has some colorful, blocky shapes and what looks like \"rooms\" formed by a background color (0) enclosed by walls. There are these special numbers (4) in those rooms, which look like the targets.\n\nNow, let's look at the yellow (4) pixels in the input. I traced those yellow pixels in the examples, I saw they were moving! They seem to move around *within* rooms enclosed by walls. Also, when looking at the input, the \"walls\" seem to be specific numbers. Let's trace their movements in the outputs. The main pattern I observe is the \"Agent\" (4) moving.\n\nI'm starting to get a sense of a rule here. It seems like the yellow \"agent\" pixels are moving inside these enclosed areas. It seems like a very visual and geometric problem. Let's look at the legend, which appears to be a pattern defined by a certain shape (5x5).\n\n**Identifying the Key Components: Legends & Agent Movement**\n\nI realized there are these \"legends\", which are specific numbers within the big blocks. These legends are actually critical to understand how the \"agent\" pixels move. In the first example, I see these 5x5 blocks. The yellow pixels are moving within the enclosed areas. These legends look like maps for the agents to follow. And those 1, 1, 2, those patterns could be how they move. I need to figure out what those numbers mean!\n\nIt seems like those numbers relate to horizontal and vertical movement. The agent in the orange-walled room always goes to the right, and the gray-walled room, left. It feels like the agents travel until they hit a wall. In the second example, I realized that the numbers within the legends might be telling the agents in which directions to move, in some pattern. I'm trying to interpret what the numbers mean, they are acting as a visual arrow!\n\n**Developing the Hypothesis & Refining the Model**\n\nIt clicked. The legend is telling us the *direction* and *number of steps*! One (blue) is Right, 2 (red) is Down. Wait a second, the sequence or the count? Ah-ha! I realized it\u2019s about reading the *order* of the numbers, or the vector. So, the arrow in the Gray 5 example points down-right, and the 4 pixels go that way. Also, the direction is relative to the wall color.\n\nSo now my hypothesis is this:\n1.  Identify the \"Legend\" (blocks of a certain number containing specific smaller numbers).\n2.  The configuration of small numbers is an \"Arrow\"\n3.  Based on the color, and the \"arrow\" direction, identify the Agent and the \"room\" it is in. The agents are these \"special numbers\"\n4.  The \"agent\" moves in this direction until a wall.\n\nNow, let's focus on those \"Legends\" and the direction they give. My mind keeps returning to the color.\n\n**Applying the Model to the Test Input & Refining the Logic**\n\nI started by looking at the test input. I identified two legends. They were 5x5 blocks containing 1s and 2s, but the 1 is a special number and the others are 2 (or a 5x5 grid but the 5s look like the \"background\".\n\nThe pattern formed from 1s and 2s indicates direction of the Agent, and the wall color defines the block with the arrow direction. Using what I learned from the examples, I determined the direction the agents would move.\n\nI carefully traced the positions of all the numbers, making sure I interpreted the grid correctly. I double-checked the logic and the positioning. I carefully identified all the agents and their respective walls. I did multiple passes and checked all the positions. It's crucial to be meticulous here because a small mistake will propagate everywhere.\n\nAfter carefully following the instructions and confirming my understanding, I'm confident about solving the test case. Now I feel very ready to construct my output grid.\n\n**Constructing the Output Grid & Final Verification**\n\nI will now construct the output grid using the plan I developed. I will copy the input and move the agents. This will involve setting the original agent locations to 0 and setting up the new agents at their target locations. I also made sure to keep track of the row and\n\nTo solve this task, we need to understand the behavior of the \"agents\" (yellow pixels with value 4) based on the environment defined by the \"walls\" (colored structures).\n\n**Rule Inference:**\n\n1.  **Identify Legends:** The grid contains solid 5x5 (or similar) blocks of specific colors that act as \"Legends\". Inside these blocks, there is a pattern of pixels of different colors (typically 1s and 2s, or 2s and 5s). These patterns define a movement direction vector for that wall color.\n    *   **Structure:** The pattern forms an arrow or directional indicator.\n        *   **Example 1:**\n            *   Orange Legend (`1,1,2` / `1,1,2`): Points **Right**.\n            *   Gray Legend (`2,1,1` / `2,1,1`): Points **Left**.\n            *   (Observation: `2` acts as the \"tip\" of the arrow).\n        *   **Example 2 & 3:**\n            *   Gray Legend (diagonal `1`s ending in `2`): Points **Down-Right** (Ex 2).\n            *   Gray Legend (vertical `1`s ending in `2`): Points **Down** (Ex 3).\n    *   **Test Input Legends:**\n        *   **Gray (5) Legend** (Top-Left): Contains `1`s and `2`s arranged diagonally with `2`s at the bottom-right. Direction: **Down-Right**.\n        *   **Blue (1) Legend** (Bottom-Left): Contains `2`s and `5`s inside the Blue block. The `2`s (Red) are at the top (Row 16), and `5`s (Gray) are below. Assuming `2` (Red) represents the arrow tip, the direction is **Up**.\n\n2.  **Move Agents:** The yellow pixels (4) are the agents. Each agent is located within or adjacent to a structure of walls of a specific color.\n    *   Identify the wall color surrounding or associated with the agent.\n    *   Move the agent in the direction defined by that color's Legend.\n    *   The agent moves in that direction until it is adjacent to a wall (a non-zero pixel that acts as an obstacle, typically of the same wall color) in the direction of movement.\n    *   If an agent is already adjacent to a wall in the movement direction, it stays in place.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Legend Analysis:**\n    *   **Gray Walls (5):** Legend indicates **Down-Right**.\n    *   **Blue Walls (1):** Legend indicates **Up**.\n\n*   **Agent Movements:**\n    1.  **Agent at (3, 11):** Surrounded by Gray walls. Move **Down-Right**.\n        *   Path: (4,12) -> (5,13) -> (6,14) -> (7,15) -> (8,16).\n        *   Check (9,17): Input Row 9, Col 17 is `5` (Wall).\n        *   **Final Position:** (8, 16).\n\n    2.  **Agent at (6, 11):** Surrounded by Gray walls. Move **Down-Right**.\n        *   Path: (7,12) -> (8,13) -> (9,14).\n        *   Check (10,15): Input Row 10, Col 15 is `5` (Wall).\n        *   **Final Position:** (9, 14).\n\n    3.  **Agent at (12, 9):** Surrounded by Blue walls. Move **Up**.\n        *   Check (11,9): Input Row 11, Col 9 is `1` (Wall).\n        *   The path is immediately blocked.\n        *   **Final Position:** (12, 9) (No change).\n\n    4.  **Agent at (17, 16):** Surrounded by Blue walls. Move **Up**.\n        *   Path: (16,16) -> (15,16) -> (14,16).\n        *   Check (13,16): Input Row 13, Col 16 is `1` (Wall).\n        *   **Final Position:** (14, 16).\n\n    5.  **Agent at (18, 11):** Surrounded by Blue walls. Move **Up**.\n        *   Path: (17,11) -> (16,11).\n        *   Check (15,11): Input Row 15, Col 11 is `1` (Wall).\n        *   **Final Position:** (16, 11).\n\n**Output Generation:**\n\n*   Copy the input grid.\n*   Remove old agents (set to 0) at (3,11), (6,11), (17,16), (18,11). Note: (12,9) remains 4.\n*   Place new agents (set to 4) at (8,16), (9,14), (14,16), (16,11).\n\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n5,5,5,1,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n5,1,5,5,1,5,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n5,5,1,5,5,2,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0\n5,5,5,2,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,5,5,5,0,4,5,5,5,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,4,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,1,1,0\n1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0\n1,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0\n1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0\n1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0\n1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

In all three training pairs, **the only cells that ever change are the ones with color `4`**.  \n   Colors `0,1,2,5,7` stay fixed.\n\n2. In each example, every `4` **moves along a straight line through cells of color `0`** until it is just about to \u201ccollide\u201d with a non\u2011zero cell (or leave the grid).  \n   - Example 1: each `4` moves horizontally left or right through `0`s until it is adjacent to a `5` or `7` in that row.\n   - Example 2: each `4` moves **diagonally down-right** (direction `(\u0394r,\u0394c) = (+1,+1)`) through `0`s until the next diagonal step would land on a non\u2011zero cell.\n   - Example 3: each `4` moves **straight down** (direction `(\u0394r,\u0394c) = (+1,0)`) through `0`s until the cell below is non\u2011zero.\n\n3. The **direction** (horizontal, diagonal \u2198, or vertical) is **constant within an example** but **differs between examples**.  \n   The direction matches the \u201clegend\u201d pattern built of 5s, 1s, and 2s near the top of each grid:\n   - Example 1: a left\u2013right pair of glyphs \u2192 horizontal direction.\n   - Example 2: a 5\u00d77 block with 1s/2s arranged on a diagonal \u2192 diagonal down\u2011right direction.\n   - Example 3: essentially the same legend rotated, with 1s/2s stacked vertically \u2192 downward direction.\n\n4. The test input has **exactly the same 5/1/2 legend as Example 2**, just in the top\u2011left instead of the top\u2011right.  \n   Therefore, for the test we use the **same motion rule as Example 2**:\n\n> **Rule for the test grid**:  \n> For each `4`, repeatedly move it **one step diagonally down\u2011right** `(row+1, col+1)` as long as the next cell is inside the grid and equals `0`.  \n> Stop when the next diagonal cell would be non\u2011zero or outside the grid.  \n> Place the `4` in the last `0` it reached; its original cell becomes `0`.  \n> All other colors stay unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### Apply the rule to the test input\n\nCoordinates are zero\u2011based `(row, col)`.\n\nInitial positions of `4` in the test input:\n\n- `S1 = (3,11)`\n- `S2 = (6,11)`\n- `S3 = (12,9)`\n- `S4 = (17,16)`\n- `S5 = (18,11)`\n\nWe treat the original grid as fixed during path computation (i.e. we don\u2019t let moving 4s block each other).\n\n---\n\n#### 1. `4` at (3,11)\n\nFollow diagonal down\u2011right through zeros:\n\n- (4,12) = 0  \n- (5,13) = 0  \n- (6,14) = 0  \n- (7,15) = 0  \n- (8,16) = 0  \n- (9,17) = 5 (non\u2011zero) \u2192 stop\n\nSo this `4` ends at **(8,16)**.  \nSet (3,11) \u2192 0; set (8,16) \u2192 4.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. `4` at (6,11)\n\n- (7,12) = 0  \n- (8,13) = 0  \n- (9,14) = 0  \n- (10,15) = 5 (non\u2011zero) \u2192 stop\n\nEnds at **(9,14)**.  \nSet (6,11) \u2192 0; set (9,14) \u2192 4.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. `4` at (12,9)\n\n- (13,10) = 0  \n- (14,11) = 0  \n- (15,12) = 1 (non\u2011zero) \u2192 stop\n\nEnds at **(14,11)**.  \nSet (12,9) \u2192 0; set (14,11) \u2192 4.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. `4` at (17,16)\n\n- (18,17) = 1 (non\u2011zero) immediately \u2192 cannot move\n\nStays at **(17,16)**.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. `4` at (18,11)\n\n- (19,12) = 1 (non\u2011zero) immediately \u2192 cannot move\n\nStays at **(18,11)**.\n\n---\n\n### Final output grid\n\nAll non\u20114 cells remain as in the input; 4s are updated as above.\n\nOutput:\n\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n5,5,5,1,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n5,1,5,5,1,5,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n5,5,1,5,5,2,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0  \n5,5,5,2,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0  \n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,5,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,5,5,5,0,4,5,5,5,5,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0  \n1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0  \n1,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0  \n1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,0  \n1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0  \n1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "The transformation works by interpreting the small block with 5s and embedded 1s and 2s at the top as a direction indicator. That pattern has the 2s diagonally down and right from the 1s, so the indicated direction is down\u2011right. Each 4 is slid along that down\u2011right direction until the next cell in that direction would be non\u2011zero; the 4 is placed in the last empty cell before such an obstacle, and its original position is cleared.\n\nApplying this to the test grid moves the 4s at (3,11), (6,11) and (12,9) to (8,16), (9,14) and (14,11) respectively; the other two 4s remain in place.

        "Full raw LLM response": "To solve this task I first looked for what changed between each input\u2013output pair. The only cells that ever moved were the ones with value\u202f4, all other colours stayed put. The way the 4s moved was consistent with a \u201cslide until you hit something\u201d rule, but the direction of the slide was different in each example.\n\nThe direction is encoded by the little 1\u2011and\u20112 motif embedded in the block of 5s near the top of the grid. In the three training grids that motif comes in three orientations:\n\n- In example\u202f1 the 2s are two cells to the right of the 1s, giving a horizontal (row) axis, and the 4s slide left or right along their row to the end of the longer zero\u2013gap.\n- In example\u202f2 the 2s are down and to the right of the 1s, giving a down\u2011right diagonal axis, and every 4 slides along that diagonal until the next cell would be non\u2011zero.\n- In example\u202f3 the 2s are two rows below the 1s, giving a vertical axis, and the 4s slide straight down until just above the first non\u2011zero.\n\nThe test grid contains the same 1/2 motif as example\u202f2 in its top\u2011left block of 5s, so the movement direction is along the down\u2011right diagonal. For each 4 I remove it from its starting cell and step one cell at a time to (row+1,col+1) as long as the next cell is 0; when the next cell is non\u2011zero or off the grid I stop and place the 4 in the last zero reached. If the very next cell is non\u2011zero, the 4 stays where it was.\n\nApplying that to the five 4s in the test input moves them to (9,17), (10,15) and (15,12); the two at (18,17) and (19,12) are blocked immediately and remain. The three original positions (4,12), (7,12) and (13,10) are cleared to 0.

On row r:\n   - Look left from column c: count how many consecutive `0`s until the first non\u2011zero (or edge). Call this `L`.\n   - Look right from column c: likewise count consecutive `0`s until the first non\u2011zero. Call this `R`.\n2. If `L > R`, move the `4` left through `L` zeros, and stop on the last `0` before the first non\u2011zero.\n3. If `R > L`, move the `4` right through `R` zeros, and stop on the last `0` before the first non\u2011zero.\n4. If `L = R`:\n   - There\u2019s no bias from the examples, so I choose to break ties by moving right (if there is at least one zero in that direction);  \n   - If both `L = 0` and `R = 0` (no zeros on either side, the `4` is already immediately between non\u2011zeros), leave the `4` in place.\n5. Clear the original cell (set it to 0), set the destination cell to 4.\n\n---\n\n## Applying to the test grid\n\nOriginal `4` positions in the test input:\n\n- A: (4,12)\n- B: (7,12)\n- C: (13,10)\n- D: (18,17)\n- E: (19,12)\n\nNow apply the rule row by row.\n\n### A: row 4, col 12\n\nRow 4:\n`5,5,1,5,5,2,5,0,0,5,0,4,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0`\n\nFrom col 12:\n\n- Left: col 11 = 0 (1 zero), then col 10 = 5 \u2192 `L = 1`.\n- Right: col 13 = 0 (1 zero), then col 14 = 5 \u2192 `R = 1`.\n\nTie, `L = R = 1`. Use the tie\u2011break \u2192 move right.\n\n- First non\u2011zero to the right is at col 14.\n- Last zero before it is col 13.\n\nSo A moves from (4,12) \u2192 (4,13).\n\n### B: row 7, col 12\n\nRow 7:\n`0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0`\n\nFrom col 12:\n\n- Left: col 11 = 0 (1 zero), then col 10 = 5 \u2192 `L = 1`.\n- Right: cols 13\u201318 are 0 (6 zeros), then col 19 = 5 \u2192 `R = 6`.\n\n`R > L`, so move right.\n\n- First non\u2011zero to the right is at col 19.\n- Last zero before it is col 18.\n\nB moves from (7,12) \u2192 (7,18).\n\n### C: row 13, col 10\n\nRow 13:\n`0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,4,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0`\n\nFrom col 10:\n\n- Left: col 9 = 0 (1 zero), then col 8 = 1 \u2192 `L = 1`.\n- Right: col 11 = 0 (1 zero), then col 12 = 1 \u2192 `R = 1`.\n\nTie, move right.\n\n- First non\u2011zero to the right is at col 12.\n- Last zero before it is col 11.\n\nC moves from (13,10) \u2192 (13,11).\n\n### D: row 18, col 17\n\nRow 18:\n`1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,0`\n\nFrom col 17:\n\n- Left: cols 16,15,14,13,12,11 are all 0 (6 zeros), then col 10 = 1 \u2192 `L = 6`.\n- Right: col 18 = 0 (1 zero), then col 19 = 1 \u2192 `R = 1`.\n\n`L > R`, so move left.\n\n- First non\u2011zero to the left is at col 10.\n- Last zero before it is col 11.\n\nD moves from (18,17) \u2192 (18,11).\n\n### E: row 19, col 12\n\nRow 19:\n`1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0`\n\nFrom col 12:\n\n- Left: col 11 = 1 (immediately non\u2011zero) \u2192 `L = 0`.\n- Right: col 13 = 1 (immediately non\u2011zero) \u2192 `R = 0`.\n\nNo zeros to either side (`L = R = 0`), so we leave this `4` in place.\n\nE stays at (19,12).\n\n### Final 4 positions\n\nAfter moving:\n\n- (4,13)\n- (7,18)\n- (13,11)\n- (18,11)\n- (19,12) (unchanged)\n\nAll original `4` cells are set to 0; these destination cells are set to 4.\n\n---\n\n## Completed output grid\n\nHere is the full transformed grid:\n\nRow 1:\n`5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 2:\n`5,5,5,1,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 3:\n`5,1,5,5,1,5,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 4:\n`5,5,1,5,5,2,5,0,0,5,0,0,4,5,0,0,5,5,0,0`\n\nRow 5:\n`5,5,5,2,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0`\n\nRow 6:\n`5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0`\n\nRow 7:\n`0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,5,0`\n\nRow 8:\n`0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0`\n\nRow 9:\n`0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0`\n\nRow 10:\n`0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0`\n\nRow 11:\n`0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 12:\n`0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\nRow 13:\n`0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0`\n\nRow 14:\n`0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0`\n\nRow 15:\n`0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0`\n\nRow 16:\n`1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0`\n\nRow 17:\n`1,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0`\n\nRow 18:\n`1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0`\n\nRow 19:\n`1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0`\n\nRow 20:\n`1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`",
