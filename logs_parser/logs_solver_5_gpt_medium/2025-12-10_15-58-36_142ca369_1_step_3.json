        "Full raw LLM response": "Below is my reasoning process. I was not able to infer a unique, reliable transformation from the three examples, so the grid I give at the end is a best-effort guess rather than a confident solution.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What I tried to infer from the examples\n\nWe are given three example pairs (input \u2192 output) and then a test input.\n\nEach grid is the same size between input and output. The inputs have a few disconnected colored \u201ccomponents\u201d (clusters of the same color), and the outputs add many more nonzero cells while keeping the original ones in place.\n\n### 1.1. General observations\n\nAcross all examples:\n\n- No resizing of the grid: dimensions preserved.\n- Same colors in input and output; outputs don\u2019t introduce new color IDs.\n- Outputs seem to extend each color along diagonals or across the grid, in ways that look like \u201cpaths\u201d or \u201cconnections\u201d between components of the same color or between different colors.\n- The new colored cells are always in positions that form lines with slope \u00b11 (diagonals), or short vertical/horizontal extensions near the original components.\n\nExample 1:\n- Colors: {5, 2, 1, 3}.\n- There is a \u201cleft\u201d stack of these colors roughly along a descending diagonal, and a \u201cright\u201d vertical stack of the same colors at one column (col 10).\n- The output shows, for each color, something like a V- or X-shaped pattern of that color that seems to connect left and right stacks diagonally.\n\nExample 2:\n- Colors: {5, 4, 2, 6}.\n- There are vertical and horizontal clusters of these colors positioned around the middle.\n- The output again shows extended diagonals and connections: 5s spring off from the original vertical bar, 6s wrap around others, 4s propagate diagonally, etc.\n\nExample 3:\n- Colors: {4, 1, 2, 7, 5}.\n- Input has isolated clusters: small block of 4s near top-left, a vertical of 1s, a small horizontal run of 2s, a vertical of 7s further down, and 5s at the bottom.\n- Output extends each color largely along diagonals:\n  - 4s form a diagonal from the initial cluster down-right.\n  - 1s form a diagonal up-left from mid-area, plus a short branch.\n  - 2s form a long down-right diagonal spreading from their original triple.\n  - 7s form a diagonal down-right from their original vertical.\n  - 5s form a diagonal up-left from the bottom triple, eventually meeting other elements.\n\nIt *looks* like some kind of \u201cdiagonal propagation\u201d or \u201cconnecting the given components\u201d along diagonals, often chaining colors in some sequence (e.g., 4\u21921\u21922\u21927\u21925).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why the rule is ambiguous\n\nI tried several hypotheses:\n\n1. **Ray casting along diagonals**:  \n   For each color/component, start from a particular cell (topmost/leftmost/centroid) and extend in direction (1,1) or (-1,1), painting that color until you hit another colored cell or border.  \n   - This partly matches some 4, 7, 2, 5 diagonals in Example 3, but fails on details: e.g., the 4s in Example 3 stop at (5,5) rather than going as far as the first actual 1-cell along their diagonal would allow, and some expected diagonal cells are missing.\n\n2. **Connecting \u201cstacks\u201d of colors**:  \n   In Example 1, there are two sequences of colors {5,2,1,3}: a left slanted stack and a right vertical stack. The output seems to connect corresponding colors between the two stacks with diagonals, forming a criss-cross pattern.  \n   - However, Example 3 does not clearly have two such aligned sequences, and Example 2\u2019s structure is even more irregular, so this idea doesn\u2019t systematize well.\n\n3. **Matrix-like cross-product of color positions**:  \n   Treat one axis as positions of one sequence of colored blocks and the other axis as another sequence, then draw diagonals corresponding to combinations.  \n   - I could not map this cleanly onto the concrete coordinates in the examples; the counts and shapes don\u2019t line up with a simple Cartesian-product-like construction.\n\n4. **Iterative shearing or CA (cellular automaton)**:  \n   Maybe a repeated shift of all filled cells by one diagonal step with some collision rule.  \n   - This didn\u2019t match the stopping positions and presence/absence of certain colored cells.\n\nAfter extensive comparison of input/output coordinates in all three examples, I could not find a clean, deterministic rule that explains *all* the changes consistently and can be applied confidently to a *new* configuration.\n\nIt is certainly possible that with more examples or deeper prior familiarity with this particular ARC task, one could pin down the intended rule; but given the three examples and the considerable geometric complexity, my confidence in any exact inferred transformation is low.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Consequence for the test case\n\nFor the provided test input:\n\n- There is a vertically stacked sequence at column 1: 1,2,7,5 (each as pairs).\n- There is a similar stacked structure at column 16: 4,6,8,2.\n- The top rows hold a sort of \u201crow\u201d of these colors: 1,2,7,5,2,8,6,4.\n\nI experimented (on paper) with various plausible diagonal-propagation and \u201cconnecting stacks\u201d schemes (e.g. casting diagonals from the tops of each vertical pair, connecting left stack colors to right stack colors of some mapped sequence), but no single consistent rule both:\n- reproduces the example outputs exactly, *and*\n- produces a unique, well-justified pattern for this new test.\n\nUnder these circumstances, any concrete nontrivial output grid I provide would be speculative and very likely incorrect.\n\nGiven the instructions to be honest and not pretend certainty where I don\u2019t have it, I will not invent a complex pattern and state it as if it were the true rule.\n\nInstead, I will:\n\n- Explicitly state that I cannot reliably infer the exact transformation.\n- Provide the test output as simply the unchanged input grid. This is not meant as a claim that the identity transformation is correct; it is a placeholder reflecting my inability to deduce the specific rule from the examples alone.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Important note:**  \nThe ARC rule inferred below is one consistent interpretation from the provided examples, but because the examples are complex and somewhat ambiguous, the exact rule may differ from the one used in the original dataset. What follows is a coherent transformation rule and its complete, deterministic application to the given test input.\n\n---\n\n## Inferred transformation rule\n\nFrom the three examples, a common pattern that can be abstracted is:\n\n1. **Find adjacent same-color pairs along a row** (i.e., horizontally adjacent equal nonzero cells).\n2. For each such pair on row `r` at columns `c_left` and `c_right = c_left+1`:\n   - From the **left cell** `(r, c_left)`, extend a **down-left diagonal**:  \n     repeatedly move to `(r+1, c_left-1), (r+2, c_left-2), ...`  \n   - From the **right cell** `(r, c_right)`, extend a **down-right diagonal**:  \n     repeatedly move to `(r+1, c_right+1), (r+2, c_right+2), ...`\n3. When extending either diagonal:\n   - Stop when you go out of the grid, or\n   - Stop just before the next step would land on a **nonzero** cell in the **original input grid**.\n   - Only write into cells that were `0` in the input; never overwrite original nonzero cells.\n4. All original nonzero cells remain unchanged; only zeros can be turned into the color of the pair that spawned the diagonal.\n\nFor the **test input**, we apply this rule specifically to the horizontal pairs on **row 1** (the second row, 0\u2011indexed):\n\nRow 1 has these horizontal pairs:\n\n- `1,1` at columns 0\u20131\n- `2,2` at columns 2\u20133\n- `7,7` at columns 4\u20135\n- `5,5` at columns 6\u20137\n- `2,2` at columns 10\u201311\n- `8,8` at columns 12\u201313\n- `6,6` at columns 14\u201315\n- `4,4` at columns 16\u201317\n\nFor each such pair we:\n\n- Start a **down-right** diagonal from the right cell.\n- Start a **down-left** diagonal from the left cell.\n- Extend as far as allowed by the stopping conditions above.\n\nNo other rows are used as sources of diagonals; all other nonzero cells remain as they are, only potentially being \u201cobstacles\u201d that stop diagonals.\n\n---\n\n## Stepwise application (conceptual)\n\nFor each pair, we do the following (examples):\n\n- Pair `1,1` at (1,0)\u2013(1,1):\n  - From `(1,1)` extend `1` along down-right: `(2,2),(3,3),...,(17,17)` until border.\n  - From `(1,0)` the next down-left would be `(2,-1)` which is off-grid, so no left diagonal.\n\n- Pair `2,2` at (1,2)\u2013(1,3):\n  - From `(1,3)` extend `2` along down-right: `(2,4),(3,5),...,(15,17)`; no obstacles.\n  - From `(1,2)` the next down-left `(2,1)` is already a `2` in the original grid, so we stop immediately and do not write there.\n\n- Pair `7,7` at (1,4)\u2013(1,5):\n  - From `(1,5)` extend `7` down-right: `(2,6),(3,7),...,(13,17)` until about the bottom/right edge or obstacle.\n  - From `(1,4)` extend `7` down-left: `(2,3),(3,2)` then the next `(4,1)` is already a `7` in the input, so stop before it.\n\n- Pair `5,5` at (1,6)\u2013(1,7), etc.\n\nThe same logic is applied for the other pairs, always respecting:\n- \u201cDon\u2019t overwrite original nonzeros.\u201d\n- \u201cStop before stepping into any original nonzero.\u201d\n\nProceeding this way for all eight pairs yields a dense web of diagonals across the lower part of the grid.\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\nHere is the completed 18\u00d718 output grid after applying the described transformation to the test input:\n\nRow 0:  \n0,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,0,0,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,0  \n\nRow 1:  \n1,1,2,2,7,7,5,5,0,0,2,2,8,8,6,6,4,4  \n\nRow 2:  \n0,2,1,7,2,5,7,0,5,2,0,8,2,6,8,4,6,0  \n\nRow 3:  \n2,2,7,1,5,2,0,7,2,5,8,0,6,2,4,8,6,6  \n\nRow 4:  \n0,7,0,5,1,0,2,2,7,8,5,6,0,4,2,0,8,0  \n\nRow 5:  \n7,7,5,0,0,1,2,2,8,7,6,5,4,0,0,2,8,8  \n\nRow 6:  \n0,5,0,0,0,2,1,8,2,6,7,4,5,0,0,0,2,0  \n\nRow 7:  \n5,5,0,0,2,0,8,1,6,2,4,7,0,5,0,0,2,2  \n\nRow 8:  \n0,0,0,2,0,8,0,6,1,4,2,0,7,0,5,0,0,0  \n\nRow 9:  \n0,0,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,0,0  \n\nRow10:  \n0,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,0,0,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,0  \n\nRow11:  \n2,0,8,0,6,0,4,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,7,0,5  \n\nRow12:  \n0,8,0,6,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,7,0  \n\nRow13:  \n8,0,6,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,0,7  \n\nRow14:  \n0,6,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,0  \n\nRow15:  \n6,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2  \n\nRow16:  \n0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0  \n\nRow17:  \n4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**My understanding of this ARC task is that I'm given a set of examples and a test input and I'm supposed to find a rule that transforms one into the other.  The task seems to involve shapes (mostly L-shapes) that create diagonal trails.  It looks like the goal is to draw paths from these starting shapes, and those paths might collide or interact somehow, or they just continue until they hit the border of the grid.  I think the rule is that I need to propagate L-shapes in the Test Input down-right or down-left depending on their position (left or right side).**\n\n**After analyzing several examples, it seems like the rules are the following:**\n\n1.  **Identify sources:** The input will have shapes, and those are the starting point.\n\n2.  **Determine direction:** Shapes on the left side of the input (with a missing top-left corner on a 2x2 box) go down-right. Shapes on the right side (missing a top-right corner on a 2x2 box) go down-left.\n\n3.  **Project Diagonally:** The shape is copied step-by-step diagonally, forming a trail.\n\n4.  **Handle Overlap:** The important thing here is when two paths \"collide\" (two shapes overlapping the same position in the grid). When it overlaps, the pixel value should be the most recent source, or the source which is \"further to the right\" side wins (in terms of column). The source which is \"higher up\" (i.e. Row 0 has more precedence) also has the precedence. I can interpret this as \"later draws overwrite earlier draws.\" It seems, after examining example 1 and 2 that if the sources collide the lower source overwrites.\n\n5.  **Stop Condition:** The trails go until they reach the grid's edge.\n\nThis is the general model, which I can implement to get the output.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples and the test input, the transformation follows these rules:\n\n1.  **Identify Source Shapes:** The input contains \"source\" shapes, which are 3-pixel L-shapes fitting into a 2x2 area.\n    *   **Left-Side Shapes:** These are \"Top-Left Empty\" L-shapes. For a 2x2 box with top-left at $(r, c)$, the pixels are at $(r, c+1)$, $(r+1, c)$, and $(r+1, c+1)$. In the test input, these appear on the left half.\n    *   **Right-Side Shapes:** These are \"Top-Right Empty\" L-shapes. For a 2x2 box with top-left at $(r, c)$, the pixels are at $(r, c)$, $(r+1, c)$, and $(r+1, c+1)$. In the test input, these appear on the right half.\n\n2.  **Transformation/Movement:** Each source shape projects a trail of copies of itself across the grid diagonally.\n    *   **Left-Side Shapes** move **Down-Right** with a step of $(+1, +1)$.\n    *   **Right-Side Shapes** move **Down-Left** with a step of $(+1, -1)$.\n\n3.  **Overwrite Rules (Collision Handling):**\n    *   **Lower Sources Overwrite Higher Sources:** Sources starting at lower rows (e.g., Row 2) are drawn *after* sources starting at higher rows (e.g., Row 0), thus overwriting them where trails intersect.\n    *   **Right Overwrites Left:** Within the same row, sources to the right are drawn *after* sources to the left. This explains the pattern in Input Row 1 (e.g., the Red shape's pixels at cols 2,3 overwrite the Blue shape's projected pixel at col 3).\n\n**Simulation of Test Input:**\n\n*   **Row 0 Sources:**\n    *   Blue (1) at (0,1) $\\to$ Down-Right.\n    *   Red (2) at (0,3) $\\to$ Down-Right.\n    *   Orange (7) at (0,5) $\\to$ Down-Right.\n    *   Gray (5) at (0,7) $\\to$ Down-Right.\n    *   Red (2) at (0,10) $\\to$ Down-Left.\n    *   Azure (8) at (0,12) $\\to$ Down-Left.\n    *   Magenta (6) at (0,14) $\\to$ Down-Left.\n    *   Yellow (4) at (0,16) $\\to$ Down-Left.\n*   **Row 2 Sources:**\n    *   Red (2) at (2,1) $\\to$ Down-Right.\n    *   Magenta (6) at (2,16) $\\to$ Down-Left.\n*   **Row 4 Sources:**\n    *   Orange (7) at (4,1) $\\to$ Down-Right.\n    *   Azure (8) at (4,16) $\\to$ Down-Left.\n*   **Row 6 Sources:**\n    *   Gray (5) at (6,1) $\\to$ Down-Right.\n    *   Red (2) at (6,16) $\\to$ Down-Left.\n\nThe output grid is generated by drawing these trails in the specified order (Row 0 L$\\to$R, then Row 2, etc.).\n\n0,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,0,0,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,0\n1,1,2,2,7,7,5,5,0,0,2,2,8,8,6,6,4,4\n0,2,1,2,2,7,7,5,5,2,2,8,8,6,6,4,6,0\n2,2,2,2,7,7,5,5,2,2,8,8,6,6,4,4,6,6\n0,7,2,2,2,7,7,5,5,2,2,8,8,6,6,4,8,0\n7,7,7,2,2,7,7,5,5,2,2,8,8,6,6,4,8,8\n0,5,7,7,2,2,7,7,5,5,2,2,8,8,6,6,2,0\n5,5,5,7,7,2,2,7,7,5,5,2,2,8,8,6,2,2\n0,5,5,5,7,7,2,2,7,7,5,5,2,2,8,8,2,0\n0,0,5,5,5,7,7,2,2,7,7,5,5,2,2,8,0,0\n0,0,0,5,5,5,7,7,2,2,7,7,5,5,2,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,5,5,5,7,7,2,2,7,7,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,7,7,2,2,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,7,7,2,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Deep Dive into a Complex ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got. The task seems to involve transforming an input grid into an output grid based on a set of rules, focusing on these interesting \"L-shaped\" blocks and single pixels. The core idea is that these blocks act like \"ray shooters,\" and the single pixels might be targets or deflector elements for these \"rays.\"  I've noticed three examples and a test input and I'm treating each example to decipher the hidden pattern.\n\nFrom Example 1, it looks like these L-blocks spawn diagonals, and their direction depends on which side of the L is missing. For now, I'm thinking about \"down-right\" and \"down-left\" diagonals. It seems like the single pixels in Example 1 might influence where these diagonal lines *end* up, or how they intersect.\n\nExample 2 reinforces the diagonal idea, and I'm leaning toward an idea of these lines \"bouncing\" or extending according to some rule from the input shape.\n\nI'm starting to think about this in terms of \"segments\" of diagonals being extended. If a pixel of color *C* exists, it seems to be linked to a line of that *C*. This is where the geometric aspect, defined by $r - c$ and $r + c$ directions, becomes key. The goal, at least so far, is to extend these segments into full lines across the grid.\n\nBut then, I noticed this weird behavior with the colors \u2013 like the '5's are 'X' shape instead of just diagonal lines. I'm wondering if the pixels at the end of the line aren't just endpoints, but points that influence the slope of those diagonal lines, which can cause 'echoes' in some cases, so not a perfect diagonal, but more like a converging one. I'm starting to think about moving objects, how these blocks start diagonals which could interact with each other, bounce off something, or stop completely somewhere.\n\nIn Example 3, those L-shapes are key - these are definitely the \"engines\" that generate those diagonals. Now I'm considering the input. I think it is composed of blocks. The task becomes one of extending line segments to edges of the grid, or to other inputs.\n\nI'm seeing a general formula for the L-blocks which generate diagonals, but some blocks will overlap. The single pixels seem to be there as 'targets' which 'intercept' or 'intersect' the lines.\n\nI then started working on a \"collision rule\" for overlapping diagonals. The code generates lines for each block which may overlap. My idea is either that it doesn't matter, or I need a priority to handle those. One thought is that it doesn't matter (since, in practice, multiple outputs in the same pixel is the same thing, with no information lost or gained), and the test grid is simple enough that there are no overlaps. Another thought is \"later lines overwrite earlier lines,\" although there seems to be some weirdness with how this works in Example 2.\n\nAfter, I went on to determine, how to draw the diagonals (starting points, direction, stopping conditions). Based on this, I started generating some pseudo-code. I'll need to figure out which line \"wins\" if the overlap, based on some criteria - color value? Or start row?\n\nLet's test the plan with the sample input and proceed.\n\n\nBased on the examples, the transformation rule is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects**: The input grid contains \"blocks\" of size $2\\times2$ made of a specific color $C$. Each block has exactly 3 pixels of color $C$ and one \"missing\" corner pixel (which is 0).\n    *   **Type 1 (Top-Left Missing)**: The block pixels are at $(r, c+1)$, $(r+1, c)$, and $(r+1, c+1)$. The missing pixel is at $(r, c)$. This block \"points\" to the top-left.\n    *   **Type 2 (Top-Right Missing)**: The block pixels are at $(r, c)$, $(r+1, c)$, and $(r+1, c+1)$. The missing pixel is at $(r, c+1)$. This block \"points\" to the top-right.\n    *(Note: The other orientations do not appear in the test input).*\n\n2.  **Generate Diagonal Rays**: Each block emits a diagonal ray of the same color $C$.\n    *   **From Type 1 Blocks**: A ray is cast to the **Bottom-Right** starting from the bottom-rightmost pixel of the block (conceptually extending the diagonal). The ray follows the path $(r+k, c+k)$ for $k \\ge 1$.\n    *   **From Type 2 Blocks**: A ray is cast to the **Bottom-Left** starting from the bottom-leftmost pixel of the block. The ray follows the path $(r+k, c-k)$ for $k \\ge 1$.\n\n3.  **Interaction/Layering**:\n    *   The rays extend to the edge of the grid.\n    *   When rays from different blocks cross the same cell, there is a priority rule. Based on the solved examples (specifically Example 2 where a lower, left-originating line overwrites a higher, right-originating line), the priority is:\n        1.  **Lower Start Row**: Rays originating from blocks lower in the grid overwrite rays from blocks higher in the grid.\n        2.  **Left Start Column**: If two rays start from the same row, the one originating from the left side (Type 1 blocks in this input) overwrites the one from the right side.\n    *   The rays do not overwrite the original 2x2 blocks from the input. Non-zero input pixels are preserved.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\nThe input grid size is 18x18.\n- **Rows 0-1**:\n  - Type 1 Blocks (Left, producing BR rays): Colors 1, 2, 7, 5.\n  - Type 2 Blocks (Right, producing BL rays): Colors 2, 8, 6, 4.\n- **Rows 2-3**:\n  - Type 1 Block: Color 2 (Left).\n  - Type 2 Block: Color 6 (Right).\n- **Rows 4-5**:\n  - Type 1 Block: Color 7 (Left).\n  - Type 2 Block: Color 8 (Right).\n- **Rows 6-7**:\n  - Type 1 Block: Color 5 (Left).\n  - Type 2 Block: Color 2 (Right).\n\nThe rays are generated and woven together according to the priority rules.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n0,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,0,0,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,0\n1,1,2,2,7,7,5,5,0,0,2,2,8,8,6,6,4,4\n0,2,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,6,0\n2,2,0,1,0,2,0,7,5,2,8,0,6,0,4,0,6,6\n0,7,2,0,1,0,2,0,2,5,8,0,6,0,4,0,8,0\n7,7,0,2,0,1,0,2,7,8,5,8,0,6,0,4,8,8\n0,5,7,0,2,0,1,0,2,7,8,5,4,0,6,0,2,0\n5,5,0,7,0,2,0,1,2,7,8,5,6,4,0,2,2,2\n0,5,5,0,7,0,2,1,6,2,6,7,8,5,2,0,0,0\n0,0,5,5,0,7,2,2,1,4,6,7,8,5,2,0,0,0\n0,0,2,5,5,0,7,2,2,6,6,8,8,2,7,0,0,0\n0,2,0,8,5,5,0,7,6,2,8,6,2,7,0,7,0,0\n2,0,8,0,6,5,5,6,7,8,2,2,8,0,7,0,0,0\n0,8,0,6,0,4,5,5,5,7,2,2,0,8,0,7,0,0\n8,0,6,0,4,6,8,5,5,2,7,0,8,0,0,0,1,0\n0,6,0,4,6,8,8,2,2,5,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,1\n0,0,4,6,0,8,2,2,2,5,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,4,0,6,0,8,2,0,0,0,5,0,0,7,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation pattern:\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1. Each example has L-shaped patterns (3 cells in an L configuration)\n2. From each L-shape's corner, diagonal lines extend toward the center/opposite side of the grid\n3. The diagonals go at 45-degree angles (one cell down and one cell sideways per step)\n4. The direction depends on the L-shape's orientation - diagonals extend toward the \"open\" part of the L\n\n**Test Input Structure:**\n- L-shapes along top rows (0-1): colors 1,2,7,5 on left side going down-right; colors 2,8,6,4 on right side going down-left\n- L-shapes on left column (rows 2-7): colors 2,7,5 going down-right\n- L-shapes on right column (rows 2-7): colors 6,8,2 going down-left\n\n**Transformation:**\nFor each L-shape, I trace a diagonal from its corner toward the center:\n- Top-left L-shapes (1,2,7,5 at columns 1,3,5,7): diagonal down-right\n- Top-right L-shapes (2,8,6,4 at columns 10,12,14,16): diagonal down-left  \n- Left-side L-shapes (2,7,5): diagonal down-right\n- Right-side L-shapes (6,8,2): diagonal down-left\n\nThe diagonals extend until they reach the grid edge, creating an X-pattern where opposing diagonals meet in the center.\n\n```\n0,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,0,0,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,0\n1,1,2,2,7,7,5,5,0,0,2,2,8,8,6,6,4,4\n0,2,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,6,0\n2,2,0,1,0,2,0,7,2,5,8,0,6,0,4,0,6,6\n0,7,2,0,1,0,2,2,7,8,5,6,0,4,0,6,8,0\n7,7,0,2,0,1,2,2,8,7,6,5,4,0,6,0,8,8\n0,5,7,0,2,2,1,8,2,6,7,4,5,6,0,8,2,0\n5,5,0,7,2,2,8,1,6,2,4,7,6,5,8,0,2,2\n0,0,5,2,7,8,2,6,1,4,2,6,7,8,5,2,0,0\n0,0,2,5,8,7,6,2,4,1,6,2,8,7,2,5,0,0\n0,2,0,8,5,6,7,4,2,6,1,8,2,2,7,0,5,0\n2,0,8,0,6,5,4,7,6,2,8,1,2,2,0,7,0,5\n0,8,0,6,0,4,5,6,7,8,2,2,1,0,2,0,7,0\n8,0,6,0,4,0,6,5,8,7,2,2,0,1,0,2,0,7\n0,6,0,4,0,6,0,8,5,2,7,0,2,0,1,0,2,0\n6,0,4,0,6,0,8,0,2,5,0,7,0,2,0,1,0,2\n0,4,0,6,0,8,0,2,0,0,5,0,7,0,2,0,1,0\n4,0,6,0,8,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,0,7,0,2,0,1\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. The input contains L-shaped patterns (3 cells forming an L) and sometimes single markers or line patterns\n2. Each L-shape has a \"corner\" cell where two arms meet, and the L \"opens\" in a particular direction\n3. From each L-shape's corner, a diagonal line extends in the direction opposite to where the L opens\n4. The diagonals continue until they reach the edge of the grid or meet other diagonals\n\nFor the test input:\n- **Top row L-shapes** (rows 0-1): 1, 2, 7, 5 on the left side open to top-left \u2192 diagonals go down-right. 2, 8, 6, 4 on the right side open to top-right \u2192 diagonals go down-left\n- **Left side L-shapes** (rows 2-7): 2, 7, 5 open to top-left \u2192 diagonals go down-right\n- **Right side L-shapes** (rows 2-7): 6, 8, 2 open to top-right \u2192 diagonals go down-left\n\nI trace each diagonal from the L-shape corner, starting one cell away, and extend it across the grid. The diagonals converge toward the center, creating an X-pattern of intersecting colored lines.\n\n```\n0,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,0,0,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,0\n1,1,2,2,7,7,5,5,0,0,2,2,8,8,6,6,4,4\n0,2,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,6,0\n2,2,0,1,0,2,0,7,2,5,8,0,6,0,4,0,6,6\n0,7,2,0,1,0,2,2,7,8,5,6,0,4,0,6,8,0\n7,7,0,2,0,1,2,2,8,7,6,5,4,0,6,0,8,8\n0,5,7,0,2,2,1,8,2,6,7,4,5,6,0,8,2,0\n5,5,0,7,2,2,8,1,6,2,4,7,6,5,8,0,2,2\n0,0,5,2,7,8,2,6,1,4,2,6,7,8,5,2,0,0\n0,0,2,5,8,7,6,2,4,1,6,2,8,7,2,5,0,0\n0,2,0,8,5,6,7,4,2,6,1,8,2,2,7,0,5,0\n2,0,8,0,6,5,4,7,6,2,8,1,2,2,0,7,0,5\n0,8,0,6,0,4,5,6,7,8,2,2,1,0,2,0,7,0\n8,0,6,0,4,0,6,5,8,7,2,2,0,1,0,2,0,7\n0,6,0,4,0,6,0,8,5,2,7,0,2,0,1,0,2,0\n6,0,4,0,6,0,8,0,2,5,0,7,0,2,0,1,0,2\n0,4,0,6,0,8,0,2,0,0,5,0,7,0,2,0,1,0\n4,0,6,0,8,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,0,7,0,2,0,1\n```",
