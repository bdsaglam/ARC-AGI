        "Full raw LLM response": "Below is the rule I inferred and then applied; it is *one* consistent interpretation of the three training pairs, but note that ARC tasks are often under\u2011specified and multiple rules can fit the same examples. This rule focuses on **connecting successive connected components along diagonals**.\n\n---\n\n## Inferred transformation rule (conceptual)\n\n1. **Find all connected components**  \n   - A connected component (CC) is a maximal set of non\u2011zero cells connected by 4\u2011connectivity (up, down, left, right).\n   - Each CC has:\n     - A color.\n     - A bounding box: min/max row and column.\n     - An \u201canchor\u201d for ordering: the first cell of the component encountered in row\u2011major scan (top to bottom, left to right).\n\n2. **Order the components**  \n   - Sort components by the row\u2011major position of their anchor cell.\n   - Call them CC1, CC2, \u2026, CCn in that order.\n\n3. **For each CC\u1d62 (except the last), draw a diagonal towards CC\u1d62\u208a\u2081**  \n   For each i from 1 to n\u22121:\n\n   - Let color = color of CC\u1d62.\n   - Let `start` be the **bottom\u2011right corner** of CC\u1d62\u2019s bounding box:\n     - `start = (row_max\u1d62, col_max\u1d62)`.\n   - Let `target` be the **top\u2011left corner** of CC\u1d62\u208a\u2081\u2019s bounding box:\n     - `target = (row_min\u1d62\u208a\u2081, col_min\u1d62\u208a\u2081)`.\n\n   - Determine a diagonal step `(dr, dc)`:\n     - `dr = +1` if `target.row > start.row`, else `dr = -1`.\n     - `dc = +1` if `target.col > start.col`, else `dc = -1`.\n     - This yields one of four diagonal directions: NE, NW, SE, or SW.\n\n   - Initialize `current = (start.row + dr, start.col + dc)`.\n\n   - While:\n     - `current` is inside the grid, and\n     - `current` is **not inside the bounding box of any original CC** (we do not overwrite original components), and\n     - we have not stepped past the `target` in the given direction\n       (i.e. for `dr = +1` we require `current.row \u2264 target.row`, for `dr = -1` we require `current.row \u2265 target.row`; similarly for `dc` and columns),\n     \n     do:\n     - Color `current` with `color` of CC\u1d62.\n     - Advance `current \u2190 current + (dr, dc)`.\n\n4. **Do not extend from the last component**  \n   - For CC\u2099 we do nothing; we only draw diagonals from CC\u2081\u2026CC\u2099\u208b\u2081.\n\n5. **Preserve all original non\u2011zero cells**  \n   - The operation only adds new colored cells in previously zero positions; it never deletes or overwrites original non\u2011zeros.\n\n---\n\n## Applying the rule to the test input\n\n### 1.

        "Full raw LLM response": "First I\u2019ll describe the transformation I inferred, then I\u2019ll show exactly how I applied it to the test grid and give the final grid.\n\n---\n\n## Inferred transformation (conceptual description)\n\nFrom the three examples, the essential common behavior I extracted is:\n\n- Each **color** tends to appear in **two separated clusters** (often one near the top, another towards a side or lower down).\n- In the **output**, for several of these colors, a **45\u00b0 diagonal line** of that color is drawn between an upper cluster and a lower/side cluster (or between two distant parts of the same color).\n- These diagonals:\n  - are strictly 45\u00b0 (row and column both change by \u00b11 each step),\n  - **pass through** the existing colored endpoints,\n  - and **stop** when they reach the other intended endpoint (or the grid boundary).\n\nThis produces the \u201cV\u201d and zigzag patterns you can see in the solved examples: multiple colors are linked together via such diagonal segments, but each segment is drawn in a straight 45\u00b0 line.\n\nBecause the exact global strategy (how all colors are orchestrated together) is quite intricate and varies between examples, for the test I focused on a **local, per-color application** that is consistent with that diagonal-linking behavior:\n- For each color that clearly has a **top cluster** and a **lower or side cluster**, I draw a **single 45\u00b0 diagonal** connecting them.\n- If the endpoints already contain that color, those cells remain; otherwise they are filled.\n- I do **not** erase any original colors; I only add along the diagonals.\n\n---\n\n## Applying that to the test input\n\n### 1. Identify main clusters and choose endpoints\n\nLook at the top 2 rows and the side/bottom rows; the color layout suggests natural pairings:\n\n- **Color 7**:\n  - Top cluster: row 2, col 5 (also col 6, but we take the left one).\n  - Left/bottom cluster: row 6, col 1 (also row 5 col 2, etc.).\n  - Connect (2,5) to (6,1) by a 45\u00b0 diagonal going down-left.\n\n- **Color 5**:\n  - Top cluster: row 2, col 7.\n  - Left/bottom cluster: row 8, col 1.\n  - Connect (2,7) to (8,1) by a 45\u00b0 diagonal going down-left.\n\n- **Color 2 (left cluster)**:\n  - Top-left cluster already runs from (2,3) to (4,1), and those 2s are already arranged on a 45\u00b0 path. No extra diagonal is needed; it is already present.\n\n- **Color 2 (right cluster)**:\n  - Top-right cluster: row 2, col 12.\n  - Bottom-right cluster: row 8, col 18.\n  - Connect (2,12) to (8,18) with a 45\u00b0 diagonal down-right.\n\n- **Color 8**:\n  - Top-right cluster: row 2, col 14.\n  - Right/mid cluster: row 6, col 18.\n  - Connect (2,14) to (6,18) down-right.\n\n- **Color 6**:\n  - Top-right cluster: row 2, col 16.\n  - Upper-right side cluster: row 4, col 18.\n  - Connect (2,16) to (4,18) down-right.\n\n**Colors 1 and 4** in this test don\u2019t clearly have distinct separated top\u2013bottom clusters (in the same way as in the solved examples), and in the examples such \u201cend colors\u201d sometimes are not extended further, so I leave them unchanged.\n\n### 2. Compute the diagonal coordinates and fill them\n\nUsing strict 45\u00b0 steps (row\u00b11, col\u00b11):\n\n- **7-diagonal from (2,5) to (6,1)**:\n  - (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1)\n  - New 7s: (3,4), (4,3) (the others were already 7).\n\n- **5-diagonal from (2,7) to (8,1)**:\n  - (2,7), (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3), (7,2), (8,1)\n  - New 5s: (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), (6,3)\n    (2,7), (7,2), (8,1) already 5).\n\n- **2 (left)**:\n  - (2,3), (3,2), (4,1) already all 2; no change.\n\n- **2-diagonal from (2,12) to (8,18)**:\n  - (2,12), (3,13), (4,14), (5,15), (6,16), (7,17), (8,18)\n  - New 2s: (3,13), (4,14), (5,15), (6,16)\n    (2,12), (7,17), (8,18) already 2.\n\n- **8-diagonal from (2,14) to (6,18)**:\n  - (2,14), (3,15), (4,16), (5,17), (6,18)\n  - New 8s: (3,15), (4,16)\n    (2,14), (5,17), (6,18) already 8.\n\n- **6-diagonal from (2,16) to (4,18)**:\n  - (2,16), (3,17), (4,18)\n  - All three already 6, so no new cells.\n\nNo conflicts occur: where multiple steps might coincide, they are always with the same color or with a blank cell.\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\nStarting from the original test input grid and adding the new diagonal cells as above, the completed output grid is:\n\nRow 1 (unchanged):\n0,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,0,0,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,0\n\nRow 2 (unchanged):\n1,1,2,2,7,7,5,5,0,0,2,2,8,8,6,6,4,4\n\nRow 3 (with new 7 at c4, new 5 at c6, new 2 at c13, new 8 at c15):\n0,2,0,7,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,8,0,6,0\n\nRow 4 (with new 7 at c3, new 5 at c5, new 2 at c14, new 8 at c16):\n2,2,7,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,8,6,6\n\nRow 5 (with new 5 at c4, new 2 at c15):\n0,7,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,8,0\n\nRow 6 (with new 5 at c3, new 2 at c16):\n7,7,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,8,8\n\nRow 7 (unchanged):\n0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n\nRow 8 (unchanged):\n5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2\n\nRows 9\u201318 (unchanged, all zeros):\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n\nSo, as a compact 18\u00d718 output grid:\n\n0,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,0,0,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,0  \n1,1,2,2,7,7,5,5,0,0,2,2,8,8,6,6,4,4  \n0,2,0,7,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,8,0,6,0  \n2,2,7,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,8,6,6  \n0,7,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,8,0  \n7,7,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,8,8  \n0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0  \n5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**My thought process begins with the task: analyze several example inputs and a test case for an ARC problem. The goal is to deduce the underlying transformation.**\n\nI start with example 1, a 20x20 grid, and observe the shapes: colored blobs or structures of various sizes. My immediate goal is to map input colors to the output patterns. I notice the shapes generate what look like \"diagonal trails\" extending from their original positions. The example uses colors and numerical values to indicate them. I initially struggle with the pattern's direction, noticing both Up-Right and Down-Right trends. My approach centers on extracting a few test cases and examining the indices. I focus on single-pixel elements and 2x2 blocks of specific colors.\n\nMy analysis reveals that single pixels spawn trails along diagonals, with direction dependent on the pixel's color in some way. I try to formulate a specific rule: Single pixels at `(r, c)` spawn a trail to the top-right (`(r-k, c+k)`). This pattern isn't immediately obvious, so I dig deeper. When looking at the larger shapes, a diagonal pattern appears, but the starting point and direction remain unclear.\n\nI then move to example 2 (18x18 grid), where the shapes are also present. Again I look for a diagonal pattern, and I notice that the patterns are symmetric. I find that the shapes are moving downwards and to the right. I note that single pixels trigger diagonal movements; for example, the pixels at `(r, c)` spawn diagonal trails to the bottom-right and the top-left from the original position `(r, c)`.\n\nI then try to form a concrete rule. After reviewing the grid, I conclude there is a pattern in the trail formation that I can build on. I initially think the shapes are rotating but realize it's some sort of reflection. I then try an \"expansion\" view. I then start working on the test case, which is a symmetric arrangement with pairs.\n\nI focus on the direction and look at the \"converge to the center\" pattern that seems apparent.\n\nI check this against Ex 3 (20x20) grid with a mix of shapes. I think that shape defines the direction. I start constructing hypotheses. Based on example 3, which has shapes on the left side, I believe it \"slides\" in a predictable way. For example, if it's a shape on the left, it should go right; however, I cannot make a single rule here. I consider the shapes to be points. I look at each color.\n\nI then look back at the test input, which is where it should apply. The shape placement is symmetric. I check for relationships. I start with a simple idea, then look at the center. I begin the assumption that \"Left Shapes -> Down-Right Trail\" and \"Right Shapes -> Down-Left Trail.\" I am starting to think in terms of a shape-based transformation. I review the various examples that go against this approach. I look at the color and shape for patterns. At the heart of this problem is the bouncing.\n\nI also look at the shape as the start of some trail. The shapes are grouped in a \"Space Invader\" pattern. I move toward a specific set of rules. I then realize I am repeating a similar structure. I decide to be more methodical. I start to assume all shapes make a path to the outside of the grid. I test the hypothesis. I continue forward with the new \"Drop + Slide\" rules. I create the algorithm based on what I have seen. I also try to create rules about overlap. The process is very close to success, so I continue to think this is the core of the problem, and keep working this approach.\n\nAfter further careful thinking, the solution clicks: All shapes make trails that move outwards, with the angle determined by whether the shape is to the left or right of the vertical center of the grid. The test case is now easy to apply.\n\n\nThe transformation rule inferred from the examples is as follows:\n1.  **Identify Shapes:** The grid contains colored shapes (connected components of non-zero pixels).\n2.  **Determine Direction:**\n    *   Shapes located on the **left side** of the grid (columns 0 to `width/2 - 1`) project a trail **Down-Right** (delta row = +1, delta col = +1).\n    *   Shapes located on the **right side** of the grid (columns `width/2` to `width - 1`) project a trail **Down-Left** (delta row = +1, delta col = -1).\n    *   This effectively means all shapes project trails converging towards the bottom-center of the grid.\n3.  **Trail Origin:** Trails emanate from the bottom-most pixels of the shape that have a clear path in the projection direction.\n4.  **Obstacles:** If a trail encounters another shape immediately (within 1 step), it is blocked and does not form. This is observed in the top rows where shapes are packed closely. Only the inner-most shapes in a packed row emit long trails.\n5.  **Trail Propagation:** Trails continue until they reach the bottom of the grid or the side boundaries. If trails from different shapes intersect, the trail from the shape in a lower row (painted later) effectively overwrites the trail from the shape in a higher row.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Top Row (Rows 0-1):** Contains pairs of blocks.\n    *   Left Side: Blue (1), Red (2), Orange (7), Grey (5).\n        *   Blue (col 0-1) blocked by Red.\n        *   Red (col 2-3) blocked by Orange.\n        *   Orange (col 4-5) blocked by Grey.\n        *   **Grey (5)** at col 6-7 is free. **Trail starts at (1,7) -> Down-Right.**\n    *   Right Side: Red (2), Azure (8), Magenta (6), Yellow (4).\n        *   Yellow (col 16-17) blocked by Magenta.\n        *   Magenta (col 14-15) blocked by Azure.\n        *   Azure (col 12-13) blocked by Red.\n        *   **Red (2)** at col 10-11 is free. **Trail starts at (1,10) -> Down-Left.**\n\n*   **Middle/Bottom Rows (Isolated Shapes):**\n    *   **Row 2 Left:** Red (2) at (2,1)-(3,1). **Trail starts at (3,1) -> Down-Right.**\n    *   **Row 2 Right:** Magenta (6) at (2,16)-(3,16). **Trail starts at (3,16) -> Down-Left.**\n    *   **Row 4 Left:** Orange (7) at (4,1)-(5,1). **Trail starts at (5,1) -> Down-Right.**\n    *   **Row 4 Right:** Azure (8) at (4,16)-(5,16). **Trail starts at (5,16) -> Down-Left.**\n    *   **Row 6 Left:** Grey (5) at (6,1)-(7,1). **Trail starts at (7,1) -> Down-Right.**\n    *   **Row 6 Right:** Red (2) at (6,16)-(7,16). **Trail starts at (7,16) -> Down-Left.**\n\n**Generated Output Grid:**\n0,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,0,0,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,0\n1,1,2,2,7,7,5,5,0,0,2,2,8,8,6,6,4,4\n0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0\n2,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n0,7,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,6,8,0\n7,7,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,6,0,8,8\n0,5,2,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,6,0,0,2,0\n5,5,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,6,0,0,2,2\n0,0,5,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,5,0,7,0,2,0,0,5,0,8,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,0,5,0,7,0,2,5,0,8,0,0,0,0,6,0\n0,0,0,0,0,5,0,7,0,5,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,7,8,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,8,7,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,5,0,7,0,5,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,5,0,7,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,5,0,7,0,5,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,7,0,5,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Detailed Analysis and Solution for the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process on this ARC task. I need to figure out a transformation rule based on a few examples and apply it to a test input. It's all about grids of colored integers, and the challenge is to understand how the input grid gets turned into the output.\n\n**Initial Assessment:**\n\n*   **Grid Structure:** The inputs and outputs are grids of numbers, representing colors. The objective is to find the rule and generate an output.\n*   **Transformation:** This is where the game lies, finding the transformation rule from examples and then applying it to a new input.\n\n**Example 1 Deep Dive:**\n\n*   **Structure and Shapes:** The inputs have these 'L' shapes (or parts of diagonals), each with a specific color. I saw single pixel \"targets\" in the input that seem important.\n*   **The Diagonal Beam Hypothesis:** My hunch is that these 'L' shapes emit a beam, going diagonally. Looking at the output, the beam creates a diagonal trail from these shapes, and it is almost like the pixels are bouncing off a wall and going in the other direction.\n*   **Target Interaction:** Tracing the beams, they seem to hit the single-pixel targets and \"bounce\" off, forming a \"V\" pattern.\n*   **Reflection Logic:** Incoming beam, Target, Outgoing beam. It behaves like a reflection.\n\n**Example 2 and Initial Hypothesis Test:**\n\n*   **Shape Variety:** This example introduced lines instead of 'L' shapes, but still creates diagonal beams, following my hypothesis.\n*   **Beam Behavior:** The \"bounce\" is present for the lines as well.\n\n**Example 3 and Test Input Examination:**\n\n*   **Mixed Shape:** This is useful for it shows both line and L-Shape.\n*   **New Input:** A set of L-shapes are on the left and right. There are no single pixel targets.\n\n**The Test Input Analysis:**\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition:** It's a structured grid of L-shapes, with mirrored shapes. This makes me consider if beams interact, like reflecting off each other.\n*   **Beams and Directions:** I realize that the L-shapes have an empty space: it starts at the bottom-left corner which sends a beam down-right, or bottom-right corner which send a beam down-left. I start tracing the beam paths.\n\n**Interactions and Hypotheses Refinement:**\n\n*   **Initial Ideas:**\n    *   No targets.\n    *   Could the beams be reflecting?\n*   **Wall Reflection vs Interaction:** Considering this, I test for any collision between the beams, but there is no. If they hit a boundary, then the beam is \"bouncing\". The interaction logic must be simple: they either don't collide or the colors just overlay.\n*   **Wall Interaction:** I considered side walls, and the bottom, and that is where the beams bounce or stops.\n*   **The Termination Hypothesis:** They stop and end at the side boundaries, they terminate when hitting the bottom wall. Blue and Yellow is an exception, to terminate at corners, 17, 17 and 17, 0 respectively.\n*   **Final Hypothesis:**\n    *   Shapes emit diagonal beams.\n    *   Left-origin shapes: beams go Down-Right.\n    *   Right-origin shapes: beams go Down-Left.\n    *   Beams hit the grid boundaries, terminating when they hit the sides (at x=0 or x=17) or the bottom (at y=17).\n    *   No collisions, beams follow straight paths.\n\n**Implementing the Solution:**\n\n*   **Initialize:** Start with the input grid.\n*   **Beam Sources:** Manual set of \"emitters\" and their directions, based on the shape locations.\n*   **Beam Tracing:** Incrementing coordinates to find each beam pixel and setting them to the correct color in the grid.\n*   **Drawing:** Drawing the paths on the output grid.\n*   **Output:** Generated grid row by row.\n\nNow, I'll generate the output grid. I'm confident in my beam termination logic. It has a clean pattern with no pixel collisions.\n\n\nTo solve this task, we analyze the provided examples to infer the transformation rules.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Shapes and Beams:** The input grids contain \"L-shaped\" blocks of 3 pixels (a 2x2 block with one corner missing). These shapes act as \"emitters\" for diagonal lines (beams).\n2.  **Direction:**\n    *   Shapes on the **left** side (or oriented towards the right) emit beams traveling **down-right** (slope +1).\n    *   Shapes on the **right** side (or oriented towards the left) emit beams traveling **down-left** (slope -1).\n3.  **Termination/Reflection:**\n    *   In Example 1, beams reflect off \"target\" pixels.\n    *   In the Test Input, there are no single target pixels. Instead, we have a symmetric arrangement of emitters on the top row and side columns.\n    *   Based on the pattern analysis, beams travel diagonally until they hit a grid boundary (left wall, right wall, or bottom wall).\n    *   There is no evidence of overlapping beams mixing colors or continuing after hitting a wall in a way that causes collision in the center for this specific configuration (as deduced from the \"non-colliding\" paths of the symmetric emitters).\n    *   Therefore, the rule is: Trace the diagonal beam from the \"tip\" of the L-shape until it hits a wall (row 17, col 0, or col 17).\n\n**Transformation Logic for Test Input:**\n1.  **Identify Emitters:**\n    *   **Top Row (Left):**\n        *   Blue (1) at (1,1) -> Emits Down-Right.\n        *   Red (2) at (1,3) -> Emits Down-Right.\n        *   Orange (7) at (1,5) -> Emits Down-Right.\n        *   Gray (5) at (1,7) -> Emits Down-Right.\n    *   **Top Row (Right):**\n        *   Red (2) at (1,10) -> Emits Down-Left.\n        *   Teal (8) at (1,12) -> Emits Down-Left.\n        *   Pink (6) at (1,14) -> Emits Down-Left.\n        *   Yellow (4) at (1,16) -> Emits Down-Left.\n    *   **Side Column (Left):**\n        *   Red (2) at (3,1) -> Emits Down-Right.\n        *   Orange (7) at (5,1) -> Emits Down-Right.\n        *   Gray (5) at (7,1) -> Emits Down-Right.\n    *   **Side Column (Right):**\n        *   Pink (6) at (3,16) -> Emits Down-Left.\n        *   Teal (8) at (5,16) -> Emits Down-Left.\n        *   Red (2) at (7,16) -> Emits Down-Left.\n\n2.  **Trace Beams:**\n    *   **Blue (1):** Starts (1,1).

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I can see the transformation involves:\n1. Identifying L-shaped patterns at various positions\n2. Drawing diagonal lines extending from these L-shapes in their \"open\" direction\n3. Where multiple diagonals cross, they overlap/intersect\n\nIn the test input:\n- Top-left has L-shapes (colors 1,2,7,5) that open down-right\n- Top-right has L-shapes (colors 2,8,6,4) that open down-left\n- Left side has L-shapes (colors 2,7,5) opening down-right\n- Right side has L-shapes (colors 6,8,2) opening down-left\n\nThe diagonals from opposite sides will cross in the middle of the grid. Each L-shape's diagonal extends toward the center/opposite side.\n\nFor example:\n- Color 1 from (1,1) goes diagonally: (2,2), (3,3), (4,4)... toward (17,17)\n- Color 4 from (1,17) goes diagonally: (2,16), (3,15)... toward (17,1)\n- These meet around (9,9)\n\nFollowing this pattern for all L-shapes, diagonals cross at column 9 at various rows, creating an intersecting pattern.\n\n```\n0,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,0,0,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,0\n1,1,2,2,7,7,5,5,0,0,2,2,8,8,6,6,4,4\n0,2,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,0,2,0,8,0,6,0,6,0\n2,2,0,1,0,2,0,7,0,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,6,6\n0,7,2,0,1,0,2,0,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,0,8,0\n7,7,0,2,0,1,0,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,0,6,8,8\n0,5,7,0,2,0,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,0,6,0,2,0\n5,5,0,7,0,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,0,6,0,8,2,2\n0,0,5,0,7,0,2,0,6,0,4,0,6,0,8,0,2,0\n0,0,0,5,0,7,0,2,0,4,0,6,0,8,0,2,0,0\n0,0,2,0,5,0,7,0,2,0,6,0,8,0,2,0,5,0\n0,2,0,8,0,5,0,7,0,6,0,8,0,2,0,7,0,5\n2,0,8,0,6,0,5,0,6,0,8,0,2,0,2,0,7,0\n0,8,0,6,0,4,0,6,0,8,0,2,0,1,0,2,0,7\n8,0,6,0,4,0,6,0,8,0,2,0,2,0,1,0,2,0\n0,6,0,4,0,6,0,8,0,2,0,7,0,2,0,1,0,2\n6,0,4,0,6,0,8,0,2,0,5,0,7,0,2,0,1,0\n0,4,0,6,0,8,0,2,0,0,0,5,0,7,0,2,0,1\n```",
