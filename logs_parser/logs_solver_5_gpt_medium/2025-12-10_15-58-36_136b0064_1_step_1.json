Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**Comprehensive ARC Task Decoding**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got. The goal is to figure out this ARC task. The input is a grid, split in two by a yellow column. The right side has a number in the first row. The left side has a pattern of 3x3 blocks, also called glyphs, stacked vertically. The output is a new grid, always 7 columns wide.\n\nMy initial thought was the left side transforms to the output based on instructions from the right side. However, I\u2019ve refined it.\n\nThe initial \u201cball\u201d starts at the same column as the input number. \nThen, a series of interactions with the block glyphs occur.\n\nEach 3x3 block represents a sort of logic gate or switch or path determiner. There are four basic glyph types, each a distinct color, influencing the ball's movement.\n\n *   **Red (2)** looks like a \u201cU\u201d or \u201ccup\u201d: This moves to the next row down, and can slightly shift the horizontal position.\n *   **Blue (1)** looks like an arrow head: also moves to next row down, and can expand its width.\n *   **Magenta (6)** looks like a funnel: the most complicated.\n     *   When 'outside' of blocks in horizontal position, it acts like a trampoline! Or makes the ball go across the rows to different blocks.\n     *   When 'inside' horizontal blocks, it acts like the others, move down, change horizontal offset.\n     *   The output also includes a number of empty rows, like the vertical line of 6s, and the number of rows is related to the distance travelled.\n *   **Green (3)** looks like a bridge, or a flattened '3'.\n\nThe process flows like this:\n\n1.  **Initial Position:** Find the input grey pixel on the right side. That column is the initial starting position. It may represent a side (Left or Right).\n\n2.  **Level Traversal:**  Start at the top (level 0), and move down one 'row' in the grid at a time. The 'side' is given by initial pos, and changed by transitions.\n\n3.  **Block Interaction:** For each level, check the glyph at the current 'level' and on the current 'side'.\n    *   `pos` is considered inside or outside a block, based on its relative horizontal location.\n    *   If pos inside: Block-based horizontal location, move pos along, and set the color of next level pixel\n    *   if pos outside (or edge): the block becomes a jump or bounce or trampoline to another horizontal position.\n    *   The Block can cause an immediate transition, and cause multiple rows to be created.\n\n4.  **Output Generation:** Blocks each do 2 things to make the output:\n    *   They draw some pattern of the blocks color to the output.\n    *   They change the state.\n    *   There is a rule that it will eventually return to the top, so we will generate multiple rows.\n\nThis is a game of shifting, splitting, directing, and ultimately, building a path based on these symbols and a starting point. The goal is a path through a grid.\n\nThe output will be the drawn results for each level. The number of output rows will be determined by the Input grid size. Each level has a corresponding output row.  If level skips are created, then multiple output rows can exist.\n\nI need to confirm the exact effect of the Magenta block. It\u2019s the trickiest and likely involves jumping to different locations and creating vertical lines that need to be accounted for.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid into an output grid based on the rules inferred from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Task:**\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grid is divided into two parts by a vertical column of yellow '4's (usually at index 7).\n    *   **Left Part (Cols 0-6):** Contains a stack of 3x3 blocks separated by empty rows. These blocks act as instructions or deflectors.\n    *   **Right Part (Cols 8-14):** Contains a single grey pixel '5' in the top row. This represents the starting position of a \"ball\" or \"flow\". It may also contain blocks in the rows below, corresponding to the \"Right Side\" of the mechanism.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output is a 7-column wide grid. Its height corresponds to the input height. The content depicts the trajectory of the ball as it interacts with the blocks.\n3.  **Block Types & Interactions:**\n    *   **Red (Color 2):** \"Shift/Deflect\". Produces a row of `2,2` (width 2). If the ball is 'inside' the block's column range, it passes to the next level. If 'outside', it deflects to the other side (Left/Right) at the same level.\n    *   **Blue (Color 1):** \"Guide\". Produces a row of `1,1,1` (width 3). It tends to shift the ball position slightly (e.g., +1) and passes the ball to the next level.\n    *   **Magenta (Color 6):** \"Tunnel/Portal\". Produces a vertical line of `6`s. It transports the ball between levels (up or down) and usually switches the side (Left <-> Right). The length of the vertical line corresponds to the distance traveled (approx 2 rows per level difference).\n    *   **Green (Color 3):** \"Platform/Bounce\". Produces a row of `3,3,3,3` (width 4). It often sends the ball upwards or acts as a landing from a Magenta portal.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Input Layout:** 5 levels of blocks (Rows 0-2, 4-6, 8-10, 12-14, 16-18).\n    *   L0: Left=Blue(1), Right=Blue(1)\n    *   L1: Left=Red(2), Right=Blue(1)\n    *   L2: Left=Magenta(6), Right=Magenta(6)\n    *   L3: Left=Green(3), Right=Green(3)\n    *   L4: Left=Magenta(6), Right=Red(2)\n*   **Start:** Grey '5' at index 2 (Left side relative to center). Start at Level 0.\n\n**Trace:**\n1.  **Level 0 Left (Blue):** Ball enters at pos 2. Blue produces `0,1,1,1,0,0,0`. Ball moves to Next Level (L1). Pos shifts +1 -> 3.\n2.  **Level 1 Left (Red):** Ball at pos 3. This is outside the Left block (0-2). Red deflects to Right side. Produces `0,0,0,2,2,0,0`. Pos stays ~3.\n3.  **Level 1 Right (Blue):** Ball enters Right side. Blue produces `0,0,0,1,1,1,0`. Ball moves to Next Level (L2). Pos shifts +1 -> 4.\n4.  **Level 2 Right (Magenta):** Ball at pos 4. Magenta acts as a portal. Target is Level 3 Left (Green) (Crossing over and down). Distance 1 level -> 2 rows of 6s. Output `0,0,0,0,6,0,0` x2.\n5.  **Level 3 Left (Green):** Ball lands at Green. Produces `0,3,3,3,3,0,0`. Green bounces ball UP to Level 2 Left (Magenta).\n6.  **Level 2 Left (Magenta):** Ball enters from Green. Magenta portal targets Level 4 Left (Magenta) (Down 2 levels). Distance 2 levels -> 4 rows of 6s. Output `0,6,0,0,0,0,0` x4.\n7.  **Level 4 Left (Magenta):** Ball lands. Targets Level 4 Right (Red) (Same level, switch side). Distance 0? Or effectively a transition.\n8.  **Level 4 Right (Red):** Ball enters Red. Produces `0,0,0,0,2,2,0`.\n9.

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "Below is my reasoning process and why I\u2019m ultimately **not able to reliably reconstruct the rule**, followed by a placeholder output grid (all zeros) just to satisfy the \u201cmust output a grid\u201d requirement. The grid is **not** something I can justify from the examples.\n\n---\n\n## Reasoning\n\nWe\u2019re given three training examples. In each:\n\n- The input is a 15-column grid with a vertical column of `4`s at column 8.\n- To the left of that column (columns 1\u20137), there are recurring 3\u00d73 patterns made of colors `1`, `2`, `3`, and `6`.  \n- These 3\u00d73 patterns repeat across tasks and positions and look like \u201cglyphs\u201d for each color:\n  - Color `1` glyph (3\u00d73):\n    ```\n    1 1 0\n    1 0 1\n    0 1 0\n    ```\n  - Color `2` glyph (3\u00d73):\n    ```\n    2 0 2\n    2 0 2\n    2 2 2\n    ```\n  - Color `3` glyph (3\u00d73):\n    ```\n    3 3 3\n    0 3 0\n    3 0 3\n    ```\n  - Color `6` glyph (3\u00d73):\n    ```\n    6 0 6\n    0 6 0\n    0 6 0\n    ```\n- To the right of the `4`-column (columns 9\u201315) there is almost nothing but zeros, except for a single `5` (always in row 1, at some column).\n\nThe outputs:\n\n- Always have the **same height** as the input.\n- Always have **width 7** (so we\u2019re compressing the 15 columns into 7).\n- Contain only the colors {0,1,2,3,5,6}; the color `4` disappears.\n- Visually, the outputs are made of **much simpler shapes** that I can summarize as:\n  - A **single pixel** `5`.\n  - For each `1`-glyph: a **horizontal run of three `1`\u2019s** (`1 1 1`) in some row and columns.\n  - For each `2`-glyph: a **horizontal run of two `2`\u2019s** (`2 2`).\n  - For each `3`-glyph: a **horizontal run of four `3`\u2019s** (`3 3 3 3`).\n  - For each `6`-glyph: a **vertical pair** of `6`\u2019s (`6` above `6`) in some column.  \n    (Sometimes multiple `6`-pairs stack in the same column to make a longer vertical run.)\n\nSo, the input\u2019s left side is covered with these 3\u00d73 glyphs; the output re-encodes each glyph as a little 1D shape.\n\nHowever:\n\n- The **positions** of these output shapes (both row and column) depend on something I can\u2019t consistently infer.\n- They are **not** simply:\n  - Directly aligned to the original glyph\u2019s location.\n  - Sorted by color.\n  - Sorted by scan order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).\n  - Grouped strictly by \u201cleft glyph\u201d vs \u201cright glyph\u201d in each 3-row band.\n\nExamples:\n\n- In Example 3, there are:\n  - Two `2`-glyphs (both on the left side), and in the output there are two `2 2` horizontal segments at different rows and different column offsets.\n  - Three `6`-glyphs (left/right in different bands), becoming three vertical pairs of `6` but with columns 3, 4, and 5; their vertical positions do **not** directly match the bands.\n- In Example 1, three `6`-glyphs (two on the \u201cright\u201d side, one on the \u201cleft\u201d) become:\n  - A vertical run of length 4 at column 5 (apparently absorbing two clusters),\n  - And a vertical pair at column 2 (the other cluster).\n  So here column choice seems to depend on more global patterning, not just \u201cwhich side\u201d.\n\nI tried many hypotheses:\n\n- Row-wise rule per row: fails; rows with blank input sometimes get non-blank output.\n- Mapping vertical bands of height 3 to certain row blocks in output: not consistent across examples.\n- Sorting glyphs by color and placing in fixed stripes: contradicted by Example 2/3 order.\n- Grouping by left/right side or by band and drawing them in fixed output columns: cannot be made consistent across all three examples.\n- Any simple count-based or geometric compression mapping from 3\u00d73 glyph to 1D shape with deterministic positioning: I can match the shape-types (lengths and orientation) but **not** the spatial placement.\n\nThe number of examples is too small relative to the complexity of the layout rule. I can confidently identify:\n\n- **What** each 3\u00d73 glyph becomes (its local 1D symbol),\n- But not **where** that symbol is supposed to be placed in the 19\u00d77 test output.\n\nBecause the training outputs show different positional strategies that I can\u2019t reconcile into a unique function, **any attempt to place the shapes for the test input would be guesswork**. For ARC, the transformation is supposed to be fully deterministic and recoverable from examples; here, I cannot reconstruct it reliably.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion and Placeholder Output\n\nGiven that I cannot extract a consistent deterministic rule for *placement* from the three training examples, I cannot, in good faith, claim a correct transformed grid for the test input.\n\nHowever, the instructions require that I \u201cMUST also respond with the completed output grid\u201d. To satisfy that mechanically, I\u2019ll output a 19\u00d77 grid of zeros, with the explicit disclaimer that this is *not* derived from a confident understanding of the rule, and is almost certainly incorrect.\n\n### Output grid (placeholder, not justified by the examples)\n\n19 rows, 7 columns:\n\nRow 1: `0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow 2: `0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow 3: `0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow 4: `0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow 5: `0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow 6: `0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow 7: `0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow 8: `0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow 9: `0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow 10:`0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow 11:`0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow 12:`0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow 13:`0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow 14:`0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow 15:`0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow 16:`0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow 17:`0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow 18:`0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow 19:`0,0,0,0,0,0,0`",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**The ARC Task: A Decoding Adventure**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My goal is to build a program that translates input grids into output grids. I'm given three examples and a test case, so I need to find the underlying logic.\n\nFirst, I notice a pattern in the inputs: they're all 15 columns wide, and the height varies. There's a vertical yellow line splitting each grid, and on the left, there are these stacked shapes made of different colors. On the right, it's mostly empty, but there's always a single gray pixel near the top, which I need to keep track of.\n\nExample 1 reveals these 3x3 shapes are essentially \"symbols.\" They could be numbers or directions. Let's dig deeper: shape 2 (red), shape 6 (magenta), shape 1 (blue) and shape 3 (green), all have specific pixel patterns. And the '5' pixel on the right side seems like a reference point, let's call it $C_{target}$.\n\nNow, the outputs are smaller (7 columns) and seem related to the left side of the input. They\u2019re basically drawing a sequence. I see lines with lengths and colors. My hunch is that the input shapes encode actions to execute.\n\nLooking at Example 2 and 3, I notice shapes are drawn in a sequence and vertical shapes are on different rows. The key is in the shape colors! I hypothesize that there is a mapping between shapes and instructions. I will assume the order is: all \"left\" shapes, and then all \"right\" shapes. And consecutive moves in the same direction can merge.\n\nLet's test this order to decode the test input. It has 5 pairs of shapes (Blue, Blue), (Red, Blue), (Magenta, Magenta), (Green, Green), (Magenta, Red), each in a 3x3 pattern! Based on the examples, I know each output line must start from the position on the right side marked by '5', which is the starting point (row, col) = (0, 2). I must now trace the path created by each shape according to a formula: (Color from Shape), and (Direction and Length (Shape Dependent, which also includes starting column)).\n\nFrom the test input, starting at (0, 2), The instructions can be summarized and drawn out. The final output is:\n1.  Draw Blue(R3) horizontally (row 1). (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4).\n2.  Draw Red(L2) horizontally (row 2). (2, 4), (2, 3).\n3.  Draw Magenta(D2) vertically (rows 3,4). (3, 3), (4, 3).\n4.  Draw Green(L4) horizontally (row 5). (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0).\n5.  Draw Magenta(D2) vertically (rows 6,7). (6, 0), (7, 0).\n6.  Draw Blue(R3) horizontally (row 8). (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2).\n7.  Draw Blue(R3) horizontally (row 9). (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4).\n8.  Draw Magenta(D2) vertically (rows 10,11). (10, 4), (11, 4).\n9.  Draw Green(L4) horizontally (row 12). (12, 4), (12, 3), (12, 2), (12, 1).\n10. Draw Red(L2) horizontally (row 13). (13, 1), (13, 0).\n\nThe output must be a grid 19 rows high and 7 columns wide, and filled as instructed.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform an input grid into an output grid based on a set of rules inferred from examples.\n\n**Inferred Rules:**\n1.  **Input Structure**: The input contains a series of shape pairs (Left, Right) separated by a vertical yellow line (color 4) at column 7. To the right of the separator, there is a single grey pixel (color 5) in the top row (row 0), which marks the starting column for the output drawing.\n2.  **Shape Decoding**: The 3x3 shapes represent drawing instructions (Direction and Length). By correlating the shapes in the examples with the output segments, we identify:\n    *   **Blue Shape (1)**: Move **Right**, Length **3**.\n    *   **Red Shape (2)**: Move **Left**, Length **2**.\n    *   **Green Shape (3)**: Move **Left**, Length **4**.\n    *   **Magenta Shape (6)**: Move **Down**, Length **2**.\n3.  **Execution Sequence**: The instructions are collected from the input pairs. The order is determined by taking all **Left** shapes from top to bottom, followed by all **Right** shapes from top to bottom (i.e., L1, L2, ..., Ln, R1, R2, ..., Rn).\n4.  **Drawing Process**:\n    *   Start at the coordinate (Row 0, Col X), where X is the relative column index of the grey '5' pixel in the input's right section (Input Column Index - 8).\n    *   Process each instruction in the sequence:\n        *   **Horizontal Move (Left/Right)**: Increment the current Row by 1. Draw a horizontal line of the specified color and length starting from the current Column in the specified direction. Update the current Column to the end of the line.\n        *   **Vertical Move (Down)**: Increment the current Row by 1. Draw a vertical line of the specified color and length starting from the current Column. Update the current Row to the end of the line (Row + Length - 1). The Column remains unchanged.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Pairs**:\n    1.  (Blue, Blue) -> (Right 3, Right 3)\n    2.  (Red, Blue) -> (Left 2, Right 3)\n    3.  (Magenta, Magenta) -> (Down 2, Down 2)\n    4.  (Green, Green) -> (Left 4, Left 4)\n    5.  (Magenta, Red) -> (Down 2, Left 2)\n*   **Sequence**: L1(B), L2(R), L3(M), L4(G), L5(M), R1(B), R2(B), R3(M), R4(G), R5(R).\n*   **Start Position**: '5' is at input column 10. Relative column = 10 - 8 = **2**. Start at (0, 2).\n\n**Step-by-Step Execution:**\n1.  **L1 (Blue, Right 3)**: Row 1. Start (1, 2). Draw Right 3 -> (1, 2) to (1, 4). End Col 4.\n2.  **L2 (Red, Left 2)**: Row 2. Start (2, 4). Draw Left 2 -> (2, 4) to (2, 3). End Col 3.\n3.  **L3 (Magenta, Down 2)**: Row 3. Start (3, 3). Draw Down 2 -> (3, 3) to (4, 3). End Row 4.\n4.  **L4 (Green, Left 4)**: Row 5. Start (5, 3). Draw Left 4 -> (5, 3) to (5, 0). End Col 0.\n5.  **L5 (Magenta, Down 2)**: Row 6. Start (6, 0). Draw Down 2 -> (6, 0) to (7, 0). End Row 7.\n6.  **R1 (Blue, Right 3)**: Row 8. Start (8, 0). Draw Right 3 -> (8, 0) to (8, 2). End Col 2.\n7.  **R2 (Blue, Right 3)**: Row 9. Start (9, 2). Draw Right 3 -> (9, 2) to (9, 4). End Col 4.\n8.  **R3 (Magenta, Down 2)**: Row 10. Start (10, 4). Draw Down 2 -> (10, 4) to (11, 4). End Row 11.\n9.  **R4 (Green, Left 4)**: Row 12. Start (12, 4). Draw Left 4 -> (12, 4) to (12, 1). End Col 1.\n10. **R5 (Red, Left 2)**: Row 13. Start (13, 1). Draw Left 2 -> (13, 1) to (13, 0).

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand how the transformation works:\n\n1. The input has a left region (columns 0-6) with colored shapes, separated by a column of 4s (column 7), and a right region (columns 8-14) that's mostly empty except for a \"5\" marker.\n\n2. The left region is divided into blocks (separated by blank rows), each with a left shape (columns 0-2) and right shape (columns 4-6).\n\n3. The output uses the right region's space (7 columns wide) to draw a continuous path starting from the \"5\" position.\n\nFor the test input:\n- 5 is at position (0, 10), which translates to column 2 in the output\n- Block 0 (rows 0-2): 1-shape (1) on both sides - matching\n- Block 1 (rows 4-6): U-shape (2) left, 1-shape (1) right\n- Block 2 (rows 8-10): Y-shape (6) on both sides - matching  \n- Block 3 (rows 12-14): 3-shape (3) on both sides - matching\n- Block 4 (rows 16-18): Y-shape (6) left, U-shape (2) right\n\nThe path follows patterns I observed in the examples:\n- Alternates between horizontal and vertical segments\n- Segment lengths correspond to shape properties (top row cell count for horizontal, column extent for vertical)\n- For matching shapes in a block, the segment extends further\n- Colors follow: lefts first, then rights, with repeating shapes contributing additional segments\n\nTracing the path from (0,2):\n1. Color 1 going right (3 cells), then down (2 cells) - block 0\n2. Color 2 going left (2 cells), color 1 going down (3 cells) - block 1\n3. Color 6 going down (4 cells) - block 2\n4. Color 3 going left (4 cells), then down (3 cells) - block 3\n5. Color 6 going down (2 cells), color 2 going right (2 cells) - block 4\n\n```\n0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,1,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,1,0,0\n0,0,0,2,2,0,0\n0,0,0,1,0,0,0\n0,0,0,1,0,0,0\n0,0,0,1,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,0,0,0\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n2,2,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Below is the reasoning I used to construct a transformation and apply it to the test input. Note that this reasoning is inductive and heuristic; the ARC tasks do not reveal the ground truth rule, so I inferred a plausible mechanism consistent with major visible regularities in the examples.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Structural observations from the examples\n\n### 1.1. Input format\n\nAll given inputs share these features:\n\n- Width is 15 columns.\n- There is a **vertical column of 4s** at column 8 (1-based), acting like a fence.\n- **All the interesting colored patterns (1,2,3,6)** are on the **left** of this fence (columns 1\u20137).\n- On the **right** of the fence (columns 9\u201315) everything is zero except for **a single 5** somewhere on the first row.\n\nSo we can think of:\n\n- Left side (cols 1\u20137): \u201cicon area\u201d\n- Column 8: separator (color 4)\n- Right side (cols 9\u201315): \u201csummary area\u201d initially with one 5 on row 1.\n\n### 1.2. Output format\n\nFor all examples:\n\n- Height of the output equals height of the input.\n- Width is **7 columns**.\n- The 5 from the input appears on row 1 of the output, in a column corresponding to its horizontal offset from the 4-column:\n  - Example 1: 5 at input col 10 \u2192 output col 10\u20138 = 2\n  - Example 2: 5 at input col 12 \u2192 output col 4\n  - Example 3: 5 at input col 13 \u2192 output col 5\n\nSo:  \n**new_5_col = original_5_col \u2212 fence_col (8)**  \nRow remains 1.\n\nThat suggests the output is essentially a 7\u2011wide \u201csummary strip\u201d corresponding to the right side, into which we redraw information extracted from the left side, but keeping the 5 aligned by this offset rule.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The \u201cicon\u201d patterns on the left\n\nOn the left of the fence, all non-zero pixels (other than 0) appear in **3\u00d73 blocks** of a single color, with one of four distinct shapes:\n\nLet X denote the color of the block.\n\n1. **Type A: \u201cU\u201d shape**\n   ```\n   X 0 X\n   X 0 X\n   X X X\n   ```\n   In the data, this always appears with color 2.\n\n2. **Type B: \u201cT/column\u201d shape**\n   ```\n   X 0 X\n   0 X 0\n   0 X 0\n   ```\n   In the data, this always appears with color 6.\n\n3. **Type C: \u201cplus with empty lower-left\u201d**\n   ```\n   X X 0\n   X 0 X\n   0 X 0\n   ```\n   In the data, this always appears with color 1.\n\n4. **Type D: \u201ccross with full top row\u201d**\n   ```\n   X X X\n   0 X 0\n   X 0 X\n   ```\n   In the data, this always appears with color 3.\n\nThese 3\u00d73 \u201cicons\u201d occur in pairs per band of 3 rows, separated by completely empty rows (left of the 4):\n\n- Example grids are organized in vertical groups:\n  - 3 rows with icons (possibly two 3\u00d73 blocks, one on columns 1\u20133 and one on 5\u20137),\n  - 1 row of zeros (left side),\n  - then repeat.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Corresponding motifs in the outputs\n\nIn the outputs, those 3\u00d73 icons no longer appear. Instead, they are replaced by **simpler \u201cmotifs\u201d** in the 7\u2011wide summary area, with **area proportional to the number of icons of that type.**\n\nFor every occurrence of a particular icon type on the left, the output seems to add a fixed-size motif of that color:\n\n- **Type A (color 2)** \u2192 **horizontal segment of length 2**\n  - Example 1: one type\u2011A icon \u2192 one \u201c22\u201d segment (2 cells)\n  - Example 2: one type\u2011A icon \u2192 one \u201c22\u201d (2 cells)\n  - Example 3: two type\u2011A icons \u2192 two \u201c22\u201d segments (4 cells total)\n\n- **Type B (color 6)** \u2192 **vertical segment of length 2**\n  - Example 2: one type\u2011B icon \u2192 \u201c6\u201d on 2 vertically adjacent cells (2 cells)\n  - Example 3: three type\u2011B icons \u2192 three such segments, possibly stacked, total 6 pixels\n  - Example 1: three type\u2011B icons \u2192 total of 6 \u201c6\u201d pixels (a 4\u2011tall column + a 2\u2011tall one), consistent with 3\u00d72\n\n- **Type C (color 1)** \u2192 **horizontal segment of length 3**\n  - Example 1: three C\u2011icons \u2192 3 segments of 3 \u201c1\u201ds each; total 9 pixels\n  - Example 2: one C\u2011icon \u2192 \u201c111\u201d (3 pixels)\n  - Example 3: one C\u2011icon \u2192 \u201c111\u201d (3 pixels)\n\n- **Type D (color 3)** \u2192 **horizontal segment of length 4**\n  - Example 1: one D\u2011icon \u2192 \u201c3333\u201d (4 pixels)\n  - Example 2: one D\u2011icon \u2192 \u201c3333\u201d (4 pixels)\n  - Example 3: none\n\nSo **area (cell count) per icon type is constant:**\n\n- A: 2 cells\n- B: 2 cells\n- C: 3 cells\n- D: 4 cells\n\nThe exact placement of these motifs in the 7\u00d7H output appears instance\u2011specific and somewhat merged when multiple same-type motifs are adjacent (e.g., stacked B motifs fuse into a longer column), but the **total counts per type** are preserved.\n\n---\n\n## 4. A practical constructive scheme\n\nGiven the limited number of training examples and the complexity of exact placement, I adopt the following **constructive scheme** that:\n\n- Preserves the **5 position rule** (col = orig_col \u2212 8, row = 1),\n- Detects all 3\u00d73 icons on the left,\n- For each icon, draws the corresponding fixed\u2011size motif on the right,\n- Stacks motifs **sequentially downward** from row 2, in the order the icons appear when scanning the input top\u2011down and left\u2011to\u2011right, without overlapping.\n\nThis matches the relation \u201cone icon \u21d2 one motif of fixed shape and color and area\u201d and keeps the global structure consistent with the examples, even though the exact training grids use slightly different, instance\u2011specific layout.\n\n### 4.1. Detect icons in the test input\n\nTest grid is 19\u00d715 with 4\u2011column at col 8 and a single 5 at row 1 col 11.\n\nLeft side (cols 1\u20137) in 3\u2011row groups, separated by blank rows:\n\n- **Group 1** (rows 1\u20133):\n\n  - Cols 1\u20133:\n    ```\n    1 1 0\n    1 0 1\n    0 1 0\n    ```\n    = type C icon (color 1).\n  - Cols 5\u20137:\n    ```\n    1 1 0\n    1 0 1\n    0 1 0\n    ```\n    = type C (color 1) again.\n\n- **Group 2** (rows 5\u20137):\n\n  - Cols 1\u20133:\n    ```\n    2 0 2\n    2 0 2\n    2 2 2\n    ```\n    = type A (color 2).\n  - Cols 5\u20137:\n    ```\n    1 1 0\n    1 0 1\n    0 1 0\n    ```\n    = type C (color 1).\n\n- **Group 3** (rows 9\u201311):\n\n  - Cols 1\u20133:\n    ```\n    6 0 6\n    0 6 0\n    0 6 0\n    ```\n    = type B (color 6).\n  - Cols 5\u20137:\n    ```\n    6 0 6\n    0 6 0\n    0 6 0\n    ```\n    = type B (color 6).\n\n- **Group 4** (rows 13\u201315):\n\n  - Cols 1\u20133:\n    ```\n    3 3 3\n    0 3 0\n    3 0 3\n    ```\n    = type D (color 3).\n  - Cols 5\u20137:\n    ```\n    3 3 3\n    0 3 0\n    3 0 3\n    ```\n    = type D (color 3).\n\n- **Group 5** (rows 17\u201319):\n\n  - Cols 1\u20133:\n    ```\n    6 0 6\n    0 6 0\n    0 6 0\n    ```\n    = type B (color 6).\n  - Cols 5\u20137:\n    ```\n    2 0 2\n    2 0 2\n    2 2 2\n    ```\n    = type A (color 2).\n\nThus the **10 icons**, in scan order (top\u2011down, left\u2011to\u2011right), are:\n\n1. C (color 1)\n2. C (color 1)\n3. A (color 2)\n4. C (color 1)\n5. B (color 6)\n6. B (color 6)\n7. D (color 3)\n8. D (color 3)\n9. B (color 6)\n10. A (color 2)\n\n### 4.2. Decide motif shapes and positions\n\nWe take the output width as 7.\n\n- Fence is at col 8, 5 at input col 11:\n  - **new_5_col = 11 \u2212 8 = 3**\n  - Place `5` at output (row 1, col 3).\n\nThen for the 10 icons, process them in that scan order, stacking from row 2 downward:\n\n- Maintain a `currentRow` pointer, starting at 2.\n- For each icon:\n\n  - If **type C** (color 1) \u2192 draw `111` (horizontal length 3) centered on the 5:\n    - columns = new_5_col \u2212 1 .. new_5_col + 1 = 2..4\n    - draw on `currentRow`, then increment `currentRow` by 1.\n\n  - If **type A** (color 2) \u2192 draw `22` (horizontal length 2) to the right of center:\n    - columns = new_5_col .. new_5_col + 1 = 3..4\n    - draw on `currentRow`, then `currentRow += 1`.\n\n  - If **type B** (color 6) \u2192 draw vertical segment of two `6`s, two rows tall, to the right of the others:\n    - column = new_5_col + 2 = 5\n    - rows = currentRow and currentRow+1\n    - fill them with `6`, then `currentRow += 2`.\n\n  - If **type D** (color 3) \u2192 draw `3333` (horizontal length 4) spanning more to the right:\n    - columns = new_5_col \u2212 1 .. new_5_col + 2 = 2..5\n    - draw on `currentRow`, then `currentRow += 1`.\n\nApply this to the 10 icons:\n\n1. Icon1: C (1)\n   - row2, cols2\u20134 \u2192 `111`\n2. Icon2: C (1)\n   - row3, cols2\u20134 \u2192 `111`\n3. Icon3: A (2)\n   - row4, cols3\u20134 \u2192 `22`\n4.
