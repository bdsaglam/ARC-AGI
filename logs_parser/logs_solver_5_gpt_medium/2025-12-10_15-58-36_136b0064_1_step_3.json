        "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, here's my breakdown of how I'd approach this ARC task.**\n\nThe goal is to analyze patterns in input grids and generate corresponding output grids. I've noticed a few key structural elements: the vertical line of '4's (yellow) that divides the grid, and a repeating pattern of shapes to the left. The output seems to be a compressed or transformed version of those left-side shapes.\n\nMy plan is to first understand the shapes that are present, and their position, with emphasis on the relationship to the '5' in the input which seems to act as a marker. I'm going to look at three examples and one test input to determine a general solution. I'm going to determine a formula for the position and horizontal size of each feature. I plan to construct the output grid based on the identified formula.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the logic inferred from the solved examples.\n\n**Logic Analysis:**\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grids contain a series of 3x3 shapes in the left section (columns 0-6) and a vertical separator line of '4's at column 7. To the right of the separator, there is a '5' in the first row at a specific column index.\n2.  **Output Structure:** The output grid is narrower (width 7) and contains a vertical sequence of rows representing the shapes from the input.\n3.  **Processing Sequence:**\n    *   The input consists of blocks of 3 rows (separated by empty rows, though not always perfectly). Each block contains a \"Left Shape\" ($L$) in columns 0-2 and a \"Right Shape\" ($R$) in columns 4-6.\n    *   The output sequence is generated by taking all the Left Shapes from top to bottom, followed by all the Right Shapes from top to bottom.\n    *   Sequence: $L_1, L_2, ..., L_n, R_1, R_2, ..., R_n$.\n4.  **Shape Representation:** Each color/shape is rendered into the output grid with a specific \"bar\" representation:\n    *   **Color 1 (Blue):** A 1-row bar of width 3 (`1,1,1`).\n    *   **Color 2 (Red):** A 1-row bar of width 2 (`2,2`).\n    *   **Color 3 (Green):** A 1-row bar of width 4 (`3,3,3,3`).\n    *   **Color 6 (Magenta):** A 2-row bar of width 1 (`6` stacked on `6`).\n5.  **Positioning:**\n    *   The horizontal position of these bars is determined by the position of the '5' in the input.\n    *   Let $k$ be the column index of '5' in the output grid. This is calculated as `(Input Index of 5) - 8`.\n    *   The features are centered around column $k-1$.\n    *   Specifically:\n        *   Width 1 (Color 6) is at column $k-1$.\n        *   Width 2 (Color 2) is at columns $k-1, k$.\n        *   Width 3 (Color 1) is at columns $k-2, k-1, k$.\n        *   Width 4 (Color 3) is at columns $k-2, k-1, k, k+1$.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Determine $k$:**\n    *   Input '5' is at column 10.\n    *   Output $k = 10 - 8 = 2$.\n    *   Output marker row (Row 0) will have '5' at index 2.\n    *   Feature alignment anchor is $k-1 = 1$.\n\n2.  **Identify Shapes:**\n    *   Block 1: Left=1, Right=1.\n    *   Block 2: Left=2, Right=1.\n    *   Block 3: Left=6, Right=6.\n    *   Block 4: Left=3, Right=3.\n    *   Block 5: Left=6, Right=2.\n\n3.  **Create Sequence:**\n    *   Lefts: 1, 2, 6, 3, 6.\n    *   Rights: 1, 1, 6, 3, 2.\n\n4.  **Render Output Rows:**\n    *   **Row 0:** Marker `0,0,5,0,0,0,0`.\n    *   **Item 1 (L1=1):** Width 3 at cols 0,1,2 $\\rightarrow$ `1,1,1,0,0,0,0` (1 row).\n    *   **Item 2 (L2=2):** Width 2 at cols 1,2 $\\rightarrow$ `0,2,2,0,0,0,0` (1 row).\n    *   **Item 3 (L3=6):** Width 1 at col 1 $\\rightarrow$ `0,6,0,0,0,0,0` (2 rows).\n    *   **Item 4 (L4=3):** Width 4 at cols 0-3 $\\rightarrow$ `3,3,3,3,0,0,0` (1 row).\n    *   **Item 5 (L5=6):** Width 1 at col 1 $\\rightarrow$ `0,6,0,0,0,0,0` (2 rows).\n    *   **Item 6 (R1=1):** Width 3 at cols 0,1,2 $\\rightarrow$ `1,1,1,0,0,0,0` (1 row).\n    *   **Item 7 (R2=1):** Width 3 at cols 0,1,2 $\\rightarrow$ `1,1,1,0,0,0,0` (1 row).\n    *   **Item 8 (R3=6):** Width 1 at col 1 $\\rightarrow$ `0,6,0,0,0,0,0` (2 rows).\n    *   **Item 9 (R4=3):** Width 4 at cols 0-3 $\\rightarrow$ `3,3,3,3,0,0,0` (1 row).\n    *   **Item 10 (R5=2):** Width 2 at cols 1,2 $\\rightarrow$ `0,2,2,0,0,0,0` (1 row).\n    *   **Remaining rows:** Fill with 0.\n\n**Completed Output Grid:**\n0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n1,1,1,0,0,0,0\n0,2,2,0,0,0,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,0,0,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n1,1,1,0,0,0,0\n1,1,1,0,0,0,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,0,0,0\n0,2,2,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Deep Dive into ARC Problem-Solving: A Pinball Physics Simulation**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an intriguing ARC task. It's like a pinball simulation, where I'm given examples and need to predict the output grid. The input is a bit weird, with a column of '4's acting as a divider, and the left side containing a sequence of 3x3 blocks. On the right, there's usually a single '5', which I believe represents the ball's starting position. The output is a series of colored pixel \"lines\" and \"blocks\".\n\n**Dissecting the Input:**\n\nThe input, it seems, is a \"course\" with a \"ball\" and I'm supposed to figure out how the ball travels through this course and what the \"blocks\" do to redirect the ball. The key is in the 3x3 shapes: each unique shape appears consistently for the same function.\n\n**The Output Clues:**\n\nThe output width matches the right side of the input, and it's built from the patterns on the left side, which act like the instructions for how the pinball machine works. The color of these blocks is also consistent, they will be used as a key for identifying them.\n\n**The Core Hypothesis:**\n\nThe left side of the input provides the building blocks for the course - and its rules.\n\nThe ball's starting position ('5') and the course layout of blocks determines how the pinball machine will run and where the ball goes, based on the blocks' properties.\n\n**Decoding the Blocks (The \"Instructions\"):**\n\nI need to figure out what each unique 3x3 block shape means.  There seem to be 4 distinct shapes, maybe they are just 4 different building blocks which determine a pinball course?\n\nShape (U): This might be a \"catch\" and shift the ball in some way.\nShape (Y): Maybe a funnel or a \"swap\" tool?\nShape (R): This might cause the ball to change direction.\nShape (I): This must be \"straight\" somehow or block stuff.\n\n**Simulating the Ball's Journey:**\n\nSo, the ball \"falls\" through a series of \"layers,\" defined by the 3x3 block pairs. It's like a game where the arrangement of the blocks dictates the ball's movement.\n\n**Here's the pinball machine action**:\n-   Ball starts from right side (the '5').\n-   The ball interacts with either the left or right blocks in that layer (each 3x3) based on its current column.\n-   The block produces an output drawing a pattern and modifies the ball's position.\n-   If the ball changes zones, the same layer is \"hit\" again but with different side\n-   This pattern repeats layer by layer.\n\nFor example, If the ball has an initial position, then it will encounter the first pair of blocks in that row, in this example, R and Y.  The output will be drawn from the action of either or both of these two blocks, and the ball might also change position.  The ball, now in a modified state moves down to the next row and repeat this process.\n\n**Hypothetical Block Behaviors**:\n\n*   **R Block (Diagonal):**  Creates horizontal lines in some way, shift the ball by +2.\n*   **U Block (Cup):** Produces a 'catch' for the ball and keeps its position.\n*   **Y Block (Funnel):** Depending on which part of the Y is hit, the ball can be repositioned.\n*   **I Block (Horizontal bar):** Produces wide pattern but doesn't affect the location of the ball.\n\nI've got the general idea and the specific output patterns that each block should produce.\n\nNow I have a way to build this pinball course from the input examples, the location of the ball ('5') determines which path it will travel and the ball might bounce back and forth between columns.\n\nI should construct my output, based on the identified pattern.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the problem is a simulation of a ball dropping through a series of obstacles defined by the 3x3 patterns on the left side of the input grid.\n\n**Rules inferred:**\n1.  **Grid Setup:** The input consists of a Left Side (instruction patterns) and a Right Side (initial state), separated by a column of '4's. The output grid corresponds to the 7-column width of the Right Side.\n2.  **Ball:** The '5' pixel in the top row of the Right Side represents the ball. Its starting column determines the initial path.\n3.  **Layers:** The Left Side contains rows of two 3x3 blocks (Left Block and Right Block). Each pair of blocks forms a \"Layer\".\n4.  **Interaction Logic:**\n    *   The ball falls through the layers.\n    *   If the ball is on the Left side (cols 0-2), it interacts with the Left Block.\n    *   If the ball is on the Right side (cols 4-6), it interacts with the Right Block.\n    *   If the ball is in the Gap (col 3), it tends to interact with the Left Block (or follows a specific gap rule).\n5.  **Block Types & Effects:**\n    *   **R-shape (Color 1):** Deflects the ball to the Right. Produces output `1 1 1` centered on the ball's path.\n    *   **U-shape (Color 2):** Catches/Holds the ball. Produces output `2 2` at the ball's position.\n    *   **I-shape (Color 3):** Platform. Produces output `3 3 3 3` (usually centered/left-aligned).\n    *   **Y-shape (Color 6):** Swap/Portal. If hit, it often swaps the ball to the corresponding position on the opposite side (Left<->Right) and activates the block on that side. If the destination block is also a Y-shape (or if hit from the \"inside\"), it produces a vertical `6` line.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Ball Start:** Column 2 (Left side of the 7-column output space).\n*   **Layer 1:** Left `R` (1), Right `R` (1).\n    *   Ball is at 2 (Left). Hits Left `R`.\n    *   Output: `1 1 1` (Color 1).\n    *   Effect: Deflects Right. Ball moves to ~Col 4.\n*   **Layer 2:** Left `U` (2), Right `R` (1).\n    *   Ball is at 4 (Right). Hits Right `R`.\n    *   Output: `1 1 1` (Color 1).\n    *   Effect: Deflects Right. Ball moves to ~Col 6.\n*   **Layer 3:** Left `Y` (6), Right `Y` (6).\n    *   Ball is at 6 (Right). Hits Right `Y`.\n    *   Effect: Swaps/Bounces. The Y-shape directs inwards. Since it's a double Y layer, this likely triggers a \"Fall Through\" or \"Swap back\" creating a vertical line. Based on Ex 1, Y interaction produces a vertical `6`.\n    *   Output: `6` (Color 6). Vertical line (2 rows).\n    *   Ball Position: Resets to center/left? Let's assume it directs to Left.\n*   **Layer 4:** Left `I` (3), Right `I` (3).\n    *   Ball (now Left/Center) hits Left `I` (or general `I` interaction).\n    *   Output: `3 3 3 3` (Color 3).\n*   **Layer 5:** Left `Y` (6), Right `U` (2).\n    *   Ball hits Left `Y`.\n    *   Effect: Swaps to Right side. Activates Right `U`.\n    *   Output: `2 2` (Color 2).\n\n**Sequence of Output Patterns:**\n1.  Ball `5` at top.\n2.  `1 1 1` (shifted left/center).\n3.  `1 1 1` (shifted right).\n4.  `6` (vertical line).\n5.  `3 3 3 3`.\n6.  `2 2` (shifted right).\n\n**Completed Output Grid:**\n0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,1,1,1,0,0,0\n0,0,0,1,1,1,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,3,3,3,3,0,0\n0,0,0,0,2,2,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this puzzle, I need to understand the transformation from input to output.\n\n**Key observations:**\n\n1. The input has a divider column (all 4s) separating two regions:\n   - Left region (cols 0-6): Contains 3x3 shape patterns arranged in sections\n   - Right region (cols 8-14): Contains a starting position marked by \"5\" and becomes the output\n\n2. The left region is divided into sections by empty rows, with each section having:\n   - A left pattern (cols 0-2)\n   - A right pattern (cols 4-6)\n\n3. Each shape type indicates a direction and path length:\n   - Shape 1 (diagonal pattern): Move RIGHT, 3 cells\n   - Shape 2 (U-shape): Move LEFT, 2 cells  \n   - Shape 3 (T-shape): Move LEFT, 4 cells\n   - Shape 6 (V-shape): Move DOWN, 2 cells\n\n4. The traversal order visits: all left shapes (top to bottom), then all right shapes (top to bottom)\n\n**Applying to test input:**\n\nTest input has 5 sections with shapes:\n- Section 0: left=1, right=1\n- Section 1: left=2, right=1\n- Section 2: left=6, right=6\n- Section 3: left=3, right=3\n- Section 4: left=6, right=2\n\nStarting position: Row 0, Column 2 (5 is at input col 10)\n\nTraversal: 1(R3), 2(L2), 6(D2), 3(L4), 6(D2), 1(R3), 1(R3), 6(D2), 3(L4), 2(L2)\n\nTracing the path:\n- Row 0: Start at col 2 (5)\n- Row 1: Color 1, cols 2-4 (right 3)\n- Row 2: Color 2, cols 3-4 (left 2)\n- Rows 3-4: Color 6, col 3 (down 2)\n- Row 5: Color 3, cols 0-3 (left 4)\n- Rows 6-7: Color 6, col 0 (down 2)\n- Row 8: Color 1, cols 0-2 (right 3)\n- Row 9: Color 1, cols 2-4 (right 3)\n- Rows 10-11: Color 6, col 4 (down 2)\n- Row 12: Color 3, cols 1-4 (left 4)\n- Row 13: Color 2, cols 0-1 (left 2)\n\n```\n0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,1,1,0,0\n0,0,0,2,2,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,0,0,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n1,1,1,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,1,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,3,3,3,3,0,0\n2,2,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "First, I\u2019ll describe the transformation I inferred from the solved examples, and how I apply it to the test input. Then I\u2019ll give the final output grid explicitly.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Interpreting the examples\n\nEach input grid has:\n\n- A fixed separator column full of color `4` (column 8 in all cases).\n- To the **left** of this separator (columns 1\u20137) there are repeated 3\u00d73 patterns (\u201cglyphs\u201d) of certain colors.\n- To the **right** (columns 9\u201315) there is usually all `0`, except in some puzzles there is a single `5` that acts as a tag line.\n\nFrom the solved examples, I identify 4 glyph types on the **left**:\n\n1. **X glyph** (color `c`):\n   ```\n   c,c,0\n   c,0,c\n   0,c,0\n   ```\n   Output code: a horizontal run of three `c` in one row.\n\n2. **T glyph** (color `c`):\n   ```\n   c,0,c\n   c,0,c\n   c,c,c\n   ```\n   Output code: a horizontal run of two `c` in one row.\n\n3. **Star glyph** (color `c`):\n   ```\n   c,c,c\n   0,c,0\n   c,0,c\n   ```\n   Output code: a horizontal run of four `c` in one row.\n\n4. **Y glyph** (color `c`):\n   Pattern of one color with two at the top row corners and then a vertical stem, e.g. for `6`:\n   ```\n   6,0,6\n   0,6,0\n   0,6,0\n   ```\n   Output code: a vertical run of two `c` in one column (occupying two consecutive rows).\n\nAlso:\n\n- If a row has a nonzero segment **right of the `4`** (only seen as a single `5` in the examples), that row is **copied verbatim** into the output.\n\n- The left-side glyphs are processed as **discrete glyph objects** found in 3-row blocks separated by all-zero rows on the left.\n\n- All glyphs are collected, **sorted** by:\n  1. Their left/right block column (left block at col1\u20133 before right block at col5\u20137),\n  2. Their top row (ascending),\n  \n  to give a single ordered list of glyphs S.\n\n- The output has the **same height** as the input and width 7.  \n  Starting at **row 2**, the glyphs in S are placed in sequence, each using one or two rows:\n  - X: 1 row.\n  - T: 1 row.\n  - Star: 1 row.\n  - Y: 2 rows.\n\n- Any rows after all glyphs are placed are filled with `0`.\n\nFor the **horizontal positions** of the codes, I use a consistent canonical placement that matches how the second example is drawn (and is compatible enough with the others for this reconstruction):\n\n- X glyph code: `0,0,0,1,1,1,0` (three `1`s in columns 4\u20136).\n- T glyph code (for color `2`): `0,0,0,0,2,2,0` (two `2`s in columns 5\u20136).\n- Star glyph code (for color `3`): `0,3,3,3,3,0,0` (four `3`s in columns 2\u20135).\n- Y glyph code (for color `6`): vertical: each of its two rows is `0,0,0,0,0,6,0` (a `6` in column 6).\n\nRow 1 of the output is always copied from the right side of row 1 of the input (columns 9\u201315 \u2192 columns 1\u20137).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying the rule to the test input\n\n### 2.1. Copy row 1\u2019s right side\n\nRow 1 of the test input:\n`1,1,0,0,1,1,0,4,0,0,5,0,0,0,0`\n\nRight of the `4` (cols 9\u201315): `0,0,5,0,0,0,0`\n\nSo output row 1 is:\n`0,0,5,0,0,0,0`\n\n### 2.2. Identify glyphs on the left\n\nLeft of the `4` (cols 1\u20137), the grid is partitioned by completely zero rows (at rows 4, 8, 12, 16). Each nonzero 3-row block contains two 3\u00d73 glyphs: one at cols 1\u20133, one at cols 5\u20137.\n\nBlocks:\n\n- **Block 1 (rows 1\u20133):**\n  - Cols1\u20133:\n    ```\n    1,1,0\n    1,0,1\n    0,1,0\n    ```\n    \u2192 X glyph, color 1 \u2192 X_L1.\n  - Cols5\u20137:\n    ```\n    1,1,0\n    1,0,1\n    0,1,0\n    ```\n    \u2192 X glyph, color 1 \u2192 X_R1.\n\n- **Block 2 (rows 5\u20137):**\n  - Cols1\u20133:\n    ```\n    2,0,2\n    2,0,2\n    2,2,2\n    ```\n    \u2192 T glyph, color 2 \u2192 T_L1.\n  - Cols5\u20137:\n    ```\n    1,1,0\n    1,0,1\n    0,1,0\n    ```\n    \u2192 X glyph, color 1 \u2192 X_R2.\n\n- **Block 3 (rows 9\u201311):**\n  - Cols1\u20133:\n    ```\n    6,0,6\n    0,6,0\n    0,6,0\n    ```\n    \u2192 Y glyph, color 6 \u2192 Y_L1.\n  - Cols5\u20137:\n    ```\n    6,0,6\n    0,6,0\n    0,6,0\n    ```\n    \u2192 Y glyph, color 6 \u2192 Y_R1.\n\n- **Block 4 (rows 13\u201315):**\n  - Cols1\u20133:\n    ```\n    3,3,3\n    0,3,0\n    3,0,3\n    ```\n    \u2192 Star glyph, color 3 \u2192 Star_L1.\n  - Cols5\u20137:\n    ```\n    3,3,3\n    3,0,3\n    3,0,3\n    ```\n    (variant but still a \u201cstar-like\u201d glyph of color 3) \u2192 Star_R1.\n\n- **Block 5 (rows 17\u201319):**\n  - Cols1\u20133:\n    ```\n    6,0,6\n    0,6,0\n    0,6,0\n    ```\n    \u2192 Y glyph, color 6 \u2192 Y_L2.\n  - Cols5\u20137:\n    ```\n    2,0,2\n    2,0,2\n    2,2,2\n    ```\n    \u2192 T glyph, color 2 \u2192 T_R2.\n\nSo we have 10 glyphs (left group, then right group):\n\nLeft-column glyphs (col1\u20133), sorted by row:\n1. X_L1  (top at row 1)\n2. T_L1  (top at row 5)\n3. Y_L1  (top at row 9)\n4. Star_L1 (top at row 13)\n5. Y_L2  (top at row 17)\n\nRight-column glyphs (col5\u20137), sorted by row:\n6.

T_R2 (top at row 17)\n\nCombined sequence S in the processing order:\nS = [X_L1, T_L1, Y_L1, Star_L1, Y_L2, X_R1, X_R2, Y_R1, Star_R1, T_R2].\n\n### 2.3. Place glyph codes into output rows\n\nStart at output row pointer `r = 2` (row 1 already used for the copied `5` row).\n\nFor each glyph in S:\n\n- **X** \u2192 one row, pattern `0,0,0,1,1,1,0`.\n- **T** \u2192 one row, pattern `0,0,0,0,2,2,0`.\n- **Star** \u2192 one row, pattern `0,3,3,3,3,0,0`.\n- **Y** \u2192 two rows, each `0,0,0,0,0,6,0`.\n\nProcess:\n\n1.

        "Full raw LLM response": "First I\u2019ll describe the structural pattern I extracted from the three training examples, then I\u2019ll show how I applied that pattern to the test grid and give the resulting output grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Structural observations from the examples\n\n### 1.1. Geometry of the input\n\nIn all examples (and in the test input):\n\n- Each grid has 15 columns.\n- Column 8 (1\u2011based) is a vertical line of 4s, acting as a separator.\n- To the right of this separator (columns 9\u201315) everything is 0 except a single 5 in the first row.\n- To the left of the separator (columns 1\u20137) there are \u201cblocks\u201d of colored patterns:\n  - Blocks are vertical regions of consecutive rows that contain nonzero colors in columns 1\u20137.\n  - Blocks are separated by rows in which columns 1\u20137 are all 0 (aside from the 4 in column 8).\n\nFor each input you can segment the rows into such blocks.  \nExample (test input, columns 1\u20137):\n\n- Block 1: rows 1\u20133, colors {1}\n- Row 4: all-0 separator\n- Block 2: rows 5\u20137, colors {1,2}\n- Row 8: separator\n- Block 3: rows 9\u201311, colors {6}\n- Row 12: separator\n- Block 4: rows 13\u201315, colors {3}\n- Row 16: separator\n- Block 5: rows 17\u201319, colors {2,6}\n\nSo there are **5 blocks** in the test input.\n\nThis same type of segmentation appears in all three training examples: each has several 3\u2011row (or similar) blocks of colored patterns to the left of the 4\u2011column, separated by empty rows.\n\n---\n\n### 1.2. Shape \u201cglyphs\u201d for each color\n\nLooking at the **outputs** of the three examples, several consistent facts emerge:\n\n- The output always has the same number of rows as the input.\n- The output has exactly **7 columns**.\n- The only nonzero colors in the output are **1,2,3,5,6**.\n- Colors appear in very regular canonical shapes (\u201cglyphs\u201d) that are **independent** of the detailed shape in the input:\n\nFrom all three examples:\n\n- **Color 5**: a single cell, on row 1 only.\n- **Color 1**: always appears as a **horizontal bar of length 3** (three 1s in a row).\n- **Color 2**: always a **horizontal bar of length 2** (two 2s in a row).\n- **Color 3**: always a **horizontal bar of length 4** (four 3s in a row).\n- **Color 6**: always a **vertical bar of length 2** (two 6s in the same column in consecutive rows).\n\nThese shapes are consistent across examples:\n\n- Example 1:\n  - 2s: one bar \u201c2,2\u201d (row 2).\n  - 3s: one bar of 4 (row 9).\n  - 1s: three separate 3-long bars (rows 3, 4, 12).\n  - 6s: three 2-high vertical bars (though two are stacked, forming a run of 4).\n  - 5: a single cell in row 1.\n\n- Example 2:\n  - 1: one bar of 3.\n  - 2: one bar of 2.\n  - 3: one bar of 4.\n  - 6: one 2-high vertical bar.\n  - 5: single at row 1.\n\n- Example 3:\n  - 1: one bar of 3.\n  - 2: two bars of 2.\n  - 6: three separate 2-high vertical bars.\n  - 5: single at row 1.\n\nSo we can view the output as composed of a multiset of these fixed glyphs.\n\n---\n\n### 1.3. How many glyphs per color?\n\nIf you count **blocks** in which each color appears in the input (left of the 4\u2011column), it matches exactly the number of glyphs of that color in the output:\n\n- Example 1:\n  - Blocks (left of column 8) and colors:\n    - Block A: {2,6}\n    - Block B: {1,3}\n    - Block C: {1,6}\n    - Block D: {1,6}\n  - Color-by-block presence:\n    - 1 in B,C,D \u2192 3 blocks \u2192 3 glyphs of 1 (three 3-long bars).\n    - 2 in A \u2192 1 block \u2192 1 bar of 2.\n    - 3 in B \u2192 1 block \u2192 1 bar of 4.\n    - 6 in A,C,D \u2192 3 blocks \u2192 3 vertical 2-high bars of 6.\n    - 5 only once on the right \u2192 1 single cell.\n\n- Example 2:\n  - Block 1: {1,2}\n  - Block 2: {3,6}\n  - So 1,2,3,6 each appear in exactly 1 block \u2192 exactly 1 glyph each in the output.\n\n- Example 3:\n  - Block 1: {2,6}\n  - Block 2: {1,6}\n  - Block 3: {2,6}\n  - So:\n    - Color 1 in 1 block \u2192 1 glyph of 1 (one 3-long bar).\n    - Color 2 in 2 blocks \u2192 2 glyphs of 2 (two 2-long bars).\n    - Color 6 in 3 blocks \u2192 3 vertical bars.\n    - No 3 in any block \u2192 no 3 in the output.\n    - 5 once \u2192 one single.\n\nThis pattern is perfectly consistent and is the **key** abstraction:\n\n> **Rule 1: For each color c \u2208 {1,2,3,6}, the number of glyphs of color c in the output equals the number of left-of-4 blocks that contain color c.**\n\n> **Rule 2: Color 5 appears exactly once in the output, from the unique 5 in the input.**\n\nThe **positions** of glyphs are used to avoid overlaps and to keep them visually separated, but they don\u2019t alter the count per color.\n\n---\n\n### 1.4. Horizontal position of the 5\n\nThe 5 is special: it is the only meaningful pixel to the **right** of the vertical 4\u2011column.\n\nEmpirically:\n\n- Example 1: 5 is at input column 10 \u2192 output column 2.\n- Example 2: 5 at input column 12 \u2192 output column 4.\n- Example 3: 5 at input column 13 \u2192 output column 5.\n\nIn all cases:\n\n- Separator 4 is at column 8.\n- The mapping follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{output\\_col}(5) = \\text{input\\_col}(5) - 8.\n\\]\n\nCheck:\n\n- Example 1: 10\u20138 = 2 \u2713\n- Example 2: 12\u20138 = 4 \u2713\n- Example 3: 13\u20138 = 5 \u2713\n\nSo:\n\n> **Rule 3: Place the single 5 at (row 1, column input_col(5) \u2212 8) in the output.**\n\nThere is no 4 in the output.\n\n---\n\n### 1.5. Summary of the abstraction\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n1. Identify the vertical 4\u2011separator (column 8). Everything is based on columns 1\u20137 and the unique 5 to the right.\n2. Split the rows into vertical **blocks** separated by rows whose columns 1\u20137 are all 0.\n3. For each block, record which colors from {1,2,3,6} appear in that block.\n4. For each color c, let `k_c` be the number of blocks in which c appears. In the output, draw exactly `k_c` **glyphs** for color c:\n   - Color 1: `k_1` horizontal bars of length 3.\n   - Color 2: `k_2` horizontal bars of length 2.\n   - Color 3: `k_3` horizontal bars of length 4.\n   - Color 6: `k_6` vertical bars of height 2.\n5. Place the single 5 at row 1, column `input_col(5) \u2212 8`.  \n   All other output cells default to 0.\n6. Glyphs are placed so that they:\n   - Do not overlap one another horizontally.\n   - 6\u2019s vertical bars do not overwrite existing nonzeros.\n   - The exact row/column positions are chosen in a consistent top-down, left-to-right manner within the available 7\u00d7N canvas.\n\nThe **exact layout pattern** of these glyphs (which row each bar goes on) is more about arrangement and spacing; the key invariant is: \u201ccount of glyphs per color = count of blocks with that color, and glyph shapes are fixed\u201d.\n\nFor the **test**, we follow the same principle: count blocks, determine needed glyphs, and lay them out compactly without overlaps.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying the abstraction to the test input\n\n### 2.1. Count blocks and color appearances\n\nFrom the test input (columns 1\u20137 only):\n\nBlocks and their colors:\n\n- **Block 1**: rows 1\u20133 \u2192 colors {1}\n- **Block 2**: rows 5\u20137 \u2192 colors {1,2}\n- **Block 3**: rows 9\u201311 \u2192 colors {6}\n- **Block 4**: rows 13\u201315 \u2192 colors {3}\n- **Block 5**: rows 17\u201319 \u2192 colors {2,6}\n\nCount per color:\n\n- Color 1:\n  - Appears in blocks 1 and 2 \u2192 `k\u2081 = 2` glyphs.\n- Color 2:\n  - Appears in blocks 2 and 5 \u2192 `k\u2082 = 2` glyphs.\n- Color 3:\n  - Appears only in block 4 \u2192 `k\u2083 = 1` glyph.\n- Color 6:\n  - Appears in blocks 3 and 5 \u2192 `k\u2086 = 2` glyphs.\n- Color 5:\n  - Appears once, at row 1, column 11 of the input (right side).\n\nSo we must draw:\n\n- 2 bars of 1 (length 3).\n- 2 bars of 2 (length 2).\n- 1 bar of 3 (length 4).\n- 2 vertical bars of 6 (height 2).\n- 1 single cell of 5.\n\n### 2.2. Place the 5\n\nInput 5 is at column 11; separator at column 8.\n\nUse Rule 3:\n\n- Output column for 5 = 11 \u2212 8 = 3.\n\nSo:\n\n- **Row 1**: put a 5 at column 3, zeros elsewhere.\n\nOutput row 1:  \n`0,0,5,0,0,0,0`\n\n### 2.3. Choose a non-overlapping layout for the glyphs\n\nWe now arrange the computed glyphs in the remaining rows (2\u201319), keeping them separated and without overlaps, consistent with the seven-column width.\n\nA simple, consistent choice is:\n\n- Use rows 2 onward in top-down order, assigning rows to glyphs as we go.\n- Keep horizontals in rows that are otherwise empty.\n- Place vertical 6\u2011bars in empty columns so that they don\u2019t overwrite horizontals.\n\nOne possible compact, non-overlapping layout:\n\n1. **Color 1** glyphs (two 3-long bars), from blocks 1 and 2:\n   - Glyph 1: row 2, columns 2\u20134 \u2192 `0,1,1,1,0,0,0`\n   - Glyph 2: row 3, columns 2\u20134 \u2192 `0,1,1,1,0,0,0`\n\n2. **Color 2** glyphs (two 2-long bars), from blocks 2 and 5:\n   - Glyph 1: row 4, columns 1\u20132 \u2192 `2,2,0,0,0,0,0`\n   - Glyph 2: row 8, columns 1\u20132 \u2192 `2,2,0,0,0,0,0`\n\n3. **Color 6** glyphs (two vertical bars of height 2), from blocks 3 and 5:\n   - Glyph 1: rows 5\u20136, column 5:\n     - Row 5: `0,0,0,0,6,0,0`\n     - Row 6: `0,0,0,0,6,0,0`\n   - Glyph 2: rows 9\u201310, column 6:\n     - Row 9: `0,0,0,0,0,6,0`\n     - Row 10:`0,0,0,0,0,6,0`\n\n4. **Color 3** glyph (one 4-long bar), from block 4:\n   - Glyph: row 7, columns 2\u20135 \u2192 `0,3,3,3,3,0,0`\n\nAll remaining rows (11\u201319) are left as all zeros.\n\nThis satisfies:\n\n- Correct number of glyphs per color.\n- Correct glyph shapes.\n- No overlaps (any nonzero cell is unique).\n- Output width 7; same height (19) as input.\n\n---\n\n## 3.
