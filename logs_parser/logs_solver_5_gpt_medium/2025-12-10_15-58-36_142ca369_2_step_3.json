There are multiple small blobs of each, but only two distinct color values.\n\nGiven the behavior seen in the examples, a reasonable inference is:\n\n- The transformation\u2019s \u201cnetwork-building\u201d relies on having several colors available to form alternating colored paths connecting the blobs.\n- With only two colors available, this mechanism cannot operate in the same way (you cannot form the kind of multi-color alternating net seen in the examples).\n\nOne simple, consistent way for the transformation to degenerate in such a case is:\n\n> If the palette in the grid has fewer than three distinct nonzero colors, the algorithm leaves the grid unchanged.\n\nThis is **consistent with**:\n- All given examples (they all have \u22654 colors and do show changes).\n- The lack of any example demonstrating behavior on a 2-color grid.\n\nTherefore, under this inferred rule, for the test grid with only colors 6 and 7, the output should equal the input.\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\nSo I keep the test input unchanged:\n\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0  \n7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7  \n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Final Solution: Connecting Bars to Corners**\n\nAlright, after a detailed analysis of the examples, I've got a solid plan for this ARC task. The core idea here is to connect specific \"bars\" of a given color to the corner clusters of the same color. The goal is to produce output images that link these elements. It seems the input image structure dictates this connection pattern:\n\n1.  **Identify Components:** The crucial elements are the central vertical \"bars\" and the corner clusters of the same color. In this test case, we have four groups, each color with one \"bar\" and one \"cluster\".\n\n2.  **Directionality:** Each bar is a \"source\" to a \"destination\".\n    - A 7 (orange) bar in the upper-left connects to the lower-right cluster.\n    - And a 7 (orange) bar in the lower-right connects to the top-left cluster.\n    - A 6 (magenta) bar in the upper-right connects to the lower-left cluster.\n    - A 6 (magenta) bar in the lower-left connects to the upper-right cluster.\n    *   This shows symmetrical behaviour based on colour.\n\n3.  **Drawing the Line:** My solution involves drawing diagonal lines from one endpoint of the bar to the cluster center.\n    - Each color's \"bar\" has an \"inner\" end - close to the center of the grid - from which we draw.\n    - For example, if the 7 has a bar in the top-left, we'll draw down from that bar.\n    - If there is a bar in the bottom-right, we'll draw upwards from that bar.\n    - And so on for each colour.\n\n    - We trace the pixel positions and mark them with the appropriate color.\n\n    - The line stops at the cluster, not at the corner - just the pixel that is part of the cluster.\n\n4.  **No Collisions:**  We have to avoid overlaps. Ex 1 hints that a single point can emit two lines. But in our test input, bars, the objects, are adjacent. If a line is drawn, and intersects another similar object, the algorithm stops there.\n    -  It appears the rule is to just connect one bar to one cluster and leave the other bars.\n\n5.  **Output Generation:** To generate the output, I'll copy the input image and then:\n    -   Iterate through each coordinate pair for each line.\n    -   Replace those pixels with the corresponding color.\n\nWith this logic, I'm confident I can solve this task!\n\n\nThe task involves connecting specific shapes (\"bars\") to \"clusters\" of the same color using diagonal lines.\n\n**Analysis of the Rules:**\n1.  **Identify Objects:**\n    *   **Corner Clusters:** In the four corners of the grid, there are small clusters of pixels.\n        *   Top-Left (TL): Orange (7). Center around (1,1).\n        *   Top-Right (TR): Magenta (6). Center around (1,17).\n        *   Bottom-Left (BL): Magenta (6). Center around (18,1).\n        *   Bottom-Right (BR): Orange (7). Center around (18,17).\n    *   **Central Bars:** In the middle region of the grid (rows 6-13), there are vertical bars of length 3.\n        *   Upper-Left (UL): Orange (7) at columns 8, rows 6-8.\n        *   Upper-Right (UR): Magenta (6) at column 10, rows 6-8.\n        *   Lower-Left (LL): Magenta (6) at column 8, rows 11-13.\n        *   Lower-Right (LR): Orange (7) at column 10, rows 11-13.\n\n2.  **Transformation Logic:**\n    *   Each Central Bar corresponds to the Corner Cluster in its quadrant (e.g., UL Bar corresponds to TL Cluster).\n    *   A diagonal line is drawn connecting the \"Inner End\" of the bar to the center of the corresponding cluster.\n    *   **Inner End Definition:**\n        *   For Upper bars (rows 6-8), the inner end is the bottom pixel (row 8).\n        *   For Lower bars (rows 11-13), the inner end is the top pixel (row 11).\n    *   **Pathing:**\n        *   **UL Orange (7):** From (8,8) draw a diagonal Up-Left to the TL cluster center (1,1).\n        *   **UR Magenta (6):** From (8,10) draw a diagonal Up-Right to the TR cluster center (1,17).\n        *   **LL Magenta (6):** From (11,8) draw a diagonal Down-Left to the BL cluster center (18,1).\n        *   **LR Orange (7):** From (11,10) draw a diagonal Down-Right to the BR cluster center (18,17).\n    *   The lines stop when they reach the cluster. They do not extend through it or to the boundary in the \"away\" direction (inwards), preventing collision in the center.\n\n**Steps for Test Input:**\n1.  **Orange (7) Line 1:** Start at (8,8). Target (1,1).\n    *   Fill: (7,7), (6,6), (5,5), (4,4), (3,3), (2,2).\n2.  **Orange (7) Line 2:** Start at (11,10). Target (18,17).\n    *   Fill: (12,11), (13,12), (14,13), (15,14), (16,15), (17,16).\n3.  **Magenta (6) Line 1:** Start at (8,10). Target (1,17).\n    *   Fill: (7,11), (6,12), (5,13), (4,14), (3,15), (2,16).\n4.  **Magenta (6) Line 2:** Start at (11,8). Target (18,1).\n    *   Fill: (12,7), (13,6), (14,5), (15,4), (16,3), (17,2).\n\nThe output grid is generated by applying these fills to the input grid.\n\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0\n7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Below is the reasoning I followed and then the resulting output grid.\n\n---\n\n## Reasoning\n\nLooking at the three solved examples, there is a consistent behavior for **L\u2011shaped 2\u00d72 clusters** (a 2\u00d72 square of a color with one corner missing, i.e. an \u201cL\u201d):\n\n- Example 3, color 4:\n  - Input has 4s at (1,2), (2,1), (2,2) \u2014 an L at the top\u2011left.\n  - Output keeps those and adds a **diagonal tail** of 4s from the **corner cell of the L** (the intersection of its two arms, here (2,2)) going **down\u2011right**: (3,3),(4,4),(5,5),(6,6), stopping before conflict or boundary.\n\n- Example 1, color 3:\n  - Input has 3s forming an L at (8,2),(9,1),(9,2).\n  - Output keeps those and adds a diagonal tail of 3s from the L\u2019s corner (9,2) going down\u2011right, again stopping before hitting another 3 or going out of bounds.\n\nThe direction of the tail for an L appears to be **\u201cinto the interior of the grid\u201d** from that corner:\n- Top\u2011left L: corner near top and left \u2192 go down\u2011right.\n- Top\u2011right L: would go down\u2011left.\n- Bottom\u2011left L: would go up\u2011right.\n- Bottom\u2011right L: would go up\u2011left.\n\nThe tail extends step by step along that diagonal, but:\n- It never overwrites an existing non\u2011zero cell.\n- It stops **just before** it would step into a non\u2011zero cell (of any color).\n\nFor the test input, the non\u2011zero cells form four very clear L\u2011shaped 2\u00d72 clusters:\n\n- **Color 7:**\n  - Top\u2011left L:\n    - (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)\n    - Corner (intersection of arms) = **(2,2)**.\n    - This is at the top\u2011left of the grid \u2192 tail direction: **down\u2011right**.\n  - Bottom\u2011right L:\n    - (19,18), (19,19), (20,18)\n    - Corner = **(19,18)**.\n    - Bottom\u2011right \u2192 tail direction: **up\u2011left**.\n\n- **Color 6:**\n  - Top\u2011right L:\n    - (1,18), (2,18), (2,19)\n    - Corner = **(2,18)**.\n    - Top\u2011right \u2192 tail direction: **down\u2011left**.\n  - Bottom\u2011left L:\n    - (19,1), (19,2), (20,2)\n    - Corner = **(19,2)**.\n    - Bottom\u2011left \u2192 tail direction: **up\u2011right**.\n\nThere are also vertical 3\u2011cell columns of 6s and 7s in the center of the grid. In the examples these central vertical/horizontal triples sometimes also spawn diagonals, but that behavior is quite intricate and depends on other interactions. For this test, I applied only the **robustly observable, consistent behavior for L\u2011shapes** and left all other non\u2011zero cells unchanged.\n\n### Applying the L\u2011rule to the test grid\n\nWork in 1\u2011based (row, column) coordinates.\n\n#### 1. 7\u2011L at top\u2011left (corner = (2,2), direction down\u2011right)\n\nWalk from (2,2) along (r+1,c+1) until just before a non\u2011zero:\n\n- (3,3): 0 \u2192 set to 7\n- (4,4): 0 \u2192 7\n- (5,5): 0 \u2192 7\n- (6,6): 0 \u2192 7\n- (7,7): 0 \u2192 7\n- (8,8): 0 \u2192 7\n- Next would be (9,9), which already has a 7 in the input (central vertical triple), so we stop.  \n  New 7s from this L: **(3,3),(4,4),(5,5),(6,6),(7,7),(8,8)**.\n\n#### 2. 7\u2011L at bottom\u2011right (corner = (19,18), direction up\u2011left)\n\nWalk from (19,18) along (r\u22121,c\u22121):\n\n- (18,17): 0 \u2192 7\n- (17,16): 0 \u2192 7\n- (16,15): 0 \u2192 7\n- (15,14): 0 \u2192 7\n- (14,13): 0 \u2192 7\n- (13,12): 0 \u2192 7\n- Next would be (12,11), which already has a 7 (the lower central vertical triple), so we stop.  \n  New 7s from this L: **(18,17),(17,16),(16,15),(15,14),(14,13),(13,12)**.\n\n#### 3. 6\u2011L at top\u2011right (corner = (2,18), direction down\u2011left)\n\nWalk from (2,18) along (r+1,c\u22121):\n\n- (3,17): 0 \u2192 6\n- (4,16): 0 \u2192 6\n- (5,15): 0 \u2192 6\n- (6,14): 0 \u2192 6\n- (7,13): 0 \u2192 6\n- (8,12): 0 \u2192 6\n- Next would be (9,11), which already has a 6 (upper central vertical triple), so we stop.  \n  New 6s from this L: **(3,17),(4,16),(5,15),(6,14),(7,13),(8,12)**.\n\n#### 4. 6\u2011L at bottom\u2011left (corner = (19,2), direction up\u2011right)\n\nWalk from (19,2) along (r\u22121,c+1):\n\n- (18,3): 0 \u2192 6\n- (17,4): 0 \u2192 6\n- (16,5): 0 \u2192 6\n- (15,6): 0 \u2192 6\n- (14,7): 0 \u2192 6\n- (13,8): 0 \u2192 6\n- Next would be (12,9), which already has a 6 (lower central vertical triple), so we stop.  \n  New 6s from this L: **(18,3),(17,4),(16,5),(15,6),(14,7),(13,8)**.\n\nAll other non\u2011zero cells from the input (the central vertical 6s and 7s and the original L\u2011cells) are kept as is.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Deep Dive into a Complex ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I'm given a bunch of examples and need to figure out the underlying logic.  It looks like I'm dealing with grids, colors, and shapes. My first thought is to start with the simplest example and see if I can find some kind of visual pattern.\n\nI start by meticulously examining the first example.  I'm trying to decipher how the input shapes relate to the output. At first glance, it looks like objects are moving diagonally. I start breaking down the example by trying to identify individual shapes and their color and trying to trace their location. But it doesn't seem that straightforward. I try tracing individual objects but my brain is getting a little scrambled.\n\nSo I go back and start looking for clues in the arrangement. I start to notice some weirdness, where single pixels seem to be related to the movement. The diagonal aspect seems to be linked to these \"target\" pixels.  I start noticing the diagonals form what looks like a 'V' shape converging towards a single pixel.\n\nI start testing this \"V\" hypothesis.  I calculate the slope of the diagonal lines for each colored object and target pixel. And sure enough, the math checks out. I find that I can take the coordinates of the shape, connect them with a diagonal, and reflect it across the column where the single target pixel is located.\n\nI refine this to the bottom-left corner and the target. And it seems to work. So, if I map all the diagonals, I can probably reproduce this with the given inputs.\n\nBut then, I get thrown off by Example 2, which seems more complicated. I see shapes made up of multiple pixels. I get a little distracted by some color change.  So I'm thinking, what's happening? There are new colors in the output. I start thinking about the interaction between different colors and how the movement changes. So I try to build a few more rules and see if this solves the examples provided.\n\nNow I am in Example 3. I see a connection between the start and end point. This requires tracking the origin. I start to see \"gravity\" or a meeting point. The shapes are shooting diagonals. After more tracing, it's clear these shapes are \"shooting\" the diagonals at 45 degrees. The key insight now is that each shape shoots towards another shape.\n\nSo, I refine the \"V\" and realize I have to work out a new hypothesis.  I'm dealing with the interaction between multiple objects. I have to think about what is the source of the diagonal rays and what is the target? It looks like I'm seeing reflection across the target column.\n\nSo, let's look at the patterns of what these lines are creating. In some cases, the lines overlap, and I have to decide what color wins. So, I have to guess and test what happens at that crossing point.\n\nFinally, I think I have a theory. I'm going to start with a new algorithm based on all my observations:\n\n1.  Identify color clusters.\n2.  Determine a direction (Up/Down and Left/Right).\n3.  Shoot diagonals from the \"inner\" edge to the opposite shapes.\n4.  Determine overlap rules - the key is the dominance of colors. I'm going with Right dominates.\n5.  Check pixels and their color.\n\nI apply this to the new test. Now, this is a complicated grid, but I think I have everything to solve this.\n\nI'm getting closer, but I realize the \"reflection\" idea isn't quite right.  I'm not reflecting across an axis, but drawing lines that meet at a central column.\n\nThe core of the problem involves identifying shapes and their properties, such as the color, the bottom-left pixel, and its relation with other shapes. Then, each shape will form two diagonal lines to define an \"Arm\", and then I just need to figure out where they overlap and what color to use.\n\nThe final element is to use the knowledge about overlapping lines.\n\nSo, finally, let's implement this theory.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation involves projecting diagonal \"beams\" from the colored shapes (sources) towards the center or towards a target on the opposite side. The rules inferred are:\n1.  **Direction**: Shapes in the top half shoot diagonals downwards; shapes in the bottom half shoot upwards. Shapes on the left shoot to the right; shapes on the right shoot to the left.\n2.  **Path**: The beams follow a 45-degree diagonal path (slope \u00b11).\n    -   Top-Left (TL) shapes shoot Down-Right (increase row, increase col).\n    -   Top-Right (TR) shapes shoot Down-Left (increase row, decrease col).\n    -   Bottom-Left (BL) shapes shoot Up-Right (decrease row, increase col).\n    -   Bottom-Right (BR) shapes shoot Up-Left (decrease row, decrease col).\n3.  **Conflict Resolution**: When beams of different colors intersect or overlap:\n    -   From Example 3 (Right-side Blue 1s overwrote Left-side Yellow 4s) and Example 2 (Side Magenta 6s moved into Center Grey 5s), it appears that **Right-side sources dominate Left-side sources**.\n    -   From general precedence in such tasks (and Example 3 where lower shapes seemed to dominate), **Bottom sources dominate Top sources**.\n    -   Combined Hierarchy: Bottom-Right (7) > Bottom-Left (6) > Top-Right (6) > Top-Left (7).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n-   **Top-Left (7)**: Shoots Down-Right towards the center. Overlapped by TR and Bottom shapes.\n-   **Top-Right (6)**: Shoots Down-Left towards the center. Dominates TL.\n-   **Middle-Left Upper (7)**: Shoots Down-Right to Col 9. Overlapped by MR Upper.\n-   **Middle-Right Upper (6)**: Shoots Down-Left to Col 9. Dominates ML Upper. Result in Col 9 (rows 7-9) is **6**.\n-   **Middle-Left Lower (6)**: Shoots Up-Right to Col 9. Overlapped by MR Lower.\n-   **Middle-Right Lower (7)**: Shoots Up-Left to Col 9. Dominates ML Lower. Result in Col 9 (rows 10-12) is **7**.\n-   **Bottom-Left (6)**: Shoots Up-Right. Dominated by BR.\n-   **Bottom-Right (7)**: Shoots Up-Left. Dominates everything.\n\n**Resulting Pattern:**\n-   The diagonals form an 'X' shape meeting at the center.\n-   The **Top intersection** area (rows 7-9, cols 8-10) is dominated by **6** (from Top-Right and Middle-Right Upper).\n-   The **Bottom intersection** area (rows 10-12, cols 8-10) is dominated by **7** (from Bottom-Right and Middle-Right Lower).\n-   Specifically, the center point (9,9) is a convergence of all 4 corners. Following the hierarchy (Bottom > Top, Right > Left), it becomes **7**.\n-   The pixel (9,8) is the convergence of Top-Right and Bottom-Right diagonals. Bottom-Right (7) wins. So **7**.\n-   Actually, to preserve the symmetry observed in Ex 3 (where 1s just overwrote the path of 4s), the beams simply overwrite.\n    -   Top-Right (6) overwrites Top-Left (7).\n    -   Bottom-Right (7) overwrites Bottom-Left (6).\n    -   Bottom-half (7) overwrites Top-half (6) at the vertical center? Or they meet?\n    -   Looking at the output of Ex 3, the beam continued.\n    -   The center pixel (9,9) is targeted by BR(7), BL(6), TR(6), TL(7). Winner: **7**.\n    -   (9,8) is targeted by TR(6), BR(7). Winner: **7**.\n    -   (8,9) is targeted by TL(7), TR(6), ML(7), MR(6). Winner: **6** (Top-Right/Middle-Right).\n\n**Final Grid Construction**:\n-   Preserve input shapes.\n-   Draw Top-Right diagonals (6s) overwriting Top-Left diagonals (7s).\n-   Draw Bottom-Right diagonals (7s) overwriting Bottom-Left diagonals (6s).\n-   Where Bottom and Top meet (Row 9, 10), Bottom (7) overwrites Top (6).\n\noutput:\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0\n7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,6,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,6,7,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7\n6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0",

The transformation draws diagonal lines connecting matching colors\n\nThe diagonals extend from:\n- Corner L-shapes toward the center\n- Linear patterns in both relevant diagonal directions\n- Creating X-shaped paths connecting same-colored elements across the grid\n\n**For the test input:**\n\nThe structure is:\n- **7 (orange)**: top-left corner, vertical line at (6-8, col 8), vertical line at (11-13, col 10), bottom-right corner\n- **6 (magenta)**: top-right corner, vertical line at (6-8, col 10), vertical line at (11-13, col 8), bottom-left corner\n\nThis creates an X-pattern where:\n- 7 diagonal: top-left \u2192 upper 7 line \u2192 center \u2192 lower 7 line \u2192 bottom-right\n- 6 diagonal: top-right \u2192 upper 6 line \u2192 center \u2192 lower 6 line \u2192 bottom-left\n\nThe diagonals cross in the center (around rows 9-10).\n\n**Construction:**\n\nI trace 45-degree diagonals from each pattern:\n- From corners going toward center\n- From each line extending up and down diagonally\n- The lines at columns 8 and 10 swap between upper and lower sections, creating the crossing effect\n\n```\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0\n7,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,6\n0,7,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,6,0\n0,0,7,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,6,0,0\n0,0,0,7,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,7,7,0,7,0,0,0,6,0,6,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0\n6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n```",
