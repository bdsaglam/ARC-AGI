In both training examples the outer frame (one colour) and an inner frame (another colour) are untouched.\n   - Inside each framed strip there is a 1\u2011dimensional pattern that repeats regularly along the strip (e.g. `1,3,1,3,1,3,\u2026` or `3,3,4,3,3,4,\u2026`).\n   - In the inputs, a few cells break that repetition (e.g. a `3,3` where we expect `1,3`).  \n     The outputs simply restore the perfect repetition of the pattern while leaving the frames as\u2011is.\n\n   So the transformation is:\n\n   > For every \u201ccorridor\u201d of non\u2011frame cells, detect the repeating motif from the consistent part of the pattern and overwrite the corridor so that the motif repeats without defects.\n\n2. **Structure of the test grid**\n\n   - Outer frame is colour **8** (whole border).\n   - Just inside it, there is a solid frame of **3** (row 1, row 27, and some columns).\n   - All remaining cells are inside this frame and contain mostly 8\u2019s, with patterns in colours **2, 1, 4, 9**.\n   - Looking down the grid, rows inside the frame repeat in cycles: after a few rows you see the same row re\u2011appear (same positions of 1\u2019s, 4\u2019s, 9\u2019s, etc.). So the vertical pattern is periodic.\n\n3. **Finding the motifs and defects**\n\n   I looked at the repeating rows/columns for each non\u2011frame colour separately.\n\n   **(a) Colour 2 (columns 3\u20134)**  \n   - Columns 3 and 4 (0\u2011based indices 3 and 4) show a perfect vertical pattern `8,2,2,8,2,2,\u2026` in triplets of rows, except at row 24 (0\u2011based) column 3, which is `8` instead of `2`.\n   - Fix: set that cell to `2`.\n\n   **(b) Colour 1 (columns 9\u201312)**  \n   - In every interior row there is exactly one `1` somewhere in columns 9\u201312, and its column moves in a 6\u2011row cycle  \n     `9,10,11,12,11,10, 9,10,11,12,11,10, \u2026`.\n   - Almost all rows follow this zig\u2011zag except:\n     - Row 12 has two `1`s at columns 9 and 11 (should only be at 11).\n     - Row 23 has a `1` at column 11, but according to the cycle it should be at column 12.\n   - Fixes:\n     - Row 12, col 9: change `1 \u2192 8`.\n     - Row 23, col 11: change `1 \u2192 8`.\n     - Row 23, col 12: change `8 \u2192 1`.\n\n   **(c) Colour 4 (columns 16\u201319)**  \n   - In these four columns, rows fall into repeating types:\n     - Type B: `4,4,4,4`\n     - Type C: `8,8,8,4`\n     - Type D: `4,8,8,8`\n   - Down the grid (ignoring the very first pattern row) the sequence of row types is  \n     `B, C, B, D, B, C, B, D, \u2026`.\n   - Two rows (13 and 23, 0\u2011based) should be type B but instead have `4,8,4,4` (only column 17 is wrong).\n   - Fixes:\n     - Row 13, col 17: change `8 \u2192 4`.\n     - Row 23, col 17: change `8 \u2192 4`.\n\n   **(d) Colour 9 (columns 24\u201325)**  \n   - Column 24: from row 4 downwards, pattern is `9,9,8,9` repeating; this is already consistent.\n   - Column 25: 9\u2019s occur every 4th row (rows 4,8,12,16,20,24), which is the clear motif, except row 25 also has a 9.\n   - Fix:\n     - Row 25, col 25: change `9 \u2192 8`.\n\n   No other cells deviate from these established periodic motifs, and the 8/3 frame is left unchanged.\n\n4. **Resulting output grid**\n\nApplying all the corrections above yields:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_D>\n<REASONING_MODEL_E model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_7_step_5_image\">\nLooking at the examples, I can see the transformation involves:\n1.

`c4` already `2`.\n   - Row 26: `c3,c4` must be `8,8` (they were `2,2`).\n\n4. **Stripe 2: columns 9\u201312 (colors 1 and 8)**\n\n   In each interior row, exactly **one** of the four cells (c9\u2013c12) is `1` and the rest are `8`. The position of that `1` follows a 6-row periodic \u201ctriangle wave\u201d:\n\n   - For rows `r = 2..26`, define `k = r - 2` and pattern `[0,1,2,3,2,1]` for the column index (0..3) of the `1`.\n   - Up to row 11 and again from row 13 to 22 this is obeyed perfectly:\n     - r2: `[1,8,8,8]` \u2192 pos 0  \n     - r3: `[8,1,8,8]` \u2192 pos 1  \n     - r4: `[8,8,1,8]` \u2192 pos 2  \n     - r5: `[8,8,8,1]` \u2192 pos 3  \n     - r6: `[8,8,1,8]` \u2192 pos 2  \n     - r7: `[8,1,8,8]` \u2192 pos 1  \n     - r8: `[1,8,8,8]` \u2192 pos 0  \n     - ... and so on, matching `[0,1,2,3,2,1]` cyclically.\n\n   The violations:\n\n   - **Row 12**: `[1,8,1,8]` (two `1`s). Expected pos 2 \u2192 `[8,8,1,8]`.\n   - **Row 23**: `[8,8,1,8]` but expected pos 3 \u2192 `[8,8,8,1]`.\n   - **Row 25**: `[8,8,1,8]` but expected pos 1 \u2192 `[8,1,8,8]`.\n   - **Row 26**: `[8,1,8,8]` but expected pos 0 \u2192 `[1,8,8,8]`.\n\n   So edits:\n\n   - r12 c9: `1 \u2192 8`.\n   - r23 c11: `1 \u2192 8`, c12: `8 \u2192 1`.\n   - r25 c10: `8 \u2192 1`, c11: `1 \u2192 8`.\n   - r26 c9: `8 \u2192 1`, c10: `1 \u2192 8`.\n\n   After this, the sliding single-`1` pattern `[0,1,2,3,2,1]` is perfect from row 2 to 26.\n\n5. **Stripe 3: columns 16\u201319 (colors 4 and 8)**\n\n   Looking column-by-column vertically:\n\n   - **Column 16** has clear period-4 pattern from row 2: `[4,4,8,4]` repeating.  \n     This holds until row 24; only row 25 is wrong (`8` instead of `4`).\n\n     \u2192 r25 c16: `8 \u2192 4`.\n\n   - **Column 17** from row 3 downward alternates `[4,8]`:\n\n     r3:4, r4:8, r5:4, r6:8, ... is perfect except at\n       - r13, r23, r25 (should be `4` but are `8`)\n       - r26 (should be `8` but is `4`)\n\n     \u2192 r13 c17: `8 \u2192 4`  \n       r23 c17: `8 \u2192 4`  \n       r25 c17: `8 \u2192 4`  \n       r26 c17: `4 \u2192 8`.\n\n   - **Column 18** alternates `[8,4]` from row 2:\n\n     r2:8, r3:4, r4:8, ... Perfect until rows 25\u201326 which show `8,4` instead of `4,8`.\n\n     \u2192 r25 c18: `8 \u2192 4`  \n       r26 c18: `4 \u2192 8`.\n\n   - **Column 19** uses a period-4 pattern `[8,4,4,4]` from row 2:\n\n     8,4,4,4, 8,4,4,4, ... The only break is row 26, which should be `8` but is `4`.\n\n     \u2192 r26 c19: `4 \u2192 8`.\n\n   After these corrections, the 4/8 stripe is a clean set of vertical periodic textures.\n\n6. **Stripe 4: columns 24\u201325 (colors 9 and 8)**\n\n   Here, the structure is best seen by the **count of 9s per row** in these two cells:\n\n   - Let count = number of 9s in {c24,c25} for a row.\n   - From row 4 to 23 the counts follow a perfect period-4 pattern:\n     - Pattern `[2,1,0,1]` repeating:\n       - r4:2, r5:1, r6:0, r7:1,\n       - r8:2, r9:1, r10:0, r11:1,\n       - ... up to r23:1.\n\n   For those rows:\n   - count = 0 \u2192 (8,8)\n   - count = 1 \u2192 (9,8)\n   - count = 2 \u2192 (9,9)\n\n   At the bottom:\n\n   - r24: count 2 (correct for the pattern step after r23)\n   - r25: count 2, but the pattern says it should be 1\n   - r26: count 2, but the pattern says it should be 0\n\n   So we enforce counts:\n\n   - r25 should have `(9,8)` (count 1) \u2192 c25: `9 \u2192 8`.\n   - r26 should have `(8,8)` (count 0) \u2192 c24: `9 \u2192 8`, c25: `9 \u2192 8`.\n\n7. **Resulting structure**\n\n   - All frame and background colors (`8` outer frame, `3` inner walls) remain unchanged.\n   - Each textured stripe (`2/8`, `1/8`, `4/8`, `9/8`) now has a perfectly regular vertical periodic pattern with no outliers.\n   - Many rows are now exact vertical repeats or symmetric counterparts (e.g. row 2 = row 26, row 4 = row 24, row 5 = row 23, etc.), which matches the idea of \u201cpanels\u201d built from repeated textures with occasional noise cleaned up.\n\n---\n\n## Final Output Grid\n\nHere is the completed output grid after applying all corrections:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_H>\n<REASONING_MODEL_I model_id=\"gpt-5.1-medium_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\nFirst I\u2019ll describe how I inferred the rule from the solved examples, then how I applied it to the test grid, and finally I\u2019ll give the full output grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the examples show\n\nIn both solved examples:\n\n- There is a **frame color** that makes rectangular panels.\n  - Example 1: frame color `3`.\n  - Example 2: frame color `4`.\n- Inside each framed panel, there is a **repeating pattern** (e.g. alternating 1/3, or repeating 3,3,4, etc.).\n- A small portion of the pattern is **wrong** (local defects: wrong color, or short run of wrong colors).\n- The transformation does **not** move shapes around; it just **recolors the defective cells** so that the pattern becomes perfectly periodic/regular again.\n\nSo the rule is:\n\n> For each framed panel, infer the intended periodic pattern from the majority of the cells and repair any local defects so that the pattern is continuous and consistent.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Structure of the test input\n\n### 2.1. Panels and borders\n\nIn the test grid:\n\n- Color `8` forms the **outer border** of the whole grid and also three internal vertical lines:\n  - Full columns of `8` at indices 0, 7, 14, 21, 28.\n  - These split the interior into **4 vertical panels**:\n    - Panel 1: columns 1\u20136\n    - Panel 2: columns 8\u201313\n    - Panel 3: columns 15\u201320\n    - Panel 4: columns 22\u201327\n- Within each panel, color `3` forms an **inner frame**:\n  - Row 1 and row 27 are all `3` within each panel\u2019s horizontal span.\n  - The first and last columns of each panel (e.g., col 1 & 6 for panel 1) are `3` from row 1 to 27.\n\nSo for each panel, the **pattern area** is:\n\n- Rows 2\u201326 and the **inner columns**:\n  - Panel 1: cols 2\u20135\n  - Panel 2: cols 9\u201312\n  - Panel 3: cols 16\u201319\n  - Panel 4: cols 23\u201326\n\nThese are the areas to repair.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Analyzing and repairing each panel\n\n### 3.1. Panel 1 (cols 2\u20135, rows 2\u201326)\n\nTake inner cells (cols 2\u20135) for rows 2\u201326:\n\nMost rows are either:\n\n- `[8,8,8,8]` (no 2\u2019s), or\n- `[8,2,2,8]` (two central 2\u2019s).\n\nAnd there is a clear vertical pattern:\n\n- The rows follow a repeating **0,1,1** cycle:\n  - Row types: off (`[8,8,8,8]`), on (`[8,2,2,8]`), on, off, on, on, \u2026\n\nChecking all rows, only **one row** breaks this rule:\n\n- Row 24 (0-based index), row content:\n  - Inner (cols 2\u20135) = `[8,8,2,8]` instead of `[8,2,2,8]`.\n- So column 3 in that row is the only defect.\n\n**Fix for panel 1:**\n\n- Row 24, column 3: change `8` \u2192 `2`.\n\n---\n\n### 3.2. Panel 2 (cols 9\u201312, rows 2\u201326)\n\nInner area (cols 9\u201312) has values `1` and `8`. Almost every row has **exactly one `1`**, and that `1` appears to **move horizontally** in a wave:\n\n- Positions of the single `1` (column indices 9\u201312) by row (2\u201326):\n\n  ```\n  r2:  9\n  r3: 10\n  r4: 11\n  r5: 12\n  r6: 11\n  r7: 10\n  r8:  9\n  r9: 10\n  r10:11\n  r11:12\n  r12: 9 & 11 (two 1's)  <-- defect\n  r13:10\n  r14: 9\n  r15:10\n  r16:11\n  r17:12\n  r18:11\n  r19:10\n  r20: 9\n  r21:10\n  r22:11\n  r23:11          (but should be at 12)  <-- defect\n  r24:11\n  r25:10\n  r26: 9\n  ```\n\nFrom most rows you can see the intended **sawtooth wave** of the `1`\u2019s position:\n\n- Expected sequence of columns: 9,10,11,12,11,10,9,10,11,12,11,10,9,10,11,12,11,10,9,10,11,12,11,10,9.\n\nComparing:\n\n- Only two rows don\u2019t match:\n  - Row 12: `[1,8,1,8]` (two ones).\n  - Row 23: `1` at column 11 instead of 12.\n\n**Fixes for panel 2:**\n\n- Row 12 (`8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,1,8,1,8,...`):\n  - Inner section `[1,8,1,8]` should be `[8,8,1,8]` (only one `1` at col 11).\n  - Change column 9: `1` \u2192 `8`.\n- Row 23 (`...,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,...` in that region):\n  - Inner section `[8,8,1,8]` should be `[8,8,8,1]` (1 at col 12).\n  - Change column 11: `1` \u2192 `8`.\n  - Change column 12: `8` \u2192 `1`.\n\nAfter this, every row has exactly one `1` and the positions follow the smooth 9\u219210\u219211\u219212\u219211\u2192\u2026 wave.\n\n---\n\n### 3.3. Panel 3 (cols 16\u201319, rows 2\u201326)\n\nInner area (cols 16\u201319) uses colors `4` and `8`. Most rows are of the following types:\n\n- `B`: `[4,4,4,4]`\n- `C`: `[8,8,8,4]`\n- `D`: `[4,8,8,8]`\n- plus one special top row `A`: `[4,4,8,8]` at row 2.\n\nIf we classify row types from row 3 down:\n\n- Sequence (rows 3\u201326) is:\n\n  ```\n  B, C, B, D, B, C, B, D, B, C, E, D, B, C, B, D, B, C, B, D, E, C, B, D\n  ```\n\nwhere `E` rows are:\n\n- Row 13: `[4,8,4,4]`\n- Row 23: `[4,8,4,4]`\n\nThe **dominant pattern** (ignoring the two E\u2019s) is a strict repetition:\n\n- `B, C, B, D` repeated over and over.\n\nAt positions where E occurs, the cycle says the row should be `B`:\n\n- So those rows should be `[4,4,4,4]`.\n\n**Fixes for panel 3:**\n\n- Row 13: change inner cells `[4,8,4,4]` \u2192 `[4,4,4,4]`  \n  (i.e., column 17: `8` \u2192 `4`).\n- Row 23: likewise, `[4,8,4,4]` \u2192 `[4,4,4,4]`  \n  (column 17: `8` \u2192 `4`).\n\nNow the sequence is perfectly `B, C, B, D` repeating below the one initial `A` row.\n\n---\n\n### 3.4. Panel 4 (cols 23\u201326, rows 2\u201326)\n\nInner area (cols 23\u201326) has patterns in terms of `8` and `9`, preceded by a constant `3` in col 22:\n\nDefine types:\n\n- `T0`: `[3,8,8,8]`\n- `T1`: `[3,8,9,8]`\n- `T2`: `[3,8,9,9]`\n\nRows 4\u201326 follow almost perfectly:\n\n- Repeating cycle: `T2, T1, T0, T1`.\n\nListing (rows 4\u201326):\n\n```\nr4:  T2\nr5:  T1\nr6:  T0\nr7:  T1\nr8:  T2\nr9:  T1\nr10: T0\nr11: T1\nr12: T2\nr13: T1\nr14: T0\nr15: T1\nr16: T2\nr17: T1\nr18: T0\nr19: T1\nr20: T2\nr21: T1\nr22: T0\nr23: T1\nr24: T2\nr25: T2   <-- should be T1\nr26: T0\n```\n\nSo every row matches the cycle except **row 25**, which is `T2` but should be `T1`.\n\n- Row 25 current inner cells: `[3,8,9,9]` (T2).\n- Should be: `[3,8,9,8]` (T1).\n\n**Fix for panel 4:**\n\n- Row 25, column 25: change `9` \u2192 `8`.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Here's my thinking process:**\n\nI start by looking at the provided examples. I'm trying to identify patterns and rules. My initial thought is that I need to find a way to analyze both inputs and outputs and look for consistent transformations. I can do this!\n\n**Example 1**:\nI notice the input and output grids and I'm looking at differences. It seems like I'm dealing with a repeating sequence that has occasional \"noise\" in it. The task seems to be about detecting and correcting these errors to complete the established pattern. Border values are important, they establish boundaries. I look for the core logic, so I can apply it to a new input. It is the core logic that defines the pattern.\n\n**Example 2**:\nHere I'm seeing multiple panels, separated by rows/columns. Within each panel, there is one or more sequence. There are deviations from the \"norm\". It's almost like it's noise removal, filling in the blanks to keep the sequence repeating. In Example 2, I have multiple patterns, but the core task of keeping to the repeating pattern or identifying repeating values remains the same.\n\n**Test Input**:\nThe test input is large and has a strong border, also divided into panels. I need to be careful with the repeating sequence and where to apply the transformation. I can do it!\n\nI'm identifying the repeating units, and the patterns within the data. It's almost like a music score; I have to identify the tune to fix the bad notes.\n\n**My Rule:**\n\n1.  **Find the \"active\" region**: The area within a panel.\n2.  **Locate Pattern:** In an active area, find a repeating sequence\n3.  **Identify deviations**: Figure out where the input has errors, \"noise\".\n4.  **Fix!**: Replace the noise with the correct values according to the repeating patterns.\n\nI've examined multiple examples and can write the transformations to generate an output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to identify and repair patterns in a grid. The grid consists of several \"panels\" or vertical strips separated by border lines. Within each strip, there is a recurring vertical pattern (sequence of rows) that might be corrupted by noise or errors in the test input. We need to deduce the correct pattern for each strip and apply it to fix the errors.\n\n**Grid Analysis:**\n- Size: 29x29.\n- Border/Background: 8 (Teal). Padding/Inner background: 3 (Green).\n- The grid is divided into 4 vertical strips of content (columns 2-5, 9-12, 16-19, 23-26), separated by columns of '3's and '8's.\n- Rows 0, 1, 27, 28 are borders/padding. The content is in rows 2 to 26.\n\n**Strip Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Strip 1 (Columns 2-5):**\n    -   **Pattern:** A 3-row cycle: `8 8 8 8`, `8 2 2 8`, `8 2 2 8`.\n    -   **Sequence:** Row 2 (`8888`), Row 3 (`8228`), Row 4 (`8228`), Row 5 (`8888`), etc.\n    -   **Errors Found:**\n        -   Row 24: Input `8 8 2 8` should be `8 2 2 8` (part of the `8228` phase).\n        -   Row 25: Input `8 8 2 8` should be `8 2 2 8`.\n        -   Row 26: Input `8 2 2 8` should be `8 8 8 8` (part of the `8888` phase).\n\n2.  **Strip 2 (Columns 9-12):**\n    -   **Pattern:** A single `1` moves back and forth (Ping-Pong) across the 4 columns: positions 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, ...\n    -   **Sequence:** Row 2 (pos 0: `1888`), Row 3 (pos 1: `8188`), Row 4 (pos 2: `8818`), Row 5 (pos 3: `8881`), Row 6 (pos 2), etc.\n    -   **Errors Found:**\n        -   Row 12: Input `1 8 1 8` (1s at pos 0 and 2). Following the sequence (Row 11 was pos 3), Row 12 should be pos 2 (`8 8 1 8`). The `1` at pos 0 is noise.\n        -   Row 24: Input `8 8 1 8` (pos 2). Based on sequence (20:1, 21:0, 22:1, 23:2), Row 24 should be pos 3 (`8 8 8 1`).\n\n3.  **Strip 3 (Columns 16-19):**\n    -   **Pattern:**\n        -   Odd rows (3, 5, 7...): Always `4 4 4 4`.\n        -   Even rows (2, 4, 6...): Alternating between `4 8 8 8` and `8 8 8 4`.\n    -   **Sequence:**\n        -   Even rows sequence: R2(`4888`), R4(`8884`), R6(`4888`), R8(`8884`), etc.\n    -   **Errors Found:**\n        -   Row 2: Input `4 4 8 8`. Should be `4 8 8 8`.\n        -   Row 13: Input `4 8 4 4`. Should be `4 4 4 4` (Odd row).\n        -   Row 23: Input `4 8 8 8`. Should be `4 4 4 4` (Odd row).\n        -   Row 24: Input `4 8 4 4`. Should be `8 8 8 4` (Even row following `4888`).\n\n4.  **Strip 4 (Columns 23-26):**\n    -   **Pattern:** A 4-row cycle: `8 8 8 8`, `9 8 8 8`, `9 9 8 8`, `9 8 8 8`.\n    -   **Sequence:** Matches starting from Row 3 (`8888`), Row 4 (`9888`), Row 5 (`9988`), etc.\n    -   **Errors Found:**\n        -   Row 2: Input `8 8 8 8`. Preceding the cycle start at R3, this should be the end of the previous cycle (`9 8 8 8`).\n        -   Row 4: Input `8 8 8 8`. Should be `9 8 8 8`.\n        -   Row 26: Input `9 9 8 8`. Should be `9 8 8 8` (last step of the cycle starting at R23).\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\nWe apply the corrections identified above to the test input grid.\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 1>\n<CANDIDATE 2>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 1x12\n488844448884\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_1_step_1\">\n**I've got this one. It's a classic ARC-style problem, and I'm seeing the patterns already.** The user wants me to fix an input grid, basically, and I'm pretty sure I know how to do it. The setup is typical: two examples, one input. The goal is likely to find the underlying rule and apply it to the input.\n\n**First things first, I need to understand the grid's structure.** It looks like it's built from nested, rectangular 'frames' of colors. The key here is to identify these frames and their boundaries because they dictate the zones of operation. The numbers 0-9 represent the colors. It's a transformation problem, so I'm looking for a rule that takes the input grid and produces the output.\n\n**Let's dive into the examples.** Example 1 is a good starting point. There's a big green frame of 3's. Inside, there's a red inner frame of 2's. And the interesting part: a central row with a sequence of 1s and a broken part with 3's. The output *corrects* this disrupted sequence. It goes from `1, 3, 3, 3, 1` to `1, 3, 1, 3, 1` in the middle of Row 2. So the goal is to *complete* an alternating pattern of 1 and 3. I am seeing the bigger picture.\n\n**The second example is more complex but also very telling.** I see several rectangular regions with their own frames (4), and with inner frames (2). There's this structure of rows of smaller repeating sequences or patterns. Example 2 has blocks of these repeating sequences. I look at three sections.\n*   In one section the sequence is, in my mind `3, 3, 4`\n*   In one section, there's an issue `1, 1, 1` that is corrected to `1, 4, 1`. The correction seems to enforce a sequence.\n*   In another section, the 8s are supposed to be forming a block. The input has a 4 where an 8 should be.\n\n**The trend is becoming clear: identify the repeating pattern and fix the \"noise\".** The goal in ARC problems seems to be to find a simple repeating pattern and correct exceptions. The \"exceptions\" seem to take the value of a boundary or interior color. The examples are providing the *template* for the fix.\n\n**Now, let's look at the test input.** It's a 29x29 grid. The outer border is 8 (teal). The inner frame is 3. I see four columns. The regions are defined by these frame colors, and each area is 4 cells wide. It's time to dig into the individual panel structures.\n\n**Let's analyze them one by one.**\n\n**First Strip (Columns 2-5):**\nEach 3-framed box should alternate rows of two types of rows. 8, 8, 8, 8 and 8, 2, 2, 8. Period is 3. The anomaly is easy to detect. Row 24 is wrong and should be fixed.\n\n**Second Strip (Columns 9-12):**\nIn this one, there's a single 1 that should bounce or move back and forth! The other numbers are mostly 8, but I'm looking at how the \"1\" changes position. There's a very clear pattern of the movement of the 1, a repeating cycle of it. I deduce: period 7. There are several incorrect cells. Many corrections. I look at each row and fix based on the column index.\n\n**Third Strip (Columns 16-19):**\nThere are a repeating four blocks of [C, A, B, A] which represents [4,8,8,8], [4,4,4,4], [8,8,8,4]. The corrections are also pretty evident. There are few exceptions, so easy to fix.\n\n**Fourth Strip (Columns 23-26):**\nThe pattern is A, B, C, B, A, B, C, B... A, B, C, B are specific structures as shown above. This looks like the phase is shifting after row 18, so I need to correct many rows at the bottom. The corrections require adjusting the structure in each row.\n\n**With the pattern understood, the fix is straightforward.** I'll scan the input, locate the anomalies, correct, and regenerate the output, just fixing the cells. It's a done deal. I'm ready to produce the correct grid!\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 2>\n<CANDIDATE 3>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x29\n88888888888888888888888888888\n83333338333333833333383333338\n83888838318883834488383888838\n83822838381883834444383888838\n83822838388183838884383899838\n83888838388813834444383898838\n83822838388183834888383888838\n83822838381883834444383898838\n83822838388183834888383888838\n83888838318883838884383899838\n83822838381883834444383898838\n83822838388183834888383888838\n83888838388813834444383898838\n83822838388183838884383899838\n83822838381883834884383898838\n83888838318883834888383888838\n83822838381883834444383898838\n83822838388183838884383899838\n83888838388813834444383898838\n83822838388183834888383888838\n83822838381883834444383898838\n83888838318883838884383899838\n83822838381883834444383898838\n83822838388183834888383888838\n83888838388183834884383898838\n83822838388183838884383899838\n83822838381883834444383899838\n83888838318883834888383888838\n83333338333333833333383333338\n88888888888888888888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gpt-5.1-medium_1_step_1\">\n**Reasoning**\n\n1. From the solved examples, the common theme is **repairing small local inconsistencies so that a repeated pattern becomes regular**:\n   - In Example 1, a row of alternating `1,3,1,3,...` had one place where two `3`s appeared in a row. The inconsistent `3` was changed to `1` to restore the alternation.\n   - In Example 2, several rows had nearly perfect periodic patterns (e.g. `3,3,4,3,3,4,...` or `1,4,1,4,...`) except for one or two misplaced values. Those cells were edited so that the repeated pattern across the row became perfectly regular.\n\n   In all cases, the structure (borders, block layout) is preserved, and only a **few inner cells** are changed to restore **consistency of a repeated motif**.\n\n2. In the test grid, the outer frame of `8`s and the internal \u201cblock\u201d layout of `3`s and `8`s is already very regular. The irregularities appear in the colored regions for values `2`, `1`, `4`, and `9`, which form repeated motifs across the grid.\n\n3. I looked for **outliers that break the repeating structures** of those colored motifs:\n\n   ### Color 2 region (columns 3\u20134)\n   - Almost all rows that contain `2`s in columns 3\u20134 have the pattern:\n     - either `8,2,2,8` (i.e. both columns 3 and 4 are `2`), or\n     - `8,8,8,8` (no `2`s on that row in that region).\n   - Row 25 (0-based index 25) has `c2\u20135 = 8,8,2,8`, i.e. only column 4 is `2`, column 3 is `8`. This breaks the consistent \u201cdouble-2\u201d motif in that vertical region.\n   - To restore the regular 2\u00d72-style blocks of `2`s, I change **row 25, column 3** from `8` to `2`.\n\n   ### Color 1 region (around columns 9\u201311)\n   - In this vertical band, almost every row has **exactly one** `1` among columns 9\u201311, forming a slanting / V-shaped motif when seen over all rows.\n   - Row 13 is the only row that has **two** `1`s in that band: at columns 9 and 11.\n   - The `1` at column 11 fits the vertical pattern (it continues the diagonal), while the `1` at column 9 is isolated relative to the neighboring rows and breaks the \u201cone 1 per row\u201d structure.\n   - So I treat that as the inconsistency and change **row 13, column 9** from `1` to `8` (matching the surrounding background).\n\n   ### Color 4 region (columns 16\u201319)\n   - In most rows, in columns 16\u201319, the patterns fall into a small set of regular forms: `[4,4,4,4]`, `[4,8,8,8]`, or `[8,8,8,4]`.\n   - Only rows 14 and 24 have the unusual pattern `[4,8,4,4]`, i.e. a stray `4` at column 18 where most rows have `8`.\n   - To match the dominant structural patterns and avoid an isolated 4 in that column, I change:\n     - **row 14, column 18** from `4` to `8`\n     - **row 24, column 18** from `4` to `8`\n   - This produces `[4,8,8,4]` in those rows, which fits smoothly between neighbors.\n\n   ### Color 9 region (columns 24\u201325)\n   - The `9`s appear in regular vertical clusters around columns 24\u201325, and examining their distribution, there isn\u2019t a single obviously unique outlier of the kind seen above (like a singleton 9 in an otherwise empty column, or a missing 9 where a block pattern clearly demands one).\n   - So I leave the `9` region unchanged.\n\n4. No other parts of the grid show clear single-cell deviations from an otherwise consistent repeating motif, so I modify only these four cells.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n\nHere is the completed output grid (29\u00d729), with only the four described cells changed from the input:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 3>\n<CANDIDATE 4>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 29x29\n88888888888888888888888888888\n83333338333333833333383333338\n83888838318883834488383888838\n83822838381883834444383888838\n83822838388183838884383899838\n83888838388813834444383898838\n83822838388183834888383888838\n83822838381883834444383898838\n83888838318883838884383899838\n83822838381883834444383898838\n83822838388183834888383888838\n83888838388813834444383898838\n83822838388183838884383899838\n83822838381883834844383898838\n83888838318883834888383888838\n83822838381883834444383898838\n83822838388183838884383899838\n83888838388813834444383898838\n83822838388183834888383888838\n83822838381883834444383898838\n83888838318883838884383899838\n83822838381883834444383898838\n83822838388183834888383888838\n83888838388183834844383898838\n83822838388183838884383899838\n83822838381883834444383899838\n83888838318883834888383888838\n83333338333333833333383333338\n88888888888888888888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gpt-5.1-medium_2_step_1\">\n**High\u2011level idea**\n\nFrom the solved examples you can infer that the task is about *repairing a mostly-regular pattern that\u2019s been slightly corrupted*.\n\n- In **Example 1**, the interior of the framed rectangle is an alternating pattern of `1` and `3`. One cell (a `3`) breaks the alternation. The output changes that single cell to `1` so that the whole row follows the same alternating pattern.\n- In **Example 2**, inside each framed region the interior of certain rows is clearly periodic:\n  - a row should be `[3,3,4,3,3,4,...]` but one place has `4,4` instead of `4,3`;\n  - another stripe should be `[1,4,1,4,1,4,...]` but one place has `1,1,1`;\n  - similarly for the `8` and `9` stripes.\n  \n  In each case, the output repairs *only* those cells that break the obvious repeating pattern; all other cells remain unchanged.\n\nSo the general transformation is:\n\n> **Identify a repeating local pattern. Any cell that breaks this pattern (and is unique compared to all the repetitions) is corrected to the value that makes the pattern uniform across all repetitions.**\n\n---\n\n## Applying this to the test grid\n\nThe test grid has four vertical \u201cfeature stripes\u201d between columns of `8`:\n\n- **Stripe 1 (color 2)**: columns 2\u20135 (0\u2011based indices 2,3,4,5) between an outer `8` frame and inside `3`s.\n- **Stripe 2 (color 1)**: columns 8\u201313.\n- **Stripe 3 (color 4)**: columns 16\u201319.\n- **Stripe 4 (color 9)**: columns 24\u201325.\n\nEach stripe repeats a vertical pattern in **6\u2011row blocks** starting from row 2:\n\n- Block 1: rows 2\u20137\n- Block 2: rows 8\u201313\n- Block 3: rows 14\u201319\n- Block 4: rows 20\u201325  \n\n(Rows 1 and 27 are uniform \u201cseparator\u201d rows of `3`s; row 0 and 28 are all `8`.)\n\nFor each stripe, I checked all 6\u00d7W blocks (W is the stripe width) and compared them across the four blocks.\n\n### Stripe with `2` (columns 2\u20135)\n\nFor rows 2\u201325, columns 2\u20135 look like this (showing only the 4 interior columns):\n\n- Pattern type **A**: `[8,8,8,8]`\n- Pattern type **B**: `[8,2,2,8]`\n  \nThe vertical pattern is:\n\n- Row 2: A  \n- Row 3: B  \n- Row 4: B  \n- Row 5: A  \n- Row 6: B  \n- Row 7: B  \n\nand this `A, B, B` triple repeats perfectly in blocks 1, 2, and 3, and also in block 4 except for **one row**:\n\nRows 20\u201325:\n\n- Row 20: A\n- Row 21: B\n- Row 22: B\n- Row 23: A\n- **Row 24: `[8,8,2,8]`**  \u2190 differs only in column 3 from the B pattern\n- Row 25: B\n\nSo for stripe 2, the only cell that breaks the clear `A, B, B` repetition is:\n\n- **Row 24, column 3 (0\u2011based)**: `8` instead of the expected `2`.\n\nTo match all other blocks, we change that one cell:\n\n- `(row 24, col 3): 8 \u2192 2`.\n\nAll other cells in the `[2..5]` stripe already match the common repeating pattern and stay unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### Stripe with `1` (columns 8\u201313)\n\nNow look at rows 2\u201325, columns 8\u201313 (a 6\u00d76 interior per block). There are only a few distinct row types, and they repeat many times across the four 6\u2011row blocks. For example:\n\nTypical row types in this stripe (columns 8\u201313):\n\n- **Type A**: `[3,1,8,8,8,3]`\n- **Type B**: `[3,8,1,8,8,3]`\n- **Type C**: `[3,8,8,1,8,3]`\n- **Type D**: `[3,8,8,8,1,3]`\n\nThese four types appear multiple times in every block, with a consistent cyclic ordering, *except* for one anomalous row:\n\n- **Row 12**, columns 8\u201313:  \n  `[3,1,8,1,8,3]`  \n\nThis differs from the common Type C (`[3,8,8,1,8,3]`) only at column 9:\n\n- Column 9 (0\u2011based) is `1` where all other corresponding rows (same relative position in the block) have `8`.\n\nSo we repair that single deviation:\n\n- **Row 12, column 9 (0\u2011based)**: `1 \u2192 8`.\n\nAfter this change, every 6\u00d76 block in the `1` stripe is consistent with the same set of row types; no other cells are unique outliers.\n\n---\n\n### Stripes with `4` and `9`\n\nFor the `4`\u2011stripe (columns 16\u201319) and the `9`\u2011stripe (columns 24\u201325), when you enumerate and classify the row patterns across all four 6\u2011row blocks:\n\n- Each pattern type appears multiple times and forms consistent, intentional-looking structures (no row pattern appears only once as an obvious outlier).\n- There is no cell whose local row segment is unique and contradicts an otherwise regular repetition, unlike the `2`\u2011stripe and `1`\u2011stripe where each had exactly one such cell.\n\nHence, according to the rule inferred from the examples (only correct cells that uniquely break a clearly regular repetition), **we leave the `4` and `9` stripes unchanged.**\n\n---\n\n## Summary of modifications\n\nOnly two cells are changed from the input:\n\n1. **Row 12, column 9 (0\u2011based)**: `1 \u2192 8`\n2. **Row 24, column 3 (0\u2011based)**: `8 \u2192 2`\n\nEverything else is identical to the input grid.\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\nHere is the completed output grid after applying the transformation:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 4>\n<CANDIDATE 5>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 29x29\n88888888888888888888888888888\n83333338333333833333383333338\n838888383188838348883838888838\n838228383818838344443838898838\n838228383881838388843838899838\n838888383888138344443838898838\n838228383881838348883838888838\n838228383818838344443838898838\n838888383188838388843838899838\n838228383818838344443838898838\n838228383881838348883838888838\n838888383888138344443838898838\n838228383881838388843838899838\n838228383818838344443838898838\n838888383188838348883838888838\n838228383818838344443838898838\n838228383881838388843838899838\n838888383888138344443838898838\n838228383881838348883838888838\n838228383818838344443838898838\n838888383188838388843838899838\n838228383818838344443838898838\n838228383881838348883838888838\n838888383888138344443838898838\n838228383881838388843838899838\n838228383818838344443838898838\n838888383188838348883838888838\n83333338333333833333383333338\n88888888888888888888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_4_step_3\">\n**Initial Assessment & Strategy:**\n\nOkay, I've got this. The task is to analyze these examples of ARC problems, figure out the underlying transformation rule, and then apply that rule to a new test case. The core is about identifying patterns within these grids and correcting any \"noise\" or deviations from the intended, periodic structures. It looks like the problems are usually based on patterns within rectangular sections of the grid, separated by background colours.\n\n**Example 1: Unraveling the Grid's Code:**\n\nThis first example is a good starting point. I looked closely at the input and output grids and immediately noticed the border (color 3) and the red background (color 2). Within that, the middle row has a sequence of numbers, that seem to be transformed to some degree.\n\nI started by looking at the inner content within that red background. Focusing on this \"content,\" the aim is to find repeating units of the sequence and what's changing.\n\nI saw the input row had the sequence `1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1` that was being altered to `1, 3, 1, 3, 1`. The pattern `1, 3` is the key. It looks like that \"noise\" `3, 3, 3` in the input gets fixed.\n\nIt looks like the 1,3 pattern in both columns and rows is periodic.\n\n**Example 2: Discovering the Multi-Panel Approach:**\n\nExample 2 is a bit more complex, with a larger grid and multiple \"strips\" or panels. The border is yellow, and there are \"separator lines\" (color 4), which define these sections. The repeating patterns is the building block of each section.\n\nFor each \"region\" separated by those lines, there is a sequence within the background.\n\nIn the first region, it's a sequence of `3, 3, 4` which repeats with an `4, 4` where it should not be.\n\nIn the second region, there is a repeating checkerboard of `1` and `4`. The deviations of the input data are corrected.\n\nI had to be meticulous and re-read the data again. The repeating pattern is key. And deviations from that pattern are the source of the problem.\n\nThis pattern or deviations or \"noise\" is an important feature, in the input that the program must fix.\n\n**Synthesizing the Transformation Rule:**\n\nThe rule is clear now. I need to:\n\n1.  Identify the \"independent\" rectangular sub-grids or panel regions within the grids which are defined by borders and backgounds.\n2.  Determine the periodic repeating pattern unit within each of these regions.\n3.  Scan the inputs to locate \"noise\" or deviations from the repetition.\n4.  Correct these deviations, changing the numbers so the patterns are perfect.\n\n**Analyzing the Test Input:**\n\nThe test input is a 29x29 grid, with a light blue border (color 8) and a green background (color 3). The new aspect is these separator columns (at columns 7, 14, 21), these form panels with repeating patterns.\n\nI began by closely scanning the input data within the borders.\n\nI needed to see where the deviations in the sequence were.\n\nIt looks like there are four main \"panels\" or sub-grids within the borders.\n\nThe challenge now is to determine the periodic pattern inside each of these \"panels.\"\n\n*   Panel 1 (Cols 2-5):  The repeating sequence looks like 3 rows: `8, 8, 8, 8`, `8, 2, 2, 8`, `8, 2, 2, 8`. A deviation happened in row 24.\n*   Panel 2 (Cols 9-12): Now I am looking at a zigzag or 'bouncing ball' of the digit 1 against the 8. Cycle: 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, etc.. I re-analyzed the input. A few were deviations from the pattern or 'out of sync'.\n*   Panel 3 (Cols 16-19): This cycle looks like 4 rows. `4, 8, 8, 8`.\n*   Panel 4 (Cols 23-26): This cycle looks like 4 rows. `8,9,8,8`. The pattern has 4 rows.\n\n**Applying the Transformation and Final Output:**\nNow it's time to \"fix\" the deviations and generate the output, applying the patterns in the correct cycle. I am building the grid and I will write a simple test for each panel to ensure this.\n\nBased on the row index,\n\nTo solve this challenge, I need to identify the repeating patterns within specific regions of the grid and repair any deviations (\"noise\") in the test input to match those patterns.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Grid Structure**\nThe test input is a 29x29 grid.\n*   **Border:** The entire grid is surrounded by a border of color 8 (light blue).\n*   **Background:** Inside the border, color 3 (green) acts as padding.\n*   **Panels:** There are four distinct vertical panels separated by vertical lines of color 8 and padding of color 3.\n    *   **Panel 1:** Columns 2-5 (Width 4).\n    *   **Panel 2:** Columns 9-12 (Width 4).\n    *   **Panel 3:** Columns 16-19 (Width 4).\n    *   **Panel 4:** Columns 23-26 (Width 4).\n*   **Content:** The patterns appear in rows 2 through 26.\n\n**2. Pattern Identification per Panel**\nI will analyze the sequence of rows in each panel to determine the intended repeating cycle.\n\n*   **Panel 1 (Cols 2-5):**\n    *   Observed rows: `8,8,8,8`, `8,2,2,8`, `8,2,2,8`, `8,8,8,8`...\n    *   **Cycle Length:** 3 rows.\n    *   **Pattern:**\n        1.  `8, 8, 8, 8`\n        2.  `8, 2, 2, 8`\n        3.  `8, 2, 2, 8`\n    *   **Deviations identified:** Row 24 is `8,8,2,8`, but should be `8,2,2,8` (2nd step of cycle).\n\n*   **Panel 2 (Cols 9-12):**\n    *   Observed rows show a single `1` moving back and forth against a background of `8`s.\n    *   Positions of `1` (0-indexed): 0 (`1888`), 1 (`8188`), 2 (`8818`), 3 (`8881`), 2 (`8818`), 1 (`8188`)...\n    *   **Cycle Length:** 6 rows.\n    *   **Pattern Sequence:**\n        1.  `1, 8, 8, 8`\n        2.  `8, 1, 8, 8`\n        3.  `8, 8, 1, 8`\n        4.  `8, 8, 8, 1`\n        5.  `8, 8, 1, 8`\n        6.  `8, 1, 8, 8`\n    *   **Deviations identified:** Several rows (e.g., 12, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26) have incorrect configurations like `1,8,1,8` or are out of sync with the cycle.

The user wants me to fix up an image based on two solved examples. Looks like a classic pattern recognition problem.\n\n**Initial Impressions**\n\nThe core idea seems to be about identifying and correcting repetitive patterns within a grid-like structure. The examples suggest that there are defined \"regions\" within the grid, and each region has a specific rule about what it should look like. Seems like the problem requires understanding both global structure (the grid as a whole) and local patterns (what goes on within each region).\n\n**Example 1: The Building Block**\n\nThis one is fairly straightforward. I can see a border, a frame, and content inside. The content row has a repeating `1, 3` pattern. The output corrects an anomaly in this pattern, enforcing the repetition. So, I need to look for a repeating unit within each region and use that as the target pattern. The \"background\" color, which is 3 in this case, sets the framework.\n\n**Example 2: Expanding the Logic**\n\nThis example is more complex because it introduces multiple \"windows\" within the grid, separated by yellow 4s. I quickly notice that the problem works across blocks. Each block has its pattern. The vertical structure is simple (blocks separated by 4s). Each block is divided into many cells and the target is to repair an error.\nI had to analyze each window in detail. The analysis revealed each cell has its specific pattern. I realized that each window had it's specific pattern.\n\n**Deductions and Hypothesis**\n\nI think I've figured out the general algorithm:\n\n1.  **Region Identification:** Determine the boundaries of each \"region\" or \"window.\" They're defined by the frames and separators (e.g., the 2s and 4s in the examples).\n2.  **Background/Foreground:** Identify the background color (usually the border color) and the foreground color(s) within each region.\n3.  **Pattern Recognition:** Determine the repeating unit and it's length (width). This usually can be deduced.\n4.  **Anomaly Correction:** If there's a deviation from the pattern in the input, fix it based on the consistent, identified unit.\n\n**Test Input: Time to Apply the Knowledge**\n\nOkay, here's where it gets interesting. I need to apply what I learned to a new grid. I recognize the 8s as the border and the 3s as the frame. This divides it into vertical \"windows\". The next step is to analyze each window (Block) separately. Each window seems to be a vertical series of cells. I just need to analyze the data.\n\n**Window by Window Analysis**\n\n*   **Window 1:** The window contains `8,2,2,8`. The pattern here is obvious. I can see an alternating pattern within Window 1, so the pattern is clearly `8, 2, 2, 8` which is 2 cells alternating with a background (8). This window has two-row blocks. These blocks should be fixed.\n*   **Window 2:** The pattern is a \"bouncing ball\" with the `1`. It moves through all the blocks in the rows with the window content. The result is the correct pattern. The window looks correct and works. The bouncing happens on the window.\n*   **Window 3:** There's a repeating cycle of three states: Full, Right, and Left, each with a specific `4,4,4,4` -like state. This is an alternating pattern. Here too, the data should be fixed.\n*   **Window 4:** The data has `H, H, F, F` pattern in the first part and `H, F, H, F`. There are few anomalies in this pattern.\n\nIn this grid, you should make these corrections for each window by correcting all the anomalous patterns. If you fix all the patterns for each of the windows and create one complete grid the job should be completed.\n\n\nThe task requires repairing a grid that has been damaged by noise. The grid is divided into 4 vertical \"windows\" (columns of content) by borders of `8` (teal) and vertical lines of `3` (green). Each window contains a distinct pattern that repeats vertically.\n\n**Global Structure:**\n- The grid is $29 \\times 29$.\n- Borders: Color `8`.\n- Vertical Separators: Columns 1, 6, 8, 13, 15, 20, 22, 27 are `3` (green).\n- Content Windows:\n  - Window 1: Cols 2-5 (Width 4). Frame color 3.\n  - Window 2: Cols 9-12 (Width 4). Frame color 3.\n  - Window 3: Cols 16-19 (Width 4). Frame color 3.\n  - Window 4: Cols 23-26 (Width 4). Frame color 3.\n- Rows 0, 1 and 27, 28 are borders/headers. Rows 2-26 contain the pattern.\n\n**Window Patterns:**\n\n1.  **Window 1 (Cols 2-5):**\n    -   **Pattern:** Alternating `8,8,8,8` and two rows of `8,2,2,8`.\n    -   **Sequence:** `Empty, Active, Active` repeating.\n    -   **Values:** Empty = `8,8,8,8`.

What the transformation does in the examples\n\n### 1.1. Structural observations\n\nAcross both examples:\n\n- There is a **dominant \u201cframe\u201d color**:\n  - Example 1: frame color 3 (outer border).\n  - Example 2: frame color 4 (outer border and separating rows/columns).\n- Inside the framed regions, there are **horizontal stripes** where the colors:\n  - Are made from exactly **two colors** (one often being the frame color),\n  - And form a **simple periodic pattern** (period 2 or 3) along the row:\n    - Example 1: inside row 2 between the 2\u2019s, the pattern should be `1,3,1,3,1,3,1,3,1` (period 2).\n    - Example 2:\n      - For the 3-block: pattern `3,3,4` repeated (period 3).\n      - For the 1-block: pattern `1,4` repeated (period 2).\n      - For the 9-block: pattern `9,4` repeated (period 2).\n      - For the 8-block: another fixed periodic pattern in that band, also alternating motif and 4 in a consistent way.\n\nIn the **inputs**, some rows within these stripes have **small local corruptions** in an otherwise perfectly periodic pattern, such as:\n\n- A duplicated frame color inside a \u201cmotif\u2013frame\u2013motif\u2013frame\u2026\u201d sequence.\n- A triple of the motif color where only one motif was expected.\n- A double of the frame color where the repeating pattern expects something else.\n\nThe **outputs** fix exactly those corruptions and leave everything else unchanged.\n\n### 1.2. How the correction works\n\nLooking at the concrete changes:\n\n- Example 1:\n  - Row 2, between the 2\u2019s:\n\n    Input:  `1,3,1,3,1,3,3,3,1`  \n    Output: `1,3,1,3,1,3,1,3,1`\n\n  - A \u201c3,3,3\u201d run appears where the intended pattern is alternating `1,3,1,3,...`.  \n    The center 3 is changed to 1 to restore the **period-2 alternation**.\n\n- Example 2:\n  - 3-block (rows 2\u20133): pattern is `3,3,4` repeated.  \n    One row had `...,4,4,3,...` locally (double 4); a 4 is changed to 3 to restore the `3,3,4` repetition.\n  - 1-block (row 7): pattern should be strict alternating `1,4,1,4,...`.  \n    There is a `4,1,1,1,4` fragment; center 1 becomes 4, giving `4,1,4,1,4`, restoring period 2.\n  - 8-block: a `4,4` fragment inside a row that otherwise follows a fixed [motif,4]-based repeat; one of the 4\u2019s becomes 8.\n  - 9-block: similarly, a `9,9` or `9,9,9` where the row otherwise alternates `9,4,9,4,...`; a 9 is changed to 4.\n\nThe shared rule is:\n\n> **Within horizontal segments in a framed band that almost follow a simple periodic pattern of two colors (period 2 or 3), detect small local violations (like double/triple wrong color) and flip the minimal number of cells so that the entire segment is again perfectly periodic. All other parts of the grid are left unchanged.**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying this rule to the test input\n\nNow we apply the same idea to the test grid.\n\nKey points for the test grid:\n\n- Frame color is **8** (outer border and internal separating columns/rows).\n- Background inside is mostly **3**, with other colors (1,2,4,9) forming more complex shapes.\n- For the rule from above to apply, we need to find **horizontal segments** (between 8\u2019s, or between an 8-border and an 8-separator) that:\n  1. Contain **exactly two colors** and\n  2. Are **almost** a clear periodic pattern (typically of length 2 or 3) with just a small local glitch.\n\nI inspected the grid row by row, focusing on segments between 8\u2019s:\n\n- In rows like row 1 and row 27, segments between 8\u2019s are **uniform 3\u2019s** (no secondary color), so there is no 2-color periodic pattern to be repaired.\n- In many other rows, segments between 8\u2019s include **three or more colors** (e.g., 3,1,8; or 3,4,8; or 3,2,8), forming **non-periodic** localized shapes (2\u00d72 blocks of 2\u2019s, clusters of 9\u2019s, etc.). These do not fit the \u201clong, nearly periodic stripe\u201d pattern from the examples.\n- Even in central bands (e.g., columns 15\u201320), the sequences like `3,4,4,4,4,3` or `3,4,8,8,8,3` appear, but:\n  - They are **short** (length 6) and\n  - They do **not** show a near-global period-2 or period-3 pattern across the row; instead they are part of more complex 2D motifs.\n- Crucially, unlike the training examples, there are **no horizontal segments** that:\n  - Use **only two colors** over a reasonably long stretch and\n  - Are clearly repeating some small pattern (like `A,B,A,B,...` or `X,X,Y,X,X,Y,...`) with a single obvious local deviation.\n\nTherefore, under the transformation inferred from the examples:\n\n- **No row segment in the test grid qualifies** as a \u201cstriped band with a small local corruption\u201d of a 2-color periodic pattern.\n- Consequently, **no cell gets changed**.\n\nSo the transformation for this particular test input is the identity: the output equals the input.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

model_id=\"gpt-5.1-medium_12_step_5_opus_gen_sol\">\nFirst, I\u2019ll describe how I inferred and applied the transformation, then I\u2019ll give the final output grid.\n\n---\n\n## Reasoning / Reconstruction\n\n### 1. Identify panel structure\n\nAs in the examples, the test grid has:\n\n- An outer border of 8\u2019s (row 0, row 28, and column 0 and 28).\n- An inner \u201cframe\u201d of 3\u2019s, with vertical separators of 8 at columns 7, 14, 21, and 28.  \n  This partitions the interior into 4 vertical panels.\n\nInside these panels, we see repeating patterns:\n\n- Left panel (cols 2\u20135) with 2\u2019s forming 2\u00d72 blocks.\n- Second panel (cols 8\u201313) with a diagonal 1 moving across columns 9\u201312.\n- Third panel (cols 16\u201319) with a periodic 4/8 pattern.\n- Right panel (cols 24\u201325) with vertical stacks of 9\u2019s in a regular scheme.\n\nThe task is to repair local anomalies so each region\u2019s pattern is perfectly consistent.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Left panel: 2\u00d72 blocks at columns 3\u20134\n\nLook at columns 3 and 4 for rows 2\u201326 (0-based rows/cols):\n\n- The normal pattern:  \n  rows 3\u20134: `[2,2]`  \n  row 5: `[8,8]`  \n  rows 6\u20137: `[2,2]`  \n  row 8: `[8,8]`  \n  \u2026 repeating: two rows of `[2,2]`, then one row of `[8,8]`.\n\nAll rows follow this except **row 24** (index 24):\n\n- Row 24 originally had `[c3,c4] = [8,2]`.\n\nTo fit the pattern (and to complete the 2\u00d72 block with row 25), we set:\n\n- **Row 24, col 3: 8 \u2192 2**\n\nNow rows 24\u201325 at cols 3\u20134 are `[2,2]` and the 2/8 cycle is regular.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Second panel: diagonal 1 at columns 9\u201312\n\nConsider columns 8\u201313 for rows 2\u201326. Each such 6-cell segment is:\n\n- Type A: `3,1,8,8,8,3`  (1 at col 9)\n- Type B: `3,8,1,8,8,3`  (1 at col 10)\n- Type C: `3,8,8,1,8,3`  (1 at col 11)\n- Type D: `3,8,8,8,1,3`  (1 at col 12)\n\nThe sequence of row types (from row 2) should follow a repeating 6-row cycle:\n`A, B, C, D, C, B, A, B, C, D, C, B, \u2026`\n\nChecking the actual grid:\n\n- Row 12 (index 12) had: `3,1,8,1,8,3`  \n  \u2192 two 1\u2019s (at cols 9 and 11) instead of a single 1 at col 11 (\u201cC\u201d type).\n- Row 23 (index 23) had: `3,8,8,1,8,3` (\u201cC\u201d type) where the cycle requires a \u201cD\u201d type.\n\nFixes:\n\n1. **Row 12, col 9: 1 \u2192 8**  \n   Row 12 segment becomes `3,8,8,1,8,3` (type C).\n\n2. **Row 23, col 11: 1 \u2192 8; col 12: 8 \u2192 1**  \n   Row 23 segment becomes `3,8,8,8,1,3` (type D).\n\nAfter these edits, the sequence of row types over rows 2\u201326 is exactly:\n`A,B,C,D,C,B, A,B,C,D,C,B, A,B,C,D,C,B, A,B,C,D,C,B,A`.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Third panel: 4/8 pattern at columns 16\u201319\n\nFocus on columns 16\u201319, rows 2\u201326.\n\nWe find a strong column-wise rule:\n\n- Column 16: 8 at rows 4,8,12,16,20,24; 4 elsewhere. No anomalies.\n- Column 18: strictly alternates 8,4,8,4,\u2026; no anomalies.\n- Column 19: 8 at rows 2,6,10,14,18,22,26; 4 elsewhere. No anomalies.\n\nFor **column 17**, we can infer a rule from the majority of rows:\n\n> Column 17 = 8 if either column 16 or column 18 is 8;  \n> Column 17 = 4 if both neighbors are 4.\n\nChecking against this rule reveals three mismatches:\n\n- Row 2: c16=4, c18=8 \u2192 should be 8, but was 4.\n- Row 13: c16=4, c18=4 \u2192 should be 4, but was 8.\n- Row 23: c16=4, c18=4 \u2192 should be 4, but was 8.\n\nFixes:\n\n1. **Row 2, col 17: 4 \u2192 8**\n2. **Row 13, col 17: 8 \u2192 4**\n3. **Row 23, col 17: 8 \u2192 4**\n\nThis makes column 17 perfectly obey the neighbor-based rule, and turns:\n\n- Row 2\u2019s [16\u201319] segment into `4,8,8,8` (consistent with other \u201cS-type\u201d rows).\n- Rows 13 and 23\u2019s [16\u201319] segments into `4,4,4,4` (consistent with \u201call-4\u201d rows).\n\n---\n\n### 5. Right panel: 9\u2019s at columns 24\u201325\n\nExamine columns 22\u201326 (especially 24\u201325):\n\nColumn 25:\n\n- Pattern: a single 9 every 4 rows at rows 4,8,12,16,20,24.  \n  All other rows have 8, *except* row 25 which also had a 9.\n\nSo:\n\n- **Row 25, col 25: 9 \u2192 8**\n\nColumn 24:\n\n- Observed: groups of 9\u2019s mostly in triples:\n  - r7\u20139: 9,9,9\n  - r11\u201313: 9,9,9\n  - r15\u201317: 9,9,9\n  - r19\u201321: 9,9,9\n  - r23\u201325: 9,9,9  \n\n  But the group around row 4\u2019s center only had r4\u20135=9,9; row 3 was 8.\n\nWe infer this pattern: for each 9 in col 25 (center row), col 24 should be 9 at that row and its immediate neighbors (above and below). That is already true for center rows 8,12,16,20,24; only the top center at row 4 is off above:\n\n- We expect c24=9 at row 3 (above row 4), but it was 8.\n\nSo:\n\n- **Row 3, col 24: 8 \u2192 9**\n\nAfter this change:\n\n- Column 25: 9 at rows 4,8,12,16,20,24 only, all others 8.\n- Column 24: 9 at rows 3\u20135,7\u20139,11\u201313,15\u201317,19\u201321,23\u201325, with single 8 rows separating these triples.\n\nRow-wise, this also aligns row 3 and row 25 segments c22\u201326 as `3,8,9,8,8`, matching all other single-9 rows.\n\n---\n\n### 6.

The output repairs those few locations so that each *local horizontal pattern* becomes perfectly regular.\n\nKey observations:\n\n### Example 1\n\n- Focus on the third row (0\u2011indexed row 2):\n\n  - Input:  \n    `3,2,1,3,1,3,1,3,3,3,1,2,3`\n  - Output:  \n    `3,2,1,3,1,3,1,3,1,3,1,2,3`\n\n- Between the 2\u2019s at columns 1 and 11, the intended pattern is clearly an alternation of `1,3,1,3,...,1`.\n- In the input, there is a local break `...,1,3,3,3,1,...` (a double 3 plus misaligned 1).\n- The output fixes only those 3\u2019s that break the alternation, yielding perfect `1,3,1,3,1,3,1,3,1`.\n\nSo: detect a short repeating horizontal pattern in a run between boundaries, and correct any values that break that repetition.\n\n### Example 2\n\nLook at a few stripes:\n\n#### Stripe of 3\u2019s (rows 2\u20133)\n\n- Input row 2, inner segment:  \n  `3,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,4,4,3,3`\n- Output:  \n  `3,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,4`\n\nIntended period: `[3,3,4]`. The substring at the end `4,4,3,3` breaks the pattern. It is corrected to continue `3,3,4`.\n\n#### Stripe of 1\u2019s (row 7)\n\n- Input row 7, central segment:  \n  `...,1,4,1,4,1,4,1,1,1,4,1,4,...`\n- Output:  \n  `...,1,4,1,4,1,4,1,4,1,4,1,4,...`\n\nIntended period: `[1,4]`. A local run `1,1,1` is corrected to `1,4,1`.\n\n#### Stripe of 8\u2019s / 9\u2019s\n\n- For the \u201c8 stripe\u201d, some rows have patterns like `8,4,4,8,8,4` or `8,8,4,4,8,8`; output repairs both to a consistent repeating pattern (`8,4,8,8,8,4` or its phase).\n- For the \u201c9 stripe\u201d, rows show `[9,4]` repeated; anomalies like `...,9,9,...` get fixed to re-establish the `[9,4]` alternation.\n\n**Common pattern:**\n\n- The grid is made of horizontal \u201cblocks\u201d of fixed width (between certain boundary colors, often 2 or 4 in examples).\n- Inside each block, there is a short horizontal period (length 2\u20134) over a small color set.\n- Where a cell breaks that local period, the output corrects that one cell. All other cells are left alone.\n\nThe corrections are *minimal* and always convert a rare/unique local pattern into one of a small set of recurring patterns visible elsewhere in the same stripe.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Structure of the test input\n\nIn the test grid:\n\n- Border color is `8` (full outer frame).\n- Inside (rows 1\u201327, cols 1\u201327), the grid is subdivided vertically by columns full of `8` at `c=0,7,14,21,28`.  \n  So each row has **four 6\u2011column interior blocks**:\n\n  - Block 1: cols 1\u20136  \n  - Block 2: cols 8\u201313  \n  - Block 3: cols 15\u201320  \n  - Block 4: cols 22\u201327  \n\n- Within each block, we mainly see color `3` at the ends, with 2/4/8/9/1 forming patterns in the middle.\n\nI proceed *block-wise* and *row-wise*:\n\n> For each 6\u2011cell block pattern that occurs many times, consider that the \u201cvalid\u201d pattern. If a row\u2019s block uses a pattern that appears only once, treat that as a corrupted variant and correct it to the nearest valid pattern (exactly the kind of repair seen in the training examples).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Detecting and fixing anomalies block by block\n\nI enumerated all 6\u2011cell blocks in cols `[1\u20136]`, `[8\u201313]`, `[15\u201320]`, `[22\u201327]` for rows 1\u201327.\n\n### Block 1: columns 1\u20136\n\nPatterns (row 1 and 27 are pure `3`s and act as top/bottom frame):\n\nFor rows 2\u201326, Block1 values (I write only the 6\u2011tuples):\n\n- Most rows alternate between two standard patterns:\n\n  - A1 (with `2`s): `3,8,2,2,8,3`  \n  - B1 (no `2`s):   `3,8,8,8,8,3`\n\n- One row has:\n\n  - D1 (unique): `3,8,8,2,8,3`  (row 24)\n\nD1 differs from A1 by a single position: it has `8,2` instead of `2,2` in the middle. Since A1 occurs many times and D1 only once, D1 is the anomaly.\n\n**Fix for Block 1:**\n\n- **Row 24** block1 currently: `3,8,8,2,8,3` (cols 1\u20136).\n- Change it to the common \u201c2\u2011block\u201d pattern A1: `3,8,2,2,8,3`.\n\nThat is done by changing:\n\n- Row 24, column 3 (0\u2011based index 3) from `8` to `2`.\n\n---\n\n### Block 2: columns 8\u201313 (the 1\u2011patterns)\n\nBlock2 for rows 2\u201326 always has the form `3,*,*,*,*,3` with a single `1` in the middle\u2026 except one row.\n\nEnumerated central 4 entries (positions 1\u20134 in the 6\u2011tuple):\n\n- Four standard patterns:\n  - P: `3,1,8,8,8,3` \u2013 `1` at position 1\n  - Q: `3,8,1,8,8,3` \u2013 `1` at position 2\n  - R: `3,8,8,1,8,3` \u2013 `1` at position 3\n  - S: `3,8,8,8,1,3` \u2013 `1` at position 4\n\n- One unique corrupted pattern:\n  - Row 12: `3,1,8,1,8,3` \u2013 **two** `1`s instead of one.\n\nIn the examples, an overlong run or extra occurrence of the \u201cspecial\u201d color is corrected back down to the standard periodic form.\n\nHere, row 12 clearly should have only one `1` like all other rows. We can deduce *where* that `1` belongs by looking at the vertical progression: rows around 12 show the `1` sliding across the block (pos 1\u21922\u21923\u21924 etc.). The local sequence around rows 10\u201314 for the 1\u2011position is:\n\n- Row 10: pos 3 (pattern R)\n- Row 11: pos 4 (S)\n- Row 12: pos 1 & 3 (corrupt)\n- Row 13: pos 2 (Q)\n- Row 14: pos 1 (P)\n\nThe smooth progression that matches neighbors is:\n\n- Row 11: 4 \u2192 Row 12: 3 \u2192 Row 13: 2\n\nSo row 12 should be **R**: `3,8,8,1,8,3` (1 at position 3 only).\n\n**Fix for Block 2:**\n\n- Row 12, cols 8\u201313 currently: `3,1,8,1,8,3`\n- Correct to: `3,8,8,1,8,3`\n\nThat changes:\n\n- Row 12, column 9 from `1` to `8` (the right\u2011hand `1` stays as the unique `1` at col 11).\n\n---\n\n### Block 3: columns 15\u201320 (4/8\u2011patterns)\n\nAgain `3` at both ends of the 6\u2011tuple; the 4 internal positions vary among a few highly repeated patterns and a couple of unique ones.\n\nFor rows 2\u201326, interior 4 entries (positions 1\u20134) are mostly:\n\n- A3: `4,4,4,4`\n- B3: `8,8,8,4`\n- C3: `4,8,8,8`\n\nThese three patterns repeat in a very regular 4\u2011row cycle: A,B,A,C, then again A,B,A,C, etc.\n\nThree rows deviate:\n\n- Row 2: D = `4,4,8,8`\n- Row 13: E = `4,8,4,4`\n- Row 23: E = `4,8,4,4` too\n\nMapping the A/B/C cycle across row indices shows:\n\n- r3\u20136: A,B,A,C\n- r7\u201310: A,B,A,C\n- r11\u201314: A,B,**E**,C \u2192 Row 13 should be A (not E)\n- r15\u201318: A,B,A,C\n- r19\u201322: A,B,A,C\n- r23\u201326: **E**,B,A,C \u2192 Row 23 should be A (not E)\n- r2 is just before r3; extending the cycle backwards makes r2 match type C, not D.\n\nSo:\n\n- Row 13 and 23 should be A3 (`4,4,4,4`) instead of E.\n- Row 2 should be C3 (`4,8,8,8`) instead of D.\n\n**Fix for Block 3:**\n\nBlock3 is cols 15\u201320, layout `[3, x1, x2, x3, x4, 3]`.\n\n- Row 2:  \n  current block3: `3,4,4,8,8,3`  \n  target C3:      `3,4,8,8,8,3`  \n  So: change **row 2, col 17** (0\u2011based index 16) from `4` to `8`.\n\n- Row 13:  \n  current block3: `3,4,8,4,4,3`  \n  target A3:      `3,4,4,4,4,3`  \n  So: change **row 13, col 17** from `8` to `4`.\n\n- Row 23:  \n  same pattern as row 13; change **row 23, col 17** from `8` to `4`.\n\nAfter these changes, the block3 patterns follow the clean A,B,A,C cycle with no one-off outliers.\n\n---\n\n### Block 4: columns 22\u201327 (8/9\u2011patterns)\n\nIn block4, the 6\u2011tuples are:\n\n- U: `3,8,8,8,8,3` (no 9s)\n- V: `3,8,9,8,8,3` (single 9 in middle)\n- W: `3,8,9,9,8,3` (double 9)\n\nUnlike blocks 1\u20133, *all* three patterns appear multiple times (U 8\u00d7, V 10\u00d7, W 7\u00d7). There is no pattern that is uniquely anomalous. The counts and distribution suggest all three are intentional configurations for this stripe (analogous to the different, but all valid, block2 patterns P/Q/R/S).\n\nIn contrast to the training example, there is no single pattern W that is rare or stands out as a corruption; so we **do not** modify block4.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Summary of concrete cell changes\n\nStarting from the given test input, the only cells that get changed are:\n\n1. **Row 2, column 17** (0-based indices: `r=2, c=16`):\n   - From `4` \u2192 `8`.\n\n2. **Row 12, column 9** (`r=12, c=9`):\n   - From `1` \u2192 `8`.\n\n3. **Row 13, column 17** (`r=13, c=16`):\n   - From `8` \u2192 `4`.\n\n4. **Row 23, column 17** (`r=23, c=16`):\n   - From `8` \u2192 `4`.\n\n5. **Row 24, column 3** (`r=24, c=3`):\n   - From `8` \u2192 `2`.\n\nAll other grid entries remain unchanged.\n\nThese repairs match the behavior seen in the solved examples: identify locally anomalous patterns in horizontally bounded blocks and minimally recolor them to match the prevailing short-period pattern that recurs throughout the grid.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Final output grid\n\nHere is the completed output grid (with the five corrected rows incorporated):\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,4,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,2,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 9>\n<CANDIDATE 10>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 29x29\n88888888888888888888888888888\n83333338333333833333383333338\n83888838318883834888383888838\n83822838381883834444383888838\n83822838388183838884383898838\n83888838388813834444383899838\n83822838388183834888383898838\n83822838381883834444383888838\n83888838318883838884383898838\n83822838381883834444383899838\n83822838388183834888383898838\n83888838388813834444383888838\n83822838388183838884383898838\n83822838381883834444383899838\n83888838318883834888383898838\n83822838381883834444383888838\n83822838388183838884383898838\n83888838388813834444383899838\n83822838388183834888383898838\n83822838381883834444383888838\n83888838318883838884383898838\n83822838381883834444383899838\n83822838388183834888383898838\n83888838388813834444383888838\n83822838388183838884383898838\n83822838381883834444383899838\n83888838318883834888383898838\n83333338333333833333383333338\n88888888888888888888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_8_step_5_image\">\n**Solution Generation for ARC Task: \"Pattern Correction\"**\n\nI'm presented with an ARC task where I'm given two example grids and a test input, and I need to determine the underlying pattern and correct anomalies in the test input.\n\n**Understanding the Task**\n\nThe goal is to analyze the examples, identify repeating visual patterns within them, and apply those patterns to \"correct\" the test input. It's a classic example of pattern recognition and rule application, which is common in these types of problems.\n\n**Analysis of Example 1**\n\n*   **Structure:** This example consists of a green (3) border, a red (2) inner rectangle, and a central row that contains a pattern.\n*   **Pattern:** The crucial part is the central row, where a repeating sequence of \"1, 3\" is established, but with a few incorrect \"3, 3\" pairs.\n*   **Rule:** The correction involves enforcing the repeating \"1, 3\" pattern, essentially smoothing out the noise and completing the pattern, by replacing values that don't fit.\n\n**Analysis of Example 2**\n\n*   **Structure:** This one's more complex, with a yellow (4) border and a series of horizontal bars separated by yellow (4) rows. Each bar is a red (2) border with a pattern within.\n*   **Pattern:** Within the bars, the relevant pattern is \"3, 3, 4\" (Green, Green, Yellow), or potentially a shift of the cyclic pattern.\n*   **Rule:** The correction here involves making that the \"3, 3, 4\" pattern consistent in the inner rows, identifying and correcting local deviations like \"4, 4\" which should be \"3, 3\" and similarly in other rows, like \"1,1\" changed to \"1,4\".\n\n**Test Input Analysis**\n\n*   **Structure:** The test input has an 8 (Teal) border and appears to have vertical panels or cells with a pattern inside them. There are vertical and horizontal lines of a \"separator\" color, forming cells or panels. There are \"patterns\" within each of these panels.\n*   **Identification:** Let's look inside those cells to discover any repeating visual pattern. Within each region of 6 rows there is a specific pattern, let's explore this. Panel 1 has 3-row blocks: \\[8,8,8,8], \\[8,2,2,8], \\[8,2,2,8]. Panel 2 has the pattern, \\[1,8,8,8], \\[8,1,8,8], \\[8,8,1,8], \\[8,8,8,1]. Panel 3 has alternating patterns, \\[4,8,8,8], \\[4,4,4,4], \\[8,8,8,4], etc. Panel 4 has 4-line cycles, \\[8,8,8,8], \\[8,9,8,8], \\[8,9,9,8], \\[8,9,8,8].\n*   **Correction:** Within panel 1 the error is a `8,8,2,8` which should be `8,2,2,8`. For panel 2, anomalies are that row inputs, from the 18th to the 23rd, are out of order, and are corrected according to the pattern (shift values in place), and in panel 3, there are a series of row swaps as well that are also corrected. Panel 4 has 4 row cycle, it is the `B, A, B, Blank` one, where the error is detected on R26, from `8998` to `8988`.\n\n**Approach for Solving**\n\n1.  **Structure Recognition:** Break down the input into logical sections or patterns.\n2.  **Pattern Identification:** Look for repeating visual sequences within those sections (length 2 to 4).\n3.  **Anomaly Detection:** Pinpoint the parts of the input where the established pattern is violated.\n4.  **Correction Application:** Modify the input to match the established pattern consistently.\n\n**Solution Generation**\n\nI will now generate the output grid.\nFirst line is 8 (teal).\nSecond line is a repeating unit with 3s inside it.\nPanel 1 correction for \\[8,8,2,8] to \\[8,2,2,8] to get patterns like \\[8,8,8,8], \\[8,2,2,8].\nPanel 2 with the pattern \\[1,8,8,8], \\[8,1,8,8].\nPanel 3 with the patterns, like \\[4,8,8,8] and \\[8,8\n\nThe task involves identifying and correcting patterns in four distinct vertical panels within a grid. The grid is segmented by columns of color 8 (Teal) and rows of color 8 at the top and bottom. Inside, there are \"frames\" with color 3 (Green) borders. We analyze the content of each panel (rows 2-26, columns corresponding to the inner parts of the frames).\n\n**Analysis of Panels:**\n\n1.  **Panel 1 (Columns 2-5):**\n    *   **Observed Pattern:** A repeating triplet of rows: `8,8,8,8` (Row A), `8,2,2,8` (Row B), `8,2,2,8` (Row B). The cycle is A, B, B.\n    *   **Corrections:**\n        *   Row 24: Input `8,8,2,8` deviates from the expected pattern B (`8,2,2,8`). It is corrected to `8,2,2,8`.\n\n2.  **Panel 2 (Columns 9-12):**\n    *   **Observed Pattern:** A single Blue pixel (`1`) oscillates diagonally on a Teal (`8`) background.

My initial focus is on analyzing the patterns within the given grids, looking for repeating sequences and anomalies.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\nI identified the basic structure as a box within a box within a row. The key is to find the repeating \"noise\" pattern and correct it. The central row had a repeating \"1, 3\" pattern, which the output corrected by eliminating the deviating parts.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n\nThis example revealed a more complex structure: a larger yellow outer box, with smaller red boxes containing patterns inside. I zeroed in on the repeating sub-patterns within each red box, and I identified a cyclic shift correction to be made.\n\n**Test Input Approach:**\n\nFor the new test input, I began by deconstructing the grid into container-like regions separated by repeating border columns. I identified horizontal and vertical columns, then analyzed their patterns.\n\n*   **Region 1:** I isolated a pattern of 8s and 2s repeating vertically. The \"2\" pixels were the \"noise\" or deviations in this region.\n*   **Region 2:** Within one of these container blocks, I observed a 'bouncing' pattern of '1's. I identified the period and position.\n*   **Region 3:** A more complex repeating pattern of `4`s and `8`s emerged in one area of the grid.\n*   **Region 4:** A sequence of \"8988, 8998, 8988, 8888\" was identified as repeating in the right region of the grid.\n\nIn Region 3 I identified that the initial assumption was incorrect, and the pattern started at phase 2 and not 0, like it was identified in the test output.\nWith the initial approach to assume there were only two colors, I found that the original alternating pattern was broken.\nI used the approach of counting good rows for the initial hypothesis to be validated with better visualization tools, I found that both parts were very consistent.\nI identified the period of each section, using the pattern of phase to identify any noise inside of a single box, and applied to all rows in the box to clean the noise and restore the output.\nTo find the pattern I used the start of the output to determine the expected output for the input and determine corrections to be made.\n\n**Overall Goal:**\n\nThe overarching goal is to identify patterns, correct any deviations, and apply these corrections across the entire grid. I am focused on cleaning the inner patterns to restore consistency. My main task is to identify and correct any noise in the repeating sub-patterns, and restore the pattern.\n\n\nThe goal is to analyze the input grid, identify the distinct patterned regions (blocks), determine the intended repeating pattern for each block, and reconstruct the grid with the patterns fully corrected (removing noise/errors).\n\n**1.

My brain immediately starts dissecting the problem: they want me to analyze a set of input-output image pairs, figure out a transformation rule, and then apply it to a new input. It's all about pattern recognition and logical inference, my bread and butter.\n\n**Deep Dive into Example Transformations**\n\nI begin by poring over the examples provided. My initial focus is on understanding how the input grids are changed to produce the outputs. I'm looking for repetitive elements, symmetrical structures, and color relationships.\n\n**Example 1: The Horizontal Line Pattern**\n\nIn the first example, I zero in on the central row. It's like a noisy line within a rectangular structure. The output cleans it up, transforming the noise into a consistent, alternating \"1, 3\" pattern. It's like the input is a partially-completed jigsaw puzzle, and the output is the fully assembled piece. I realize the border color (3) is also part of the pattern, which is interesting. It's not just a frame; it actively contributes to the transformation.\n\n**Example 2: Multiple Patterns and Noisy Regions**\n\nThe second example throws a bit more at me. It's a grid with a background and several internal \"lanes\" or rectangular regions. Within each lane, a unique horizontal pattern is being revealed, although there's some corruption, which I must correct. It's crucial to identify the pattern and isolate the error. I have to look closely to identify the small deviations in each of those regions from the intended regularities and fix those.\n\n**Synthesizing the Transformation Logic**\n\nAfter staring at these examples, a general rule begins to emerge. It seems the input has a \"noisy\" section that must be smoothed. I'm getting the idea that my job is to segment the grid into relevant regions, identify a pattern, and then clean up any deviations within that pattern. It looks like the task involves removing \"noise\" and restoring the intended repeating patterns.\n\n**A Strategy for Success**\n\nTo approach the test input, I plan to proceed in the following steps:\n\n1.  **Identify regions:** Identify regions that have content.\n2.  **Define background and canvas colors:** Find the colors of background and canvas.\n3.  **Detect the vertical and horizontal segmentation boundaries**.\n4.  **Identify the repeating patterns, including any phase shifts**.\n5.  **Clean up any deviations from the pattern in those segments**.\n\n**Analyzing the Test Input**\n\nI start by looking at the test input's visual structure. It is a 29x29 grid enclosed by a border of color 8. I notice the internal regions are filled with color 3 (Green).\n\nI can visually segment the input. I can see 4 blocks separated by 8s and then filled with 3s. I am going to define each region by the set of rows and columns.\n\n**Pattern Analysis and Corrections**\n\nFor each \"panel\" identified, I'll examine the rows to find how the rows of pixels of canvas color 3 will change, and correct them. Let's start with the Panel Column 1 that has the pattern `3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3` (3, followed by 8s)\n\n**Implementing the Solution**\n\nThe task now is to write the transformation function that correctly generates the output grid based on the derived rules.\n\nI will iterate through each row of the grid. It's a matter of plugging in the derived patterns and logic.\n\nFor the border, I simply generate the border of 8s.\n\nThe internal rows are generated by applying the various patterns. I can generate any row by adding a few offsets and then applying the various repeating patterns within each row (horizontal panel).\n\n**Final Validation**\n\nBefore I submit, I need to verify that everything works. I need to re-run the process for one or two rows of the input, making sure the code generates what my brain expects. I'll test, make the corrections, and I should be good to go.\n\n\nThe problem requires identifying and restoring periodic patterns within vertical panels in a grid. The grid is segmented by vertical walls of color `8`. There are four distinct panels, each 6 pixels wide, running from row 2 to row 26.\n\n**Analysis of Panels:**\n\n1.  **Panel 1 (Columns 1-6):**\n    *   **Observed Pattern:** A vertical repeating sequence of 3 rows: A, B, B.\n    *   **Row Types:**\n        *   Type A: `3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3`\n        *   Type B: `3, 8, 2, 2, 8, 3`\n    *   **Logic:** For row `r` (2-indexed), the type is determined by `(r-2) % 3`.\n        *   0 $\\rightarrow$ A\n        *   1 $\\rightarrow$ B\n        *   2 $\\rightarrow$ B\n\n2.  **Panel 2 (Columns 8-13):**\n    *   **Observed Pattern:** A \"bouncing\" pixel of color `1` on a background of `8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8`.\n    *   **Sequence:** The index of the `1` (relative to the panel start, 0-indexed) follows the cycle: `2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3` (length 6).\n    *   **Logic:** For row `r`, the index of `1` is `cycle[(r-2) % 6]`.\n\n3.  **Panel 3 (Columns 15-20):**\n    *   **Observed Pattern:** A vertical cycle of 4 rows: D, A, C, A.\n    *   **Row Types:**\n        *   Type D: `3, 4, 8, 8, 8, 3`\n        *   Type A: `3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3`\n        *   Type C: `3, 8, 8, 8, 4, 3`\n    *   **Logic:** For row `r`, the type is determined by `(r-2) % 4`.\n        *   0 $\\rightarrow$ D\n        *   1 $\\rightarrow$ A\n        *   2 $\\rightarrow$ C\n        *   3 $\\rightarrow$ A\n\n4.  **Panel 4 (Columns 22-27):**\n    *   **Observed Pattern:** A \"pulse\" pattern involving color `9` on a background of `8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8`.\n    *   **Row Types:**\n        *   Type 0: `8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8` (Empty)\n        *   Type 1: `8, 3, 8, 9, 8, 8` (One `9` at index 3)\n        *   Type 2: `8, 3, 8, 9, 9, 8` (Two `9`s at indices 3, 4)\n    *   **Cycle:** The sequence of types is 1, 0, 1, 2 (length 4).\n    *   **Logic:** For row `r`, the type is determined by `(r-2) % 4`.\n        *   0 $\\rightarrow$ Type 1\n        *   1 $\\rightarrow$ Type 0\n        *   2 $\\rightarrow$ Type 1\n        *   3 $\\rightarrow$ Type 2\n\n**Reconstruction:**\nThe output grid is constructed by applying these patterns to rows 2 through 26.

One cell near the right end is `3` instead of `1`, so it is corrected.\n\nIn Example 2, each horizontal band has its own repeating pattern:\n- a `3,3,4` rhythm in one band,\n- a `1,4` alternation in another,\n- a more complex repetition for the `8`-band and for the `9`-band.\nAgain, only the few cells that violate the column\u2011wise/row\u2011wise repetition are corrected.\n\n---\n\n### Applying this to the test grid\n\nFor the test input:\n\n- The outer color is `8`, forming a border and internal vertical pillars.\n- Between the vertical pillars, the interior columns show **clear vertical periodic patterns**:\n  - Columns with `2` follow `8,2,2` repeating down the grid.\n  - Columns with `1` and `8` follow cycles such as `1,8,8,8,8,8,1,\u2026` or `8,8,1,8,1,8,\u2026`.\n  - Columns with `4` repeat simple patterns like `4,4,8,4,\u2026` or alternations of `8` and `4`.\n  - Columns with `9` follow a `8,9,9,9` or `8,8,9,8,8,8,9,\u2026` style repetition.\n\nMost cells already fit these vertical sequences; a small number are wrong and break the clear pattern. For each such column:\n\n1. Identify the repeating cycle by inspection of the majority of the column.\n2. For any cell that does not agree with that cycle, change it to the value dictated by the cycle.\n\nDoing this yields the following corrections (row, column):\n- `(25,4)` from `8` \u2192 `2` to fit the `8,2,2` pattern.\n- `(13,10)` from `1` \u2192 `8` to restore the `1`-every-6-rows pattern in column 10.\n- `(24,12)` from `1` \u2192 `8` to make column 12 follow its `8,8,1,8,1,8` cycle.\n- `(14,18)` from `8` \u2192 `4` and `(24,18)` from `8` \u2192 `4` to fix column 18\u2019s `4/8` alternation.\n- `(4,25)` from `8` \u2192 `9` to restore the `8,9,9,9` pattern in column 25.\n- `(26,26)` from `9` \u2192 `8` so column 26 has `9` at every 4th row only, not one extra.\n\nAll other cells already respect their column\u2019s repetition and are unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\nHere is the completed output grid after making those corrections:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE

model_id=\"gemini-3-high_5_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n**Analyzing and Reconstructing an ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I need to take input grids and transform them into specific outputs. My approach involves a methodical breakdown. First, I'll dissect the provided input/output pairs to understand the underlying transformation logic. I'm looking for recurring patterns, periodic sequences, or any inherent structure that's being altered.\n\nThe initial example shows a framed structure with a \"content\" section inside. The key seems to be identifying the frame colors and the repetitive nature of the elements within the content area. I'm focusing on the \"glitches\" or deviations from an expected pattern and how they are corrected in the output. For example, a disrupted sequence is \"repaired\" to fit the underlying, regular structure. The pattern can be one-dimensional within each row or even two-dimensional where it interacts across multiple rows and columns.\n\nExample two further illustrates these ideas. The grid is clearly divided into regions by frames and separators. Each content area has its own pattern and those patterns may shift or have varying periodicity. This analysis is about identifying the common denominators within the noise. I'm looking for the most probable structure that has a certain rhythm.\n\nWhen I get to the test input, I use these insights to decode the structures and correct noisy data. I map the grid, isolate the regions, and then apply what I've learned about extracting periodic patterns, taking into account any disruptions. This involves a lot of close inspection to pick the most likely patterns and how those are altered or corrected to make the output.\n\nAfter identifying the key pattern, I can reconstruct the output. I will copy all elements except in the designated regions. And then I can recreate those sections to match the desired patterns. This requires attention to index. The periodic sequences could have glitches when mapped onto an index, which can throw off the pattern. And I have to be careful with indexing because I am replacing some elements in each step of my pattern. Once I understand the relationships between an input's disruptions and the pattern that should be present, I'll generate the new rows and replace the ones in the grid.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to solve an ARC task where we must identify patterns within grid regions and repair \"glitches\" or deviations from those patterns.\n\n**Analysis of the Task:**\n\n1.  **Structure Decomposition:**\n    *   The grid is composed of a background structure (borders) and foreground content regions.\n    *   **Borders:** There is an outer border of color 8 (Light Blue) and an inner structure using colors 8 and 3 (Green).\n    *   **Content Regions:** The grid is vertically divided into 4 distinct rectangular strips (regions) separated by vertical lines of color 3 and 8.\n        *   **Region 1:** Columns 2-5 (Width 4).\n        *   **Region 2:** Columns 9-12 (Width 4).\n        *   **Region 3:** Columns 16-19 (Width 4).\n        *   **Region 4:** Columns 23-26 (Width 4).\n    *   The rows containing content are Row 2 through Row 26. Rows 0, 1, 27, and 28 form the top and bottom borders.\n\n2.  **Pattern Identification per Region:**\n\n    *   **Region 1 (Leftmost):**\n        *   The rows exhibit a repeating 3-step cycle: `A, B, B`.\n        *   **A:** `8, 8, 8, 8`\n        *   **B:** `8, 2, 2, 8`\n        *   The cycle starts at Row 2.\n            *   Row 2 (Step 0): `8, 8, 8, 8` (A)\n            *   Row 3 (Step 1): `8, 2, 2, 8` (B)\n            *   Row 4 (Step 2): `8, 2, 2, 8` (B)\n            *   Row 5 (Step 0): `8, 8, 8, 8` (A)\n            *   ...and so on.\n\n    *   **Region 2 (Middle-Left):**\n        *   The pattern involves a single `1` moving diagonally on a background of `8`s, bouncing back and forth.\n        *   The positions of the `1` follow the sequence: 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1 (repeat).\n        *   Rows:\n            *   Pos 0: `1, 8, 8, 8`\n            *   Pos 1: `8, 1, 8, 8`\n            *   Pos 2: `8, 8, 1, 8`\n            *   Pos 3: `8, 8, 8, 1`\n        *   The cycle starts at Row 2 with Position 0.\n\n    *   **Region 3 (Middle-Right):**\n        *   The pattern alternates based on the row number (even vs. odd).\n        *   **Odd Rows (3, 5, ...):** Always `4, 4, 4, 4`.\n        *   **Even Rows (2, 4, ...):** A single `4` on a background of `8`s, alternating between the leftmost (Pos 0) and rightmost (Pos 3) columns.\n            *   Row 2: `4, 8, 8, 8` (Pos 0)\n            *   Row 4: `8, 8, 8, 4` (Pos 3)\n            *   Row 6: `4, 8, 8, 8` (Pos 0)\n            *   ...and so on.\n\n    *   **Region 4 (Rightmost):**\n        *   The rows exhibit a repeating 4-step cycle: `T1, T2, T3, T4`.\n        *   **T1:** `8, 8, 8, 8`\n        *   **T2:** `8, 9, 8, 8`\n        *   **T3:** `8, 9, 9, 8`\n        *   **T4:** `8, 9, 8, 8`\n        *   The cycle starts at Row 2.\n\n3.  **Correction Logic:**\n    *   We apply these derived ideal patterns to Rows 2 through 26.\n    *   Any deviation in the input grid (noise/glitches) is overwritten by the correct pattern.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n\nThe code below represents the final 29x29 grid generated by applying these rules.\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE

model_id=\"gemini-3-high_11_step_5_gemini_gen_sol\">\n**Alright, here's my breakdown of this ARC task.**\n\nThe user wants me to fix patterns in these grids. It looks like each grid has a repeating unit or \"tile,\" and the task is to correct deviations from that unit.\n\nFirst, I looked at the two solved examples to get a feel for what constitutes a \"correct\" pattern. Example 1 showed a simple alternating pattern disrupted by some \"noise,\" which was then corrected. Example 2 had vertically stacked panels with individual pattern problems in each.\n\nThen, I focused on the test input, which seems to be structured as a 29x29 grid split into four vertical \"strips.\" I found that the grid uses a kind of \"padding\" and a repeating unit that defines each column. Inside each strip, the patterns are the core of the challenge.\n\nLet's do the deep dive on those strips:\n\n*   **Strip 1:** It looks like a standard periodic repetition of 3 rows: 8888, 8228, 8228.\n\n*   **Strip 2:** The pattern here is a kind of bouncing line of \"1\" pixels against an \"8\" background, like zig-zagging. The period of the zig-zag is 13, and I figured out the best fit pattern by carefully considering the sequence 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 0 - and then applied a Period 13 cycle: 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1.\n\n*   **Strip 3:** It's a \"4444\" \"Background\" with a mix of \"8884\" and \"4888\". I'm calling it a Period 2 cycle: \"4888, 4444\" pattern, with an 8884 exception when there are 3 consecutive 4s\n\n*   **Strip 4:** I identified a period 4 unit `8888, 9888, 9988, 9888`\n\nNow, the plan is to fix the grid:\n\n*   **Strip 1:** Will apply a 3-row tile, fixing only the deviation at R24.\n\n*   **Strip 2:** Will apply a Period 13 pattern, fixing two deviation at R13 and R26.\n\n*   **Strip 3:** Will apply a Period 4 pattern, making the \"8884, 4444, 4888, 4444\" with three \"8884\" exceptions.\n\n*   **Strip 4:** Will apply a standard Period 4 with corrections for R3, R4, R5, R6, R24, and R26.\n\nMy goal is to create a complete and corrected version of this test grid based on these \"tile\" rules.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the structural patterns and periodicity in the test input, here is the reconstruction of the solution.\n\nThe grid consists of four vertical strips (panels) separated by columns of `8`s. Each strip has a distinct background and pattern logic. The goal is to identify the periodic \"tile\" or sequence for each strip and repair any deviations (noise, missing lines, or broken cycles).\n\n**Strip 1 (Cols 2-5):**\n*   **Pattern:** A 3-row repeating cycle: `8,8,8,8` (Frame), `8,2,2,8` (Hollow), `8,2,2,8` (Hollow).\n*   **Logic:** Rows 2, 5, 8, ... are full `8`s. Intermediate rows are `8`s with `2`s in the middle.\n*   **Corrections:** Row 24 input `8,8,2,8` is corrected to `8,2,2,8` to match the phase.\n\n**Strip 2 (Cols 9-12):**\n*   **Pattern:** A \"bouncing\" diagonal line of color `1` on a background of `8`. The cycle is Period 13.\n*   **Sequence:** `0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1`. (Where 0 is `1,8,8,8`, 1 is `8,1,8,8`, etc.).\n*   **Logic:** This sequence accounts for the \"dwell\" at the right edge (position 3) and the immediate return at the left edge (position 0) observed in the input.\n*   **Corrections:**\n    *   Row 13 (Input `1,8,1,8` noise) is corrected to `8,8,1,8` (Position 2).\n    *   Row 26 (Input `8,1,8,8`) is corrected to `8,8,1,8` (Position 2) to complete the cycle.\n\n**Strip 3 (Cols 16-19):**\n*   **Pattern:** Alternating rows of solid `4`s (`4,4,4,4`) and Pattern rows (`4,8,8,8` or `8,8,8,4`).\n*   **Logic:**\n    *   The \"separator\" rows of `4,4,4,4` occur on odd indices relative to the pattern start (Rows 3, 5, 7, etc.).\n    *   The \"content\" rows alternate. The dominant pattern is `4,8,8,8` (Left-aligned 4), but specific rows (4, 9, 24) are `8,8,8,4` (Right-aligned 4).\n    *   I will enforce the alternation and specific instances found in valid input rows, repairing noise like `4,4,8,8` in Row 2 to `4,8,8,8` and `4,4,8,4` in Row 8 to `4,4,4,4`.\n*   **Refined Logic:** The Period 4 pattern `4888, 4444, 8884, 4444` appears to be the underlying rule, but with a phase shift or irregularity in the middle. Given the high density of `4888` in the bottom half and `8884` in specific upper rows, I will standardize on `4,8,8,8` for the pattern rows unless the input strongly indicated `8,8,8,4` in a valid position (Rows 4, 9, 24).\n    *   Actually, looking at the Period 4 structure in Strip 4, Strip 3 likely follows a similar Period 4 or Period 2. The most robust fix is: Odd rows (3,5...) are `4,4,4,4`. Even rows are `4,8,8,8`. The `8,8,8,4` entries at 4, 9, 24 are preserved where they don't conflict with the `4,4,4,4` grid, but most noise (like in Row 8) is cleared to `4,4,4,4`.\n\n**Strip 4 (Cols 23-26):**\n*   **Pattern:** A 4-row repeating cycle: `8,8,8,8`, `9,8,8,8`, `9,9,8,8`, `9,8,8,8`.\n*   **Logic:** This is an expanding and contracting bar of `9`s.\n*   **Corrections:** Fixes applied to Rows 3-6 (phase mismatch/noise) and Row 24, 26 to match the established Period 4 pattern starting from Row 7.\n\noutput:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,9,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,9,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,9,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,9,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,9,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,9,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 16>\n<CANDIDATE 17>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 29x29\n88888888888888888888888888888\n83333338333333833333383333338\n83888838318883834888383888838\n83822838381883834444383888838\n83822838388183838884383899838\n838888383888138344443838898838\n83822838388183834888383888838\n83822838381883834444383888838\n83888838318883838884383899838\n838228383818838344443838898838\n83822838388183834888383888838\n83888838388813834444383888838\n83822838388183838884383899838\n838228383818838344443838898838\n83888838318883834888383888838\n83822838381883834444383888838\n83822838388183838884383899838\n838888383888138344443838898838\n83822838388183834888383888838\n83822838381883834444383888838\n83888838318883838884383899838\n838228383818838344443838898838\n83822838388183834888383888838\n83888838388813834444383888838\n83822838388183838884383899838\n838228383818838344443838898838\n83888838318883834888383888838\n83333338333333833333383333338\n88888888888888888888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gemini-3-high_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\n**Here's how I'm approaching this ARC task:**\n\nI'm being presented with a coding problem based on two example input/output grids and a test grid. My goal is to deduce the pattern and apply the corrections, simulating a visual repair on a damaged image. This is a task that heavily relies on pattern recognition, spatial reasoning, and the ability to extrapolate from limited examples. I have to interpret the data, identify irregularities, and replace 'defective' areas with the correct repeating sequence to produce a correct grid.\n\n**Initial Analysis and Decoding the Rules:**\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grid format. I start by observing that the grids are framed by a border element ('3', '4', '8' respectively). The central region contains the data. I'm noting that the task involves \"independent panels framed by borders.\" Example 2 has multiple panels and this is reinforced in the test input. The hints also stress looking at repeating units within each panel. I initially assume that I need to process each grid row, independently, to correct the pattern.\n\n**Breaking Down the Examples:**\n\nThe two examples give me concrete cases to start. I'm focusing on identifying the repeating elements and any disruption.\n\n*   **Example 1**: The first example showcases a simple grid. The input row has a pattern (repeating \"1, 3\" ) disrupted by a sequence of \"3,3.\" The task is to replace this disruptive pixel block with the repeating unit \"1,3\" to restore the sequence. I'm focusing on the border pixels and the content.\n\n*   **Example 2**: I'm quickly realizing this is a multi-panel grid. I focus on how the borders work and use it to divide up my problem. After carefully looking at this example, I realize that it consists of vertical panel divisions. Then I look at a row's contents to see what patterns are present. I find the repeating unit is `1, 4` - however, '4' is the border number. This causes me to re-evaluate the patterns, as the border can act as part of a recurring element in this example. I determine this by looking at how pixels break the pattern, and which pixels make up the repeating unit.\n\n**Test Input - The Real Challenge:**\n\nThe test input is larger, more complex, with 4 columns - or vertical panels - and requires the patterns of each panel to be restored. I start by carefully checking out the borders ('8') and what divides up the contents. I determine the borders that define the sub-regions, focusing on the vertical '3's that act as dividers. Now, my task is to identify patterns in each region. The key is in determining *vertical* patterns. I then find a vertical repeating sequence within each subgrid and analyze those regions independently. I realize that the overall pattern repeats vertically. I find that this is an *A, B, C* pattern for each section. I look at each panel and determine the underlying patterns:\n*   Panel 1: \"A, B, B\" pattern\n*   Panel 2: Scanner (or zig-zag) like pattern where a '1' moves position down each row.\n*   Panel 3: Two repeating rows *A* and *B*, that themselves repeat.\n*   Panel 4: \"A, A, B, C\"\n\nNow, I'm identifying any local errors within these sequences. I analyze the example, row by row and note which pixels in each panel are defective and, in each case, the correct value for the pixel. This becomes my rule to fix the test input.\n\n**Formulating the Implementation:**\n\nBased on the patterns identified, I'm forming a plan:\n1.  Read in the test input grid.\n2.  I break each grid row into its panels, based on the `3` borders.\n3.  Based on my previous analysis, I identify the positions where defective elements are.\n4.  I replace the defective values with the correct element from the repeating unit in its pattern.\n5.  I construct the final output grid and return it.\n\n\nTo solve this task, I first identified the structure of the grid. The image consists of independent vertical panels separated by border columns. The borders are marked by the value `8` (teal) and separator columns of `3` (green). Within these panels, there are repeating visual patterns that contain local defects. The goal is to deduce the correct pattern for each panel from the intact rows and repair the defective pixels.\n\n**Panel Identification:**\nThe grid (rows 0-28, cols 0-28) contains four vertical data panels:\n1.  **Panel 1:** Columns 2-5 (width 4).\n2.  **Panel 2:** Columns 9-12 (width 4).\n3.  **Panel 3:** Columns 16-19 (width 4).\n4.  **Panel 4:** Columns 23-26 (width 4).\n\n**Pattern Analysis and Repair:**\n\n**Panel 1 (Cols 2-5):**\n*   **Pattern:** A vertical repeating sequence of rows `A, B, B`, where `A = [8, 8, 8, 8]` and `B = [8, 2, 2, 8]`.\n*   **Defect:**\n    *   Row 24: Input is `[8, 8, 2, 8]`. It corresponds to pattern B (`[8, 2, 2, 8]`).\n    *   **Repair:** Change cell (24, 3) from `8` to `2`.\n\n**Panel 2 (Cols 9-12):**\n*   **Pattern:** A \"bouncing\" single pixel of color `1` on a background of `8`s. The position of `1` follows the sequence 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, ...\n*   **Defects:**\n    *   Row 12: Sequence position 2 (expected `1` at col 11). Input `[1, 8, 1, 8]` has extra `1` at col 9.\n        *   **Repair:** Change (12, 9) from `1` to `8`.\n    *   Row 23: Sequence position 3 (expected `1` at col 12). Input `[8, 8, 1, 8]` has `1` at col 11.\n        *   **Repair:** Change (23, 11) from `1` to `8`, (23, 12) from `8` to `1`.\n    *   Row 25: Sequence position 1 (expected `1` at col 10). Input `[8, 8, 1, 8]` has `1` at col 11.\n        *   **Repair:** Change (25, 10) from `8` to `1`, (25, 11) from `1` to `8`.\n    *   Row 26: Sequence position 0 (expected `1` at col 9). Input `[8, 1, 8, 8]` has `1` at col 10.\n        *   **Repair:** Change (26, 9) from `8` to `1`, (26, 10) from `1` to `8`.\n\n**Panel 3 (Cols 16-19):**\n*   **Pattern:** Even rows alternate between `A = [4, 8, 8, 8]` and `B = [8, 8, 8, 4]`. Odd rows are always `Filler = [4, 4, 4, 4]`.\n*   **Defects:**\n    *   Row 2: Should be A. Input `[4, 4, 8, 8]`. **Repair:** (2, 17) `4` -> `8`.\n    *   Row 13: Should be Filler.

Input `[4, 8, 8, 8]`. **Repair:** (19, 17) `8`->`4`, (19, 18) `8`->`4`, (19, 19) `8`->`4`.\n    *   Row 20: Should be B. Input `[4, 4, 4, 4]`. **Repair:** (20, 16) `4`->`8`, (20, 17) `4`->`8`, (20, 18) `4`->`8`.\n    *   Row 21: Should be Filler. Input `[8, 8, 8, 4]`. **Repair:** (21, 16) `8`->`4`, (21, 17) `8`->`4`, (21, 18) `8`->`4`.\n    *   Row 22: Should be A. Input `[4, 4, 4, 4]`. **Repair:** (22, 17) `4`->`8`, (22, 18) `4`->`8`, (22, 19) `4`->`8`.\n    *   Row 23: Should be Filler.

The user wants me to solve this Arc task based on two provided examples, and I've dissected them thoroughly.\n\nFirst, I recognized a recurring theme: identify the frame, then the internal panels or rows, determine the patterns, and fix the defects. The examples help to establish this general strategy.\n\n**Example 1**: I zeroed in on the alternating `1, 3` pattern in the first example, noting the disruption and fixing this \"broken\" element. The pattern's periodicity was the key, so I focused on it.\n\n**Example 2**: This became a more complex task, with the main task of breaking down the grid into panels separated by a yellow frame color. I could then see internal, repeating sequences within them. Patterns like `3, 3, 4` and `1, 4` emerged, but I really paid attention to where the inputs deviated from these. One row had a repeating disruption in the output. I also noticed that the panels were of a certain height and had periodic rows. Panel borders were also evident.\n\n**Moving to the Test Input:**\n\nI then tackled the test input, armed with this structured thinking. I identified the frame color (teal, or 8) and noticed how it established a grid-like structure with vertical dividers. Each of these components seemed to have patterns I could exploit.\n\n*   **Vertical Panels:** The dividers (also 8s) created these vertical panels within the grid.\n*   **Horizontal Segmentation:** Horizontal dividing lines also exist (row 1, 27). The frame color (8).\n*   **Panel Content:** The content within these, I decided were from R2 to R26.\n\nI looked in detail and discovered, after a few iterations, that each \"Panel\" has an internal structure. They should be built with repeating sequences. The analysis helped identify those. In summary:\n\n*   **Panel 1:** Vertical repetition. (0,1,2,2)\n*   **Panel 2:** \"Zigzag\" 1 movement in each row: 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1 and repeat.\n*   **Panel 3:** 0,1,2,3 for vertical direction.\n*   **Panel 4:** 0, 1, 2, 3 with patterns of 4x1 pixels.\n\nI took the test input and performed an iterative analysis of the panels, figuring out what sequences were occurring in the input, and correcting deviations from that. The most prominent pattern was a vertical repeating sequence with period 4, and some disturbances.\n\n**Key takeaway**\n\nAll of this analysis then lead to this overall strategy to construct the output, which will be the sum of all the patterns I have been able to extract from the example analysis. I will create a grid of 29x29 and start from scratch.\n\n*   Initialize all with 8's.\n*   Add 3's in the appropriate cells from Rows 1 and 27 to make frame.\n*   Apply the repeating sequences to the Panels I have defined to generate final pattern.\n\nI feel confident in my proposed solution. Now, let's turn these insights into the correct output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to repair a grid containing several independent panels. Based on the analysis of the test input and the provided examples, here is the breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**:\n    *   The grid (29x29) is divided into four vertical panels separated by columns of `8` (teal) and bounded by columns of `3` (green).\n    *   **Frame**: Rows 0 and 28 are solid `8`s. Columns 0, 7, 14, 21, 28 are `8`s.\n    *   **Panel Borders**: Rows 1 and 27 are horizontal borders (`8` at the frame columns, `3` elsewhere). Columns 1, 6, 8, 13, 15, 20, 22, 27 are vertical borders of `3`s spanning from Row 2 to Row 26.\n    *   **Content Regions**: There are 4 distinct content areas (Panels) spanning Rows 2 through 26. Each is 4 pixels wide.\n        *   Panel 1: Cols 2-5\n        *   Panel 2: Cols 9-12\n        *   Panel 3: Cols 16-19\n        *   Panel 4: Cols 23-26\n\n2.  **Pattern Identification & Repair**:\n    We analyze each panel's content rows (indices 2 to 26) to find the periodic pattern and repair defects.

What the examples are doing\n\n- In both solved examples, the picture is divided into **panels** by a uniform border color (3 in example 1, 4 in example 2).\n- Inside a panel, certain rows contain a **repeating 1\u2011D pattern** (e.g. `1,3,1,3,...` or `3,3,4,3,3,4,...`).\n- A few cells break this periodic pattern (e.g. `...,3,3,3,...` where you expect `...,1,3,1,...`).\n- The output is obtained by **repairing only those defective cells** so that each row\u2019s pattern becomes perfectly periodic, while borders and all other cells remain unchanged.\n\nThe key operations:\n- Identify the border color and panel boundaries.\n- Within each panel, deduce the intended periodic pattern from the majority of cells.\n- Locate cells that violate this pattern and overwrite them with the correct color to restore periodicity.\n\n### 2. Structure of the test grid\n\n- Border color is **8**: the outer frame (row 0, row 28, column 0, column 28) is all 8.\n- Inside, there are **vertical panels** separated by full columns of 8 at columns 7, 14, 21:\n  - Panel 1: columns 1\u20136\n  - Panel 2: columns 8\u201313\n  - Panel 3: columns 15\u201320\n  - Panel 4: columns 22\u201327\n- Each panel uses colors `{3, 8}` plus one \u201cspecial\u201d color:\n  - Panel 1: special color 2\n  - Panel 2: special color 1\n  - Panel 3: special color 4\n  - Panel 4: special color 9\n\nThe patterns in these panels are **vertical waves/stripes**:\n- Panel 1: columns 3 and 4 alternate in a periodic `8,2,2,8,2,2,...` fashion.\n- Panel 2: a single `1` moves back and forth across columns 2\u20135 (a vertical triangular wave).\n- Panel 3: columns show regular alternations/blocks of 4 and 8 (e.g. alternation in column 17, and 4\u2011of\u2011a\u2011kind / 8\u2011of\u2011a\u2011kind blocks in other columns).\n- Panel 4: columns 24\u201325 form a regular stripe pattern of 9\u2019s: the row types repeat in a `2,1,0,1` cycle (where 2 = double\u20119, 1 = single\u20119, 0 = no 9).\n\nIn almost all rows, these vertical patterns are perfectly regular; a **few cells** clearly break them.\n\n### 3. Finding and fixing the defects\n\nProcess each panel independently, column by column, to preserve the vertical periodic pattern.\n\n#### Panel 2 (columns 8\u201313, special color 1)\n\nPanel 2 grid (rows 1\u201327, columns 8\u201313, with interior indices 1\u20136):\n\n- General pattern:\n  - Column 1 and 6: always 3 (frame inside the panel).\n  - Columns 2\u20135: there is **exactly one `1` per row** (rows 2\u201326), moving as a triangular wave across columns 2\u20135:\n    - Expected column of the `1` by row (r = 2..26):  \n      `2,3,4,5,4,3,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,3,4,5,4,3,2`\n\nCompare with actual panel entries:\n\n- In every row except one, there is a **single** `1` at the expected column.\n- **Row 12** (global row index 12) has two `1`s: at panel column 2 and panel column 4:\n  - Original row 12, columns 8\u201313: `3,1,8,1,8,3`\n  - Expected (from the wave): only column 4 should be 1; column 2 should be 8.\n- So the cell at **(row 12, column 9)** (0-based column index; panel column 2) is a defect: `1` should be `8`.\n\n**Fix 1:** row 12 col 9: `1 \u2192 8`.\n\n#### Panel 1 (columns 1\u20136, special color 2)\n\nPanel 1 grid (rows 1\u201327):\n\nTypical rows are either:\n- `3,8,8,8,8,3` (no 2\u2019s in the middle rows of that vertical period), or\n- `3,8,2,2,8,3` (two adjacent 2\u2019s forming a vertical stripe).\n\nLook at columns 3 and 4 across rows:\n- Column 3 pattern from rows 2\u201326: `8,2,2,8,2,2,8,2,2,...`\n- Column 4 pattern from rows 2\u201326: exactly the same `8,2,2,8,2,2,...`\n\nCheck for breaks:\n- Every row matches this 3\u2011step pattern except **row 24** (global index 24) in column 3:\n  - Original panel row 24, cols 1\u20136: `3,8,8,2,8,3`\n  - Pattern says column 3 at that row should be `2`, not `8`.\n\nSo:\n\n**Fix 2:** row 24 col 3: `8 \u2192 2`.\n\n#### Panel 3 (columns 15\u201320, special color 4)\n\nPanel 3 grid (rows 1\u201327, cols 15\u201320):\n\n- Column 15 and 20: always 3 (inner framing) \u2013 no anomalies.\n- Column 16: periodic pattern `4,4,8` repeated (8 appears exactly on rows 4,8,12,16,20,24); current data already fits this.\n- Column 18: perfect alternation `8,4,8,4,...`; no defects.\n- Column 19: repeating pattern: one `8` followed by three `4`s; no defects.\n\nThe only irregularities occur in **column 17**:\n\nColumn 17 values by row (1\u201327) as read from the input:\n\n- r1: 3 (border-adjacent, special)\n- r2: 4\n- r3: 4\n- r4: 8\n- r5: 4\n- r6: 8\n- r7: 4\n- r8: 8\n- r9: 4\n- r10: 8\n- r11: 4\n- r12: 8\n- r13: 8\n- r14: 8\n- r15: 4\n- r16: 8\n- r17: 4\n- r18: 8\n- r19: 4\n- r20: 8\n- r21: 4\n- r22: 8\n- r23: 8\n- r24: 8\n- r25: 4\n- r26: 8\n- r27: 3\n\nFrom row 3 downward, the intended pattern is a strict alternation:\n\n`4,8,4,8,4,8,4,8,4,8,4,8,4,8,4,8,4,8,4,8,4,8,4,8` (rows 3\u201326)\n\nComparing:\n- At **row 13** and **row 23**, column 17 is `8` where the alternation demands `4`:\n  - Row 13, panel 3: `3,4,8,4,4,3` \u2192 should be `3,4,4,4,4,3`.\n  - Row 23, panel 3: `3,4,8,4,4,3` \u2192 should be `3,4,4,4,4,3`.\n\nSo:\n\n**Fix 3:** row 13 col 17: `8 \u2192 4`.  \n**Fix 4:** row 23 col 17: `8 \u2192 4`.\n\n#### Panel 4 (columns 22\u201327, special color 9)\n\nPanel 4 grid exhibits three \u201crow types\u201d inside rows 2\u201326:\n- Type 0: `[3,8,8,8,8,3]` (no 9\u2019s)\n- Type 1: `[3,8,9,8,8,3]` (single 9 at col 24)\n- Type 2: `[3,8,9,9,8,3]` (two 9\u2019s at cols 24\u201325)\n\nThe sequence of row types is periodic starting at row 4:\n\n`2,1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0` (rows 4\u201326)\n\nCompare with the input types:\n- They match everywhere except at **row 25**, which is Type 2 instead of the expected Type 1:\n  - Original row 25, P4: `[3,8,9,9,8,3]`\n  - It should be `[3,8,9,8,8,3]` (only one 9 in that row).\n\nSo:\n\n**Fix 5:** row 25 col 25: `9 \u2192 8`.\n\nAll other cells in all panels fit their respective periodic vertical patterns, so no further changes are made.\n\n### 4.

                "response": "**Initial Assessment: Deep Dive into the ARC Puzzle and Candidate Solutions**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to review a bunch of potential solutions for this ARC puzzle. The core task? Fix corrupted patterns within grids. My initial thought process involves a detailed analysis of the examples, the test input, and then devising a strategy to evaluate each candidate.\n\nFirst, I'm breaking down the problem. The examples show that we're dealing with rectangular \"panels\" within a larger grid. Each panel has a repeating pattern \u2013 the puzzle involves identifying this periodicity and then correcting any cells that deviate. For example, a \"1,3\" pattern disturbed by a \"3,3\" needs to become \"1,3\" again.\n\nNext, I'm examining the test input itself. It's a 29x29 grid with specific border sizes and vertical dividers. This grid is divided into four panels, each with a different repeating pattern. I'm carefully analyzing these patterns, their cycle lengths, and how they interact (or don't) with each other. This is crucial for anticipating errors.\n\nI've identified key \"defects\" in the test input. For instance, in Panel 1, a cell should be an \"8\", but it's a \"2\", this needs fixing. Panel 2 has several, I need to verify them. Panel 3, the pattern is slightly complex, even rows seem to vary from odd ones. Panel 4 has what I think is a 4 cycle, this will be verified.\n\nNow, my strategy for evaluating the candidate solutions is taking shape. I'm going to look for the candidate that correctly identifies the periodic patterns and, most importantly, *correctly fixes* the deviations in the test input. Accuracy is key.\n\nI've listed the most likely errors that a strong candidate should detect and fix. It's time to put these candidates through their paces and see if they have the right reasoning and, crucially, consistent execution to identify and fix these defects. I'll need to double check how the index lines are referenced in the input text, which is causing confusion. I'm also finding a lot of candidates are hallucinating. I must rely on my own analysis.\n\nOkay, let's start dissecting these candidates.\n\n\n<AUDIT_LOG>\n### Phase 1: Logic Selection & Crystallization\n\n**Candidate 15 (Gemini-3-High)** provides the most detailed and effective reasoning, despite some minor hallucinations in the text description of the input values (a common artifact).\n\n**Crystallized Rule (from Candidate 15):**\n1.  **Grid Parsing:** Divide the 29x29 grid into 4 vertical panels defined by the border color 8 and separator columns.\n    *   Panel 1: Cols 2-5\n    *   Panel 2: Cols 9-12\n    *   Panel 3: Cols 16-19\n    *   Panel 4: Cols 23-26\n2.  **Pattern Enforcement:** For each panel, apply a specific periodic vertical pattern to rows 2-26.\n    *   **Panel 1 (Period 3):** Rows modulo 3.\n        *   0: `8,8,8,8`\n        *   1: `8,2,2,8`\n        *   2: `8,2,2,8`\n    *   **Panel 2 (Period 6):** Single `1` bouncing `0,1,2,3,2,1` (column indices relative to panel).\n    *   **Panel 3 (Period 4):**\n        *   Odd rows relative to start (indices 1, 3...): `4,4,4,4`\n        *   Even rows (indices 0, 2): Alternate `4,8,8,8` and `8,8,8,4`.\n    *   **Panel 4 (Period 4):** Expanding/Contracting 9s.\n        *   0: `8,8,8,8`\n        *   1: `8,9,8,8`\n        *   2: `8,9,9,8`\n        *   3: `8,9,8,8`\n3.  **Correction:** Overwrite any cell in the input that deviates from this strict periodic schema.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 2: The Ground Truth Audit\n\n**Example 1:**\n- **Hypothesis:** Pattern is `1,3,1,3...`. Input `3,3,3` violates this. Rule says \"Overwrite deviations\". Output should be `1,3,1`.\n- **Observation:** Output is `1,3,1`.\n- **Verdict:** Pass.\n\n**Example 2:**\n- **Hypothesis:** Multiple panels.\n    - 3s panel: `3,3,4` period. Input `4,4` corrected to `3,3`.\n    - 1s panel: `1,4` alternation. Input `1,1,1` corrected to `1,4,1`.\n- **Observation:** Output matches these corrections.\n- **Verdict:** Pass.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 3: Execution Consistency\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n- **Panel 1 (Cols 2-5):**\n    - Defect at Row 24 (index 24): Input `8,8,2,8`. Pattern (24%3=0 -> `8,8,8,8`? No, pattern aligns such that R2=0. So R24 is index 22 in pattern. 22%3=1 -> `8,2,2,8`. Correct). Input `8,8,2,8`. Fix: Col 3 `8`->`2`.\n    - **Candidate 15 Output:** Row 24 (Line 26) shows `8,2,2,8`. **Correct.**\n- **Panel 2 (Cols 9-12):**\n    - Defect at Row 12 (index 12): Input `1,8,1,8`. Pattern (12-2=10; 10%6=4 -> pos 2 `8,8,1,8`). Fix: Col 9 `1`->`8`.\n    - Defect at Row 23 (index 23): Input `8,8,1,8`. Pattern (23-2=21; 21%6=3 -> pos 3 `8,8,8,1`). Fix: `8,8,1,8` -> `8,8,8,1`.\n    - **Candidate 15 Output:** Row 12 shows `8,8,1,8`. Row 23 (Line 25) shows `8,8,8,1`. **Correct.**\n- **Panel 3 (Cols 16-19):**\n    - Defect at Row 13 (index 13): Input `4,8,4,4`. Pattern (Odd index 11 -> `4,4,4,4`). Fix: Col 17 `8`->`4`.\n    - Defect at Row 23 (index 23): Input `4,8,4,4` (or similar). Pattern (Odd index 21 -> `4,4,4,4`). Fix: Col 17 `8`->`4`.\n    - **Candidate 15 Output:** Rows 13 and 23 show `4,4,4,4`. **Correct.**\n- **Panel 4 (Cols 23-26):**\n    - Defect at Row 25 (index 25): Input `8,9,9,8`. Pattern (25-2=23; 23%4=3 -> `8,9,8,8`). Fix: `9`->`8` at col 25.\n    - **Candidate 15 Output:** Row 25 (Line 27) shows `8,9,8,8`. **Correct.**\n\n**Comparison with Runner-Up (Candidate 0):**\n- Candidate 0 correctly identified patterns but failed execution on Panel 2 Row 23 (Output `8188` instead of `8881`).\n- Candidate 15 correctly executed all complex fixes.\n\n**Conclusion:** Candidate 15 is the only candidate that successfully repaired all identified defects in the test input, including the tricky \"off-by-one\" errors in the zigzag pattern and the alternating periodicity in Panel 3.\n\n### Phase 4: Stack Ranking\n\n1.  **Candidate 15 (Tier 1 - Gold):** Flawless execution on the test grid. Correctly identified and fixed every distinct error pattern.\n2.  **Candidate 0 (Tier 2 - Silver):** Excellent logic but a single execution error (internal contradiction) on Panel 2.\n3.  **Candidate 10 (Tier 3 - Bronze):** Fixed some panels but missed others (Panel 2).\n4.  **Candidate 9 (Tier 3 - Bronze):** Missed multiple repairs.\n5.  **Candidate 4 (Tier 3 - Bronze):** Minimal repairs only.\n6.  **Candidate 1 (Tier 4 - Invalid):** Hallucinated input values.\n\n</AUDIT_LOG>\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 15,\n      \"score\": 9.8,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Correctly generalizes the 'periodic pattern repair' logic to multiple distinct panel types.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Perfect\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Divides grid into 4 panels, identifies the unique periodicity (periods 3, 6, 4, 4) for each, and strictly enforces these patterns to repair local defects.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 8.5,\n      \"tier\": \"SILVER\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Logic is sound and matches Gold.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"High_With_Error\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Identical logic to Gold, but failed to correctly generate the grid for Panel 2 Row 23 (Internal Contradiction between text and grid).\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 10,\n      \"score\": 6.0,\n      \"tier\": \"BRONZE\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Standard repair logic.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Partial\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Correctly fixes Panels 1 and 4, but fails to apply fixes to Panels 2 and 3 despite identifying them in text.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 9,\n      \"score\": 5.0,\n      \"tier\": \"BRONZE\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Standard repair logic.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Partial\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Misses corrections in Panels 2, 3, and 4.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 4,\n      \"score\": 3.0,\n      \"tier\": \"BRONZE\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Basic pattern matching.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Low\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Only identifies the most obvious outliers; fails to detect phase/periodicity errors.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 1,\n      \"score\": 1.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Partial\",\n          \"2\": \"Fail\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Reasoning is confused about row indices.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"None\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Hallucinates input values and row indices.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Each grid contains patterns that repeat in regular ways\n- Some cells deviate from the expected pattern (errors)\n- The transformation corrects these errors to restore the regular pattern\n\n**Example Analysis:**\n- Example 1: Pattern \"1,3,1,3,1...\" has a \"3,3\" error that gets corrected to \"1,3\"\n- Example 2: Multiple panels with repeating patterns have anomalies that are corrected\n\n**Test Input Structure:**\nThe grid has 4 panels separated by borders (8s and 3s):\n- Panel 1 (cols 2-5): Pattern alternates between \"8,8,8,8\" every 3rd row and \"8,2,2,8\" otherwise\n- Panel 2 (cols 9-12): Zigzag pattern of 1s (positions 0,1,2,3,2,1 repeating)\n- Panel 3 (cols 16-19): Odd rows are \"4,4,4,4\", even rows alternate between \"8,8,8,4\" and \"4,8,8,8\"\n- Panel 4 (cols 23-26): 4-row repeating pattern starting from row 4\n\n**Errors Found:**\n1.

In both training examples the outer frame (one colour) and an inner frame (another colour) are untouched.\n   - Inside each framed strip there is a 1\u2011dimensional pattern that repeats regularly along the strip (e.g. `1,3,1,3,1,3,\u2026` or `3,3,4,3,3,4,\u2026`).\n   - In the inputs, a few cells break that repetition (e.g. a `3,3` where we expect `1,3`).  \n     The outputs simply restore the perfect repetition of the pattern while leaving the frames as\u2011is.\n\n   So the transformation is:\n\n   > For every \u201ccorridor\u201d of non\u2011frame cells, detect the repeating motif from the consistent part of the pattern and overwrite the corridor so that the motif repeats without defects.\n\n2. **Structure of the test grid**\n\n   - Outer frame is colour **8** (whole border).\n   - Just inside it, there is a solid frame of **3** (row 1, row 27, and some columns).\n   - All remaining cells are inside this frame and contain mostly 8\u2019s, with patterns in colours **2, 1, 4, 9**.\n   - Looking down the grid, rows inside the frame repeat in cycles: after a few rows you see the same row re\u2011appear (same positions of 1\u2019s, 4\u2019s, 9\u2019s, etc.). So the vertical pattern is periodic.\n\n3. **Finding the motifs and defects**\n\n   I looked at the repeating rows/columns for each non\u2011frame colour separately.\n\n   **(a) Colour 2 (columns 3\u20134)**  \n   - Columns 3 and 4 (0\u2011based indices 3 and 4) show a perfect vertical pattern `8,2,2,8,2,2,\u2026` in triplets of rows, except at row 24 (0\u2011based) column 3, which is `8` instead of `2`.\n   - Fix: set that cell to `2`.\n\n   **(b) Colour 1 (columns 9\u201312)**  \n   - In every interior row there is exactly one `1` somewhere in columns 9\u201312, and its column moves in a 6\u2011row cycle  \n     `9,10,11,12,11,10, 9,10,11,12,11,10, \u2026`.\n   - Almost all rows follow this zig\u2011zag except:\n     - Row 12 has two `1`s at columns 9 and 11 (should only be at 11).\n     - Row 23 has a `1` at column 11, but according to the cycle it should be at column 12.\n   - Fixes:\n     - Row 12, col 9: change `1 \u2192 8`.\n     - Row 23, col 11: change `1 \u2192 8`.\n     - Row 23, col 12: change `8 \u2192 1`.\n\n   **(c) Colour 4 (columns 16\u201319)**  \n   - In these four columns, rows fall into repeating types:\n     - Type B: `4,4,4,4`\n     - Type C: `8,8,8,4`\n     - Type D: `4,8,8,8`\n   - Down the grid (ignoring the very first pattern row) the sequence of row types is  \n     `B, C, B, D, B, C, B, D, \u2026`.\n   - Two rows (13 and 23, 0\u2011based) should be type B but instead have `4,8,4,4` (only column 17 is wrong).\n   - Fixes:\n     - Row 13, col 17: change `8 \u2192 4`.\n     - Row 23, col 17: change `8 \u2192 4`.\n\n   **(d) Colour 9 (columns 24\u201325)**  \n   - Column 24: from row 4 downwards, pattern is `9,9,8,9` repeating; this is already consistent.\n   - Column 25: 9\u2019s occur every 4th row (rows 4,8,12,16,20,24), which is the clear motif, except row 25 also has a 9.\n   - Fix:\n     - Row 25, col 25: change `9 \u2192 8`.\n\n   No other cells deviate from these established periodic motifs, and the 8/3 frame is left unchanged.\n\n4. **Resulting output grid**\n\nApplying all the corrections above yields:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"E\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_7_step_5_image\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at the examples, I can see the transformation involves:\n1.

odd rows are all 4s, even rows alternate between 8,8,8,4 and 4,8,8,8\n- **Panel 4 (cols 23-26)**: Pattern with color 9 - period 4: 8,9,9,8 | 8,9,8,8 | 8,8,8,8 | 8,9,8,8\n\n**Identified Deviations:**\n1. **Row 12, Panel 2**: 1,8,1,8 should be 8,8,1,8 (extra 1 at position 0)\n2. **Row 13, Panel 3**: 4,8,4,4 should be 4,4,4,4 (odd index should be all 4s)\n3. **Row 23, Panel 2**: 8,8,1,8 should be 8,8,8,1 (1 at wrong position)\n4. **Row 23, Panel 3**: 4,8,4,4 should be 4,4,4,4 \n5. **Row 24, Panel 1**: 8,8,2,8 should be 8,2,2,8 (missing 2)\n6. **Row 25, Panel 4**: 8,9,9,8 should be 8,9,8,8 (extra 9)\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"H\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-medium_11_step_5_gemini_gen_sol\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Reasoning / Reconstruction**\n\n1. **From the solved examples**\n\n   - In both example problems, the grids are composed of \u201cframed\u201d regions with background colors and inner textured bands (e.g. alternating colors or periodic triples).\n   - The transformation does **not** change the overall layout or the frame/background colors.  \n   - It **fixes local pattern violations**: when a row or column segment is almost perfectly periodic (e.g. `3,3,4` repeating or `1,3,1,3,1` alternating) and a few cells break that pattern, those outliers are corrected.\n\n   So the rule is:\n\n   > For each textured region in the frame, infer the dominant periodic pattern (often from the majority of rows/columns) and correct any cells that break that pattern.\n\n2. **Identifying periodic regions in the test input**\n\n   Inside the outer `8` border and `3` background we see several vertical \u201ctexture stripes\u201d that mix background colors (`3` or `8`) with a pattern color:\n\n   - Columns 2\u20135: mostly `8` with some `2` \u2192 a **(8,2)** stripe.\n   - Columns 9\u201312: mostly `8` with a moving `1` \u2192 a **(8,1)** stripe.\n   - Columns 16\u201319: mix of `4` and `8` \u2192 a **(4,8)** stripe.\n   - Columns 24\u201325: mix of `9` and `8` \u2192 a **(9,8)** stripe.\n   - The other columns (1,6,7,8,13,14,15,20,21,22,23,26,27) are stable frames/backgrounds and never change color type.\n\n   For each of these stripes, you can read down the columns and see **clear periodic patterns** with just a few outliers near the bottom.\n\n3. **Stripe 1: columns 3 and 4 (colors 8 and 2)**\n\n   Consider column 3 (0\u2011indexed):\n\n   - From row 2 to row 23 (inclusive), the values follow a perfect period-3 pattern:  \n     `8,2,2, 8,2,2, 8,2,2, ...`\n   - At rows 24\u201326 this pattern is broken: the sequence should continue as `..., 8,2,2, 8`, but we see `8,8,2` instead.\n\n   The same is true for column 4.\n\n   So we enforce the `[8,2,2]` pattern down to row 26:\n\n   - Row 24: `c3,c4` must be `2,2` (they were `8,8`).\n   - Row 25: `c3` must be `2` (was `8`); `c4` already `2`.\n   - Row 26: `c3,c4` must be `8,8` (they were `2,2`).\n\n4. **Stripe 2: columns 9\u201312 (colors 1 and 8)**\n\n   In each interior row, exactly **one** of the four cells (c9\u2013c12) is `1` and the rest are `8`. The position of that `1` follows a 6-row periodic \u201ctriangle wave\u201d:\n\n   - For rows `r = 2..26`, define `k = r - 2` and pattern `[0,1,2,3,2,1]` for the column index (0..3) of the `1`.\n   - Up to row 11 and again from row 13 to 22 this is obeyed perfectly:\n     - r2: `[1,8,8,8]` \u2192 pos 0  \n     - r3: `[8,1,8,8]` \u2192 pos 1  \n     - r4: `[8,8,1,8]` \u2192 pos 2  \n     - r5: `[8,8,8,1]` \u2192 pos 3  \n     - r6: `[8,8,1,8]` \u2192 pos 2  \n     - r7: `[8,1,8,8]` \u2192 pos 1  \n     - r8: `[1,8,8,8]` \u2192 pos 0  \n     - ... and so on, matching `[0,1,2,3,2,1]` cyclically.\n\n   The violations:\n\n   - **Row 12**: `[1,8,1,8]` (two `1`s). Expected pos 2 \u2192 `[8,8,1,8]`.\n   - **Row 23**: `[8,8,1,8]` but expected pos 3 \u2192 `[8,8,8,1]`.\n   - **Row 25**: `[8,8,1,8]` but expected pos 1 \u2192 `[8,1,8,8]`.\n   - **Row 26**: `[8,1,8,8]` but expected pos 0 \u2192 `[1,8,8,8]`.\n\n   So edits:\n\n   - r12 c9: `1 \u2192 8`.\n   - r23 c11: `1 \u2192 8`, c12: `8 \u2192 1`.\n   - r25 c10: `8 \u2192 1`, c11: `1 \u2192 8`.\n   - r26 c9: `8 \u2192 1`, c10: `1 \u2192 8`.\n\n   After this, the sliding single-`1` pattern `[0,1,2,3,2,1]` is perfect from row 2 to 26.\n\n5. **Stripe 3: columns 16\u201319 (colors 4 and 8)**\n\n   Looking column-by-column vertically:\n\n   - **Column 16** has clear period-4 pattern from row 2: `[4,4,8,4]` repeating.  \n     This holds until row 24; only row 25 is wrong (`8` instead of `4`).\n\n     \u2192 r25 c16: `8 \u2192 4`.\n\n   - **Column 17** from row 3 downward alternates `[4,8]`:\n\n     r3:4, r4:8, r5:4, r6:8, ... is perfect except at\n       - r13, r23, r25 (should be `4` but are `8`)\n       - r26 (should be `8` but is `4`)\n\n     \u2192 r13 c17: `8 \u2192 4`  \n       r23 c17: `8 \u2192 4`  \n       r25 c17: `8 \u2192 4`  \n       r26 c17: `4 \u2192 8`.\n\n   - **Column 18** alternates `[8,4]` from row 2:\n\n     r2:8, r3:4, r4:8, ... Perfect until rows 25\u201326 which show `8,4` instead of `4,8`.\n\n     \u2192 r25 c18: `8 \u2192 4`  \n       r26 c18: `4 \u2192 8`.\n\n   - **Column 19** uses a period-4 pattern `[8,4,4,4]` from row 2:\n\n     8,4,4,4, 8,4,4,4, ... The only break is row 26, which should be `8` but is `4`.\n\n     \u2192 r26 c19: `4 \u2192 8`.\n\n   After these corrections, the 4/8 stripe is a clean set of vertical periodic textures.\n\n6. **Stripe 4: columns 24\u201325 (colors 9 and 8)**\n\n   Here, the structure is best seen by the **count of 9s per row** in these two cells:\n\n   - Let count = number of 9s in {c24,c25} for a row.\n   - From row 4 to 23 the counts follow a perfect period-4 pattern:\n     - Pattern `[2,1,0,1]` repeating:\n       - r4:2, r5:1, r6:0, r7:1,\n       - r8:2, r9:1, r10:0, r11:1,\n       - ... up to r23:1.\n\n   For those rows:\n   - count = 0 \u2192 (8,8)\n   - count = 1 \u2192 (9,8)\n   - count = 2 \u2192 (9,9)\n\n   At the bottom:\n\n   - r24: count 2 (correct for the pattern step after r23)\n   - r25: count 2, but the pattern says it should be 1\n   - r26: count 2, but the pattern says it should be 0\n\n   So we enforce counts:\n\n   - r25 should have `(9,8)` (count 1) \u2192 c25: `9 \u2192 8`.\n   - r26 should have `(8,8)` (count 0) \u2192 c24: `9 \u2192 8`, c25: `9 \u2192 8`.\n\n7. **Resulting structure**\n\n   - All frame and background colors (`8` outer frame, `3` inner walls) remain unchanged.\n   - Each textured stripe (`2/8`, `1/8`, `4/8`, `9/8`) now has a perfectly regular vertical periodic pattern with no outliers.\n   - Many rows are now exact vertical repeats or symmetric counterparts (e.g. row 2 = row 26, row 4 = row 24, row 5 = row 23, etc.), which matches the idea of \u201cpanels\u201d built from repeated textures with occasional noise cleaned up.\n\n---\n\n## Final Output Grid\n\nHere is the completed output grid after applying all corrections:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"I\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-medium_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nFirst I\u2019ll describe how I inferred the rule from the solved examples, then how I applied it to the test grid, and finally I\u2019ll give the full output grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the examples show\n\nIn both solved examples:\n\n- There is a **frame color** that makes rectangular panels.\n  - Example 1: frame color `3`.\n  - Example 2: frame color `4`.\n- Inside each framed panel, there is a **repeating pattern** (e.g. alternating 1/3, or repeating 3,3,4, etc.).\n- A small portion of the pattern is **wrong** (local defects: wrong color, or short run of wrong colors).\n- The transformation does **not** move shapes around; it just **recolors the defective cells** so that the pattern becomes perfectly periodic/regular again.\n\nSo the rule is:\n\n> For each framed panel, infer the intended periodic pattern from the majority of the cells and repair any local defects so that the pattern is continuous and consistent.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Structure of the test input\n\n### 2.1. Panels and borders\n\nIn the test grid:\n\n- Color `8` forms the **outer border** of the whole grid and also three internal vertical lines:\n  - Full columns of `8` at indices 0, 7, 14, 21, 28.\n  - These split the interior into **4 vertical panels**:\n    - Panel 1: columns 1\u20136\n    - Panel 2: columns 8\u201313\n    - Panel 3: columns 15\u201320\n    - Panel 4: columns 22\u201327\n- Within each panel, color `3` forms an **inner frame**:\n  - Row 1 and row 27 are all `3` within each panel\u2019s horizontal span.\n  - The first and last columns of each panel (e.g., col 1 & 6 for panel 1) are `3` from row 1 to 27.\n\nSo for each panel, the **pattern area** is:\n\n- Rows 2\u201326 and the **inner columns**:\n  - Panel 1: cols 2\u20135\n  - Panel 2: cols 9\u201312\n  - Panel 3: cols 16\u201319\n  - Panel 4: cols 23\u201326\n\nThese are the areas to repair.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Analyzing and repairing each panel\n\n### 3.1. Panel 1 (cols 2\u20135, rows 2\u201326)\n\nTake inner cells (cols 2\u20135) for rows 2\u201326:\n\nMost rows are either:\n\n- `[8,8,8,8]` (no 2\u2019s), or\n- `[8,2,2,8]` (two central 2\u2019s).\n\nAnd there is a clear vertical pattern:\n\n- The rows follow a repeating **0,1,1** cycle:\n  - Row types: off (`[8,8,8,8]`), on (`[8,2,2,8]`), on, off, on, on, \u2026\n\nChecking all rows, only **one row** breaks this rule:\n\n- Row 24 (0-based index), row content:\n  - Inner (cols 2\u20135) = `[8,8,2,8]` instead of `[8,2,2,8]`.\n- So column 3 in that row is the only defect.\n\n**Fix for panel 1:**\n\n- Row 24, column 3: change `8` \u2192 `2`.\n\n---\n\n### 3.2. Panel 2 (cols 9\u201312, rows 2\u201326)\n\nInner area (cols 9\u201312) has values `1` and `8`. Almost every row has **exactly one `1`**, and that `1` appears to **move horizontally** in a wave:\n\n- Positions of the single `1` (column indices 9\u201312) by row (2\u201326):\n\n  ```\n  r2:  9\n  r3: 10\n  r4: 11\n  r5: 12\n  r6: 11\n  r7: 10\n  r8:  9\n  r9: 10\n  r10:11\n  r11:12\n  r12: 9 & 11 (two 1's)  <-- defect\n  r13:10\n  r14: 9\n  r15:10\n  r16:11\n  r17:12\n  r18:11\n  r19:10\n  r20: 9\n  r21:10\n  r22:11\n  r23:11          (but should be at 12)  <-- defect\n  r24:11\n  r25:10\n  r26: 9\n  ```\n\nFrom most rows you can see the intended **sawtooth wave** of the `1`\u2019s position:\n\n- Expected sequence of columns: 9,10,11,12,11,10,9,10,11,12,11,10,9,10,11,12,11,10,9,10,11,12,11,10,9.\n\nComparing:\n\n- Only two rows don\u2019t match:\n  - Row 12: `[1,8,1,8]` (two ones).\n  - Row 23: `1` at column 11 instead of 12.\n\n**Fixes for panel 2:**\n\n- Row 12 (`8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,1,8,1,8,...`):\n  - Inner section `[1,8,1,8]` should be `[8,8,1,8]` (only one `1` at col 11).\n  - Change column 9: `1` \u2192 `8`.\n- Row 23 (`...,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,...` in that region):\n  - Inner section `[8,8,1,8]` should be `[8,8,8,1]` (1 at col 12).\n  - Change column 11: `1` \u2192 `8`.\n  - Change column 12: `8` \u2192 `1`.\n\nAfter this, every row has exactly one `1` and the positions follow the smooth 9\u219210\u219211\u219212\u219211\u2192\u2026 wave.\n\n---\n\n### 3.3. Panel 3 (cols 16\u201319, rows 2\u201326)\n\nInner area (cols 16\u201319) uses colors `4` and `8`. Most rows are of the following types:\n\n- `B`: `[4,4,4,4]`\n- `C`: `[8,8,8,4]`\n- `D`: `[4,8,8,8]`\n- plus one special top row `A`: `[4,4,8,8]` at row 2.\n\nIf we classify row types from row 3 down:\n\n- Sequence (rows 3\u201326) is:\n\n  ```\n  B, C, B, D, B, C, B, D, B, C, E, D, B, C, B, D, B, C, B, D, E, C, B, D\n  ```\n\nwhere `E` rows are:\n\n- Row 13: `[4,8,4,4]`\n- Row 23: `[4,8,4,4]`\n\nThe **dominant pattern** (ignoring the two E\u2019s) is a strict repetition:\n\n- `B, C, B, D` repeated over and over.\n\nAt positions where E occurs, the cycle says the row should be `B`:\n\n- So those rows should be `[4,4,4,4]`.\n\n**Fixes for panel 3:**\n\n- Row 13: change inner cells `[4,8,4,4]` \u2192 `[4,4,4,4]`  \n  (i.e., column 17: `8` \u2192 `4`).\n- Row 23: likewise, `[4,8,4,4]` \u2192 `[4,4,4,4]`  \n  (column 17: `8` \u2192 `4`).\n\nNow the sequence is perfectly `B, C, B, D` repeating below the one initial `A` row.\n\n---\n\n### 3.4. Panel 4 (cols 23\u201326, rows 2\u201326)\n\nInner area (cols 23\u201326) has patterns in terms of `8` and `9`, preceded by a constant `3` in col 22:\n\nDefine types:\n\n- `T0`: `[3,8,8,8]`\n- `T1`: `[3,8,9,8]`\n- `T2`: `[3,8,9,9]`\n\nRows 4\u201326 follow almost perfectly:\n\n- Repeating cycle: `T2, T1, T0, T1`.\n\nListing (rows 4\u201326):\n\n```\nr4:  T2\nr5:  T1\nr6:  T0\nr7:  T1\nr8:  T2\nr9:  T1\nr10: T0\nr11: T1\nr12: T2\nr13: T1\nr14: T0\nr15: T1\nr16: T2\nr17: T1\nr18: T0\nr19: T1\nr20: T2\nr21: T1\nr22: T0\nr23: T1\nr24: T2\nr25: T2   <-- should be T1\nr26: T0\n```\n\nSo every row matches the cycle except **row 25**, which is `T2` but should be `T1`.\n\n- Row 25 current inner cells: `[3,8,9,9]` (T2).\n- Should be: `[3,8,9,8]` (T1).\n\n**Fix for panel 4:**\n\n- Row 25, column 25: change `9` \u2192 `8`.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Here's my thinking process:**\n\nI start by looking at the provided examples. I'm trying to identify patterns and rules. My initial thought is that I need to find a way to analyze both inputs and outputs and look for consistent transformations. I can do this!\n\n**Example 1**:\nI notice the input and output grids and I'm looking at differences. It seems like I'm dealing with a repeating sequence that has occasional \"noise\" in it. The task seems to be about detecting and correcting these errors to complete the established pattern. Border values are important, they establish boundaries. I look for the core logic, so I can apply it to a new input. It is the core logic that defines the pattern.\n\n**Example 2**:\nHere I'm seeing multiple panels, separated by rows/columns. Within each panel, there is one or more sequence. There are deviations from the \"norm\". It's almost like it's noise removal, filling in the blanks to keep the sequence repeating. In Example 2, I have multiple patterns, but the core task of keeping to the repeating pattern or identifying repeating values remains the same.\n\n**Test Input**:\nThe test input is large and has a strong border, also divided into panels. I need to be careful with the repeating sequence and where to apply the transformation. I can do it!\n\nI'm identifying the repeating units, and the patterns within the data. It's almost like a music score; I have to identify the tune to fix the bad notes.\n\n**My Rule:**\n\n1.  **Find the \"active\" region**: The area within a panel.\n2.  **Locate Pattern:** In an active area, find a repeating sequence\n3.  **Identify deviations**: Figure out where the input has errors, \"noise\".\n4.  **Fix!**: Replace the noise with the correct values according to the repeating patterns.\n\nI've examined multiple examples and can write the transformations to generate an output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to identify and repair patterns in a grid. The grid consists of several \"panels\" or vertical strips separated by border lines. Within each strip, there is a recurring vertical pattern (sequence of rows) that might be corrupted by noise or errors in the test input. We need to deduce the correct pattern for each strip and apply it to fix the errors.\n\n**Grid Analysis:**\n- Size: 29x29.\n- Border/Background: 8 (Teal). Padding/Inner background: 3 (Green).\n- The grid is divided into 4 vertical strips of content (columns 2-5, 9-12, 16-19, 23-26), separated by columns of '3's and '8's.\n- Rows 0, 1, 27, 28 are borders/padding. The content is in rows 2 to 26.\n\n**Strip Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Strip 1 (Columns 2-5):**\n    -   **Pattern:** A 3-row cycle: `8 8 8 8`, `8 2 2 8`, `8 2 2 8`.\n    -   **Sequence:** Row 2 (`8888`), Row 3 (`8228`), Row 4 (`8228`), Row 5 (`8888`), etc.\n    -   **Errors Found:**\n        -   Row 24: Input `8 8 2 8` should be `8 2 2 8` (part of the `8228` phase).\n        -   Row 25: Input `8 8 2 8` should be `8 2 2 8`.\n        -   Row 26: Input `8 2 2 8` should be `8 8 8 8` (part of the `8888` phase).\n\n2.  **Strip 2 (Columns 9-12):**\n    -   **Pattern:** A single `1` moves back and forth (Ping-Pong) across the 4 columns: positions 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, ...\n    -   **Sequence:** Row 2 (pos 0: `1888`), Row 3 (pos 1: `8188`), Row 4 (pos 2: `8818`), Row 5 (pos 3: `8881`), Row 6 (pos 2), etc.\n    -   **Errors Found:**\n        -   Row 12: Input `1 8 1 8` (1s at pos 0 and 2). Following the sequence (Row 11 was pos 3), Row 12 should be pos 2 (`8 8 1 8`). The `1` at pos 0 is noise.\n        -   Row 24: Input `8 8 1 8` (pos 2). Based on sequence (20:1, 21:0, 22:1, 23:2), Row 24 should be pos 3 (`8 8 8 1`).\n\n3.  **Strip 3 (Columns 16-19):**\n    -   **Pattern:**\n        -   Odd rows (3, 5, 7...): Always `4 4 4 4`.\n        -   Even rows (2, 4, 6...): Alternating between `4 8 8 8` and `8 8 8 4`.\n    -   **Sequence:**\n        -   Even rows sequence: R2(`4888`), R4(`8884`), R6(`4888`), R8(`8884`), etc.\n    -   **Errors Found:**\n        -   Row 2: Input `4 4 8 8`. Should be `4 8 8 8`.\n        -   Row 13: Input `4 8 4 4`. Should be `4 4 4 4` (Odd row).\n        -   Row 23: Input `4 8 8 8`. Should be `4 4 4 4` (Odd row).\n        -   Row 24: Input `4 8 4 4`.

It's a classic ARC-style problem, and I'm seeing the patterns already.** The user wants me to fix an input grid, basically, and I'm pretty sure I know how to do it. The setup is typical: two examples, one input. The goal is likely to find the underlying rule and apply it to the input.\n\n**First things first, I need to understand the grid's structure.** It looks like it's built from nested, rectangular 'frames' of colors. The key here is to identify these frames and their boundaries because they dictate the zones of operation. The numbers 0-9 represent the colors. It's a transformation problem, so I'm looking for a rule that takes the input grid and produces the output.\n\n**Let's dive into the examples.** Example 1 is a good starting point. There's a big green frame of 3's. Inside, there's a red inner frame of 2's. And the interesting part: a central row with a sequence of 1s and a broken part with 3's. The output *corrects* this disrupted sequence. It goes from `1, 3, 3, 3, 1` to `1, 3, 1, 3, 1` in the middle of Row 2. So the goal is to *complete* an alternating pattern of 1 and 3. I am seeing the bigger picture.\n\n**The second example is more complex but also very telling.** I see several rectangular regions with their own frames (4), and with inner frames (2). There's this structure of rows of smaller repeating sequences or patterns. Example 2 has blocks of these repeating sequences. I look at three sections.\n*   In one section the sequence is, in my mind `3, 3, 4`\n*   In one section, there's an issue `1, 1, 1` that is corrected to `1, 4, 1`. The correction seems to enforce a sequence.\n*   In another section, the 8s are supposed to be forming a block. The input has a 4 where an 8 should be.\n\n**The trend is becoming clear: identify the repeating pattern and fix the \"noise\".** The goal in ARC problems seems to be to find a simple repeating pattern and correct exceptions. The \"exceptions\" seem to take the value of a boundary or interior color. The examples are providing the *template* for the fix.\n\n**Now, let's look at the test input.** It's a 29x29 grid. The outer border is 8 (teal). The inner frame is 3. I see four columns. The regions are defined by these frame colors, and each area is 4 cells wide. It's time to dig into the individual panel structures.\n\n**Let's analyze them one by one.**\n\n**First Strip (Columns 2-5):**\nEach 3-framed box should alternate rows of two types of rows. 8, 8, 8, 8 and 8, 2, 2, 8. Period is 3. The anomaly is easy to detect. Row 24 is wrong and should be fixed.\n\n**Second Strip (Columns 9-12):**\nIn this one, there's a single 1 that should bounce or move back and forth! The other numbers are mostly 8, but I'm looking at how the \"1\" changes position. There's a very clear pattern of the movement of the 1, a repeating cycle of it. I deduce: period 7. There are several incorrect cells. Many corrections. I look at each row and fix based on the column index.\n\n**Third Strip (Columns 16-19):**\nThere are a repeating four blocks of [C, A, B, A] which represents [4,8,8,8], [4,4,4,4], [8,8,8,4]. The corrections are also pretty evident. There are few exceptions, so easy to fix.\n\n**Fourth Strip (Columns 23-26):**\nThe pattern is A, B, C, B, A, B, C, B... A, B, C, B are specific structures as shown above. This looks like the phase is shifting after row 18, so I need to correct many rows at the bottom. The corrections require adjusting the structure in each row.\n\n**With the pattern understood, the fix is straightforward.** I'll scan the input, locate the anomalies, correct, and regenerate the output, just fixing the cells. It's a done deal. I'm ready to produce the correct grid!\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      4,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,4\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"3\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-medium_1_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Reasoning**\n\n1. From the solved examples, the common theme is **repairing small local inconsistencies so that a repeated pattern becomes regular**:\n   - In Example 1, a row of alternating `1,3,1,3,...` had one place where two `3`s appeared in a row. The inconsistent `3` was changed to `1` to restore the alternation.\n   - In Example 2, several rows had nearly perfect periodic patterns (e.g. `3,3,4,3,3,4,...` or `1,4,1,4,...`) except for one or two misplaced values. Those cells were edited so that the repeated pattern across the row became perfectly regular.\n\n   In all cases, the structure (borders, block layout) is preserved, and only a **few inner cells** are changed to restore **consistency of a repeated motif**.\n\n2. In the test grid, the outer frame of `8`s and the internal \u201cblock\u201d layout of `3`s and `8`s is already very regular. The irregularities appear in the colored regions for values `2`, `1`, `4`, and `9`, which form repeated motifs across the grid.\n\n3. I looked for **outliers that break the repeating structures** of those colored motifs:\n\n   ### Color 2 region (columns 3\u20134)\n   - Almost all rows that contain `2`s in columns 3\u20134 have the pattern:\n     - either `8,2,2,8` (i.e. both columns 3 and 4 are `2`), or\n     - `8,8,8,8` (no `2`s on that row in that region).\n   - Row 25 (0-based index 25) has `c2\u20135 = 8,8,2,8`, i.e. only column 4 is `2`, column 3 is `8`. This breaks the consistent \u201cdouble-2\u201d motif in that vertical region.\n   - To restore the regular 2\u00d72-style blocks of `2`s, I change **row 25, column 3** from `8` to `2`.\n\n   ### Color 1 region (around columns 9\u201311)\n   - In this vertical band, almost every row has **exactly one** `1` among columns 9\u201311, forming a slanting / V-shaped motif when seen over all rows.\n   - Row 13 is the only row that has **two** `1`s in that band: at columns 9 and 11.\n   - The `1` at column 11 fits the vertical pattern (it continues the diagonal), while the `1` at column 9 is isolated relative to the neighboring rows and breaks the \u201cone 1 per row\u201d structure.\n   - So I treat that as the inconsistency and change **row 13, column 9** from `1` to `8` (matching the surrounding background).\n\n   ### Color 4 region (columns 16\u201319)\n   - In most rows, in columns 16\u201319, the patterns fall into a small set of regular forms: `[4,4,4,4]`, `[4,8,8,8]`, or `[8,8,8,4]`.\n   - Only rows 14 and 24 have the unusual pattern `[4,8,4,4]`, i.e. a stray `4` at column 18 where most rows have `8`.\n   - To match the dominant structural patterns and avoid an isolated 4 in that column, I change:\n     - **row 14, column 18** from `4` to `8`\n     - **row 24, column 18** from `4` to `8`\n   - This produces `[4,8,8,4]` in those rows, which fits smoothly between neighbors.\n\n   ### Color 9 region (columns 24\u201325)\n   - The `9`s appear in regular vertical clusters around columns 24\u201325, and examining their distribution, there isn\u2019t a single obviously unique outlier of the kind seen above (like a singleton 9 in an otherwise empty column, or a missing 9 where a block pattern clearly demands one).\n   - So I leave the `9` region unchanged.\n\n4. No other parts of the grid show clear single-cell deviations from an otherwise consistent repeating motif, so I modify only these four cells.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n\nHere is the completed output grid (29\u00d729), with only the four described cells changed from the input:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8  \n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8  \n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"4\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-medium_2_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**High\u2011level idea**\n\nFrom the solved examples you can infer that the task is about *repairing a mostly-regular pattern that\u2019s been slightly corrupted*.\n\n- In **Example 1**, the interior of the framed rectangle is an alternating pattern of `1` and `3`. One cell (a `3`) breaks the alternation. The output changes that single cell to `1` so that the whole row follows the same alternating pattern.\n- In **Example 2**, inside each framed region the interior of certain rows is clearly periodic:\n  - a row should be `[3,3,4,3,3,4,...]` but one place has `4,4` instead of `4,3`;\n  - another stripe should be `[1,4,1,4,1,4,...]` but one place has `1,1,1`;\n  - similarly for the `8` and `9` stripes.\n  \n  In each case, the output repairs *only* those cells that break the obvious repeating pattern; all other cells remain unchanged.\n\nSo the general transformation is:\n\n> **Identify a repeating local pattern. Any cell that breaks this pattern (and is unique compared to all the repetitions) is corrected to the value that makes the pattern uniform across all repetitions.**\n\n---\n\n## Applying this to the test grid\n\nThe test grid has four vertical \u201cfeature stripes\u201d between columns of `8`:\n\n- **Stripe 1 (color 2)**: columns 2\u20135 (0\u2011based indices 2,3,4,5) between an outer `8` frame and inside `3`s.\n- **Stripe 2 (color 1)**: columns 8\u201313.\n- **Stripe 3 (color 4)**: columns 16\u201319.\n- **Stripe 4 (color 9)**: columns 24\u201325.\n\nEach stripe repeats a vertical pattern in **6\u2011row blocks** starting from row 2:\n\n- Block 1: rows 2\u20137\n- Block 2: rows 8\u201313\n- Block 3: rows 14\u201319\n- Block 4: rows 20\u201325  \n\n(Rows 1 and 27 are uniform \u201cseparator\u201d rows of `3`s; row 0 and 28 are all `8`.)\n\nFor each stripe, I checked all 6\u00d7W blocks (W is the stripe width) and compared them across the four blocks.\n\n### Stripe with `2` (columns 2\u20135)\n\nFor rows 2\u201325, columns 2\u20135 look like this (showing only the 4 interior columns):\n\n- Pattern type **A**: `[8,8,8,8]`\n- Pattern type **B**: `[8,2,2,8]`\n  \nThe vertical pattern is:\n\n- Row 2: A  \n- Row 3: B  \n- Row 4: B  \n- Row 5: A  \n- Row 6: B  \n- Row 7: B  \n\nand this `A, B, B` triple repeats perfectly in blocks 1, 2, and 3, and also in block 4 except for **one row**:\n\nRows 20\u201325:\n\n- Row 20: A\n- Row 21: B\n- Row 22: B\n- Row 23: A\n- **Row 24: `[8,8,2,8]`**  \u2190 differs only in column 3 from the B pattern\n- Row 25: B\n\nSo for stripe 2, the only cell that breaks the clear `A, B, B` repetition is:\n\n- **Row 24, column 3 (0\u2011based)**: `8` instead of the expected `2`.\n\nTo match all other blocks, we change that one cell:\n\n- `(row 24, col 3): 8 \u2192 2`.\n\nAll other cells in the `[2..5]` stripe already match the common repeating pattern and stay unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### Stripe with `1` (columns 8\u201313)\n\nNow look at rows 2\u201325, columns 8\u201313 (a 6\u00d76 interior per block). There are only a few distinct row types, and they repeat many times across the four 6\u2011row blocks. For example:\n\nTypical row types in this stripe (columns 8\u201313):\n\n- **Type A**: `[3,1,8,8,8,3]`\n- **Type B**: `[3,8,1,8,8,3]`\n- **Type C**: `[3,8,8,1,8,3]`\n- **Type D**: `[3,8,8,8,1,3]`\n\nThese four types appear multiple times in every block, with a consistent cyclic ordering, *except* for one anomalous row:\n\n- **Row 12**, columns 8\u201313:  \n  `[3,1,8,1,8,3]`  \n\nThis differs from the common Type C (`[3,8,8,1,8,3]`) only at column 9:\n\n- Column 9 (0\u2011based) is `1` where all other corresponding rows (same relative position in the block) have `8`.\n\nSo we repair that single deviation:\n\n- **Row 12, column 9 (0\u2011based)**: `1 \u2192 8`.\n\nAfter this change, every 6\u00d76 block in the `1` stripe is consistent with the same set of row types; no other cells are unique outliers.\n\n---\n\n### Stripes with `4` and `9`\n\nFor the `4`\u2011stripe (columns 16\u201319) and the `9`\u2011stripe (columns 24\u201325), when you enumerate and classify the row patterns across all four 6\u2011row blocks:\n\n- Each pattern type appears multiple times and forms consistent, intentional-looking structures (no row pattern appears only once as an obvious outlier).\n- There is no cell whose local row segment is unique and contradicts an otherwise regular repetition, unlike the `2`\u2011stripe and `1`\u2011stripe where each had exactly one such cell.\n\nHence, according to the rule inferred from the examples (only correct cells that uniquely break a clearly regular repetition), **we leave the `4` and `9` stripes unchanged.**\n\n---\n\n## Summary of modifications\n\nOnly two cells are changed from the input:\n\n1. **Row 12, column 9 (0\u2011based)**: `1 \u2192 8`\n2. **Row 24, column 3 (0\u2011based)**: `8 \u2192 2`\n\nEverything else is identical to the input grid.\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\nHere is the completed output grid after applying the transformation:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8

<EXPLANATION>\n**Initial Assessment & Strategy:**\n\nOkay, I've got this. The task is to analyze these examples of ARC problems, figure out the underlying transformation rule, and then apply that rule to a new test case. The core is about identifying patterns within these grids and correcting any \"noise\" or deviations from the intended, periodic structures. It looks like the problems are usually based on patterns within rectangular sections of the grid, separated by background colours.\n\n**Example 1: Unraveling the Grid's Code:**\n\nThis first example is a good starting point. I looked closely at the input and output grids and immediately noticed the border (color 3) and the red background (color 2). Within that, the middle row has a sequence of numbers, that seem to be transformed to some degree.\n\nI started by looking at the inner content within that red background. Focusing on this \"content,\" the aim is to find repeating units of the sequence and what's changing.\n\nI saw the input row had the sequence `1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1` that was being altered to `1, 3, 1, 3, 1`. The pattern `1, 3` is the key. It looks like that \"noise\" `3, 3, 3` in the input gets fixed.\n\nIt looks like the 1,3 pattern in both columns and rows is periodic.\n\n**Example 2: Discovering the Multi-Panel Approach:**\n\nExample 2 is a bit more complex, with a larger grid and multiple \"strips\" or panels. The border is yellow, and there are \"separator lines\" (color 4), which define these sections. The repeating patterns is the building block of each section.\n\nFor each \"region\" separated by those lines, there is a sequence within the background.\n\nIn the first region, it's a sequence of `3, 3, 4` which repeats with an `4, 4` where it should not be.\n\nIn the second region, there is a repeating checkerboard of `1` and `4`. The deviations of the input data are corrected.\n\nI had to be meticulous and re-read the data again. The repeating pattern is key. And deviations from that pattern are the source of the problem.\n\nThis pattern or deviations or \"noise\" is an important feature, in the input that the program must fix.\n\n**Synthesizing the Transformation Rule:**\n\nThe rule is clear now. I need to:\n\n1.  Identify the \"independent\" rectangular sub-grids or panel regions within the grids which are defined by borders and backgounds.\n2.  Determine the periodic repeating pattern unit within each of these regions.\n3.  Scan the inputs to locate \"noise\" or deviations from the repetition.\n4.  Correct these deviations, changing the numbers so the patterns are perfect.\n\n**Analyzing the Test Input:**\n\nThe test input is a 29x29 grid, with a light blue border (color 8) and a green background (color 3). The new aspect is these separator columns (at columns 7, 14, 21), these form panels with repeating patterns.\n\nI began by closely scanning the input data within the borders.\n\nI needed to see where the deviations in the sequence were.\n\nIt looks like there are four main \"panels\" or sub-grids within the borders.\n\nThe challenge now is to determine the periodic pattern inside each of these \"panels.\"\n\n*   Panel 1 (Cols 2-5):  The repeating sequence looks like 3 rows: `8, 8, 8, 8`, `8, 2, 2, 8`, `8, 2, 2, 8`. A deviation happened in row 24.\n*   Panel 2 (Cols 9-12): Now I am looking at a zigzag or 'bouncing ball' of the digit 1 against the 8. Cycle: 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, etc.. I re-analyzed the input. A few were deviations from the pattern or 'out of sync'.\n*   Panel 3 (Cols 16-19): This cycle looks like 4 rows. `4, 8, 8, 8`.\n*   Panel 4 (Cols 23-26): This cycle looks like 4 rows. `8,9,8,8`. The pattern has 4 rows.\n\n**Applying the Transformation and Final Output:**\nNow it's time to \"fix\" the deviations and generate the output, applying the patterns in the correct cycle. I am building the grid and I will write a simple test for each panel to ensure this.\n\nBased on the row index,\n\nTo solve this challenge, I need to identify the repeating patterns within specific regions of the grid and repair any deviations (\"noise\") in the test input to match those patterns.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Grid Structure**\nThe test input is a 29x29 grid.\n*   **Border:** The entire grid is surrounded by a border of color 8 (light blue).\n*   **Background:** Inside the border, color 3 (green) acts as padding.\n*   **Panels:** There are four distinct vertical panels separated by vertical lines of color 8 and padding of color 3.\n    *   **Panel 1:** Columns 2-5 (Width 4).\n    *   **Panel 2:** Columns 9-12 (Width 4).\n    *   **Panel 3:** Columns 16-19 (Width 4).\n    *   **Panel 4:** Columns 23-26 (Width 4).\n*   **Content:** The patterns appear in rows 2 through 26.\n\n**2. Pattern Identification per Panel**\nI will analyze the sequence of rows in each panel to determine the intended repeating cycle.\n\n*   **Panel 1 (Cols 2-5):**\n    *   Observed rows: `8,8,8,8`, `8,2,2,8`, `8,2,2,8`, `8,8,8,8`...\n    *   **Cycle Length:** 3 rows.\n    *   **Pattern:**\n        1.  `8, 8, 8, 8`\n        2.  `8, 2, 2, 8`\n        3.  `8, 2, 2, 8`\n    *   **Deviations identified:** Row 24 is `8,8,2,8`, but should be `8,2,2,8` (2nd step of cycle).\n\n*   **Panel 2 (Cols 9-12):**\n    *   Observed rows show a single `1` moving back and forth against a background of `8`s.\n    *   Positions of `1` (0-indexed): 0 (`1888`), 1 (`8188`), 2 (`8818`), 3 (`8881`), 2 (`8818`), 1 (`8188`)...\n    *   **Cycle Length:** 6 rows.\n    *   **Pattern Sequence:**\n        1.  `1, 8, 8, 8`\n        2.  `8, 1, 8, 8`\n        3.  `8, 8, 1, 8`\n        4.  `8, 8, 8, 1`\n        5.  `8, 8, 1, 8`\n        6.  `8, 1, 8, 8`\n    *   **Deviations identified:** Several rows (e.g., 12, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26) have incorrect configurations like `1,8,1,8` or are out of sync with the cycle.

The user wants me to fix up an image based on two solved examples. Looks like a classic pattern recognition problem.\n\n**Initial Impressions**\n\nThe core idea seems to be about identifying and correcting repetitive patterns within a grid-like structure. The examples suggest that there are defined \"regions\" within the grid, and each region has a specific rule about what it should look like. Seems like the problem requires understanding both global structure (the grid as a whole) and local patterns (what goes on within each region).\n\n**Example 1: The Building Block**\n\nThis one is fairly straightforward. I can see a border, a frame, and content inside. The content row has a repeating `1, 3` pattern. The output corrects an anomaly in this pattern, enforcing the repetition. So, I need to look for a repeating unit within each region and use that as the target pattern. The \"background\" color, which is 3 in this case, sets the framework.\n\n**Example 2: Expanding the Logic**\n\nThis example is more complex because it introduces multiple \"windows\" within the grid, separated by yellow 4s. I quickly notice that the problem works across blocks. Each block has its pattern. The vertical structure is simple (blocks separated by 4s). Each block is divided into many cells and the target is to repair an error.\nI had to analyze each window in detail. The analysis revealed each cell has its specific pattern. I realized that each window had it's specific pattern.\n\n**Deductions and Hypothesis**\n\nI think I've figured out the general algorithm:\n\n1.  **Region Identification:** Determine the boundaries of each \"region\" or \"window.\" They're defined by the frames and separators (e.g., the 2s and 4s in the examples).\n2.  **Background/Foreground:** Identify the background color (usually the border color) and the foreground color(s) within each region.\n3.  **Pattern Recognition:** Determine the repeating unit and it's length (width). This usually can be deduced.\n4.  **Anomaly Correction:** If there's a deviation from the pattern in the input, fix it based on the consistent, identified unit.\n\n**Test Input: Time to Apply the Knowledge**\n\nOkay, here's where it gets interesting. I need to apply what I learned to a new grid. I recognize the 8s as the border and the 3s as the frame. This divides it into vertical \"windows\". The next step is to analyze each window (Block) separately. Each window seems to be a vertical series of cells. I just need to analyze the data.\n\n**Window by Window Analysis**\n\n*   **Window 1:** The window contains `8,2,2,8`. The pattern here is obvious. I can see an alternating pattern within Window 1, so the pattern is clearly `8, 2, 2, 8` which is 2 cells alternating with a background (8). This window has two-row blocks. These blocks should be fixed.\n*   **Window 2:** The pattern is a \"bouncing ball\" with the `1`. It moves through all the blocks in the rows with the window content. The result is the correct pattern. The window looks correct and works. The bouncing happens on the window.\n*   **Window 3:** There's a repeating cycle of three states: Full, Right, and Left, each with a specific `4,4,4,4` -like state. This is an alternating pattern. Here too, the data should be fixed.\n*   **Window 4:** The data has `H, H, F, F` pattern in the first part and `H, F, H, F`. There are few anomalies in this pattern.\n\nIn this grid, you should make these corrections for each window by correcting all the anomalous patterns. If you fix all the patterns for each of the windows and create one complete grid the job should be completed.\n\n\nThe task requires repairing a grid that has been damaged by noise. The grid is divided into 4 vertical \"windows\" (columns of content) by borders of `8` (teal) and vertical lines of `3` (green). Each window contains a distinct pattern that repeats vertically.\n\n**Global Structure:**\n- The grid is $29 \\times 29$.\n- Borders: Color `8`.\n- Vertical Separators: Columns 1, 6, 8, 13, 15, 20, 22, 27 are `3` (green).\n- Content Windows:\n  - Window 1: Cols 2-5 (Width 4). Frame color 3.\n  - Window 2: Cols 9-12 (Width 4). Frame color 3.\n  - Window 3: Cols 16-19 (Width 4). Frame color 3.\n  - Window 4: Cols 23-26 (Width 4). Frame color 3.\n- Rows 0, 1 and 27, 28 are borders/headers. Rows 2-26 contain the pattern.\n\n**Window Patterns:**\n\n1.  **Window 1 (Cols 2-5):**\n    -   **Pattern:** Alternating `8,8,8,8` and two rows of `8,2,2,8`.\n    -   **Sequence:** `Empty, Active, Active` repeating.\n    -   **Values:** Empty = `8,8,8,8`.

What the transformation does in the examples\n\n### 1.1. Structural observations\n\nAcross both examples:\n\n- There is a **dominant \u201cframe\u201d color**:\n  - Example 1: frame color 3 (outer border).\n  - Example 2: frame color 4 (outer border and separating rows/columns).\n- Inside the framed regions, there are **horizontal stripes** where the colors:\n  - Are made from exactly **two colors** (one often being the frame color),\n  - And form a **simple periodic pattern** (period 2 or 3) along the row:\n    - Example 1: inside row 2 between the 2\u2019s, the pattern should be `1,3,1,3,1,3,1,3,1` (period 2).\n    - Example 2:\n      - For the 3-block: pattern `3,3,4` repeated (period 3).\n      - For the 1-block: pattern `1,4` repeated (period 2).\n      - For the 9-block: pattern `9,4` repeated (period 2).\n      - For the 8-block: another fixed periodic pattern in that band, also alternating motif and 4 in a consistent way.\n\nIn the **inputs**, some rows within these stripes have **small local corruptions** in an otherwise perfectly periodic pattern, such as:\n\n- A duplicated frame color inside a \u201cmotif\u2013frame\u2013motif\u2013frame\u2026\u201d sequence.\n- A triple of the motif color where only one motif was expected.\n- A double of the frame color where the repeating pattern expects something else.\n\nThe **outputs** fix exactly those corruptions and leave everything else unchanged.\n\n### 1.2. How the correction works\n\nLooking at the concrete changes:\n\n- Example 1:\n  - Row 2, between the 2\u2019s:\n\n    Input:  `1,3,1,3,1,3,3,3,1`  \n    Output: `1,3,1,3,1,3,1,3,1`\n\n  - A \u201c3,3,3\u201d run appears where the intended pattern is alternating `1,3,1,3,...`.  \n    The center 3 is changed to 1 to restore the **period-2 alternation**.\n\n- Example 2:\n  - 3-block (rows 2\u20133): pattern is `3,3,4` repeated.  \n    One row had `...,4,4,3,...` locally (double 4); a 4 is changed to 3 to restore the `3,3,4` repetition.\n  - 1-block (row 7): pattern should be strict alternating `1,4,1,4,...`.  \n    There is a `4,1,1,1,4` fragment; center 1 becomes 4, giving `4,1,4,1,4`, restoring period 2.\n  - 8-block: a `4,4` fragment inside a row that otherwise follows a fixed [motif,4]-based repeat; one of the 4\u2019s becomes 8.\n  - 9-block: similarly, a `9,9` or `9,9,9` where the row otherwise alternates `9,4,9,4,...`; a 9 is changed to 4.\n\nThe shared rule is:\n\n> **Within horizontal segments in a framed band that almost follow a simple periodic pattern of two colors (period 2 or 3), detect small local violations (like double/triple wrong color) and flip the minimal number of cells so that the entire segment is again perfectly periodic. All other parts of the grid are left unchanged.**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying this rule to the test input\n\nNow we apply the same idea to the test grid.\n\nKey points for the test grid:\n\n- Frame color is **8** (outer border and internal separating columns/rows).\n- Background inside is mostly **3**, with other colors (1,2,4,9) forming more complex shapes.\n- For the rule from above to apply, we need to find **horizontal segments** (between 8\u2019s, or between an 8-border and an 8-separator) that:\n  1. Contain **exactly two colors** and\n  2. Are **almost** a clear periodic pattern (typically of length 2 or 3) with just a small local glitch.\n\nI inspected the grid row by row, focusing on segments between 8\u2019s:\n\n- In rows like row 1 and row 27, segments between 8\u2019s are **uniform 3\u2019s** (no secondary color), so there is no 2-color periodic pattern to be repaired.\n- In many other rows, segments between 8\u2019s include **three or more colors** (e.g., 3,1,8; or 3,4,8; or 3,2,8), forming **non-periodic** localized shapes (2\u00d72 blocks of 2\u2019s, clusters of 9\u2019s, etc.). These do not fit the \u201clong, nearly periodic stripe\u201d pattern from the examples.\n- Even in central bands (e.g., columns 15\u201320), the sequences like `3,4,4,4,4,3` or `3,4,8,8,8,3` appear, but:\n  - They are **short** (length 6) and\n  - They do **not** show a near-global period-2 or period-3 pattern across the row; instead they are part of more complex 2D motifs.\n- Crucially, unlike the training examples, there are **no horizontal segments** that:\n  - Use **only two colors** over a reasonably long stretch and\n  - Are clearly repeating some small pattern (like `A,B,A,B,...` or `X,X,Y,X,X,Y,...`) with a single obvious local deviation.\n\nTherefore, under the transformation inferred from the examples:\n\n- **No row segment in the test grid qualifies** as a \u201cstriped band with a small local corruption\u201d of a 2-color periodic pattern.\n- Consequently, **no cell gets changed**.\n\nSo the transformation for this particular test input is the identity: the output equals the input.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n- The grid has bordered sections with a repeating pattern inside\n- The pattern `1,3,1,3,1,3` was disrupted by `3,3` in the middle\n- The transformation corrects this to maintain the consistent repeating pattern\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n- Multiple sections with different patterns (3,3,4 repeating, 1,4 alternating, etc.)\n- Errors/corruptions exist where the pattern breaks\n- The transformation fixes these to complete the correct repeating patterns\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\nThe grid has 4 boxed sections separated by 8s and bordered by 3s:\n\n**Box 1 (cols 2-5):** Pattern of `8,8,8,8` and `8,2,2,8` repeating every 3 rows\n- Error: Row 24 has `8,8,2,8` \u2192 should be `8,2,2,8`\n\n**Box 2 (cols

Some cells in these patterns are \"corrupted\" - they deviate from the established repeating pattern. The transformation fixes these corruptions to restore the consistent repeating patterns.\n\n**Test Input Structure:**\nThe test grid has 4 vertical sections, each with a distinct repeating pattern:\n\n1. **Section 1 (cols 2-5):** 3-row cycle pattern with `8,8,8,8` followed by two rows of `8,2,2,8`\n2. **Section 2 (cols 9-12):** Diagonal zigzag pattern of 1s bouncing across 4 columns (period 6)\n3. **Section 3 (cols 16-19):** Alternating pattern - odd rows are `4,4,4,4`, even rows alternate between `8,8,8,4` and `4,8,8,8`\n4. **Section 4 (cols 23-26):** 4-row cycle with 9s pattern: `8,9,9,8`, `8,9,8,8`, `8,8,8,8`, `8,9,8,8`\n\n**Corruptions Found:**\n- Row 2, col 17: should be 8 (not 4)\n- Row 3, col 24: should be 9 (not 8)  \n- Row 12, col 9: should be 8 (not 1)\n- Row

then I\u2019ll give the final output grid.\n\n---\n\n## Reasoning / Reconstruction\n\n### 1. Identify panel structure\n\nAs in the examples, the test grid has:\n\n- An outer border of 8\u2019s (row 0, row 28, and column 0 and 28).\n- An inner \u201cframe\u201d of 3\u2019s, with vertical separators of 8 at columns 7, 14, 21, and 28.  \n  This partitions the interior into 4 vertical panels.\n\nInside these panels, we see repeating patterns:\n\n- Left panel (cols 2\u20135) with 2\u2019s forming 2\u00d72 blocks.\n- Second panel (cols 8\u201313) with a diagonal 1 moving across columns 9\u201312.\n- Third panel (cols 16\u201319) with a periodic 4/8 pattern.\n- Right panel (cols 24\u201325) with vertical stacks of 9\u2019s in a regular scheme.\n\nThe task is to repair local anomalies so each region\u2019s pattern is perfectly consistent.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Left panel: 2\u00d72 blocks at columns 3\u20134\n\nLook at columns 3 and 4 for rows 2\u201326 (0-based rows/cols):\n\n- The normal pattern:  \n  rows 3\u20134: `[2,2]`  \n  row 5: `[8,8]`  \n  rows 6\u20137: `[2,2]`  \n  row 8: `[8,8]`  \n  \u2026 repeating: two rows of `[2,2]`, then one row of `[8,8]`.\n\nAll rows follow this except **row 24** (index 24):\n\n- Row 24 originally had `[c3,c4] = [8,2]`.\n\nTo fit the pattern (and to complete the 2\u00d72 block with row 25), we set:\n\n- **Row 24, col 3: 8 \u2192 2**\n\nNow rows 24\u201325 at cols 3\u20134 are `[2,2]` and the 2/8 cycle is regular.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Second panel: diagonal 1 at columns 9\u201312\n\nConsider columns 8\u201313 for rows 2\u201326. Each such 6-cell segment is:\n\n- Type A: `3,1,8,8,8,3`  (1 at col 9)\n- Type B: `3,8,1,8,8,3`  (1 at col 10)\n- Type C: `3,8,8,1,8,3`  (1 at col 11)\n- Type D: `3,8,8,8,1,3`  (1 at col 12)\n\nThe sequence of row types (from row 2) should follow a repeating 6-row cycle:\n`A, B, C, D, C, B, A, B, C, D, C, B, \u2026`\n\nChecking the actual grid:\n\n- Row 12 (index 12) had: `3,1,8,1,8,3`  \n  \u2192 two 1\u2019s (at cols 9 and 11) instead of a single 1 at col 11 (\u201cC\u201d type).\n- Row 23 (index 23) had: `3,8,8,1,8,3` (\u201cC\u201d type) where the cycle requires a \u201cD\u201d type.\n\nFixes:\n\n1. **Row 12, col 9: 1 \u2192 8**  \n   Row 12 segment becomes `3,8,8,1,8,3` (type C).\n\n2. **Row 23, col 11: 1 \u2192 8; col 12: 8 \u2192 1**  \n   Row 23 segment becomes `3,8,8,8,1,3` (type D).\n\nAfter these edits, the sequence of row types over rows 2\u201326 is exactly:\n`A,B,C,D,C,B, A,B,C,D,C,B, A,B,C,D,C,B, A,B,C,D,C,B,A`.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Third panel: 4/8 pattern at columns 16\u201319\n\nFocus on columns 16\u201319, rows 2\u201326.\n\nWe find a strong column-wise rule:\n\n- Column 16: 8 at rows 4,8,12,16,20,24; 4 elsewhere. No anomalies.\n- Column 18: strictly alternates 8,4,8,4,\u2026; no anomalies.\n- Column 19: 8 at rows 2,6,10,14,18,22,26; 4 elsewhere. No anomalies.\n\nFor **column 17**, we can infer a rule from the majority of rows:\n\n> Column 17 = 8 if either column 16 or column 18 is 8;  \n> Column 17 = 4 if both neighbors are 4.\n\nChecking against this rule reveals three mismatches:\n\n- Row 2: c16=4, c18=8 \u2192 should be 8, but was 4.\n- Row 13: c16=4, c18=4 \u2192 should be 4, but was 8.\n- Row 23: c16=4, c18=4 \u2192 should be 4, but was 8.\n\nFixes:\n\n1. **Row 2, col 17: 4 \u2192 8**\n2. **Row 13, col 17: 8 \u2192 4**\n3. **Row 23, col 17: 8 \u2192 4**\n\nThis makes column 17 perfectly obey the neighbor-based rule, and turns:\n\n- Row 2\u2019s [16\u201319] segment into `4,8,8,8` (consistent with other \u201cS-type\u201d rows).\n- Rows 13 and 23\u2019s [16\u201319] segments into `4,4,4,4` (consistent with \u201call-4\u201d rows).\n\n---\n\n### 5. Right panel: 9\u2019s at columns 24\u201325\n\nExamine columns 22\u201326 (especially 24\u201325):\n\nColumn 25:\n\n- Pattern: a single 9 every 4 rows at rows 4,8,12,16,20,24.  \n  All other rows have 8, *except* row 25 which also had a 9.\n\nSo:\n\n- **Row 25, col 25: 9 \u2192 8**\n\nColumn 24:\n\n- Observed: groups of 9\u2019s mostly in triples:\n  - r7\u20139: 9,9,9\n  - r11\u201313: 9,9,9\n  - r15\u201317: 9,9,9\n  - r19\u201321: 9,9,9\n  - r23\u201325: 9,9,9  \n\n  But the group around row 4\u2019s center only had r4\u20135=9,9; row 3 was 8.\n\nWe infer this pattern: for each 9 in col 25 (center row), col 24 should be 9 at that row and its immediate neighbors (above and below). That is already true for center rows 8,12,16,20,24; only the top center at row 4 is off above:\n\n- We expect c24=9 at row 3 (above row 4), but it was 8.\n\nSo:\n\n- **Row 3, col 24: 8 \u2192 9**\n\nAfter this change:\n\n- Column 25: 9 at rows 4,8,12,16,20,24 only, all others 8.\n- Column 24: 9 at rows 3\u20135,7\u20139,11\u201313,15\u201317,19\u201321,23\u201325, with single 8 rows separating these triples.\n\nRow-wise, this also aligns row 3 and row 25 segments c22\u201326 as `3,8,9,8,8`, matching all other single-9 rows.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Sanity check\n\n- Borders (8\u2019s and 3\u2019s frames) untouched.\n- 2\u00d72 2-blocks regular.\n- Diagonal 1 pattern in second panel strictly cycles A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D\u2013C\u2013B.\n- Third panel 4/8 columns obey the column-wise rule consistently.\n- 9 structures in right panel follow clean vertical periodicity.\n\nNo other entries appear inconsistent with their local repeating patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Final Output Grid\n\nHere is the completed 29\u00d729 output grid after applying all fixes:\n\nRow 0:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n\nRow 1:\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n\nRow 2:\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n\nRow 3:\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n\nRow 4:\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n\nRow 5:\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n\nRow 6:\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n\nRow 7:\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n\nRow 8:\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n\nRow 9:\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n\nRow 10:\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n\nRow 11:\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n\nRow 12:\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n\nRow 13:\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n\nRow 14:\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n\nRow 15:\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n\nRow 16:\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n\nRow 17:\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n\nRow 18:\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n\nRow 19:\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n\nRow 20:\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n\nRow 21:\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n\nRow 22:\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n\nRow 23:\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n\nRow 24:\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n\nRow 25:\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n\nRow 26:\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n\nRow 27:\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n\nRow 28:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"E\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at this task, I need to analyze the test input which consists of 4 panels separated by borders (8s between panels and 3s as inner borders).\n\n**Panel Analysis:**\n\n**Panel 1 (columns 2-5):** Contains a vertical stripe pattern with 2x2 blocks of 2s surrounded by 8s.

describe the transformation I inferred from the examples, then how I applied that to the test input.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What the examples show\n\nIn both solved examples, the input grid is largely a regular repeated pattern with a few \u201ccorrupted\u201d cells. The output repairs those few locations so that each *local horizontal pattern* becomes perfectly regular.\n\nKey observations:\n\n### Example 1\n\n- Focus on the third row (0\u2011indexed row 2):\n\n  - Input:  \n    `3,2,1,3,1,3,1,3,3,3,1,2,3`\n  - Output:  \n    `3,2,1,3,1,3,1,3,1,3,1,2,3`\n\n- Between the 2\u2019s at columns 1 and 11, the intended pattern is clearly an alternation of `1,3,1,3,...,1`.\n- In the input, there is a local break `...,1,3,3,3,1,...` (a double 3 plus misaligned 1).\n- The output fixes only those 3\u2019s that break the alternation, yielding perfect `1,3,1,3,1,3,1,3,1`.\n\nSo: detect a short repeating horizontal pattern in a run between boundaries, and correct any values that break that repetition.\n\n### Example 2\n\nLook at a few stripes:\n\n#### Stripe of 3\u2019s (rows 2\u20133)\n\n- Input row 2, inner segment:  \n  `3,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,4,4,3,3`\n- Output:  \n  `3,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,4,3,3,4`\n\nIntended period: `[3,3,4]`. The substring at the end `4,4,3,3` breaks the pattern. It is corrected to continue `3,3,4`.\n\n#### Stripe of 1\u2019s (row 7)\n\n- Input row 7, central segment:  \n  `...,1,4,1,4,1,4,1,1,1,4,1,4,...`\n- Output:  \n  `...,1,4,1,4,1,4,1,4,1,4,1,4,...`\n\nIntended period: `[1,4]`. A local run `1,1,1` is corrected to `1,4,1`.\n\n#### Stripe of 8\u2019s / 9\u2019s\n\n- For the \u201c8 stripe\u201d, some rows have patterns like `8,4,4,8,8,4` or `8,8,4,4,8,8`; output repairs both to a consistent repeating pattern (`8,4,8,8,8,4` or its phase).\n- For the \u201c9 stripe\u201d, rows show `[9,4]` repeated; anomalies like `...,9,9,...` get fixed to re-establish the `[9,4]` alternation.\n\n**Common pattern:**\n\n- The grid is made of horizontal \u201cblocks\u201d of fixed width (between certain boundary colors, often 2 or 4 in examples).\n- Inside each block, there is a short horizontal period (length 2\u20134) over a small color set.\n- Where a cell breaks that local period, the output corrects that one cell. All other cells are left alone.\n\nThe corrections are *minimal* and always convert a rare/unique local pattern into one of a small set of recurring patterns visible elsewhere in the same stripe.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Structure of the test input\n\nIn the test grid:\n\n- Border color is `8` (full outer frame).\n- Inside (rows 1\u201327, cols 1\u201327), the grid is subdivided vertically by columns full of `8` at `c=0,7,14,21,28`.  \n  So each row has **four 6\u2011column interior blocks**:\n\n  - Block 1: cols 1\u20136  \n  - Block 2: cols 8\u201313  \n  - Block 3: cols 15\u201320  \n  - Block 4: cols 22\u201327  \n\n- Within each block, we mainly see color `3` at the ends, with 2/4/8/9/1 forming patterns in the middle.\n\nI proceed *block-wise* and *row-wise*:\n\n> For each 6\u2011cell block pattern that occurs many times, consider that the \u201cvalid\u201d pattern. If a row\u2019s block uses a pattern that appears only once, treat that as a corrupted variant and correct it to the nearest valid pattern (exactly the kind of repair seen in the training examples).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Detecting and fixing anomalies block by block\n\nI enumerated all 6\u2011cell blocks in cols `[1\u20136]`, `[8\u201313]`, `[15\u201320]`, `[22\u201327]` for rows 1\u201327.\n\n### Block 1: columns 1\u20136\n\nPatterns (row 1 and 27 are pure `3`s and act as top/bottom frame):\n\nFor rows 2\u201326, Block1 values (I write only the 6\u2011tuples):\n\n- Most rows alternate between two standard patterns:\n\n  - A1 (with `2`s): `3,8,2,2,8,3`  \n  - B1 (no `2`s):   `3,8,8,8,8,3`\n\n- One row has:\n\n  - D1 (unique): `3,8,8,2,8,3`  (row 24)\n\nD1 differs from A1 by a single position: it has `8,2` instead of `2,2` in the middle. Since A1 occurs many times and D1 only once, D1 is the anomaly.\n\n**Fix for Block 1:**\n\n- **Row 24** block1 currently: `3,8,8,2,8,3` (cols 1\u20136).\n- Change it to the common \u201c2\u2011block\u201d pattern A1: `3,8,2,2,8,3`.\n\nThat is done by changing:\n\n- Row 24, column 3 (0\u2011based index 3) from `8` to `2`.\n\n---\n\n### Block 2: columns 8\u201313 (the 1\u2011patterns)\n\nBlock2 for rows 2\u201326 always has the form `3,*,*,*,*,3` with a single `1` in the middle\u2026 except one row.\n\nEnumerated central 4 entries (positions 1\u20134 in the 6\u2011tuple):\n\n- Four standard patterns:\n  - P: `3,1,8,8,8,3` \u2013 `1` at position 1\n  - Q: `3,8,1,8,8,3` \u2013 `1` at position 2\n  - R: `3,8,8,1,8,3` \u2013 `1` at position 3\n  - S: `3,8,8,8,1,3` \u2013 `1` at position 4\n\n- One unique corrupted pattern:\n  - Row 12: `3,1,8,1,8,3` \u2013 **two** `1`s instead of one.\n\nIn the examples, an overlong run or extra occurrence of the \u201cspecial\u201d color is corrected back down to the standard periodic form.\n\nHere, row 12 clearly should have only one `1` like all other rows. We can deduce *where* that `1` belongs by looking at the vertical progression: rows around 12 show the `1` sliding across the block (pos 1\u21922\u21923\u21924 etc.). The local sequence around rows 10\u201314 for the 1\u2011position is:\n\n- Row 10: pos 3 (pattern R)\n- Row 11: pos 4 (S)\n- Row 12: pos 1 & 3 (corrupt)\n- Row 13: pos 2 (Q)\n- Row 14: pos 1 (P)\n\nThe smooth progression that matches neighbors is:\n\n- Row 11: 4 \u2192 Row 12: 3 \u2192 Row 13: 2\n\nSo row 12 should be **R**: `3,8,8,1,8,3` (1 at position 3 only).\n\n**Fix for Block 2:**\n\n- Row 12, cols 8\u201313 currently: `3,1,8,1,8,3`\n- Correct to: `3,8,8,1,8,3`\n\nThat changes:\n\n- Row 12, column 9 from `1` to `8` (the right\u2011hand `1` stays as the unique `1` at col 11).\n\n---\n\n### Block 3: columns 15\u201320 (4/8\u2011patterns)\n\nAgain `3` at both ends of the 6\u2011tuple; the 4 internal positions vary among a few highly repeated patterns and a couple of unique ones.\n\nFor rows 2\u201326, interior 4 entries (positions 1\u20134) are mostly:\n\n- A3: `4,4,4,4`\n- B3: `8,8,8,4`\n- C3: `4,8,8,8`\n\nThese three patterns repeat in a very regular 4\u2011row cycle: A,B,A,C, then again A,B,A,C, etc.\n\nThree rows deviate:\n\n- Row 2: D = `4,4,8,8`\n- Row 13: E = `4,8,4,4`\n- Row 23: E = `4,8,4,4` too\n\nMapping the A/B/C cycle across row indices shows:\n\n- r3\u20136: A,B,A,C\n- r7\u201310: A,B,A,C\n- r11\u201314: A,B,**E**,C \u2192 Row 13 should be A (not E)\n- r15\u201318: A,B,A,C\n- r19\u201322: A,B,A,C\n- r23\u201326: **E**,B,A,C \u2192 Row 23 should be A (not E)\n- r2 is just before r3; extending the cycle backwards makes r2 match type C, not D.\n\nSo:\n\n- Row 13 and 23 should be A3 (`4,4,4,4`) instead of E.\n- Row 2 should be C3 (`4,8,8,8`) instead of D.\n\n**Fix for Block 3:**\n\nBlock3 is cols 15\u201320, layout `[3, x1, x2, x3, x4, 3]`.\n\n- Row 2:  \n  current block3: `3,4,4,8,8,3`  \n  target C3:      `3,4,8,8,8,3`  \n  So: change **row 2, col 17** (0\u2011based index 16) from `4` to `8`.\n\n- Row 13:  \n  current block3: `3,4,8,4,4,3`  \n  target A3:      `3,4,4,4,4,3`  \n  So: change **row 13, col 17** from `8` to `4`.\n\n- Row 23:  \n  same pattern as row 13; change **row 23, col 17** from `8` to `4`.\n\nAfter these changes, the block3 patterns follow the clean A,B,A,C cycle with no one-off outliers.\n\n---\n\n### Block 4: columns 22\u201327 (8/9\u2011patterns)\n\nIn block4, the 6\u2011tuples are:\n\n- U: `3,8,8,8,8,3` (no 9s)\n- V: `3,8,9,8,8,3` (single 9 in middle)\n- W: `3,8,9,9,8,3` (double 9)\n\nUnlike blocks 1\u20133, *all* three patterns appear multiple times (U 8\u00d7, V 10\u00d7, W 7\u00d7). There is no pattern that is uniquely anomalous. The counts and distribution suggest all three are intentional configurations for this stripe (analogous to the different, but all valid, block2 patterns P/Q/R/S).\n\nIn contrast to the training example, there is no single pattern W that is rare or stands out as a corruption; so we **do not** modify block4.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Summary of concrete cell changes\n\nStarting from the given test input, the only cells that get changed are:\n\n1. **Row 2, column 17** (0-based indices: `r=2, c=16`):\n   - From `4` \u2192 `8`.\n\n2. **Row 12, column 9** (`r=12, c=9`):\n   - From `1` \u2192 `8`.\n\n3. **Row 13, column 17** (`r=13, c=16`):\n   - From `8` \u2192 `4`.\n\n4. **Row 23, column 17** (`r=23, c=16`):\n   - From `8` \u2192 `4`.\n\n5. **Row 24, column 3** (`r=24, c=3`):\n   - From `8` \u2192 `2`.\n\nAll other grid entries remain unchanged.\n\nThese repairs match the behavior seen in the solved examples: identify locally anomalous patterns in horizontally bounded blocks and minimally recolor them to match the prevailing short-period pattern that recurs throughout the grid.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Final output grid\n\nHere is the completed output grid (with the five corrected rows incorporated):\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,4,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,2,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,4,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,2,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"10\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_8_step_5_image\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Solution Generation for ARC Task: \"Pattern Correction\"**\n\nI'm presented with an ARC task where I'm given two example grids and a test input, and I need to determine the underlying pattern and correct anomalies in the test input.\n\n**Understanding the Task**\n\nThe goal is to analyze the examples, identify repeating visual patterns within them, and apply those patterns to \"correct\" the test input. It's a classic example of pattern recognition and rule application, which is common in these types of problems.\n\n**Analysis of Example 1**\n\n*   **Structure:** This example consists of a green (3) border, a red (2) inner rectangle, and a central row that contains a pattern.\n*   **Pattern:** The crucial part is the central row, where a repeating sequence of \"1, 3\" is established, but with a few incorrect \"3, 3\" pairs.\n*   **Rule:** The correction involves enforcing the repeating \"1, 3\" pattern, essentially smoothing out the noise and completing the pattern, by replacing values that don't fit.\n\n**Analysis of Example 2**\n\n*   **Structure:** This one's more complex, with a yellow (4) border and a series of horizontal bars separated by yellow (4) rows. Each bar is a red (2) border with a pattern within.\n*   **Pattern:** Within the bars, the relevant pattern is \"3, 3, 4\" (Green, Green, Yellow), or potentially a shift of the cyclic pattern.\n*   **Rule:** The correction here involves making that the \"3, 3, 4\" pattern consistent in the inner rows, identifying and correcting local deviations like \"4, 4\" which should be \"3, 3\" and similarly in other rows, like \"1,1\" changed to \"1,4\".\n\n**Test Input Analysis**\n\n*   **Structure:** The test input has an 8 (Teal) border and appears to have vertical panels or cells with a pattern inside them. There are vertical and horizontal lines of a \"separator\" color, forming cells or panels. There are \"patterns\" within each of these panels.\n*   **Identification:** Let's look inside those cells to discover any repeating visual pattern. Within each region of 6 rows there is a specific pattern, let's explore this. Panel 1 has 3-row blocks: \\[8,8,8,8], \\[8,2,2,8], \\[8,2,2,8]. Panel 2 has the pattern, \\[1,8,8,8], \\[8,1,8,8], \\[8,8,1,8], \\[8,8,8,1]. Panel 3 has alternating patterns, \\[4,8,8,8], \\[4,4,4,4], \\[8,8,8,4], etc. Panel 4 has 4-line cycles, \\[8,8,8,8], \\[8,9,8,8], \\[8,9,9,8], \\[8,9,8,8].\n*   **Correction:** Within panel 1 the error is a `8,8,2,8` which should be `8,2,2,8`. For panel 2, anomalies are that row inputs, from the 18th to the 23rd, are out of order, and are corrected according to the pattern (shift values in place), and in panel 3, there are a series of row swaps as well that are also corrected. Panel 4 has 4 row cycle, it is the `B, A, B, Blank` one, where the error is detected on R26, from `8998` to `8988`.\n\n**Approach for Solving**\n\n1.  **Structure Recognition:** Break down the input into logical sections or patterns.\n2.  **Pattern Identification:** Look for repeating visual sequences within those sections (length 2 to 4).\n3.  **Anomaly Detection:** Pinpoint the parts of the input where the established pattern is violated.\n4.  **Correction Application:** Modify the input to match the established pattern consistently.\n\n**Solution Generation**\n\nI will now generate the output grid.\nFirst line is 8 (teal).\nSecond line is a repeating unit with 3s inside it.\nPanel 1 correction for \\[8,8,2,8] to \\[8,2,2,8] to get patterns like \\[8,8,8,8], \\[8,2,2,8].\nPanel 2 with the pattern \\[1,8,8,8], \\[8,1,8,8].\nPanel 3 with the patterns, like \\[4,8,8,8] and \\[8,8\n\nThe task involves identifying and correcting patterns in four distinct vertical panels within a grid. The grid is segmented by columns of color 8 (Teal) and rows of color 8 at the top and bottom. Inside, there are \"frames\" with color 3 (Green) borders. We analyze the content of each panel (rows 2-26, columns corresponding to the inner parts of the frames).\n\n**Analysis of Panels:**\n\n1.  **Panel 1 (Columns 2-5):**\n    *   **Observed Pattern:** A repeating triplet of rows: `8,8,8,8` (Row A), `8,2,2,8` (Row B), `8,2,2,8` (Row B). The cycle is A, B, B.\n    *   **Corrections:**\n        *   Row 24: Input `8,8,2,8` deviates from the expected pattern B (`8,2,2,8`). It is corrected to `8,2,2,8`.\n\n2.  **Panel 2 (Columns 9-12):**\n    *   **Observed Pattern:** A single Blue pixel (`1`) oscillates diagonally on a Teal (`8`) background.

The transformation **fixes errors/anomalies** in these patterns to make them regular and consistent.\n\nExample 1: A simple row with pattern `1,3,1,3,1,3,3,3,1` gets corrected to `1,3,1,3,1,3,1,3,1` (fixing the `3,3` break in the pattern).\n\nExample 2: Multiple regions with different patterns (diagonal checkerboards, repeating blocks) have scattered errors that get corrected to maintain the regular pattern.\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\nThe test grid has 4 rectangular regions (separated by 8s and bordered by 3s):\n\n1. **Region 1 (cols 2-5)**: Pattern of 2s in a 3-row cycle: `8,8,8,8` then `8,2,2,8` twice\n   - Error: Row 24, col 3 should be 2 (not 8)\n\n2. **Region 2 (cols 9-12)**: Zigzag diagonal of 1s moving positions 0\u21921\u21922\u21923\u21922\u21921\u21920...\n   - Error: Row 12 has extra 1 at col 9 (should only be at col 11)\n   - Error: Row 23 has 1 at col 11 (should be at col 12)\n\n3. **Region 3 (cols 16-19)**: Odd rows are all 4s; even rows alternate between `8,8,8,4` and `4,8,8,8`\n   - Error: Row 13, col 17 should be 4 (not 8)\n   - Error: Row 23, col 17 should be 4 (not 8)\n\n4. **Region 4 (cols 24-25)**: 4-row cycle: `9,9` \u2192 `9,8` \u2192 `8,8` \u2192 `9,8`\n   - Error: Row 3, col 24 should be 9 (not 8)\n   - Error: Row 25, col 25 should be 8 (not 9)\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"12\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_7_step_5_image\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Here's my thought process, distilled into a concise summary:**\n\nI'm tasked with solving an ARC puzzle based on provided examples. My initial focus is on analyzing the patterns within the given grids, looking for repeating sequences and anomalies.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\nI identified the basic structure as a box within a box within a row. The key is to find the repeating \"noise\" pattern and correct it. The central row had a repeating \"1, 3\" pattern, which the output corrected by eliminating the deviating parts.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n\nThis example revealed a more complex structure: a larger yellow outer box, with smaller red boxes containing patterns inside. I zeroed in on the repeating sub-patterns within each red box, and I identified a cyclic shift correction to be made.\n\n**Test Input Approach:**\n\nFor the new test input, I began by deconstructing the grid into container-like regions separated by repeating border columns. I identified horizontal and vertical columns, then analyzed their patterns.\n\n*   **Region 1:** I isolated a pattern of 8s and 2s repeating vertically. The \"2\" pixels were the \"noise\" or deviations in this region.\n*   **Region 2:** Within one of these container blocks, I observed a 'bouncing' pattern of '1's. I identified the period and position.\n*   **Region 3:** A more complex repeating pattern of `4`s and `8`s emerged in one area of the grid.\n*   **Region 4:** A sequence of \"8988, 8998, 8988, 8888\" was identified as repeating in the right region of the grid.\n\nIn Region 3 I identified that the initial assumption was incorrect, and the pattern started at phase 2 and not 0, like it was identified in the test output.\nWith the initial approach to assume there were only two colors, I found that the original alternating pattern was broken.\nI used the approach of counting good rows for the initial hypothesis to be validated with better visualization tools, I found that both parts were very consistent.\nI identified the period of each section, using the pattern of phase to identify any noise inside of a single box, and applied to all rows in the box to clean the noise and restore the output.\nTo find the pattern I used the start of the output to determine the expected output for the input and determine corrections to be made.\n\n**Overall Goal:**\n\nThe overarching goal is to identify patterns, correct any deviations, and apply these corrections across the entire grid. I am focused on cleaning the inner patterns to restore consistency. My main task is to identify and correct any noise in the repeating sub-patterns, and restore the pattern.\n\n\nThe goal is to analyze the input grid, identify the distinct patterned regions (blocks), determine the intended repeating pattern for each block, and reconstruct the grid with the patterns fully corrected (removing noise/errors).\n\n**1. Grid Structure Analysis**\nThe grid is 29x29.\n- **Background:** Color 8 (Azure).\n- **Structure:** There are 4 vertical rectangular blocks (columns of data) separated by columns of 8s.

My brain immediately starts dissecting the problem: they want me to analyze a set of input-output image pairs, figure out a transformation rule, and then apply it to a new input. It's all about pattern recognition and logical inference, my bread and butter.\n\n**Deep Dive into Example Transformations**\n\nI begin by poring over the examples provided. My initial focus is on understanding how the input grids are changed to produce the outputs. I'm looking for repetitive elements, symmetrical structures, and color relationships.\n\n**Example 1: The Horizontal Line Pattern**\n\nIn the first example, I zero in on the central row. It's like a noisy line within a rectangular structure. The output cleans it up, transforming the noise into a consistent, alternating \"1, 3\" pattern. It's like the input is a partially-completed jigsaw puzzle, and the output is the fully assembled piece. I realize the border color (3) is also part of the pattern, which is interesting. It's not just a frame; it actively contributes to the transformation.\n\n**Example 2: Multiple Patterns and Noisy Regions**\n\nThe second example throws a bit more at me. It's a grid with a background and several internal \"lanes\" or rectangular regions. Within each lane, a unique horizontal pattern is being revealed, although there's some corruption, which I must correct. It's crucial to identify the pattern and isolate the error. I have to look closely to identify the small deviations in each of those regions from the intended regularities and fix those.\n\n**Synthesizing the Transformation Logic**\n\nAfter staring at these examples, a general rule begins to emerge. It seems the input has a \"noisy\" section that must be smoothed. I'm getting the idea that my job is to segment the grid into relevant regions, identify a pattern, and then clean up any deviations within that pattern. It looks like the task involves removing \"noise\" and restoring the intended repeating patterns.\n\n**A Strategy for Success**\n\nTo approach the test input, I plan to proceed in the following steps:\n\n1.  **Identify regions:** Identify regions that have content.\n2.  **Define background and canvas colors:** Find the colors of background and canvas.\n3.  **Detect the vertical and horizontal segmentation boundaries**.\n4.  **Identify the repeating patterns, including any phase shifts**.\n5.  **Clean up any deviations from the pattern in those segments**.\n\n**Analyzing the Test Input**\n\nI start by looking at the test input's visual structure. It is a 29x29 grid enclosed by a border of color 8. I notice the internal regions are filled with color 3 (Green).\n\nI can visually segment the input. I can see 4 blocks separated by 8s and then filled with 3s. I am going to define each region by the set of rows and columns.\n\n**Pattern Analysis and Corrections**\n\nFor each \"panel\" identified, I'll examine the rows to find how the rows of pixels of canvas color 3 will change, and correct them. Let's start with the Panel Column 1 that has the pattern `3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3` (3, followed by 8s)\n\n**Implementing the Solution**\n\nThe task now is to write the transformation function that correctly generates the output grid based on the derived rules.\n\nI will iterate through each row of the grid. It's a matter of plugging in the derived patterns and logic.\n\nFor the border, I simply generate the border of 8s.\n\nThe internal rows are generated by applying the various patterns. I can generate any row by adding a few offsets and then applying the various repeating patterns within each row (horizontal panel).\n\n**Final Validation**\n\nBefore I submit, I need to verify that everything works. I need to re-run the process for one or two rows of the input, making sure the code generates what my brain expects. I'll test, make the corrections, and I should be good to go.\n\n\nThe problem requires identifying and restoring periodic patterns within vertical panels in a grid. The grid is segmented by vertical walls of color `8`.

One cell near the right end is `3` instead of `1`, so it is corrected.\n\nIn Example 2, each horizontal band has its own repeating pattern:\n- a `3,3,4` rhythm in one band,\n- a `1,4` alternation in another,\n- a more complex repetition for the `8`-band and for the `9`-band.\nAgain, only the few cells that violate the column\u2011wise/row\u2011wise repetition are corrected.\n\n---\n\n### Applying this to the test grid\n\nFor the test input:\n\n- The outer color is `8`, forming a border and internal vertical pillars.\n- Between the vertical pillars, the interior columns show **clear vertical periodic patterns**:\n  - Columns with `2` follow `8,2,2` repeating down the grid.\n  - Columns with `1` and `8` follow cycles such as `1,8,8,8,8,8,1,\u2026` or `8,8,1,8,1,8,\u2026`.\n  - Columns with `4` repeat simple patterns like `4,4,8,4,\u2026` or alternations of `8` and `4`.\n  - Columns with `9` follow a `8,9,9,9` or `8,8,9,8,8,8,9,\u2026` style repetition.\n\nMost cells already fit these vertical sequences; a small number are wrong and break the clear pattern. For each such column:\n\n1. Identify the repeating cycle by inspection of the majority of the column.\n2. For any cell that does not agree with that cycle, change it to the value dictated by the cycle.\n\nDoing this yields the following corrections (row, column):\n- `(25,4)` from `8` \u2192 `2` to fit the `8,2,2` pattern.\n- `(13,10)` from `1` \u2192 `8` to restore the `1`-every-6-rows pattern in column 10.\n- `(24,12)` from `1` \u2192 `8` to make column 12 follow its `8,8,1,8,1,8` cycle.\n- `(14,18)` from `8` \u2192 `4` and `(24,18)` from `8` \u2192 `4` to fix column 18\u2019s `4/8` alternation.\n- `(4,25)` from `8` \u2192 `9` to restore the `8,9,9,9` pattern in column 25.\n- `(26,26)` from `9` \u2192 `8` so column 26 has `9` at every 4th row only, not one extra.\n\nAll other cells already respect their column\u2019s repetition and are unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\nHere is the completed output grid after making those corrections:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n

ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I need to take input grids and transform them into specific outputs. My approach involves a methodical breakdown. First, I'll dissect the provided input/output pairs to understand the underlying transformation logic. I'm looking for recurring patterns, periodic sequences, or any inherent structure that's being altered.\n\nThe initial example shows a framed structure with a \"content\" section inside. The key seems to be identifying the frame colors and the repetitive nature of the elements within the content area. I'm focusing on the \"glitches\" or deviations from an expected pattern and how they are corrected in the output. For example, a disrupted sequence is \"repaired\" to fit the underlying, regular structure. The pattern can be one-dimensional within each row or even two-dimensional where it interacts across multiple rows and columns.\n\nExample two further illustrates these ideas. The grid is clearly divided into regions by frames and separators. Each content area has its own pattern and those patterns may shift or have varying periodicity. This analysis is about identifying the common denominators within the noise. I'm looking for the most probable structure that has a certain rhythm.\n\nWhen I get to the test input, I use these insights to decode the structures and correct noisy data. I map the grid, isolate the regions, and then apply what I've learned about extracting periodic patterns, taking into account any disruptions. This involves a lot of close inspection to pick the most likely patterns and how those are altered or corrected to make the output.\n\nAfter identifying the key pattern, I can reconstruct the output. I will copy all elements except in the designated regions. And then I can recreate those sections to match the desired patterns. This requires attention to index. The periodic sequences could have glitches when mapped onto an index, which can throw off the pattern. And I have to be careful with indexing because I am replacing some elements in each step of my pattern. Once I understand the relationships between an input's disruptions and the pattern that should be present, I'll generate the new rows and replace the ones in the grid.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to solve an ARC task where we must identify patterns within grid regions and repair \"glitches\" or deviations from those patterns.\n\n**Analysis of the Task:**\n\n1.  **Structure Decomposition:**\n    *   The grid is composed of a background structure (borders) and foreground content regions.\n    *   **Borders:** There is an outer border of color 8 (Light Blue) and an inner structure using colors 8 and 3 (Green).\n    *   **Content Regions:** The grid is vertically divided into 4 distinct rectangular strips (regions) separated by vertical lines of color 3 and 8.\n        *   **Region 1:** Columns 2-5 (Width 4).\n        *   **Region 2:** Columns 9-12 (Width 4).\n        *   **Region 3:** Columns 16-19 (Width 4).\n        *   **Region 4:** Columns 23-26 (Width 4).\n    *   The rows containing content are Row 2 through Row 26. Rows 0, 1, 27, and 28 form the top and bottom borders.\n\n2.  **Pattern Identification per Region:**\n\n    *   **Region 1 (Leftmost):**\n        *   The rows exhibit a repeating 3-step cycle: `A, B, B`.\n        *   **A:** `8, 8, 8, 8`\n        *   **B:** `8, 2, 2, 8`\n        *   The cycle starts at Row 2.\n            *   Row 2 (Step 0): `8, 8, 8, 8` (A)\n            *   Row 3 (Step 1): `8, 2, 2, 8` (B)\n            *   Row 4 (Step 2): `8, 2, 2, 8` (B)\n            *   Row 5 (Step 0): `8, 8, 8, 8` (A)\n            *   ...and so on.\n\n    *   **Region 2 (Middle-Left):**\n        *   The pattern involves a single `1` moving diagonally on a background of `8`s, bouncing back and forth.\n        *   The positions of the `1` follow the sequence: 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1 (repeat).\n        *   Rows:\n            *   Pos 0: `1, 8, 8, 8`\n            *   Pos 1: `8, 1, 8, 8`\n            *   Pos 2: `8, 8, 1, 8`\n            *   Pos 3: `8, 8, 8, 1`\n        *   The cycle starts at Row 2 with Position 0.\n\n    *   **Region 3 (Middle-Right):**\n        *   The pattern alternates based on the row number (even vs. odd).\n        *   **Odd Rows (3, 5, ...):** Always `4, 4, 4, 4`.\n        *   **Even Rows (2, 4, ...):** A single `4` on a background of `8`s, alternating between the leftmost (Pos 0) and rightmost (Pos 3) columns.\n            *   Row 2: `4, 8, 8, 8` (Pos 0)\n            *   Row 4: `8, 8, 8, 4` (Pos 3)\n            *   Row 6: `4, 8, 8, 8` (Pos 0)\n            *   ...and so on.\n\n    *   **Region 4 (Rightmost):**\n        *   The rows exhibit a repeating 4-step cycle: `T1, T2, T3, T4`.\n        *   **T1:** `8, 8, 8, 8`\n        *   **T2:** `8, 9, 8, 8`\n        *   **T3:** `8, 9, 9, 8`\n        *   **T4:** `8, 9, 8, 8`\n        *   The cycle starts at Row 2.\n\n3.

of this ARC task.**\n\nThe user wants me to fix patterns in these grids. It looks like each grid has a repeating unit or \"tile,\" and the task is to correct deviations from that unit.\n\nFirst, I looked at the two solved examples to get a feel for what constitutes a \"correct\" pattern. Example 1 showed a simple alternating pattern disrupted by some \"noise,\" which was then corrected. Example 2 had vertically stacked panels with individual pattern problems in each.\n\nThen, I focused on the test input, which seems to be structured as a 29x29 grid split into four vertical \"strips.\" I found that the grid uses a kind of \"padding\" and a repeating unit that defines each column. Inside each strip, the patterns are the core of the challenge.\n\nLet's do the deep dive on those strips:\n\n*   **Strip 1:** It looks like a standard periodic repetition of 3 rows: 8888, 8228, 8228.\n\n*   **Strip 2:** The pattern here is a kind of bouncing line of \"1\" pixels against an \"8\" background, like zig-zagging. The period of the zig-zag is 13, and I figured out the best fit pattern by carefully considering the sequence 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 0 - and then applied a Period 13 cycle: 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1.\n\n*   **Strip 3:** It's a \"4444\" \"Background\" with a mix of \"8884\" and \"4888\". I'm calling it a Period 2 cycle: \"4888, 4444\" pattern, with an 8884 exception when there are 3 consecutive 4s\n\n*   **Strip 4:** I identified a period 4 unit `8888, 9888, 9988, 9888`\n\nNow, the plan is to fix the grid:\n\n*   **Strip 1:** Will apply a 3-row tile, fixing only the deviation at R24.\n\n*   **Strip 2:** Will apply a Period 13 pattern, fixing two deviation at R13 and R26.\n\n*   **Strip 3:** Will apply a Period 4 pattern, making the \"8884, 4444, 4888, 4444\" with three \"8884\" exceptions.\n\n*   **Strip 4:** Will apply a standard Period 4 with corrections for R3, R4, R5, R6, R24, and R26.\n\nMy goal is to create a complete and corrected version of this test grid based on these \"tile\" rules.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the structural patterns and periodicity in the test input, here is the reconstruction of the solution.\n\nThe grid consists of four vertical strips (panels) separated by columns of `8`s. Each strip has a distinct background and pattern logic. The goal is to identify the periodic \"tile\" or sequence for each strip and repair any deviations (noise, missing lines, or broken cycles).\n\n**Strip 1 (Cols 2-5):**\n*   **Pattern:** A 3-row repeating cycle: `8,8,8,8` (Frame), `8,2,2,8` (Hollow), `8,2,2,8` (Hollow).\n*   **Logic:** Rows 2, 5, 8, ... are full `8`s. Intermediate rows are `8`s with `2`s in the middle.\n*   **Corrections:** Row 24 input `8,8,2,8` is corrected to `8,2,2,8` to match the phase.\n\n**Strip 2 (Cols 9-12):**\n*   **Pattern:** A \"bouncing\" diagonal line of color `1` on a background of `8`. The cycle is Period 13.\n*   **Sequence:** `0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1`. (Where 0 is `1,8,8,8`, 1 is `8,1,8,8`, etc.).\n*   **Logic:** This sequence accounts for the \"dwell\" at the right edge (position 3) and the immediate return at the left edge (position 0) observed in the input.\n*   **Corrections:**\n    *   Row 13 (Input `1,8,1,8` noise) is corrected to `8,8,1,8` (Position 2).\n    *   Row 26 (Input `8,1,8,8`) is corrected to `8,8,1,8` (Position 2) to complete the cycle.\n\n**Strip 3 (Cols 16-19):**\n*   **Pattern:** Alternating rows of solid `4`s (`4,4,4,4`) and Pattern rows (`4,8,8,8` or `8,8,8,4`).\n*   **Logic:**\n    *   The \"separator\" rows of `4,4,4,4` occur on odd indices relative to the pattern start (Rows 3, 5, 7, etc.).\n    *   The \"content\" rows alternate. The dominant pattern is `4,8,8,8` (Left-aligned 4), but specific rows (4, 9, 24) are `8,8,8,4` (Right-aligned 4).\n    *   I will enforce the alternation and specific instances found in valid input rows, repairing noise like `4,4,8,8` in Row 2 to `4,8,8,8` and `4,4,8,4` in Row 8 to `4,4,4,4`.\n*   **Refined Logic:** The Period 4 pattern `4888, 4444, 8884, 4444` appears to be the underlying rule, but with a phase shift or irregularity in the middle. Given the high density of `4888` in the bottom half and `8884` in specific upper rows, I will standardize on `4,8,8,8` for the pattern rows unless the input strongly indicated `8,8,8,4` in a valid position (Rows 4, 9, 24).\n    *   Actually, looking at the Period 4 structure in Strip 4, Strip 3 likely follows a similar Period 4 or Period 2. The most robust fix is: Odd rows (3,5...) are `4,4,4,4`. Even rows are `4,8,8,8`. The `8,8,8,4` entries at 4, 9, 24 are preserved where they don't conflict with the `4,4,4,4` grid, but most noise (like in Row 8) is cleared to `4,4,4,4`.\n\n**Strip 4 (Cols 23-26):**\n*   **Pattern:** A 4-row repeating cycle: `8,8,8,8`, `9,8,8,8`, `9,9,8,8`, `9,8,8,8`.\n*   **Logic:** This is an expanding and contracting bar of `9`s.\n*   **Corrections:** Fixes applied to Rows 3-6 (phase mismatch/noise) and Row 24, 26 to match the established Period 4 pattern starting from Row 7.\n\noutput:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,9,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,9,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,9,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,9,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,9,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,9,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,9,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,9,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,9,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,9,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,9,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,9,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,9,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"17\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_10_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Here's how I'm approaching this ARC task:**\n\nI'm being presented with a coding problem based on two example input/output grids and a test grid. My goal is to deduce the pattern and apply the corrections, simulating a visual repair on a damaged image. This is a task that heavily relies on pattern recognition, spatial reasoning, and the ability to extrapolate from limited examples. I have to interpret the data, identify irregularities, and replace 'defective' areas with the correct repeating sequence to produce a correct grid.\n\n**Initial Analysis and Decoding the Rules:**\n\nFirst, I need to understand the grid format. I start by observing that the grids are framed by a border element ('3', '4', '8' respectively). The central region contains the data. I'm noting that the task involves \"independent panels framed by borders.\" Example 2 has multiple panels and this is reinforced in the test input. The hints also stress looking at repeating units within each panel. I initially assume that I need to process each grid row, independently, to correct the pattern.\n\n**Breaking Down the Examples:**\n\nThe two examples give me concrete cases to start. I'm focusing on identifying the repeating elements and any disruption.\n\n*   **Example 1**: The first example showcases a simple grid. The input row has a pattern (repeating \"1, 3\" ) disrupted by a sequence of \"3,3.\" The task is to replace this disruptive pixel block with the repeating unit \"1,3\" to restore the sequence. I'm focusing on the border pixels and the content.\n\n*   **Example 2**: I'm quickly realizing this is a multi-panel grid. I focus on how the borders work and use it to divide up my problem. After carefully looking at this example, I realize that it consists of vertical panel divisions. Then I look at a row's contents to see what patterns are present. I find the repeating unit is `1, 4` - however, '4' is the border number. This causes me to re-evaluate the patterns, as the border can act as part of a recurring element in this example. I determine this by looking at how pixels break the pattern, and which pixels make up the repeating unit.\n\n**Test Input - The Real Challenge:**\n\nThe test input is larger, more complex, with 4 columns - or vertical panels - and requires the patterns of each panel to be restored. I start by carefully checking out the borders ('8') and what divides up the contents. I determine the borders that define the sub-regions, focusing on the vertical '3's that act as dividers. Now, my task is to identify patterns in each region. The key is in determining *vertical* patterns. I then find a vertical repeating sequence within each subgrid and analyze those regions independently. I realize that the overall pattern repeats vertically. I find that this is an *A, B, C* pattern for each section. I look at each panel and determine the underlying patterns:\n*   Panel 1: \"A, B, B\" pattern\n*   Panel 2: Scanner (or zig-zag) like pattern where a '1' moves position down each row.\n*   Panel 3: Two repeating rows *A* and *B*, that themselves repeat.\n*   Panel 4: \"A, A, B, C\"\n\nNow, I'm identifying any local errors within these sequences. I analyze the example, row by row and note which pixels in each panel are defective and, in each case, the correct value for the pixel. This becomes my rule to fix the test input.\n\n**Formulating the Implementation:**\n\nBased on the patterns identified, I'm forming a plan:\n1.  Read in the test input grid.\n2.  I break each grid row into its panels, based on the `3` borders.\n3.  Based on my previous analysis, I identify the positions where defective elements are.\n4.  I replace the defective values with the correct element from the repeating unit in its pattern.\n5.  I construct the final output grid and return it.\n\n\nTo solve this task, I first identified the structure of the grid. The image consists of independent vertical panels separated by border columns. The borders are marked by the value `8` (teal) and separator columns of `3` (green). Within these panels, there are repeating visual patterns that contain local defects. The goal is to deduce the correct pattern for each panel from the intact rows and repair the defective pixels.\n\n**Panel Identification:**\nThe grid (rows 0-28, cols 0-28) contains four vertical data panels:\n1.  **Panel 1:** Columns 2-5 (width 4).\n2.  **Panel 2:** Columns 9-12 (width 4).\n3.  **Panel 3:** Columns 16-19 (width 4).\n4.  **Panel 4:** Columns 23-26 (width 4).\n\n**Pattern Analysis and Repair:**\n\n**Panel 1 (Cols 2-5):**\n*   **Pattern:** A vertical repeating sequence of rows `A, B, B`, where `A = [8, 8, 8, 8]` and `B = [8, 2, 2, 8]`.\n*   **Defect:**\n    *   Row 24: Input is `[8, 8, 2, 8]`. It corresponds to pattern B (`[8, 2, 2, 8]`).\n    *   **Repair:** Change cell (24, 3) from `8` to `2`.\n\n**Panel 2 (Cols 9-12):**\n*   **Pattern:** A \"bouncing\" single pixel of color `1` on a background of `8`s. The position of `1` follows the sequence 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, ...\n*   **Defects:**\n    *   Row 12: Sequence position 2 (expected `1` at col 11). Input `[1, 8, 1, 8]` has extra `1` at col 9.\n        *   **Repair:** Change (12, 9) from `1` to `8`.\n    *   Row 23: Sequence position 3 (expected `1` at col 12). Input `[8, 8, 1, 8]` has `1` at col 11.\n        *   **Repair:** Change (23, 11) from `1` to `8`, (23, 12) from `8` to `1`.\n    *   Row 25: Sequence position 1 (expected `1` at col 10). Input `[8, 8, 1, 8]` has `1` at col 11.\n        *   **Repair:** Change (25, 10) from `8` to `1`, (25, 11) from `1` to `8`.\n    *   Row 26: Sequence position 0 (expected `1` at col 9). Input `[8, 1, 8, 8]` has `1` at col 10.\n        *   **Repair:** Change (26, 9) from `8` to `1`, (26, 10) from `1` to `8`.\n\n**Panel 3 (Cols 16-19):**\n*   **Pattern:** Even rows alternate between `A = [4, 8, 8, 8]` and `B = [8, 8, 8, 4]`.

The user wants me to solve this Arc task based on two provided examples, and I've dissected them thoroughly.\n\nFirst, I recognized a recurring theme: identify the frame, then the internal panels or rows, determine the patterns, and fix the defects. The examples help to establish this general strategy.\n\n**Example 1**: I zeroed in on the alternating `1, 3` pattern in the first example, noting the disruption and fixing this \"broken\" element. The pattern's periodicity was the key, so I focused on it.\n\n**Example 2**: This became a more complex task, with the main task of breaking down the grid into panels separated by a yellow frame color. I could then see internal, repeating sequences within them. Patterns like `3, 3, 4` and `1, 4` emerged, but I really paid attention to where the inputs deviated from these. One row had a repeating disruption in the output. I also noticed that the panels were of a certain height and had periodic rows. Panel borders were also evident.\n\n**Moving to the Test Input:**\n\nI then tackled the test input, armed with this structured thinking. I identified the frame color (teal, or 8) and noticed how it established a grid-like structure with vertical dividers. Each of these components seemed to have patterns I could exploit.\n\n*   **Vertical Panels:** The dividers (also 8s) created these vertical panels within the grid.\n*   **Horizontal Segmentation:** Horizontal dividing lines also exist (row 1, 27). The frame color (8).\n*   **Panel Content:** The content within these, I decided were from R2 to R26.\n\nI looked in detail and discovered, after a few iterations, that each \"Panel\" has an internal structure. They should be built with repeating sequences. The analysis helped identify those. In summary:\n\n*   **Panel 1:** Vertical repetition. (0,1,2,2)\n*   **Panel 2:** \"Zigzag\" 1 movement in each row: 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1 and repeat.\n*   **Panel 3:** 0,1,2,3 for vertical direction.\n*   **Panel 4:** 0, 1, 2, 3 with patterns of 4x1 pixels.\n\nI took the test input and performed an iterative analysis of the panels, figuring out what sequences were occurring in the input, and correcting deviations from that. The most prominent pattern was a vertical repeating sequence with period 4, and some disturbances.\n\n**Key takeaway**\n\nAll of this analysis then lead to this overall strategy to construct the output, which will be the sum of all the patterns I have been able to extract from the example analysis. I will create a grid of 29x29 and start from scratch.\n\n*   Initialize all with 8's.\n*   Add 3's in the appropriate cells from Rows 1 and 27 to make frame.\n*   Apply the repeating sequences to the Panels I have defined to generate final pattern.\n\nI feel confident in my proposed solution. Now, let's turn these insights into the correct output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to repair a grid containing several independent panels. Based on the analysis of the test input and the provided examples, here is the breakdown of the solution:\n\n1.  **Grid Structure**:\n    *   The grid (29x29) is divided into four vertical panels separated by columns of `8` (teal) and bounded by columns of `3` (green).\n    *   **Frame**: Rows 0 and 28 are solid `8`s. Columns 0, 7, 14, 21, 28 are `8`s.\n    *   **Panel Borders**: Rows 1 and 27 are horizontal borders (`8` at the frame columns, `3` elsewhere). Columns 1, 6, 8, 13, 15, 20, 22, 27 are vertical borders of `3`s spanning from Row 2 to Row 26.\n    *   **Content Regions**: There are 4 distinct content areas (Panels) spanning Rows 2 through 26. Each is 4 pixels wide.\n        *   Panel 1: Cols 2-5\n        *   Panel 2: Cols 9-12\n        *   Panel 3: Cols 16-19\n        *   Panel 4: Cols 23-26\n\n2.  **Pattern Identification & Repair**:\n    We analyze each panel's content rows (indices 2 to 26) to find the periodic pattern and repair defects. Let $r$ be the row index and $offset = r - 2$.\n\n    *   **Panel 1 (Cols 2-5)**:\n        *   The pattern is a vertical period of 3.\n        *   Sequence:\n            *   Offset % 3 == 0: `8, 8, 8, 8`\n            *   Offset % 3 == 1: `8, 2, 2, 8`\n            *   Offset % 3 == 2: `8, 2, 2, 8`\n        *   This corresponds to an `8` border with a `2` (red) fill appearing in 2 out of 3 rows.\n\n    *   **Panel 2 (Cols 9-12)**:\n        *   The pattern involves a single `1` (blue) pixel moving on a background of `8`s.\n        *   The position of `1` follows the sequence `0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1` repeating every 6 rows.\n        *   Sequence (1-based position index 0..3):\n            *   Offset % 6 == 0: `1, 8, 8, 8`\n            *   Offset % 6 == 1: `8, 1, 8, 8`\n            *   Offset % 6 == 2: `8, 8, 1, 8`\n            *   Offset % 6 == 3: `8, 8, 8, 1`\n            *   Offset % 6 == 4: `1, 8, 8, 8`\n            *   Offset % 6 == 5: `8, 1, 8, 8`\n\n    *   **Panel 3 (Cols 16-19)**:\n        *   The pattern alternates rows of `4`s (yellow) with a shifting row containing `8`s and a single `4`.\n        *   Period 4.\n        *   Sequence:\n            *   Offset % 4 == 0: `4, 8, 8, 8`\n            *   Offset % 4 == 1: `4, 4, 4, 4`\n            *   Offset % 4 == 2: `8, 8, 8, 4`\n            *   Offset % 4 == 3: `4, 4, 4, 4`\n\n    *   **Panel 4 (Cols 23-26)**:\n        *   The pattern is a \"pulsing\" diamond shape of `9`s (maroon) on `8`s.\n        *   Period 4.\n        *   Sequence:\n            *   Offset % 4 == 0: `8, 8, 8, 8`\n            *   Offset % 4 == 1: `8, 9, 8, 8`\n            *   Offset % 4 == 2: `8, 9, 9, 8`\n            *   Offset % 4 == 3: `8, 9, 8, 8`\n\n3.  **Construction**:\n    The output grid is constructed by filling the structural frame and replacing the content of each panel with the idealized patterns derived above, correcting all local defects found in the

solved examples, then apply the same style of reasoning to the test.\n\n### 1. What the examples are doing\n\n- In both solved examples, the picture is divided into **panels** by a uniform border color (3 in example 1, 4 in example 2).\n- Inside a panel, certain rows contain a **repeating 1\u2011D pattern** (e.g. `1,3,1,3,...` or `3,3,4,3,3,4,...`).\n- A few cells break this periodic pattern (e.g. `...,3,3,3,...` where you expect `...,1,3,1,...`).\n- The output is obtained by **repairing only those defective cells** so that each row\u2019s pattern becomes perfectly periodic, while borders and all other cells remain unchanged.\n\nThe key operations:\n- Identify the border color and panel boundaries.\n- Within each panel, deduce the intended periodic pattern from the majority of cells.\n- Locate cells that violate this pattern and overwrite them with the correct color to restore periodicity.\n\n### 2. Structure of the test grid\n\n- Border color is **8**: the outer frame (row 0, row 28, column 0, column 28) is all 8.\n- Inside, there are **vertical panels** separated by full columns of 8 at columns 7, 14, 21:\n  - Panel 1: columns 1\u20136\n  - Panel 2: columns 8\u201313\n  - Panel 3: columns 15\u201320\n  - Panel 4: columns 22\u201327\n- Each panel uses colors `{3, 8}` plus one \u201cspecial\u201d color:\n  - Panel 1: special color 2\n  - Panel 2: special color 1\n  - Panel 3: special color 4\n  - Panel 4: special color 9\n\nThe patterns in these panels are **vertical waves/stripes**:\n- Panel 1: columns 3 and 4 alternate in a periodic `8,2,2,8,2,2,...` fashion.\n- Panel 2: a single `1` moves back and forth across columns 2\u20135 (a vertical triangular wave).\n- Panel 3: columns show regular alternations/blocks of 4 and 8 (e.g. alternation in column 17, and 4\u2011of\u2011a\u2011kind / 8\u2011of\u2011a\u2011kind blocks in other columns).\n- Panel 4: columns 24\u201325 form a regular stripe pattern of 9\u2019s: the row types repeat in a `2,1,0,1` cycle (where 2 = double\u20119, 1 = single\u20119, 0 = no 9).\n\nIn almost all rows, these vertical patterns are perfectly regular; a **few cells** clearly break them.\n\n### 3. Finding and fixing the defects\n\nProcess each panel independently, column by column, to preserve the vertical periodic pattern.\n\n#### Panel 2 (columns 8\u201313, special color 1)\n\nPanel 2 grid (rows 1\u201327, columns 8\u201313, with interior indices 1\u20136):\n\n- General pattern:\n  - Column 1 and 6: always 3 (frame inside the panel).\n  - Columns 2\u20135: there is **exactly one `1` per row** (rows 2\u201326), moving as a triangular wave across columns 2\u20135:\n    - Expected column of the `1` by row (r = 2..26):  \n      `2,3,4,5,4,3,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,3,4,5,4,3,2`\n\nCompare with actual panel entries:\n\n- In every row except one, there is a **single** `1` at the expected column.\n- **Row 12** (global row index 12) has two `1`s: at panel column 2 and panel column 4:\n  - Original row 12, columns 8\u201313: `3,1,8,1,8,3`\n  - Expected (from the wave): only column 4 should be 1; column 2 should be 8.\n- So the cell at **(row 12, column 9)** (0-based column index; panel column 2) is a defect: `1` should be `8`.\n\n**Fix 1:** row 12 col 9: `1 \u2192 8`.\n\n#### Panel 1 (columns 1\u20136, special color 2)\n\nPanel 1 grid (rows 1\u201327):\n\nTypical rows are either:\n- `3,8,8,8,8,3` (no 2\u2019s in the middle rows of that vertical period), or\n- `3,8,2,2,8,3` (two adjacent 2\u2019s forming a vertical stripe).\n\nLook at columns 3 and 4 across rows:\n- Column 3 pattern from rows 2\u201326: `8,2,2,8,2,2,8,2,2,...`\n- Column 4 pattern from rows 2\u201326: exactly the same `8,2,2,8,2,2,...`\n\nCheck for breaks:\n- Every row matches this 3\u2011step pattern except **row 24** (global index 24) in column 3:\n  - Original panel row 24, cols 1\u20136: `3,8,8,2,8,3`\n  - Pattern says column 3 at that row should be `2`, not `8`.\n\nSo:\n\n**Fix 2:** row 24 col 3: `8 \u2192 2`.\n\n#### Panel 3 (columns 15\u201320, special color 4)\n\nPanel 3 grid (rows 1\u201327, cols 15\u201320):\n\n- Column 15 and 20: always 3 (inner framing) \u2013 no anomalies.\n- Column 16: periodic pattern `4,4,8` repeated (8 appears exactly on rows 4,8,12,16,20,24); current data already fits this.\n- Column 18: perfect alternation `8,4,8,4,...`; no defects.\n- Column 19: repeating pattern: one `8` followed by three `4`s; no defects.\n\nThe only irregularities occur in **column 17**:\n\nColumn 17 values by row (1\u201327) as read from the input:\n\n- r1: 3 (border-adjacent, special)\n- r2: 4\n- r3: 4\n- r4: 8\n- r5: 4\n- r6: 8\n- r7: 4\n- r8: 8\n- r9: 4\n- r10: 8\n- r11: 4\n- r12: 8\n- r13: 8\n- r14: 8\n- r15: 4\n- r16: 8\n- r17: 4\n- r18: 8\n- r19: 4\n- r20: 8\n- r21: 4\n- r22: 8\n- r23: 8\n- r24: 8\n- r25: 4\n- r26: 8\n- r27: 3\n\nFrom row 3 downward, the intended pattern is a strict alternation:\n\n`4,8,4,8,4,8,4,8,4,8,4,8,4,8,4,8,4,8,4,8,4,8,4,8` (rows 3\u201326)\n\nComparing:\n- At **row 13** and **row 23**, column 17 is `8` where the alternation demands `4`:\n  - Row 13, panel 3: `3,4,8,4,4,3` \u2192 should be `3,4,4,4,4,3`.\n  - Row 23, panel 3: `3,4,8,4,4,3` \u2192 should be `3,4,4,4,4,3`.\n\nSo:\n\n**Fix 3:** row 13 col 17: `8 \u2192 4`.  \n**Fix 4:** row 23 col 17: `8 \u2192 4`.\n\n#### Panel 4 (columns 22\u201327, special color 9)\n\nPanel 4 grid exhibits three \u201crow types\u201d inside rows 2\u201326:\n- Type 0: `[3,8,8,8,8,3]` (no 9\u2019s)\n- Type 1: `[3,8,9,8,8,3]` (single 9 at col 24)\n- Type 2: `[3,8,9,9,8,3]` (two 9\u2019s at cols 24\u201325)\n\nThe sequence of row types is periodic starting at row 4:\n\n`2,1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0` (rows 4\u201326)\n\nCompare with the input types:\n- They match everywhere except at **row 25**, which is Type 2 instead of the expected Type 1:\n  - Original row 25, P4: `[3,8,9,9,8,3]`\n  - It should be `[3,8,9,8,8,3]` (only one 9 in that row).\n\nSo:\n\n**Fix 5:** row 25 col 25: `9 \u2192 8`.\n\nAll other cells in all panels fit their respective periodic vertical patterns, so no further changes are made.\n\n### 4. Final output grid\n\nApplying only the five corrections above, the completed output grid is:\n\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,1,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,4,3,8,3,8,9,9,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,1,8,3,8,3,4,8,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,2,2,8,3,8,3,8,1,8,8,3,8,3,4,4,4,4,3,8,3,8,9,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,1,8,8,8,3,8,3,4,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8\n      8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n</CANDIDATES>\n\n<INSTRUCTIONS>\nYou must behave as an AUDITOR, not a solver.\n\nYour overall goal:\n- For each candidate, choose a representative explanation and treat it as that\n  candidate's proposed rule.\n- Audit that rule against all training examples.\n- Check whether the candidate's predicted test OUTPUT_GRID actually follows\n  that rule.\n- Assign each candidate a score from 0 to 10 and rank all candidates.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\nSTEP 1 -- CHOOSE A REPRESENTATIVE RULE PER CANDIDATE\nFor each CANDIDATE:\n\n  1.

                "response": "**Initial Assessment: Auditing ARC Candidate Solutions**\n\nOkay, I'm diving into this ARC task, analyzing candidate solutions. The goal is to spot repeating patterns within grids and fix any local errors. We've got two training examples to guide us: one with a simple border and an internal pattern, and another with multiple regions and more complex rules. I'm focusing on the test input, a 29x29 grid with an outer 8 border and internal dividers.\n\n**Detailed Analysis of the Test Input**\n\nThe test input is broken down into four vertical panels. I'm carefully analyzing each one:\n\n*   **Panel 1:** It's got a simple repeating pattern of 8s and 2s, but there's a clear error in one row. I need to fix it by changing an 8 to a 2.\n*   **Panel 2:** There's a diagonal \"1\" moving in a zig-zag pattern. I need to figure out its cyclical positions and correct an out-of-place 1.\n*   **Panel 3:** This one's a bit trickier, with a pattern involving 4s and 8s, and a clear even/odd structure. There seem to be multiple errors in this panel. I've identified several cells that need correction.\n*   **Panel 4:** This involves repeating groups of 9s. I'm carefully examining the sequence of rows to understand it and I suspect there is one or two errors here.\n\n**Candidate Solutions Evaluation**\n\nI'm now going through the candidates to see if they've spotted the same errors and proposed sensible fixes. I'm making sure they are consistent.\n\n**Candidate Review and Refinement**\n\nSome candidates correctly identify the P1 error, P2 errors, and P3 errors. I've also identified multiple P4 errors. Others jump to overbroad generalizations. I'm evaluating them, comparing each cell.\n\nI'm checking if the candidates' outputs make sense. Some might have hallucinated input. Others have applied specific rewrite rules that replace a whole section.\n\nI need to find the correct number of errors and cells to change in this set of candidate solutions. I'm carefully going through candidates now and identifying the best fit.\n\n**Final Decision and Ranking**\n\nMy final check is on each candidate output, comparing to all the errors. After careful review, Candidate 8 seems to consistently identify the key errors and propose reasonable fixes without overreaching, or at least, interpreting ambiguous portions correctly.\n\n\nThe candidates have been audited.\n\n**Candidate 8** provides the most robust solution. It correctly identifies the four vertical panels and their respective repeating patterns. Crucially, it identifies and corrects specific single-cell errors in Panel 1 (Row 24), Panel 2 (Rows 12, 23), and Panel 3 (Rows 2, 13, 23) that other candidates miss (especially P3 Row 2). In Panel 4, it identifies Row 25 as an error, which is consistent with the pattern break. It also \"fixes\" Row 3 in Panel 4; while the necessity of this fix is debatable due to the complex phase of that panel, the candidate's consistent logic and comprehensive error detection in other panels make it the strongest submission.\n\n**Candidate 0** and **Candidate 14** performed well but missed the error in Panel 3 Row 2 (`4,4,8,8` should be `4,8,8,8`).\n\n**Candidate 19** and **Candidate 11** also missed specific errors (like P3 R2) or had slightly less complete pattern models.\n\n**Candidate 9** missed the error in Panel 4 Row 25.\n\n**Candidate 6**, **Candidate 17**, and **Candidate 18** proposed \"rewrite\" strategies that replaced large chunks of valid data (e.g., Rows 17-22 in Panel 3) to enforce a rigid pattern, likely destroying intended variation or phase shifts.\n\n**Candidate 1**, **Candidate 2**, and **Candidate 7** failed to produce a valid transformed grid (Output = Input or degenerate).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 8,\n      \"score\": 9.5,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Correctly identifies the strategy of repairing local pattern violations within bordered regions.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Identifies 4 vertical panels with unique repeating patterns (period 3, period 6 zigzag, period 4 alternating, period 4 wave).
