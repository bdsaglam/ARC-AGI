        "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's how I see the solution to this ARC task. I am confident in this approach.**\n\n**Analysis:** I'm given three examples and a test input, all 2D grids of numbers representing colors. The goal is to figure out the rule that transforms the input and apply it to the test input. I need a detailed explanation and the completed output grid.\n\n**Review of Examples:** I meticulously went through the provided examples, looking for patterns.\n\n*   **Example 1:** At first, I was confused, but I realized each color had a small \"source\" shape, often a connected L-shape in a corner, and a single \"target\" pixel of the same color. The output seemed like diagonal lines shooting from the sources to their targets, but they didn't stop at the targets; they \"bounced\" off an invisible line (actually the target's column) and continued. This \"bounce\" was crucial.\n\n*   **Example 2:** Things got more complicated with similar shapes of the same color. There was still a sense of \"sources\" and \"targets\" that were the same colors, but here they were shapes with more than one pixel. The goal was clearly to connect the shapes. The \"bounce\" rule still applied. In this case, two shapes create diagonal lines that meet in the middle and cross.\n\n*   **Example 3:** This example introduced color changes! The source and target colors were different. The core rule, a beam of color travels to reflect off of a \"mirror,\" became clearer: the beams are now color-specific and would transfer colors depending on source and mirror. The color transfer seems to occur when the beam reaches the target's column or in the space defined by the boundary of the shape. I observed the pattern of how the colors would change in between.\n\n**Hypothesis Formation:** I refined my understanding of the fundamental rule:\n\n1.  Identify \"Source\" Shapes and \"Target\" Locations.\n2.  Cast a diagonal beam from the tip of the source, usually at the \"inner\" corner.\n3.  The beam travels diagonally until it meets an implicit \"mirror\" coordinate (a column or row matching the target).\n4.  At the mirror, the beam bounces at a 90-degree angle; the bounce direction depends on whether the coordinate being met is a row or a column and whether the move direction is up or down.\n5.  In some cases (Example 3), the beam changes color upon hitting a target shape (not a single pixel). The color change is based on the target itself.\n\n**Applying the Rule to the Test Input:** Now, I'm ready to tackle the test input.\n\n*   I saw four corner L-shapes: two orange, two pink, and two central vertical lines (that look like target shapes).\n*   The logic is clear: Each corner shoots a diagonal beam to hit the inner tip of a central vertical line.\n*   The beam reflects in some sense. What I saw in the example pattern helped to derive the rule. The beams are extended along the targets: They go to touch, fill, and extend the central lines. The diagonal beams and the vertical segments are all based on source-target structure and geometry.\n*   Colors need to align. Since the corners are symmetric, it's clear: top right and bottom left are one color, and bottom right and top left are another.\n*   The central sections connect and the colors get assigned during the process of building the shapes.\n\n**Output Grid Creation:** I'll apply the transformation rule:\n\n1.  Draw diagonal lines connecting each corner tip to the nearest point on the central vertical lines.\n2.  The diagonals will be filled with the color from their source.\n3.  Fill the gap in between central objects with extensions of the target pixels.\n4.  My output grid matches this pattern.\n\nI checked for inconsistencies:\n* Are the diagonal lines correct?\n* Are the reflections correct?\n* Do any colours intersect?\n\nThis is how I will complete the ARC task, I have provided a complete plan and the method to create the image is now well-established.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to identify a transformation rule based on three solved examples and apply it to a test input.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n*   **Example 1:** Diagonal beams are projected from \"source\" shapes (small L-shapes in the corners) towards \"target\" points (single pixels). The beams travel in a diagonal line (e.g., down-right). When a beam aligns with the column of a target, it \"bounces\" or reflects vertically (e.g., changes from down-right to down-left). The color of the beam matches the source.\n*   **Example 2:** Similar to Example 1, but targets are larger shapes. The transformation involves connecting shapes with diagonal lines, and likely filling the path between them.\n*   **Example 3:** Shows different colored sources and targets connecting. The key insight is connecting geometrically aligned features with diagonal paths.\n\n**Analysis of Test Input:**\n*   **Input Grid Size:** 20 rows x 19 columns.\n*   **Corner Objects (Sources):**\n    *   **Top-Left (TL):** Orange (7) L-shape at `(0,1), (1,0), (1,1)`. The \"tip\" pointing inward is at `(1,1)`.\n    *   **Top-Right (TR):** Pink (6) L-shape at `(0,17), (1,17), (1,18)`. The tip is at `(1,17)`.\n    *   **Bottom-Left (BL):** Pink (6) L-shape at `(18,0), (18,1), (19,1)`. The tip is at `(18,1)`.\n    *   **Bottom-Right (BR):** Orange (7) L-shape at `(18,18), (18,17), (19,17)`. The tip is at `(18,17)`.\n*   **Central Objects (Targets):**\n    *   Two vertical lines at Column 8 and Column 10.\n    *   **Top Pair (Rows 6-8):** Orange (7) at Col 8, Pink (6) at Col 10.\n    *   **Bottom Pair (Rows 11-13):** Pink (6) at Col 8, Orange (7) at Col 10.\n\n**Transformation Logic:**\n1.  **Diagonal Connections:** Shoot diagonal beams from the \"tips\" of the corner sources towards the central vertical lines.\n    *   **TL Orange (7):** From `(1,1)` shoot Down-Right `(1,1)`. The path hits the bottom of the top-left central block at `(8,8)`.\n        *   Path pixels: `(2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6), (7,7)`. Color: 7.\n    *   **TR Pink (6):** From `(1,17)` shoot Down-Left `(1, -1)`. The path hits the bottom of the top-right central block at `(8,10)`.\n        *   Path pixels: `(2,16), (3,15), (4,14), (5,13), (6,12), (7,11)`. Color: 6.\n    *   **BL Pink (6):** From `(18,1)` shoot Up-Right `(-1, 1)`. The path hits the top of the bottom-left central block at `(11,8)`.\n        *   Path pixels: `(17,2), (16,3), (15,4), (14,5), (13,6), (12,7)`. Color: 6.\n    *   **BR Orange (7):** From `(18,17)` shoot Up-Left `(-1, -1)`. The path hits the top of the bottom-right central block at `(11,10)`.\n        *   Path pixels: `(17,16), (16,15), (15,14), (14,13), (13,12), (12,11)`. Color: 7.\n\n2.  **Central Gap Filling:** There is a vertical gap between the top central blocks (ending at row 8) and bottom central blocks (starting at row 11). The gap consists of rows 9 and 10.\n    *   **Column 8:** The top block is Orange (7), the bottom block is Pink (6). The gap pixels `(9,8)` and `(10,8)` connect them. The fill color extends from the nearest block: `(9,8)` takes 7, `(10,8)` takes 6.\n    *   **Column 10:** The top block is Pink (6), the bottom block is Orange (7). The gap pixels `(9,10)` and `(10,10)` connect them. The fill color extends from the nearest block: `(9,10)` takes 6, `(10,10)` takes 7.\n\n**Final Steps:**\nCombine the original input with the four calculated diagonal paths and the four central gap-fill pixels.\n\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0\n7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**High\u2011level description of the rule I inferred**\n\nFrom the three training pairs, I focused on how new colored pixels are added in the outputs:\n\n- New pixels are always in 45\u00b0 diagonals (either down\u2011right or down\u2011left).\n- Original colored pixels are never overwritten.\n- For each color, there is at least one long, straight diagonal \u201cray\u201d starting from one of that color\u2019s extreme occurrences (usually near a corner/edge) and running across the grid, stopping at the boundary.\n- Different colors can have their diagonal rays cross; in such cases, one color simply occupies the empty cell first, and the other color does not overwrite it.\n\nFor the **test input**, there are only two colors: **7** and **6**. Each of them has a cluster near one top corner:\n\n- Color 7 near the **top\u2011left**: at (row 1, col 2) and (row 2, cols 1\u20132).\n- Color 6 near the **top\u2011right**: at (row 1, col 18) and (row 2, cols 18\u201319).\n\nSo I apply this simplified pattern:\n\n- For color **7**, start a 45\u00b0 **down\u2011right** diagonal ray from the top\u2011left occurrence (1,2), continuing as far as possible:  \n  (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), \u2026, up to the last valid cell before leaving the grid.\n- For color **6**, start a 45\u00b0 **down\u2011left** diagonal ray from the top\u2011right occurrence (1,18), continuing as far as possible:  \n  (1,18), (2,17), (3,16), \u2026, up to the last valid cell before leaving the grid.\n\nWhen drawing these rays:\n\n- If a target cell is 0, paint it with the ray\u2019s color.\n- If a target cell is already non\u2011zero (from the input or from another ray), leave it as is (no overwriting).\n\nThen I keep all original 6s and 7s unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### Step\u2011by\u2011step application to the test grid\n\nThe test grid is 20 rows \u00d7 19 columns.\n\n**Diagonal ray for 7** (down\u2011right from (1,2)):\n\nPositions:\n- (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,7),\n- (7,8), (8,9), (9,10), (10,11), (11,12),\n- (12,13), (13,14), (14,15), (15,16), (16,17),\n- (17,18), (18,19).  \n\nColor those positions with 7 if currently 0.\n\n**Diagonal ray for 6** (down\u2011left from (1,18)):\n\nPositions:\n- (1,18), (2,17), (3,16), (4,15), (5,14), (6,13),\n- (7,12), (8,11), (9,10), (10,9), (11,8),\n- (12,7), (13,6), (14,5), (15,4), (16,3),\n- (17,2), (18,1).  \n\nColor those positions with 6 if currently 0.\n\nI then overlay these rays on the original test input, without changing any existing non\u2011zero cells.\n\n---\n\n### Final output grid\n\nRow by row, after adding the two diagonals and preserving the original colors:\n\n1.

Row7 originally had 7 at (7,9) and 6 at (7,11); add 7 at (7,8) and 6 at (7,12):\n   - `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\n8. Row8 originally had 7 at (8,9) and 6 at (8,11); those are exactly on the two diagonals, so no change:\n   - `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\n9. Row9 originally had 7 at (9,9) and 6 at (9,11); both diagonals hit (9,10), but 7 is drawn first and we avoid overwriting, so (9,10) becomes 7:\n   - `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\n10. Row10 gets 6 at (10,9) and 7 at (10,11):\n    - `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\n11. Row11 gets 6 at (11,8) and 7 at (11,12):\n    - `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\n12. Row12 originally had 6 at (12,9) and 7 at (12,11); add 6 at (12,7) and 7 at (12,13):\n    - `0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0`\n\n13. Row13 originally had 6 at (13,9) and 7 at (13,11); add 6 at (13,6) and 7 at (13,14):\n    - `0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0`\n\n14. Row14 originally had 6 at (14,9) and 7 at (14,11); add 6 at (14,5) and 7 at (14,15):\n    - `0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0`\n\n15. Row15 gets 6 at (15,4) and 7 at (15,16):\n    - `0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0`\n\n16. Row16 gets 6 at (16,3) and 7 at (16,17):\n    - `0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0`\n\n17. Row17 gets 6 at (17,2) and 7 at (17,18):\n    - `0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0`\n\n18. Row18 gets 6 at (18,1) and 7 at (18,19):\n    - `6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7`\n\n19. Row19 remains as in input (no diagonal hits beyond row18):\n    - `6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7`\n\n20. Row20 remains as in input:\n    - `0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0`\n\n---\n\n### Completed output grid\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n```\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0\n7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7\n6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "First, here is the high\u2011level pattern I inferred from the three training examples, and then how I applied it to the test case.\n\n---\n\n## Inferred transformation (informal description)\n\nFrom the examples, the transformation seems to:\n\n1. **Preserve all non-zero cells from the input.**\n2. **Identify connected components of each color.**\n3. **For each color, and for each pair of successive components (in vertical order), draw a diagonal \u201cbridge\u201d of that color from one component towards the next one.**\n   - Choose a *representative anchor* cell in the source component (I always took the \u201clowest\u201d cell in that component, i.e., with the largest row index).\n   - Look at the next component for the same color (the one whose topmost row is below the current component).\n   - From the anchor cell, step diagonally downwards one row at a time:\n     - If the next component is mostly to the right, step down-right (row+1, col+1).\n     - If it is mostly to the left, step down-left (row+1, col\u22121).\n   - Keep stepping until the row index reaches the top row of the target component (or, in cases with no clear matching component, until the row where the next object of that color or the border lies).\n   - Only paint along this diagonal where cells are currently zero; if a step would land on a non-zero cell (from any color), stop that bridge before overwriting.\n\nThis rule matches the idea seen in the examples:\n- Example 3: 4 bridges down-right until it\u2019s on the same row as the 1\u2011cluster, then 1 bridges down-left until it\u2019s on the same row as the 7\u2011cluster, etc.\n- Example 1/2: each color\u2019s separated components get connected by diagonal runs.\n\nI then applied a consistent version of that rule to the test grid.\n\n---\n\n## Applying the rule to the test input\n\n### 1. Original non-zero structure\n\nColors present: 7 and 6.\n\nCoordinates (row, col), 0\u2011indexed:\n\n- Color 7 components:\n  - A: top-left L-shape: (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)\n  - B: upper-middle vertical: (6,8), (7,8), (8,8)\n  - C: lower-middle vertical (right): (11,10), (12,10), (13,10)\n  - D: bottom-right L-shape: (18,17), (18,18), (19,17)\n\n- Color 6 components:\n  - A6: top-right L-shape: (0,17), (1,17), (1,18)\n  - B6: upper-middle vertical (right): (6,10), (7,10), (8,10)\n  - C6: lower-middle vertical (left): (11,8), (12,8), (13,8)\n  - D6: bottom-left L-shape: (18,0), (18,1), (19,1)\n\n### 2. Diagonal bridges for color 7\n\nSorted by top row: A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D.\n\nI chose these anchors:\n- A anchor: (1,1)  (the lower of the TL L-shape)\n- B anchor: (8,8)\n- C anchor: (13,10)\n\n**Bridge A \u2192 B (towards B\u2019s top row = 6, B is to the right):**\n- Direction: down-right.\n- From (1,1), step until row = 6 (inclusive):\n  - (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6)\n- All those cells are zero in the input, so they become 7.\n\n**Bridge B \u2192 C (towards C\u2019s top row = 11, C is to the right of B):**\n- Direction: down-right.\n- From (8,8) to row 11:\n  - (9,9), (10,10), (11,11)\n- All zero in the input, so they become 7 (note that (11,10) was already 7, we add (11,11)).\n\n**Bridge C \u2192 D (towards D\u2019s top row = 18, D is to the right of C):**\n- Direction: down-right.\n- From (13,10) to row 18:\n  - (14,11), (15,12), (16,13), (17,14), (18,15)\n- All zero in the input, so they become 7 (D\u2019s own cells at (18,17), (18,18), (19,17) are kept as is).\n\n### 3. Diagonal bridges for color 6\n\nSorted by top row: A6 \u2192 B6 \u2192 C6 \u2192 D6.\n\nAnchors:\n- A6 anchor: (1,17)\n- B6 anchor: (8,10)\n- C6 anchor: (13,8)\n\n**Bridge A6 \u2192 B6 (towards B6\u2019s top row = 6, B6 is to the left):**\n- Direction: down-left.\n- From (1,17) to row 6:\n  - (2,16), (3,15), (4,14), (5,13), (6,12)\n- All zero in the input, so they become 6.\n\n**Bridge B6 \u2192 C6 (towards C6\u2019s top row = 11, C6 is to the left):**\n- Direction: down-left.\n- From (8,10):\n  - Next step (9,9) \u2014 but this cell was already set to 7 by the 7-bridge B\u2192C.\n  - According to the \u201cno overwrite\u201d rule, we stop here and do not paint (9,9) or any further steps for this bridge.\n\n**Bridge C6 \u2192 D6 (towards D6\u2019s top row = 18, D6 is to the left):**\n- Direction: down-left.\n- From (13,8) to row 18:\n  - (14,7), (15,6), (16,5), (17,4), (18,3)\n- All zero in the current grid, so they become 6.\n\nNo overwriting occurs; original 6\u2019s and 7\u2019s are preserved, and new 6/7 diagonals are added only in previously zero cells.\n\n---\n\n## Final output grid\n\nPutting all this together, the final 20\u00d719 grid is:\n\nRow 0:  \n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0\n\nRow 1:  \n7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n\nRow 2:  \n0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n\nRow 3:  \n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n\nRow 4:  \n0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 5:  \n0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 6:  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 7:  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 8:  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 9:  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 10:  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 11:  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 12:  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 13:  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 14:  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 15:  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 16:  \n0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 17:  \n0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 18:  \n6,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,7\n\nRow 19:  \n0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Implementation Strategy for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I'm given some input grids and need to generate an output based on observed patterns. My initial thought process involves breaking down the problem by examining the provided examples and test input. My main approach is to identify recurring transformations.\n\n**Initial Observations and Hypothesis Generation**\n\nI started by looking at the first example and noticing how shapes (clusters of non-zero pixels with a specific color) in the input seemed to \"move\" in the output. The pixels of a shape often created trails or lines. I then attempted to trace the trajectories of these shapes. The shape positions in example 1 gave an interesting view, almost creating paths.\n\n*   **Example 1**: The initial observation was diagonal motion, with the initial \"source\" pixels generating diagonal trails leading to specific \"target\" pixels in the grid.\n*   **Hypothesis 1**: Draw a diagonal line or \"beam\" from the shapes, extending until the edge of the grid or hitting a \"target\" pixel of the same color.\n*   The second and third examples made me rethink that there are any \"targets\".\n\n**Refining the Theory and Identifying Key Elements**\n\nExample 2 showed more complex interactions, making the \"target\" pixel hypothesis less likely. Also, Example 3 has no targets. This lead to a more abstract concept of motion and diagonal beams.\n\n*   **Key Idea**: Shapes emit beams diagonally. How do we determine the exact diagonal, direction and length?\n*   **Example 3**: Introduced the idea that the beams could go to the edge of the grid or simply extend based on the shape's position relative to the grid borders, maybe moving towards the center? Or a \"reflection\" pattern?\n\n**Test Input Analysis and Algorithm Development**\n\nThe test input solidified the idea that corner shapes project diagonal beams inwards (i.e., towards the center of the grid, or opposite to the corners).\n\n*   Test Input: Contains corner shapes.\n*   Shapes on corners point towards: the center.\n\nBased on this, I formed a comprehensive plan:\n1.  Read the input grid.\n2.  Define Source Shapes.\n3.  Draw Beams: For each pixel of a source shape, extend a beam diagonally towards.\n4.  Implement collision rules (I'll draw the beams and if there are collisions, the second beam drawn wins).\n5.  Generate the output grid.\n\nI need to handle boundary conditions (beams extending to the edge of the grid) and potential collisions between beams (which I arbitrarily resolved in favor of the second beam drawn). I had to be extremely careful with indices to avoid mistakes during beam generation.\n\nFinally, the whole process boils down to the creation of the diagonals.\n\nTo solve this task, we analyze the transformation rules from the solved examples and apply them to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Example 1:** Several clusters of colored pixels (shapes) appear on the left side of the grid. Single pixels of the corresponding colors appear on the right side. The transformation draws a diagonal line from each pixel of the source shape towards the target area. Specifically, the trails follow a (+1, +1) direction (down-right). The lines connect the source shapes to the target pixels.\n2.  **Example 2:** We see shapes at the top/bottom and corners. The output shows diagonal trails connecting them. Specifically, the 6s at the corners form a large X pattern connecting Top-Right to Bottom-Left and Top-Left to Bottom-Right (though here 6s are only TR and BL in input, and 2s/4s/5s connect their respective pairs). The rule appears to be that shapes emit diagonal beams.\n3.  **Example 3:** Single clusters of pixels emit diagonal beams. Top-Left shapes emit (+1, +1). Top-Right shapes (implied) would emit (+1, -1). Bottom-Right shapes emit (-1, -1) and Bottom-Left emit (-1, +1). Basically, shapes in the corners/edges shoot beams \"inwards\" or across the grid at 45-degree angles.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\nThe test input has:\n-   A **7s shape** in the Top-Left corner: `(0,1), (1,0), (1,1)`.\n-   A **6s shape** in the Top-Right corner: `(0,17), (1,17), (1,18)`.\n-   Clusters of 7s and 6s in the middle of the grid and at the bottom corners.\n\nBased on the logic inferred:\n1.  The **Top-Left 7s** will emit a diagonal beam in the **(+1, +1)** direction (Down-Right).\n2.  The **Top-Right 6s** will emit a diagonal beam in the **(+1, -1)** direction (Down-Left).\n3.  These beams will travel across the grid. Where they encounter existing non-zero pixels (like the middle blocks or bottom corners), they align with them (matches observed in analysis). Where they cross empty space, they fill it.\n4.  **Collision Rule:** At the intersection of the two beams (around rows 8-10), we must decide which color prevails. In Example 2, the intersection of the X was clean. Given no specific precedence rule, and the reading order (Left-to-Right), we will assume the 6s (magenta) might overwrite the 7s (orange) or vice versa. However, looking at the layout, the 6s and 7s cross. A common pattern in such tasks is that the \"later\" drawn object (or the one moving leftwards) might appear on top, or they just pass through. I will apply the rule that **6s overwrite 7s** at the intersection, as this results in a symmetric crossing where the \"front\" visible beam segments are maintained.\n\n**Transformation Steps:**\n1.  Start with the original input grid.\n2.  **Draw 7s:** For every pixel `(r, c)` in the Top-Left 7-shape, calculate `(r+k, c+k)` for `k >= 1`. If the position is within the grid, set the color to 7. (Do not overwrite non-zero pixels from the original input).\n3.  **Draw 6s:** For every pixel `(r, c)` in the Top-Right 6-shape, calculate `(r+k, c-k)` for `k >= 1`. If the position is within the grid, set the color to 6. This **overwrites** the 7s trail at the intersection points to create a clean crossing.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n-   **Row 0, 1:** Original shapes.\n-   **Rows 2-5:** Trails extend. 7s at `(k, 1+k), (k+1, k), (k+1, 1+k)`. 6s at `(k, 17-k), (k+1, 17-k), (k+1, 18-k)`.\n-   **Rows 6-8:** Trails merge with Middle Top blocks.\n    -   Row 8 Collision: `(8,9)` becomes 6 (Intersection of `(1,0)->(8,7)` is 7? No, `(1,0)->(9,8)`).\n    -   Let's trace Row 9 specifically:\n        -   7s from `(1,0)` -> `(9,8)`.\n        -   7s from `(1,1)` -> `(9,9)`.\n        -   7s from `(0,1)` -> `(9,10)`.\n        -   6s from `(0,17)` -> `(9,8)`.\n        -   6s from `(1,17)` -> `(9,9)`.\n        -   6s from `(1,18)` -> `(9,10)`.\n        -   **Result:** Row 9 positions 8, 9, 10 become 6 (Overwrite).\n-   **Rows 10:** Collision at `(10,9)`. Becomes 6.\n-   **Rows 11-13:** Trails merge with Middle Bottom blocks.\n-   **Rows 14-17:** Trails continue.\n-   **Rows 18-19:** Trails merge with Bottom corners.\n\n```\n0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0\n7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0\n0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0\n0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,7,0,6,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,7,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,6,0,7,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0\n0,0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0\n0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7\n6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7\n6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n```",
