Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, here's my breakdown of this ARC task.**\n\nThe goal is to analyze a set of input/output image pairs, figure out a transformation rule, and then apply it to a new input image. The images are essentially grids with a vertical separator and patterns on one side. The key is that the output seems strongly related to the right-hand side of the input, and particularly the position of a special marker pixel ('5') in the right section. The main task seems to be to manipulate the left side of the input (patterns) into the correct output while taking into account this special marker.\n\nI started by observing some key features. The images have varying heights but a consistent width for both the input and output. The left side of the input contains blocks. The '5' marker's horizontal position seems to determine a key starting column on the right output (or perhaps an anchor point). The right side of the output is 7 pixels wide and seems to correlate with the right-hand part of the input.\n\nMy next step was to analyze the repeating elements on the left side of the input images, or rather, the blocks. I soon recognized that the left side comprises 3x3 blocks, forming shapes. I noticed that each of these 3x3 pixel blocks has unique \"shapes\" that map to different dimensions in the output and different input/output positions, and also have different shapes based on unique 3x3 bitmaps. Some have holes, some are solid, and some are branched, and I need to figure out their implications.\n\nBy analyzing the output grids, I saw these shapes translate into different configurations of colored blocks. I started mapping these shapes and their color (which seemed irrelevant) to the width and height of these resulting blocks, and their left/right position. I realized that the output isn't simply a one-to-one pixel mapping but a more abstract transformation of the patterns on the left side. It's not just pixel-for-pixel translation, which made things more interesting.\n\nThrough further analysis, I began to see a consistent logic. I hypothesized that each shape (block in the input) has an \"entry\" point and an \"exit\" point, and the '5' marker and its position define the initial \"cursor\" of where we start placing blocks. As I went through the examples, it seemed that the horizontal positions of these shapes matter. By analyzing a series of example outputs, I realized the output can be modeled as a sequence. Each 3x3 block on the left \"pushes\" elements into the right side one at a time. The shapes and their features seemed to control how each bar of color will be constructed and where it will go.\n\nThe critical insight was a parameter that I named $L_{in}$, which defines the \"input-pin\" (entry position), which orients each bar. Similarly, $L_{out}$ defines the \"output-pin\", and therefore where the next bar will begin to be placed relative to $X$, the current position in the output. These parameters, width and height of the generated blocks, and $X_{initial}$, are the main elements I needed to extract from the examples and test images.\n\nSo, in summary, I now have a solid framework. I am confident that I can use this framework with all required images for this task, so let's get generating the results!\n\n\nThe task involves transforming a sequence of 3x3 pattern blocks from the left side of the input grid into a stacked structure in the output grid (which corresponds to the right side of the input).\n\n**Reasoning Process:**\n\n1.  **Input Parsing**:\n    *   **Right Side Marker**: In the right section of the input (columns 8-14), there is a single pixel of color 5 in the first row. Its column index relative to the start of the right section (column 8) determines the starting horizontal position ($X_{start}$) for the output construction.\n        *   In the Test Input, the '5' is at column index 10. Relative to column 8, $X_{start} = 10 - 8 = 2$.\n    *   **Left Side Blocks**: The left section (columns 0-6) contains 3x3 pattern blocks arranged in two columns (Left: cols 0-2, Right: cols 4-6) and multiple rows (starts at 0, 4, 8, etc.).\n    *   **Processing Order**: The blocks are processed in a specific sequence: all blocks from the **Left Column** (top to bottom), followed by all blocks from the **Right Column** (top to bottom).\n\n2.  **Block Logic & Transformation**:\n    *   Each 3x3 block shape corresponds to a specific output object with defined Width ($W$), Height ($H$), Entry Offset ($L_{in}$), and Exit Offset ($L_{out}$).\n    *   The \"Current Cursor\" $X$ starts at $X_{start}$. For each block:\n        *   **Position**: The block is placed horizontally such that its Entry Offset aligns with the Current Cursor. $Position = X - L_{in}$.\n        *   **Draw**: The block is drawn on the output grid at the calculated position with its specific width and height.\n        *   **Update**: The cursor moves to the block's Exit position. $X_{new} = Position + L_{out}$.\n        *   The vertical position advances by the block's height.\n\n3.  **Shape Parameters (Inferred from Examples)**:\n    *   **Shape S1 (Color 1)**: $W=3, H=1$. $L_{in}=0, L_{out}=2$. (Shift +2)\n    *   **Shape U (Color 2)**: $W=2, H=1$. $L_{in}=1, L_{out}=0$. (Shift -1)\n    *   **Shape Y (Color 6)**: $W=1, H=2$. $L_{in}=0, L_{out}=0$. (Shift 0)\n    *   **Shape S3 (Color 3)**: $W=4, H=1$. Based on Example 1's Color 3 block, $L_{in}=3, L_{out}=0$. (Shift -3)\n\n4.  **Applying to Test Input**:\n    *   **Initial State**: $X=2$, Row=1.\n    *   **Sequence**:\n        1.  **Left (0,0) - S1 (1)**: $X=2 \\to Pos=2$ (Cols 2-4). $X_{new}=4$. Row 1.\n        2.  **Left (4,0) - U (2)**: $X=4 \\to Pos=3$ (Cols 3-4). $X_{new}=3$. Row 2.\n        3.  **Left (8,0) - Y (6)**: $X=3 \\to Pos=3$ (Col 3). $X_{new}=3$. Rows 3-4.\n        4.  **Left (12,0) - S3 (3)**: $X=3 \\to Pos=0$ (Cols 0-3). $X_{new}=0$. Row 5.\n        5.  **Left (16,0) - Y (6)**: $X=0 \\to Pos=0$ (Col 0). $X_{new}=0$. Rows 6-7.\n        6.  **Right (0,4) - S1 (1)**: $X=0 \\to Pos=0$ (Cols 0-2). $X_{new}=2$. Row 8.\n        7.  **Right (4,4) - S1 (1)**: $X=2 \\to Pos=2$ (Cols 2-4). $X_{new}=4$. Row 9.\n        8.  **Right (8,4) - Y (6)**: $X=4 \\to Pos=4$ (Col 4). $X_{new}=4$. Rows 10-11.\n        9.  **Right (12,4) - S3 (3)**: $X=4 \\to Pos=1$ (Cols 1-4). $X_{new}=1$. Row 12.\n        10. **Right (16,4) - U (2)**: $X=1 \\to Pos=0$ (Cols 0-1). $X_{new}=0$. Row 13.\n\n    *   Remaining rows (14-18) are filled with 0. Row 0 contains the initial '5' at column 2.\n\n**Final Output Grid Generation:**\n\n0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,1,1,0,0\n0,0,0,2,2,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,0,0,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n1,1,1,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,1,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,3,3,3,3,0,0\n2,2,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Strategy for ARC Task: Image Pattern Translation**\n\nI'm presented with an ARC task where I'm given several solved examples and a test case, and I must figure out the rule. My goal is to transform an input image into a specific output image.\n\n**1. Data Structure and Initial Observations:**\n   - I see that the inputs are consistently 15 pixels wide, while the outputs are always 7 pixels wide. A vertical line (color 4, yellow) divides each input image into a 7-pixel-wide left portion and a 7-pixel-wide right portion. The output images have the same height as the input.\n   - The left side of the input contains shapes created from colored pixels. The dividing line is solid yellow, and the right side is generally black, with a single grey pixel (color 5) at varying positions. The output's content seems related to the patterns on the left side, with some influence from the grey pixel position.\n\n**2. Deep Dive: Decoding the Left and Right Sides:**\n   - On the left, I've noticed 3x3 blocks which are the key to the solution. The right part of input, contains a single grey pixel (5).\n   - This \"grey pixel\" might be a selector.\n\n**3. Pattern Extraction and Representation:**\n   - The key is to map patterns on the left to output representations.\n   - Let's label and analyze the shapes present.\n\n**4. Grey Pixel's Role and Mapping:**\n   - The grey pixel seems to dictate where the patterns are placed in the output.\n   - The output is built by combining these building blocks.\n   - I figured that the grey pixel's *relative* horizontal position within the right section is critical, but I need to link this relative index to a certain part in the output.\n\n**5. Building the Output: Putting it All Together:**\n   - I noticed the output contains shapes whose origin is in the left side. The order of shape generation is very important.\n   - Let's call the building block a \"glyph\". A \"glyph\" is a 3x3 shape, but what about the output's pattern? It seems related, but not a direct copy.\n   - The \"grey pixel's\" horizontal position is significant. Based on the position of that pixel, I need to know the offset value for each shape.\n   - Using examples, I deduced each glyph has a vector to apply to the output.\n\n**6. Solving the Mystery of the Relative Offset and Green A:**\n   - The most difficult part of the task is to deduce the position of the shapes.\n   - The start and the increment are the key. For the start: if the first glyph is blue h or something else: `ref`. If the first is red u, then `ref-1`.\n   - The offset of shapes in the output is highly dependent on the \"current\" and \"next\" shape.\n   - I used a \"rules\" system:\n     - Blue h add +2.\n     - if next is Green T: delta = -3.\n     - if current shape is Mag Y and next shape is Red U, delta is -1. Otherwise, it is 0.\n   - The new shape, Green A should have similar rules to Green T.\n\n**7. Test the Theory:**\n   - I can now work through any input.\n   - I have all the components, and it's time to test them against the Test Input.\n   - I confirmed the position, extraction, pattern, and offset are working.\n\n**8. Final Steps:**\n   - I double-checked the output based on my derived rules.\n   - It all looks correct, and the solution is complete.\n   - In short: I need to determine an order for the 3x3 shapes. The grey pixel has a position to select the shape. Given that and, also, the shapes' type, the position of that shape is generated in the final output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid based on patterns found in the input.\n\n**1. Analysis of Input Structure**\nThe input grid (15x19 for the test case) is divided into two parts by a vertical yellow line (color 4) at column 7.\n*   **Left Side (Cols 0-6):** Contains a series of 3x3 patterned blocks. In the test input, there are 5 blocks in the left column (starting rows 0, 4, 8, 12, 16) and 5 blocks in the right column of this section (cols 4-6, same rows). Note that the \"left side\" itself acts as two columns of 3x3 blocks.\n*   **Right Side (Cols 8-14):** Mostly black, with a single grey pixel (color 5) in the top row. The position of this pixel acts as a reference coordinate.\n\n**2. Decoding the Objects**\nWe extract the sequence of 3x3 blocks from the left side, reading down the first column (cols 0-2) then down the second column (cols 4-6). We identify the shape/color of each block:\n*   **Blue 'h'**: (Color 1) Pattern `110, 101, 010`. Maps to output horizontal bar `1 1 1`.\n*   **Red 'U'**: (Color 2) Pattern `202, 202, 222`. Maps to output horizontal bar `2 2`.\n*   **Magenta 'Y'**: (Color 6) Pattern `606, 060, 060`. Maps to output vertical bar of height 2 (`6` over `6`).\n*   **Green 'A'**: (Color 3) Pattern `333, 030, 303`. Maps to output horizontal bar `3 3 3 3` (inferred from Green 'T' behavior in examples).\n\n**3. Determining Positions**\nThe horizontal position (column index) of each output pattern is determined by a starting reference and a sequence of shifts (deltas) based on the shape transitions.\n*   **Reference (`ref`):** The column index of the grey pixel (5) in the right side. For the test input, `5` is at index 2 (relative to the separator). `ref = 2`.\n*   **Start Position:** Since the first shape is Blue, the start position is `ref` = 2.\n*   **Transition Rules:**\n    *   If the *next* shape is Green, apply **-3**.\n    *   Else if the *current* shape is Blue, apply **+2**.\n    *   Else if the *current* shape is Magenta and *next* is Red, apply **-1**.\n    *   Otherwise, apply **0**.\n\n**4. Applying to Test Input**\nSequence of shapes: L1(Blue), L2(Red), L3(Mag), L4(Green), L5(Mag), R1(Blue), R2(Blue), R3(Mag), R4(Green), R5(Red).\n\n*   **L1 (Blue)**: Start at **2**. Output `1 1 1`.\n    *   *Transition L1->L2*: Current Blue, Next Red. Delta **+2**. New Pos: 4.\n*   **L2 (Red)**: At **4**. Output `2 2`.\n    *   *Transition L2->L3*: Current Red, Next Mag. Delta **0**. New Pos: 4.\n*   **L3 (Mag)**: At **4**. Output `6` (height 2).\n    *   *Transition L3->L4*: Next is Green. Delta **-3**. New Pos: 1.\n*   **L4 (Green)**: At **1**. Output `3 3 3 3`.\n    *   *Transition L4->L5*: Current Green. Delta **0**. New Pos: 1.\n*   **L5 (Mag)**: At **1**. Output `6` (height 2).\n    *   *Transition L5->R1*: Current Mag, Next Blue. Delta **0**. New Pos: 1.\n*   **R1 (Blue)**: At **1**. Output `1 1 1`.\n    *   *Transition R1->R2*: Current Blue, Next Blue. Delta **+2**. New Pos: 3.\n*   **R2 (Blue)**: At **3**. Output `1 1 1`.\n    *   *Transition R2->R3*: Current Blue, Next Mag. Delta **+2**. New Pos: 5.\n*   **R3 (Mag)**: At **5**. Output `6` (height 2).\n    *   *Transition R3->R4*: Next is Green. Delta **-3**. New Pos: 2.\n*   **R4 (Green)**: At **2**. Output `3 3 3 3`.\n    *   *Transition R4->R5*: Current Green. Delta **0**. New Pos: 2.\n*   **R5 (Red)**: At **2**. Output `2 2`.\n\n**5. Constructing the Output Grid**\nThe grid is 7 columns wide. Row 0 contains the reference `5` at index 2. Subsequent rows contain the generated patterns at their calculated positions. Magenta shapes occupy 2 rows; others occupy 1.\n\n0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,1,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,2,2,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,3,3,3,3,0,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,1,1,1,0,0,0\n0,0,0,1,1,1,0\n0,0,0,0,0,6,0\n0,0,0,0,0,6,0\n0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,2,2,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, here's the game plan:** I've got to decode this ARC task.  It's all about taking these input grids and transforming them into a specific output.  I've got three solved examples and a test input to work with.\n\n**The big picture:** Each input is divided, it seems, by a vertical yellow line. The left side has a pattern of shapes and the right side is mostly empty, except for one grey pixel that looks like the starting point. The test input has some additional rows/blocks, which means my understanding should scale up to larger/longer inputs.\n\n**Let's dive into these \"shapes\":**  They seem to be 3x3 grids stacked on top of each other.  I'm seeing familiar shapes in there: red \"U\"s, pink \"Y\"s (or maybe inverted \"T\"s, visually it's a bit unclear, but the provided text data helps), blue \"b\"s, and green \"T\"s.  Crucially, the colours of these shapes seem to be important (2, 6, 1, 3 etc).\n\n**Okay, the lightbulb moment!** It looks like the output is a path that's defined by the shapes on the left side of the input. Each shape has an associated move. The initial grey pixel is always the start.\n\n**Shape = Move.** I'm seeing Red 'U' shapes mean \"Move Left 2\". Green \"T\" means \"Move Left 4\". Blue \"b\" means \"Move Right 3\". And Pink \"Y\" means \"Move Down 2\".  (I can easily verify these moves by visually inspecting the text and examples).\n\n**The key is the order.**  The way I'm thinking about it now is that there are blocks of shapes: each block has a Left and Right shape. The order of the shapes in the input is, Top-Left shape first then Bottom Left shape, then Top-Right shape, then Bottom-Right shape. (This is a simplified way to describe it and it's easily scalable). The output path is constructed by taking each \"shape\" in a specific row-major order: all the left shapes going from the top-most shape downwards, then taking all the right shapes from the top shape to the bottom.\n\n**This is the test:** I'm going to take the test input, apply this logic, and see if the output makes sense.\n\n**Putting it all together:**\n*   Identify the Start Point.\n*   Extract the shapes from the left side of the grid.\n*   Decode each shape into a move (Direction and Length), in Left then Right, Top-to-Bottom, column-major order.\n*   Construct the path from the start point using these move instructions.\n*   The path should have color changes, with each color corresponding to a unique shape in the input, and the total height should match the input height.\n*   The path should be continuous.\n*   Generate the output grid, with the path drawn as a series of connected segments, each segment of the corresponding colour and length. The output grid has the same dimensions as the original input.\n\nWith this logic, I should have a solid solution. Let's see if this works on the Test Input!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform an input grid into an output grid based on a specific set of rules derived from the examples.\n\n**1. Analysis of Input and Output Structure:**\n*   **Input Grid:** The input grid is split into two sections by a vertical yellow line (color 4) at column 7.\n    *   **Left Side (Cols 0-6):** Contains a series of 3x3 colored shapes arranged in two columns (Left and Right). These blocks of shapes are separated by rows of zeros.\n    *   **Right Side (Cols 8-14):** Mostly empty (black/0) but contains a single grey pixel (color 5) in the top row (row 0). This grey pixel represents the starting point of a path.\n*   **Output Grid:** The output is a grid of width 7 (corresponding to the canvas size of the right side of the input). It contains a continuous path starting from the grey pixel's position. The path is made of segments of different colors.\n\n**2. Decoding the Transformation Rules:**\nBy correlating the sequence of shapes on the left side with the path segments in the output, we can deduce the following:\n\n*   **Processing Order:** The shapes are processed in \"Column-Major\" order. We read all shapes in the **Left Column** from top to bottom, and then all shapes in the **Right Column** from top to bottom.\n*   **Shape to Move Mapping:** Each specific shape corresponds to a movement direction and length. The color of the shape matches the color of the path segment.\n    *   **Red 'U' Shape (Color 2):** Move **Left 2** spaces. (Horizontal)\n    *   **Blue 'b' Shape (Color 1):** Move **Right 3** spaces. (Horizontal)\n    *   **Pink 'Y' Shape (Color 6):** Move **Down 2** spaces. (Vertical)\n    *   **Green 'T' Shape (Color 3):** Move **Left 4** spaces. (Horizontal)\n\n*   **Drawing the Path:**\n    *   Start at the grey pixel (5).\n    *   **Horizontal Moves:** Shift down to the next row, then draw the horizontal segment starting from the current column position.\n    *   **Vertical Moves:** continue from the current position downwards for the specified length.\n    *   The path is continuous; each segment starts where the previous one ended.\n\n**3. Applying Rules to Test Input:**\n*   **Start Point:** Grey pixel (5) is at column 10 in input. Relative to the right side (cols 8-14), this is **column 2**.\n*   **Input Blocks:** There are 5 blocks of shapes (Rows 0-2, 4-6, 8-10, 12-14, 16-18).\n*   **Sequence of Shapes (Left Col then Right Col):**\n    1.  **Block 0 Left:** Blue 'b' (1) -> **Right 3**\n    2.  **Block 1 Left:** Red 'U' (2) -> **Left 2**\n    3.  **Block 2 Left:** Pink 'Y' (6) -> **Down 2**\n    4.  **Block 3 Left:** Green 'T' (3) -> **Left 4** (Note: Input has `3,3,3`... which is Green T)\n    5.  **Block 4 Left:** Pink 'Y' (6) -> **Down 2**\n    6.  **Block 0 Right:** Blue 'b' (1) -> **Right 3**\n    7.  **Block 1 Right:** Blue 'b' (1) -> **Right 3**\n    8.  **Block 2 Right:** Pink 'Y' (6) -> **Down 2**\n    9.  **Block 3 Right:** Green 'T' (3) -> **Left 4**\n    10. **Block 4 Right:** Red 'U' (2) -> **Left 2**\n\n*   **Tracing the Path:**\n    *   **Start:** (Row 0, Col 2) -> `0,0,5,0,0,0,0`\n    *   **Move 1 (Blue, R3):** Row 1. From col 2, Right 3 -> Cols 2, 3, 4. End at 4.\n    *   **Move 2 (Red, L2):** Row 2. From col 4, Left 2 -> Cols 4, 3. End at 3.\n    *   **Move 3 (Pink, D2):** Rows 3-4. From col 3, Down 2 -> Col 3. End at 3.\n    *   **Move 4 (Green, L4):** Row 5. From col 3, Left 4 -> Cols 3, 2, 1, 0. End at 0.\n    *   **Move 5 (Pink, D2):** Rows 6-7. From col 0, Down 2 -> Col 0. End at 0.\n    *   **Move 6 (Blue, R3):** Row 8. From col 0, Right 3 -> Cols 0, 1, 2. End at 2.\n    *   **Move 7 (Blue, R3):** Row 9. From col 2, Right 3 -> Cols 2, 3, 4. End at 4.\n    *   **Move 8 (Pink, D2):** Rows 10-11. From col 4, Down 2 -> Col 4. End at 4.\n    *   **Move 9 (Green, L4):** Row 12. From col 4, Left 4 -> Cols 4, 3, 2, 1. End at 1.\n    *   **Move 10 (Red, L2):** Row 13. From col 1, Left 2 -> Cols 1, 0. End at 0.\n    *   **Remaining Rows:** 14-18 are empty.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n\n```\n0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,1,1,0,0\n0,0,0,2,2,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,0,0,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n1,1,1,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,1,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,3,3,3,3,0,0\n2,2,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Deep Dive into ARC Problem-Solving**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got. I'm faced with an ARC task. We're given three solved examples and one test input. Time to break it down.\n\nFirst off, the examples are all about grid manipulations. We've got an input grid with some repeating patterns on the left, a divider, and a seemingly related output grid on the right.  It looks like we're supposed to \"trace\" something out in the output, maybe related to those patterns.\n\nIn Example 1, I see these 3x3 tiles, each with a unique shape and color.  The output is a winding path. My initial guess: the tiles dictate how the path is laid out. I looked at the output and started noticing segment lengths - the Red was length 2, Blue was kind of a zigzag (total pixels 6, but in two segments). It's not a direct pixel-by-pixel match. Okay, this is more complex.\n\nMy next hunch: maybe the shapes tell us *directions*, a sequence. But the colors didn't match the order of the shapes, so that got tossed. I also thought, 'what if the grey pixel is the start, and the colors are a sequence,' but the color sequence didn't line up.\n\nThen, I tried another idea: pathfinding within the grid. Are the 3x3 blocks rooms, and the grey dot the player? That felt right. Maybe the 0s inside these rooms form the path?  Tried that, but it didn't align.\n\nI then started to think these shapes were *instructions* to move. In the test input, Blue seemed to mean a zigzag, Green was a horizontal segment. But it was just looking at the examples and guessing. So, I tried focusing on connections. How did each segment *connect* to the next? It got messy.\n\nI noticed, too, there's a Yellow line in the middle of each example, the divider. The output is the right side of the input, now the 7 wide part. The plan shifted - maybe the problem is just *overlaying* the left side onto the right? A \"folding\" process of some sort. The tiles got shifted, and the path just makes visual connections.\n\nThen, I focused on the output shapes, now thinking that they are *projections* of the input shapes. I saw a line of pixels of varying widths. The input shapes must define the path segment. It was like I had to map the visual segment in the Output to the shapes in the Input.\n\nSo I am thinking each 3x3 grid *is* a shape, and it can be treated like a pipe, or a tube that has an opening - the 0s form some visual element. I mapped the path through the 0s (opening) for each tile. Now I'm getting a handle on it.\n\nSo now, I looked at a \"maze\" or \"pathfinding\" or some algorithm. I thought, *What if the left side of the input is a program, and the right side is the canvas?* Execute in a certain order. The code is in those blocks, and the canvas is this empty right grid. That's getting closer.\n\nI got excited when I realized that, maybe the colors defined a chain: Red leads to Blue, then Blue to Pink... like a program. I went back to a \"fall down\" model - start at Grey pixel, fall down the 3x3 rows, and at each row, make a move.  Each block is in one of the columns. The instruction of the block will direct a shift.\n\nBut that \"fall down\" idea failed to account for row order. So, I need to use this idea of *blocks as tiles* but in a more logical or graph structure.  The output shape and width were critical - the shape is an instruction, but it depends on the adjacent tile.\n\nAnd then I saw this, and it felt right!\n  * **Build the output as a path.**\n  *   Start X determined by Grey Dot location\n  *   We fall down row by row and pick a tile\n  *   For each tile, find its corresponding shape.\n  *   Add a segment to the path.\n  *   Move along a segment,\n  *   And repeat to generate output.\n  *   (I thought about *connectivity* of the tiles).\n  *   The start point and the instructions are key.\n  *   In the test input, the starting position is important.\n\nSo, for the test input:\nI'm looking at two *Blue* tiles, both with the \"zigzag\" function. Then I hit a Pink tile, \"straight down\" function.  Then, a Green tile - horizontal shift - and another Pink tile.  I\n\nTo solve this puzzle, we need to understand the relationship between the 15x7 pattern on the left side of the input (the \"map\") and the resulting path on the right side (the output).\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Structure**: The input consists of a left section (columns 0-6) containing a grid of 3x3 colored blocks separated by black rows, a yellow divider (column 7), and a right section (columns 8-14) which is empty except for a single grey pixel (color 5). The output grid corresponds to the right section (7xN).\n\n2.  **The Grey Pixel**: The grey pixel represents the **starting point** of a path. Its horizontal position in the output grid determines the entry column for the first block.\n    *   Example 1: Grey pixel at index 1 (col 9 in input -> 9-8 = 1).\n    *   Example 2: Grey pixel at index 3 (col 11 in input -> 11-8 = 3).\n    *   Test Input: Grey pixel at index 2 (col 10 in input -> 10-8 = 2).\n\n3.  **The Blocks as Instructions**: The 3x3 colored blocks act as tiles that direct the path. The path descends row by row through the blocks. The specific block chosen depends on the current \"Left\" or \"Right\" column alignment.\n    *   **Columns 0-2 (Left Side)**: Active if the path enters from the left (indices 0-2).\n    *   **Columns 4-6 (Right Side)**: Active if the path enters from the right (indices 4-6).\n\n4.  **Block Logic & Shapes**:\n    *   **Blue (1)**: Visually an inverted 'U' or 'A'. Function: **Diagonal/Zigzag**. It shifts the path from one side to the other (Left $\\to$ Right or Right $\\to$ Left). In the output, it forms a 2-row \"Z\" shape.\n    *   **Pink (6)**: Visually a 'Y' or vertical bar. Function: **Vertical Straight**. It keeps the path in the current column. In the output, it forms a vertical line (usually 2-4 pixels long).\n    *   **Green (3)**: Visually a 'T'. Function: **Horizontal Shift/Step**. In the output, it forms a horizontal bar.\n    *   **Red (2)**: Visually a 'U'. Function: **Step**. Seen in Example 1 to create a small step.\n\n5.  **Test Input Tracing**:\n    *   **Start**: Grey pixel at index **2** (Left side).\n    *   **Step 1 (Row 0)**: We are on the Left. The block at Row 0 Left is **Blue (1)**.\n        *   Action: Blue shifts sides. Left $\\to$ Right.\n        *   Output Shape: A 2-row Blue zigzag starting at col 2 and moving right.\n    *   **Step 2 (Row 1)**: Now we are on the Right. The block at Row 1 Right is **Blue (1)**.\n        *   Action: Blue shifts sides. Right $\\to$ Left.\n        *   Output Shape: A 2-row Blue zigzag starting at the previous end point and moving left.\n    *   **Step 3 (Row 2)**: Now we are on the Left. The block at Row 2 Left is **Pink (6)**.\n        *   Action: Go Straight. Stay Left.\n        *   Output Shape: A vertical Pink line.\n    *   **Step 4 (Row 3)**: We are on the Left. The block at Row 3 Left is **Green (3)**.\n        *   Action: Horizontal segment.\n        *   Output Shape: A horizontal Green bar.\n    *   **Step 5 (Row 4)**: We are on the Left. The block at Row 4 Left is **Pink (6)**.\n        *   Action: Go Straight.\n        *   Output Shape: A vertical Pink line.\n\n**Constructing the Output Grid:**\n*   Start at (0, 2) with value 5.\n*   **Blue Segment 1**: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4) then (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5). (Zigzag Right).\n*   **Blue Segment 2**: (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3) then (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2). (Zigzag Left).\n*   **Pink Segment 1**: Vertical line at col 2. Rows 5, 6.\n*   **Green Segment**: Horizontal bar centered at col 2. Row 7. (Cols 1-4).\n*   **Pink Segment 2**: Vertical line at col 2. Rows 8, 9, 10.\n\n*Refining lengths based on examples*:\n*   Blue segments are 2 rows high.\n*   Pink segments are typically 2-4 rows high.\n*   Green segment is 1 row high.\n\n**Final Coordinates**:\n1.  (0, 2): 5\n2.  (1, 2-4): 1\n3.  (2, 3-5): 1\n4.  (3, 3-5): 1\n5.  (4, 2-4): 1\n6.  (5, 2): 6\n7.  (6, 2): 6\n8.  (7, 2): 6\n9.  (8, 1-4): 3\n10. (9, 2): 6\n11. (10, 2): 6\n12. (11, 2): 6\n\nThis pattern fits the logic derived from the solved examples.\n\n0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,1,1,0,0\n0,0,0,1,1,1,0\n0,0,0,1,1,1,0\n0,0,1,1,1,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,3,3,3,3,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Deconstructing the ARC Puzzle**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of this ARC problem. The user wants me to translate a visual input to a visual output based on a few examples and some clues.  I've got this:\n\nFirst, let's understand the input grids. They're fixed width (15 cols), and have a vertical separator.  Everything to the left is where the action is, it seems.  The important pattern here is that the left side is structured in tile rows. Each row has two 3x3 shapes (tiles), separated by empty columns.  I've labeled these tiles as $T_{r, c}$ where $r$ is the row and $c$ is the column.\n\nNow, the output grids.  Their width (7) corresponds to the \"right block\" of the input. The key is that the output *path* relates to the left-side tiles, which is hinted by the hint.\n\nThe hint tells me to think of the left side as tiles arranged in two columns. The output is a vertical path. That *vertical* part gets its horizontal location from the *original* tile column. A horizontal shift in the output path means the column selection changed, right?  The \"grey pixel\" on the right side indicates my starting point for the output. I need to figure out the rule.\n\nI looked at the pixel colors and thought I could build a path by connecting segments (horizontal and vertical). Now, the hint says the tile colors determine the path, but the hints aren't very clear on what actions the tiles have.  \n\nI tried to classify the tiles by their shapes: U, Y, Z, and T. These looked like building blocks, but it didn't fully fit.\n\nAfter some analysis, I had to rethink the tiles. The tiles are operators. I will build an output path by following a specific sequence of tiles.\n\nThe start position (grey pixel) helps determine my tile in row 0.\n\nSo, here's the algorithm I plan to use:\n\n1.  **Grey Pixel Location:** It dictates the start column.\n2.  **Row Iteration:** Go through the tile rows (0 to the max).\n    *   **Tile Choice:** Based on current column location, select a tile to draw.\n    *   **Action:** Apply an action based on tile color.\n3.  **Horizontal/Vertical:** Build my path according to which direction to go, by creating horizontal segments (if I switched columns) or vertical parts (staying in the same column).\n\nThe path is built by tracing specific segment based on tile shape (color).\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the problem asks us to construct a vertical path in the output grid based on the \"tiles\" provided in the left part of the input grid. The logic is as follows:\n\n1.  **Input Structure**: The left side of the input (cols 0-6) contains pairs of 3x3 tiles (Left and Right). The right side (cols 8-14) contains a single grey pixel (5) which indicates the starting position.\n2.  **Path Logic**:\n    *   The path starts at the horizontal position indicated by the grey pixel.\n    *   We process the tile rows sequentially (Row 0, Row 1, ...).\n    *   At each step, we look at the tile in the **current column** (Left or Right) of the path.\n    *   The **Tile Color/Pattern** determines the shape of the path segment and whether to switch columns:\n        *   **Blue (1)**: Acts as a **Switch**. If on the Left, switch to Right. If on the Right, switch to Left. The shape creates a diagonal connection.\n        *   **Red (2)**: Acts as a **Start/Corner** or standard segment. It keeps the path in the current column.\n        *   **Pink (6)**: Acts as a **Vertical** line. It keeps the path in the current column and draws a vertical segment (usually 4 pixels high).\n        *   **Green (3)**: Acts as a **Horizontal** bar or bridge. It keeps the path in the current column.\n3.  **Application to Test Input**:\n    *   **Start**: The grey pixel (5) is at column index 10. Relative to the right block (starts at 8), this is index 2. This maps to the far right of the output grid (Column 6). So, we start **Right**.\n    *   **Row 0**: We are on the Right. The tile at Row 0, Right Column is **Blue** (`1,1,0...`).\n        *   **Action**: Switch from Right to Left.\n        *   **Output Shape**: A diagonal path of 1s moving from right to left.\n    *   **Row 1**: We are now on the Left. The tile at Row 1, Left Column is **Red** (`2,0,2...`).\n        *   **Action**: Stay Left.\n        *   **Output Shape**: A Red segment (`2,2`).\n    *   **Row 2**: We are on the Left. The tile at Row 2, Left Column is **Pink** (`6,0,6...`).\n        *   **Action**: Stay Left.\n        *   **Output Shape**: A vertical Pink line (`6`s).\n    *   **Row 3**: We are on the Left. The tile at Row 3, Left Column is **Green** (`3,3,3...`).\n        *   **Action**: Stay Left.\n        *   **Output Shape**: A horizontal Green bar (`3`s).\n    *   **Row 4**: We are on the Left. The tile at Row 4, Left Column is **Pink** (`6,0,6...`).\n        *   **Action**: Stay Left.\n        *   **Output Shape**: A vertical Pink line (`6`s).\n\n**Constructing the Output Grid**:\n*   Row 0: Start at col 6 (5).\n*   Rows 1-3: Blue path switching from col 6 to col 0.\n*   Row 4: Red segment at col 0-1.\n*   Rows 5-8: Pink vertical line at col 1.\n*   Row 9: Green horizontal bar.\n*   Rows 10-13: Pink vertical line at col 1.\n\noutput:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5\n0,0,0,0,1,1,1\n0,0,1,1,1,0,0\n1,1,1,0,0,0,0\n2,2,0,0,0,0,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,3,3,3,3,0,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, here's my understanding of the situation. I'm tasked with generating an output grid based on three example inputs and a test input. The core challenge is to recognize a pattern related to tiles, '5', and a vertical separator '4' in the input grid.**\n\nThe input format involves a large grid with 3x3 tiles arranged vertically on the left side of a '4' separator.  The key is the horizontal position of a '5', which seems to dictate something about the start of a path in the output. The output, a smaller grid, needs to contain colored pixels in a specific structure that relates to the input.\n\n**Analyzing the Input**\n\nThe input seems to be built from vertically stacked 3x3 tiles. There are two columns: 0-2 (left) and 4-6 (right) with column 3 as a gap. We have to identify these tiles. The horizontal position of the '5' is crucial as it determines the start of the \"path\". I've tried to understand how a tile's position (Left vs. Right) translates to the output, and I think it has something to do with aligning the path at a particular start column.\n\n**Output Generation**\n\nThe output is much smaller. The grid is 7 columns wide and the height matches the input. My primary goal is to decipher the logic of the output structure. It appears to be a vertical path. The location of the '5' hints at the path's starting point. The tricky part is figuring out how the path relates to the 3x3 tile's shape, and the color of the output, which is not exactly the same as the input's tiles. The example outputs look flattened.\n\n**The \"Path\" Hypothesis**\n\nThe examples show a path-like output that zig-zags and uses colors from the input tiles. I realized the '5' is simply an anchor. The colors used seem to encode the path segments. The path seems to \"traverse\" tiles from level to level. It either follows a direct vertical path or switches.\n\n**\"Tiles as Pipes/Connectors\"**\n\nI realized that the tiles (3x3 blocks) are more like *pipes* or *connectors*.\nI think the shapes are critical. One hypothesis is the tiles themselves contain information on direction.\nThe colors tell the *path color*, and the shape tells where the path goes (up, down, turn).\n- Vertical tiles have a straight flow\n- Horizontal tiles switch columns.\n\nThe 'Switch' mechanism: a blue tile causes a horizontal segment from the left tile area to the right tile area. During the 'switch', there is a gap. A Vertical segment after each 'Switch', uses the \"Next vertical\" tile on the originating side. In Ex 1, after the horizontal Blue tile (switch from Left), the Magenta vertical line (coming from Right side) is a connection between this switch to a future element on the 'Right Side' of the output.\n\n**Final Pattern**\n\n*   **Start**: Determine if start column is 'Left' or 'Right'. This comes from the position of the '5'.\n*   **Tile processing** Process the vertical path.\n*   **Vertical Tiles**: Vertically extend same color.\n*   **Switch Tiles**: Output a horizontal segment from origin to other column, draw vertical from current side.\n*   The \"vertical drop\" color is determined by the *next* vertical tile's color on the **originating** side.\n*   The \"Junction\" tiles seem to extend on current column.\n\nThis pattern seems to explain all of the inputs.\nThe output, for the Test Input is:\nA blue segment.\nA Red gap segment.\nA Blue segment.\nA Mag gap.\nA Mag Vertical.\nA Mag Gap\nA Green Horizontal.\nA Mag gap.\nA Mag Horizontal.\nA Mag Gap.\nA Red Horizontal\n\nOkay, I have a plan. I think I've figured it out!\n\n\nThe ARC task presents a problem where we must navigate a path through a set of tiles based on rules derived from their shapes and positions.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure**: The input grid consists of a left section (columns 0-6) and a right section (column 7 onwards). The left section contains 3x3 tiles arranged in two columns (Left and Right) separated by a gap. The right section contains a yellow divider at column 7 and a grey pixel '5' somewhere to the right.\n2.  **Output Structure**: The output is a narrower grid (width 7) representing a single path. The path is constructed by connecting specific tiles from the input.\n3.  **Start Position**: The horizontal starting position of the path is determined by the grey '5'. Its distance from the divider (col 7) maps to the output column.\n    *   Example 1: '5' at index 9 (+2) -> Output Col 1. (Left)\n    *   Example 2: '5' at index 11 (+4) -> Output Col 3. (Left/Center)\n    *   Example 3: '5' at index 12 (+5) -> Output Col 4. (Right)\n    *   Test Input: '5' at index 10 (+3) -> Maps to Output Col 2. We start on the **Left** logical side.\n4.  **Path Logic**: The path descends level by level (each level is a 3x3 tile + 1 row gap). At each level, we execute the tile on the current side (Left or Right).\n    *   **Vertical Tile (e.g., Red U `2`, Magenta Y `6`)**: The path stays on the same side. We draw the tile's color.\n    *   **Switch Tile (e.g., Blue `1` pattern)**: The path switches to the other side. We draw a horizontal connection.\n    *   **Identical Tiles Rule**: From Example 3, if the current tile is identical to the next tile on the same side (e.g., two Magenta Y's), it acts as a switch (push) to the other side.\n    *   **Gap Color**: When the path drops vertically (either staying on the same side or finishing a switch), the color of the vertical segment in the gap is determined by the **next vertical tile** on the **origin** side (the side we are coming from).\n5.  **Applying to Test Input**:\n    *   **Start**: Left side (Col 2).\n    *   **Level 0 (L1)**: Tile is **Blue** (`1 1 0...`). Pattern matches \"Switch\".\n        *   Action: Switch to Right.\n        *   Output: Blue horizontal segment.\n        *   Gap (Row 3): Next vertical tile on Left is L2 (Red). Gap color is **Red**. Destination is Right Col (Col 5).\n    *   **Level 1 (R2)**: Tile is **Blue** (`1 1 0...`). Pattern matches \"Switch\".\n        *   Action: Switch to Left.\n        *   Output: Blue horizontal segment.\n        *   Gap (Row 7): Next vertical tile on Right is R3 (Magenta). Gap color is **Magenta**. Destination is Left Col (Col 2).\n    *   **Level 2 (L3)**: Tile is **Magenta** (`6 0 6...`). Pattern is Vertical Y. Next tile L4 is Green (different).\n        *   Action: Stay Left.\n        *   Output: Magenta vertical segment.\n        *   Gap (Row 11): L3 is vertical, so it extends itself. Gap color is **Magenta**.\n    *   **Level 3 (L4)**: Tile is **Green** (`3 3 3...`). Pattern is Junction.\n        *   Action: Stay Left.\n        *   Output: Green horizontal segment.\n        *   Gap (Row 15): Next vertical tile on Left is L5 (Magenta). Gap color is **Magenta**.\n    *   **Level 4 (L5)**: Tile is **Magenta** (`6 0 6...`). Pattern is Vertical.\n        *   Check Rule: L6 is also Magenta (`6 0 6`). Identical!\n        *   Action: Switch (Push) to Right.\n        *   Output: Magenta segment.\n        *   Gap (Row 19): Next vertical tile on Left is L6 (Magenta). Gap color is **Magenta**. Destination is Right Col (Col 5).\n    *   **Level 5 (R6)**: Tile is **Red** (`2 2 2...`). Vertical U.\n        *   Action: End of grid. Draw Red.\n\n**Sequence**: Blue (L1) -> Red Gap -> Blue (R2) -> Magenta Gap -> Magenta (L3) -> Magenta Gap -> Green (L4) -> Magenta Gap -> Magenta (L5) -> Magenta Gap -> Red (R6).\n\n**Output Grid Construction**:\n- Width 7.

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Below is the reasoning I used and then the concrete output grid I obtain from applying it.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Interpreting the input as tiles\n\nFor all examples (and the test), the left part of the input is 7 columns wide, separated from the right part by a vertical column of 4\u2019s. That left region is composed of 3\u00d73 tiles arranged in two columns:\n\n- Column 0: columns 1\u20133  \n- Column 1: columns 5\u20137  \n\nThe tiles are stacked vertically, with a blank row of zeros between consecutive tile rows.\n\nFor the test input (19\u00d715), the left 7 columns look like this (spacing added):\n\nRows 1\u20133:\n- Col0 (c1\u20133): color 1 tile\n- Col1 (c5\u20137): color 1 tile\n\nRow 4: blank\n\nRows 5\u20137:\n- Col0: color 2 tile\n- Col1: color 1 tile\n\nRow 8: blank\n\nRows 9\u201311:\n- Col0: color 6 tile\n- Col1: color 6 tile\n\nRow 12: blank\n\nRows 13\u201315:\n- Col0: color 3 tile\n- Col1: color 3 tile\n\nRow 16: blank\n\nRows 17\u201319:\n- Col0: color 6 tile\n- Col1: color 2 tile\n\nSo we have:\n\n- Column 0 tile colors (top to bottom):  \n  `[1, 2, 6, 3, 6]`\n- Column 1 tile colors (top to bottom):  \n  `[1, 1, 6, 3, 2]`\n\nWe then define the sequence of tiles for the path by concatenating the two columns:\n\n```text\ntile_colors = [1, 2, 6, 3, 6, 1, 1, 6, 3, 2]\n```\n\nThis convention (all column\u20110 tiles top\u2011down, then all column\u20111 tiles top\u2011down) is consistent with how the solved examples order colors along their paths.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Determining the anchor column\n\nThe 4-column is at input column 8, so the \u201cright\u201d region runs from columns 9\u201315 (7 columns wide).\n\nIn all examples, the grey (5) lies somewhere in this right region; its *local* index in that 7\u2011wide strip becomes the horizontal anchor position in the output (which is always 7 columns wide):\n\n- Example 1: 5 in right region position 2 \u21d2 output column 2\n- Example 2: 5 in right region position 4 \u21d2 output column 4\n- Example 3: 5 in right region position 5 \u21d2 output column 5\n\nFor the test:\n\n- 4 is in column 8\n- 5 is in column 11\n- Right-region index of 5 = 11 \u2212 8 = 3\n\nSo in the output grid (width 7), the anchor 5 goes at column 3, row 1.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Drawing the path\n\nWe create a 19\u00d77 output grid (same height as input, width 7), initially all zeros.\n\nWe then:\n\n1. Place the anchor:\n   - Row 1, Col 3 = 5\n\n2. Traverse the `tile_colors` sequence. For each tile we extend the path downward from the current endpoint.\n\n   I use a simple alternating rule consistent with the \u201cvertical path with occasional horizontal shifts\u201d behavior seen in the examples:\n\n   - The sequence of tile colors is:\n     `c1=1, c2=2, c3=6, c4=3, c5=6, c6=1, c7=1, c8=6, c9=3, c10=2`\n   - Steps are indexed i = 1\u202610.\n   - Side:\n     - i = 1..5 \u2192 column\u20110 tiles (treated as \u201cleft side\u201d)\n     - i = 6..10 \u2192 column\u20111 tiles (treated as \u201cright side\u201d)\n   - From the current cell (r, x):\n     - If i is odd: make a **horizontal step** one row down\n       - For a column\u20110 tile: move one cell to the **left** (if possible)\n       - For a column\u20111 tile: move one cell to the **right** (if possible)\n       - Color every cell in that small vertical\u2011then\u2011horizontal move with the tile\u2019s color.\n     - If i is even: make a **vertical step** of two cells down in the same column, coloring them.\n\n   Applying this from anchor at (row=1, col=3):\n\n   - **Step 1** (tile 1, color 1, column 0, horizontal):\n     - From (1,3) \u2192 (2,3) then to (2,2)  \n       Row 2: cols 2\u20133 = 1  \n       End at (2,2)\n\n   - **Step 2** (tile 2, color 2, column 0, vertical):\n     - Down to (3,2), then (4,2)  \n       Rows 3\u20134: col 2 = 2  \n       End at (4,2)\n\n   - **Step 3** (tile 3, color 6, column 0, horizontal):\n     - From (4,2) \u2192 (5,2) then left to (5,1)  \n       Row 5: cols 1\u20132 = 6  \n       End at (5,1)\n\n   - **Step 4** (tile 4, color 3, column 0, vertical):\n     - Down to (6,1), then (7,1)  \n       Rows 6\u20137: col 1 = 3  \n       End at (7,1)\n\n   - **Step 5** (tile 5, color 6, column 0, horizontal):\n     - From (7,1) \u2192 (8,1); can\u2019t move further left, so stay at col 1  \n       Row 8: col 1 = 6  \n       End at (8,1)\n\n   - **Step 6** (tile 6, color 1, column 1, horizontal):\n     - From (8,1) \u2192 (9,1) then right to (9,2)  \n       Row 9: cols 1\u20132 = 1  \n       End at (9,2)\n\n   - **Step 7** (tile 7, color 1, column 1, vertical):\n     - Down to (10,2), then (11,2)  \n       Rows 10\u201311: col 2 = 1  \n       End at (11,2)\n\n   - **Step 8** (tile 8, color 6, column 1, horizontal):\n     - From (11,2) \u2192 (12,2) then right to (12,3)  \n       Row 12: cols 2\u20133 = 6  \n       End at (12,3)\n\n   - **Step 9** (tile 9, color 3, column 1, vertical):\n     - Down to (13,3), then (14,3)  \n       Rows 13\u201314: col 3 = 3  \n       End at (14,3)\n\n   - **Step 10** (tile 10, color 2, column 1, horizontal):\n     - From (14,3) \u2192 (15,3) then right to (15,4)  \n       Row 15: cols 3\u20134 = 2  \n       End at (15,4)\n\n   Rows 16\u201319 remain zero.\n\nThis yields a single continuous 4\u2011connected path, descending from the grey anchor, whose colored segments correspond (in order) to all tiles of column 0, then all tiles of column 1.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "I was not able to fully reconstruct a consistent rule from the three training examples that lets me deterministically generate the exact intended path for the test case.\n\nI did manage to infer quite a bit:\n\n- The left part of the input (columns 0\u20136) is a field of 3\u00d73 \u201cglyph\u201d tiles in two columns, separated by a grey wall at column 7.\n- The tiles always use a single non\u2011zero color and a characteristic 3\u00d73 pattern (the same shapes recur across examples).\n- There are exactly two tile columns: \u201cColumn 0\u201d (left, at input columns 0\u20132) and \u201cColumn 1\u201d (right, at input columns 4\u20136). Vertically, tile rows are separated by a row of zeros.\n- The unique \u201c5\u201d on the right of the wall is the starting anchor.\n- The output is always height = input height, width = 7.\n- The output consists of a single colored path:\n  - The anchor 5 is placed in some column of this 7\u2011wide grid.\n  - Each tile becomes one segment of the path, colored with that tile\u2019s color.\n  - The segments for all tiles from Column 0 (left) and all tiles from Column 1 (right) are arranged in some specific order and joined into a single polyline.\n  - When the path conceptually \u201cstays in the same column\u201d between one tile and the next, the segment is vertical; when it \u201cswitches columns\u201d, there is a horizontal segment.\n  - In the examples the tiles are indeed treated as two stacks (left\u2011column tiles and right\u2011column tiles), and the color sequence in the output matches a specific ordering of these tiles:\n    - Example 2: left\u2011column tiles (1, 6), then right\u2011column tiles (2, 3) \u2192 output color order 1, 6, 2, 3.\n    - Example 3: left\u2011column tiles (2, 6, 2), then right\u2011column tiles (6, 1, 6) \u2192 output color order 2, 6, 2, 6, 1, 6.\n    - Example 1: left\u2011column tiles (2, 1, 1, 6), then right\u2011column tiles (6, 3, 6, 1) \u2192 output color order, when expanded, 2, 1, 1, 6, 6, 3, 6, 1.\n  - So the *sequence of colors* is clear: all left tiles top\u2011down, followed by all right tiles top\u2011down.\n\nWhere I failed is the *geometric* mapping from:\n- input tile column (left/right)  \nto\n- exact horizontal positions and vertical extents within the 7\u2011wide output grid.\n\nAcross the three solved examples the anchor\u2019s column and the \u201crails\u201d used for left/right tiles vary in a way I couldn\u2019t tie back to a simple, consistent function of the input coordinates. Without that, I can\u2019t reliably place the path segments for the unseen test case.\n\nBecause of this, any concrete 19\u00d77 grid I output for the test would effectively be a guess and is almost surely incorrect relative to the intended ARC solution.\n\nNonetheless, I must provide an output grid. I will therefore give the all\u2011zero grid of the correct size (19 rows, 7 columns), explicitly noting that it is *not* derived from a correct understanding of the transformation and should be considered a placeholder rather than a valid solution.\n\nHere is that placeholder output:\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation:\n\n1. **Input structure**: The input has a left region with two columns of tiles (columns 0-2 and 4-6), separated by a column of 4s (column 7). The position of \"5\" indicates the starting anchor.\n\n2. **Tile extraction**: I identify the tiles from left column (positions 0-2) and right column (positions 4-6) at each row block.\n\n3. **Path sequence**: Starting with left column tiles top-to-bottom, if consecutive tiles match in color, switch to the right column. Then traverse the right column.\n\n4. **Output positioning**: \n   - Anchor column = input anchor column - 8 (test: column 10 \u2192 column 2)\n   - Left tiles extend leftward from anchor\n   - Right tiles extend rightward, then positions alternate\n\n**Test input analysis:**\n- Anchor at column 10 \u2192 output column 2\n- Left tiles: 1, 2, 6, 3, 6 (no consecutive matches)\n- Right tiles: 1, 1, 6, 3, 2\n\n**Tracing the path:**\n- Start at anchor (col 2)\n- Tile 1 (left): columns 0-2, position \u2192 0\n- Tile 2 (left): columns 0-1, position \u2192 1  \n- Tile 6 (left, vertical): column 1\n- Tile 3 (left): columns 1-4, position \u2192 4\n- Tile 6 (left, vertical): column 4\n- Tile 1 (right): columns 4-6, position \u2192 6\n- Tile 1 (right, vertical): column 6\n- Tile 6 (right, vertical): column 6\n- Tile 3 (right): columns 3-6, position \u2192 3\n- Tile 2 (right): columns 3-4\n\n```\n0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n1,1,1,0,0,0,0\n2,2,0,0,0,0,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,3,3,3,3,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,0,1,1,1\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1\n0,0,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3\n0,0,0,2,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to analyze the transformation from the examples:\n\n**Understanding the Structure:**\n- The input has a left section (columns 0-6) with tiles arranged in 2 columns, separated by column 7 (all 4s)\n- The right section (columns 8-14) contains the starting marker (5) and is empty otherwise\n- Each tile block is 3x3 patterns with specific colors\n\n**Key Transformation Rules:**\n1. Process all Left column tiles first (top to bottom), then Right column tiles\n2. The 5's position in the right area maps directly to the output starting column (col 10 - 8 = col 2)\n3. Patterns like 6 create vertical segments (height 2); patterns 1, 2, 3 create horizontal segments\n4. Left column tiles position the path on the left side; right column tiles connect to the right side\n5. When transitioning between columns, horizontal patterns create connecting segments\n\n**Identifying Test Input Tiles:**\n- Row 0: L=1, R=1\n- Row 1: L=2, R=1  \n- Row 2: L=6, R=6\n- Row 3: L=3, R=3\n- Row 4: L=6, R=2\n\n**Sequence:** L0(1), L1(2), L2(6), L3(3), L4(6), R0(1), R1(1), R2(6), R3(3), R4(2)\n\n**Tracing the Path:**\n- Start at col 2 (5 position)\n- L0-L4: Move left, creating segments on left side\n- R0: Creates connecting segment from left to right\n- R1-R4: Continue on right side\n\n**Building the Output:**\n\n```\n0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n1,1,1,0,0,0,0\n2,2,0,0,0,0,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,0,0,0,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,1,1,1,1,0,0\n0,0,0,1,1,1,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,2,2,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC-AGI Image Analysis Summary**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a task where I need to decipher the relationship between an input image (with three pairs) and the expected output.  My initial focus is on understanding the structures and patterns within each input/output pair.\n\nThe input image consists of two parts: a grid filled with shapes (which I'll call \"tiles\"), and a usually black area to the right. The output is a \"snake\" or connected path composed of colored blocks within this blank area.  There is also a grey pixel marker in the output section of each image.\n\nI first look at the tiles, realizing that each tile represents a specific instruction or element in the \"program.\"  These tiles appear to be organized in columns, which I will index as 0 and 1. The output's construction seems to correlate with the sequence of these tiles.  The color of a segment in the snake appears to match the color of the current tile in the sequence.\n\nThe grey pixel's position seems significant, potentially acting as the \"anchor\" or starting point for the output snake. However, its exact relationship to the tile grid and the snake's initial orientation is initially unclear.  I hypothesize the grey pixel also dictates the location of the initial column within the output.\n\nMy analysis reveals a critical insight: The output snake always alternates between horizontal and vertical segments.  Horizontal shifts are associated with transitions from one column to another in the input grid, while vertical segments correspond to moving \"down\" within a column. The path itself seems to follow the sequence of colored tiles in the grid. It's likely going to be a Depth-First Search-type path that seeks to build the longest consistent run of adjacent color/shapes.\n\nThe tricky part is defining a consistent set of rules to map the tile grid's coordinates to the snake's segments.  The critical breakthrough is that if a horizontal transition happens from one tile to another, there is a vertical segment added in the output. If a vertical (down) shift happens on the grid, it becomes a horizontal segment in the output. And this behavior depends on whether we are moving columns within the source tiles. This, in theory, explains Input 1, 2, and 3.\n\nI'm now confident that I can develop a generalized algorithm to predict the output snake given any tile grid input. The algorithm is going to rely on path finding, column analysis, and the placement of the output based on a central anchor, and will likely prioritize a specific traversal order.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the training examples, here are the generalizable insights:\n\n**1. Observable Structures**\n*   **Input:** Divided into two sections by a vertical yellow line.\n    *   **Left Section:** A grid containing distinct colored shapes (Red U, Magenta T, Blue Square, Green T). These shapes appear to be uniform \"tiles\" arranged in a 2-column structure.\n    *   **Right Section:** A largely black canvas with a single grey pixel on the top row. The horizontal position of this grey pixel varies across examples.\n*   **Output:** A vertical \"snake-like\" structure on a black background.\n    *   The structure is composed of connected colored blocks (segments).\n    *   The segments alternate between horizontal and vertical orientations.\n    *   The colors of the segments correspond to the colors of the shapes in the left input grid.\n\n**2. Transformation Categories**\n*   **Present:** Cluster \u2192 icon mapping (shapes act as instruction tiles), Copying/pasting (colors are preserved), Repositioning (grid to linear path), Using a key anchor location (grey pixel).\n*   **Maybe:** Symmetry/Reflection (Input 3's traversal order suggests a zig-zag or reversal).\n\n**3. Key Non-Obvious Insights**\n*   **The Left Grid is a Map/List:** The left side is not just a picture but a 2-column list of \"instructions\" or \"nodes\" to be visited.\n*   **Spatial Mapping (Column to X-Offset):** The horizontal position of a block in the output snake corresponds directly to the **column index** of that shape in the input grid.\n    *   Shapes from the **Left Column (Col 0)** appear on the **left** side of the output snake.\n    *   Shapes from the **Right Column (Col 1)** appear on the **right** side of the output snake.\n*   **Connectivity = Movement:**\n    *   A **Vertical segment** in the output represents a move within the same column (e.g., from Col 0 to Col 0).\n    *   A **Horizontal segment** represents a switch between columns (e.g., from Col 0 to Col 1).\n*   **Traversal Order:** The shapes are not visited strictly row-by-row. The path traverses the grid to form a connected chain. In Input 3, it appears to visit Row 0, then Row 2, then Row 1 (in reverse), suggesting a logic that prioritizes specific adjacencies or color patterns.\n*   **Grey Pixel Anchor:** The grey pixel marks the starting horizontal anchor point. The entire output structure hangs relative to this pixel, aligning the starting column with the pixel's X-coordinate.\n\n**4. General Rule Hypothesis**\nThe task is to **linearize the 2-column grid of shapes** into a single connected vertical path.\n1.  **Parse** the left grid into a set of tiles (Node at col `c`, row `r` with color `K`).\n2.  **Find a path** through these tiles. The path starts at the top-left (0,0). The traversal logic seems to follow a \"boustrophedon\" (ox-turning) or adjacency-based order that visits all meaningful tiles.\n3.  **Draw** the path on the output canvas starting at the **grey pixel**.\n    *   For each node in the path:\n        *   Place a colored block.\n        *   Set its horizontal position relative to the grey pixel based on its grid column (e.g., Col 0 aligns with Grey or Left of Grey; Col 1 is the other).\n        *   Connect it to the previous block. If the column changed, use a horizontal connector. If the column stayed the same, use a vertical connector.\n\n**5. Validation Checks**\n*   **Check Color Sequence:** Does the vertical sequence of colors in the output match a specific traversal path on the input grid?\n*   **Check Lateral Shifts:** Do \"Left\" blocks in the output always come from the left column of the grid, and \"Right\" blocks from the right column?\n*   **Check Connectors:** Are horizontal segments only present when the color sequence implies a jump from Col 0 to Col 1 (or vice versa)?\n*   **Check Traversal:** Verify if the path visits every shape exactly once.\n\nHINT_START\n*   Treat the left input grid as a set of tiles arranged in two columns (Column 0 and Column 1).\n*   The output generates a vertical path where the horizontal position (Left vs. Right) is determined by the tile's original column.\n*   The path connects these tiles; a column switch creates a horizontal segment, while staying in the same column creates a vertical drop.\n*   The grey pixel indicates the horizontal starting anchor for the path.\nHINT_END",
            "Extracted hint": "*   Treat the left input grid as a set of tiles arranged in two columns (Column 0 and Column 1).\n*   The output generates a vertical path where the horizontal position (Left vs. Right) is determined by the tile's original column.\n*   The path connects these tiles; a column switch creates a horizontal segment, while staying in the same column creates a vertical drop.\n*   The grey pixel indicates the horizontal starting anchor for the path."

Right-column shapes, from top to bottom.\n- Each shape corresponds to one **segment of a path** drawn on the output grid, starting from the position of the `5` and continuing sequentially.\n- The path is 4-connected (no jumps), and the color of each segment is the color of the shape that generated it.\n\n**Segment types by color**\n\nBy inspecting where each color appears in the outputs and matching to the order of the input shapes, we can deduce:\n\n- Color `1` \u2192 horizontal segment, **3 cells**, oriented **to the right**.\n- Color `2` \u2192 horizontal segment, **2 cells**, oriented **to the left**.\n- Color `3` \u2192 horizontal segment, **4 cells**, oriented **to the left**.\n- Color `6` \u2192 vertical segment, **2 cells**, oriented **downwards**.\n\n**How segments are placed**\n\nLet `(r, c)` be the last path cell currently drawn (start with the `5`):\n\nFor each shape in order:\n\n- If the shape color is **1**:\n  - Move to the next row: `r := r + 1`.\n  - Draw cells: `(r, c)`, `(r, c + 1)`, `(r, c + 2)` = color 1.\n  - New end column: `c := c + 2`.\n\n- If the shape color is **2**:\n  - Move to the next row: `r := r + 1`.\n  - Draw cells: `(r, c)`, `(r, c - 1)` = color 2.\n  - New end column: `c := c - 1`.\n\n- If the shape color is **3**:\n  - Move to the next row: `r := r + 1`.\n  - Draw cells: `(r, c)`, `(r, c - 1)`, `(r, c - 2)`, `(r, c - 3)` = color 3.\n  - New end column: `c := c - 3`.\n\n- If the shape color is **6**:\n  - Draw vertically downward:\n    - `(r + 1, c)` and `(r + 2, c)` = color 6.\n  - New end row: `r := r + 2` (column stays `c`).\n\nThis exactly fits all three provided examples.\n\nAny remaining rows below the final segment remain all `0`.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Decode the shapes in the test input\n\nThe test input\u2019s left side (columns 1\u20137) contains 3\u00d73 blocks:\n\nRows 1\u20133:\n- Left block (cols 1\u20133): color **1**\n- Right block (cols 5\u20137): color **1**\n\nRows 5\u20137:\n- Left block: color **2**\n- Right block: color **1**\n\nRows 9\u201311:\n- Left block: color **6**\n- Right block: color **6**\n\nRows 13\u201315:\n- Left block: color **3**\n- Right block: color **3**\n\nRows 17\u201319:\n- Left block: color **6**\n- Right block: color **2**\n\nSo the ordered sequence of shapes is:\n\n- Left column top\u2192bottom: **1, 2, 6, 3, 6**\n- Right column top\u2192bottom: **1, 1, 6, 3, 2**\n\nCombined shape sequence:  \n`[1, 2, 6, 3, 6, 1, 1, 6, 3, 2]`\n\n---\n\n## 3. Locate the start marker (5) in the test input\n\nIn the test input row 1:\n\n`..., 4, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0`\n\n- The `4` is at column 8.\n- The `5` is at column 11 (1-based).\n- Output `5` column = `11 \u2212 8 = 3`.\n\nThus, in the output, the start is at `(row 1, col 3)`.\n\nInitialize:\n\n- `r = 1`\n- `c = 3`\n- Output grid 19\u00d77 all zeros, then set `(1,3) = 5`.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Output grid is 7 columns wide (pattern area only) \u00d7 same height as input\n2. The 5 marker moves from input position (row, col) to output position (0, col-8)\n3. Each 3x3 shape block is classified: color 6 shapes (vertical B pattern) create VERTICAL path segments; colors 1, 2, 3 shapes create HORIZONTAL segments\n4. Shapes are traversed: left column top-to-bottom, then right column top-to-bottom\n5. A continuous path is drawn from the 5 marker using each shape's color\n6. Horizontal segments are 1 row \u00d7 2-4 cells; vertical segments are 2 rows \u00d7 1 cell\n7. Consecutive color 6 (B-type) shapes merge their vertical segments\n8. Path direction: left column shapes \u2192 path goes left; right column shapes \u2192 path goes right\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**My Thinking on this ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC problem involving building paths from input patterns. Let's break this down. My goal is to figure out the rules. I'll need to analyze the input and output grids, understand how they relate to each other, and then generalize those observations.\n\n**Input Grid Structure**\n\nFirst, I notice a vertical yellow divider (color 4) splitting the grid. It looks like the left side contains blocks of 3x3 shapes separated by empty rows. There are two columns of these shapes. The right side is mostly empty, but always has a grey pixel (color 5) in the first row. The position of this pixel seems to be crucial since it's the starting point of the generated path on the output grid.\n\n**Shape Classification and Instruction Decoding**\n\nThe real core is in those 3x3 shapes. They seem to represent instructions. It's clear that colors 1, 2, and 3 create horizontal segments, while color 6 produces vertical segments. The tricky part is the *direction* and *length* of these segments.\n\nI start by classifying the shapes:\n\n*   **Color 2 (Red):** This looks like a U.\n*   **Color 6 (Magenta):** A \"Y\" shape.\n*   **Color 1 (Blue):** This has an \"L\" or \"h\" shape.\n*   **Color 3 (Green):** Usually a \"T\", but the example here uses a different shape.\n\nThe provided description states that the left and right sides of each shape contribute to the path. So, I need to figure out how the position (left or right column) relates to the generated path. This is a crucial concept.\n\n**Output Grid and Path Construction**\n\nThe output grids are smaller and represent the generated path. The path starts from a position derived from the position of the color 5 marker in the input grid. I deduce that the \"5\" position determines the horizontal starting position of the path on the output.\n\n**Establishing Drawing Rules**\n\nIt seems that I must traverse the shapes top-to-bottom on each side. The order of traversal appears to be: Left column shapes, then Right column shapes, going row by row. But this is where it gets tricky, the direction of the horizontal segment (left or right) seems to be encoded in the color of the horizontal line, and not the position of the shape. In addition, the length of the segment may need to be decoded.\n\nI check this hypothesis by tracing through the examples, trying to match input shapes to output segments. I begin to formulate:\n\n*   **Color 2 (Left):** U-shape generates a horizontal segment to the left.\n*   **Color 1 (Right):** L-shape generates a horizontal segment to the right.\n*   **Color 3 (Left):** T-shape usually generates a horizontal segment to the left.\n*   **Color 6 (Vertical):** Y-shape generates a vertical segment down.\n\nAnd the new variant for color 3, the shape is different.\n\n**Segment Length Determination: A Tricky Matter**\n\nThen I investigate segment length. The description says \"2 to 4 cells\", but it's not random. I analyze the pixel pattern of the 3x3 shapes and try to correlate this with horizontal segment length. This is where I struggle for a bit. My ideas are:\n\n*   Empty pixels count?\n*   Connected components?\n*   Binary representation?\n*   Pixels per row?\n*   How many times is a pixel colored?\n\nNone of these work for all examples. Then I think: is the number of pixels in the 3x3 grid directly related to horizontal length?\n\nI observe that the length of the segment is actually fixed per color.\n*   For color 2, the horizontal length is 2.\n*   For color 1, the horizontal length is 3.\n*   For color 3, the horizontal length is 4.\n*   For color 6, the segment will be 2 high.\n\nThe change of shape for the new instance for Color 3, it's just a variation, the general rules stay the same.\n\n**Test Case Execution**\n\nI trace the steps for the test input. First, I determine the starting point based on the color 5 marker, then I process each shape (and color), determining direction and length. For each shape I determine the position of the next segment in the output, row by row. I carefully calculate the horizontal positions given direction and length. The vertical shapes are easy, they simply stack down.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nAfter tracing, I've confirmed that the core logic is: the position of the color 5 pixel determines start position, the shape'\n\nThe problem asks us to reconstruct a path in an output grid based on a sequence of shapes found in the input grid. The input grid is divided into a pattern area (left) and a marker area (right).\n\n**Logic Derivation:**\n\n1.  **Output Grid Dimensions:** The output grid is 7 columns wide and has the same height as the input grid (19 rows).\n\n2.  **Starting Position:** A marker of color 5 is present in the input's right section. Its position determines the start of the path in the output.\n    *   Test Input 5 is at `(0, 10)`.\n    *   Output 5 position = `(0, 10 - 8) = (0, 2)`.\n\n3.  **Sequence of Shapes:** The path is constructed by reading the 3x3 shapes in the left part of the input (columns 0-6). The reading order is **Left Column (top-to-bottom) then Right Column (top-to-bottom)**.\n    *   **Left Column Shapes:**\n        1.  Row 0-2: Color 1 (Blue)\n        2.  Row 4-6: Color 2 (Red)\n        3.  Row 8-10: Color 6 (Magenta)\n        4.  Row 12-14: Color 3 (Green)\n        5.  Row 16-18: Color 6 (Magenta)\n    *   **Right Column Shapes:**\n        6.  Row 0-2: Color 1 (Blue)\n        7.  Row 4-6: Color 1 (Blue)\n        8.  Row 8-10: Color 6 (Magenta)\n        9.  Row 12-14: Color 3 (Green)\n        10. Row 16-18: Color 2 (Red)\n\n4.  **Shape Rules:** Each color corresponds to a specific path segment type defined by direction and length. Based on the solved examples:\n    *   **Color 1:** Horizontal, Direction **Right**, Length **3**.\n    *   **Color 2:** Horizontal, Direction **Left**, Length **2**.\n    *   **Color 3:** Horizontal, Direction **Left**, Length **4**. (Note: The shape variation in the test input is assumed to follow the color rule).\n    *   **Color 6:** Vertical, Length **2 rows**.\n\n5.  **Path Construction:**\n    *   **Start:** `(0, 2)` (Color 5). Current X = 2.\n    *   **Step 1 (L1, Color 1):** Row 1. Go Right 3. Range `[2, 4]`. Cells `(1,2), (1,3), (1,4)`. New X = 4.\n    *   **Step 2 (L2, Color 2):** Row 2. Go Left 2. Range `[3, 4]`.

Cells `(8,0)-(8,2)`. New X = 2.\n    *   **Step 7 (R2, Color 1):** Row 9. Go Right 3. Range `[2, 4]`. Cells `(9,2)-(9,4)`. New X = 4.\n    *   **Step 8 (R3, Color 6):** Rows 10-11. Vertical. Col 4. Cells `(10,4), (11,4)`. New X = 4.\n    *   **Step 9 (R4, Color 3):** Row 12. Go Left 4. Range `[1, 4]`. Cells `(12,1)-(12,4)`. New X = 1.\n    *   **Step 10 (R5, Color 2):** Row 13. Go Left 2. Range `[0, 1]`. Cells `(13,0), (13,1)`. New X = 0.\n    *   **Remaining Rows:** Rows 14-18 are filled with background color 0.\n\n**Output Grid Generation:**\n\n0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,1,1,0,0\n0,0,0,2,2,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,0,0,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n1,1,1,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,1,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,3,3,3,3,0,0\n2,2,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

Key attributes include color (0-6), shape type (single cell, line segment, or 3x3 pattern), orientation, and position within the grid structure.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Output grid is 7 columns wide (pattern area only) \u00d7 same height as input\n2. The 5 marker moves from input position (row, col) to output position (0, col-8)\n3. Each 3x3 shape block is classified: color 6 shapes (vertical B pattern) create VERTICAL path segments; colors 1, 2, 3 shapes create HORIZONTAL segments\n4. Shapes are traversed: left column top-to-bottom, then right column top-to-bottom\n5. A continuous path is drawn from the 5 marker using each shape's color\n6. Horizontal segments are 1 row \u00d7 2-4 cells; vertical segments are 2 rows \u00d7 1 cell\n7. Consecutive color 6 (B-type) shapes merge their vertical segments\n8. Path direction: left column shapes \u2192 path goes left; right column shapes \u2192 path goes right\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Okay, here's the gist of my current thinking:**\n\nThe user wants me to solve an ARC task, specifically, to transform a grid based on some provided examples.  I've broken this down into several sub-problems. First, I have to *understand* what the task is. It seems there are a few key components: input grids with numbers (0-9), solved example pairs, a new test input to solve, and an overall logic that includes a separator, a marker, and a few basic patterns that repeat.\n\nI am given a very specific \"hint\" or description of the transformation. I have to figure out if this is accurate, or if I have to derive the logic from scratch.\n\nI've been analyzing the first example.  I'm trying to figure out how the grid is *parsed*. It looks like it is grouped into sets of rows (\"blocks\") separated by the horizontal lines, and that there are patterns side-by-side. I'm trying to interpret the text's description as closely as possible, but it doesn't match the examples perfectly. The given rules for jumping from one block to another based on the color (value) of the pattern are a little vague.\n\nThe key I have discovered is an extra \"sequential\" number, and there is a \"mode\" dependent on the position of the gray marker. I see that the output rows are a concatenation of the left and right side patterns, which are determined by the jump rules. The patterns that determine the path are, I think, important. I'm testing the path logic very carefully, step by step, and comparing it to the actual outputs.  I am trying to confirm these rules across all the given examples. There is a specific order of visitation across blocks.\n\nI'm starting to think this is a graph traversal, where the patterns are nodes, and the color values are edges. The \"k\" parameter seems to be a jump size.  I think that maybe this \"hint\" I am given is incomplete or approximate. I have to interpret what \"Jump + k\" and all of the navigation rules truly mean. I have to test the jump size parameter, the initial marker position, and the mode rules, and all their combinations.\n\nI've found inconsistencies! The rules provided in the description *seem* reasonable, but they do not match every example. I had to start over many times and re-evaluate the navigation logic, which means re-evaluating the jump rules, step by step. I am testing the rules that I have created against multiple examples. It looks like it is Interleaved or Sequential. I see an extra pattern being included. I am working through the logic to find what I have missed. I have to deduce exactly how the output grid is assembled.\n\nI had to trace through the \"jumping logic\" several times for each example.  I have the sequence of the blocks and the exact rules. I'm building a list of patterns to render, and checking the order carefully. Once I have the list of shapes in the right order, I have to figure out where to *put* them on the output grid.\n\nThe output grid width is probably 7. The exact placement and centering of the shapes seem to depend on the *position* of a \"marker\" element.\n\nI think the column index is key. I am trying to relate the starting column offset to this \"marker\" index. I'm testing various placement methods. I am trying to determine if there is \"drift\" or \"offsets.\"\n\nThe most critical part is, perhaps, determining how the *height* of specific output shapes are generated.  The overall algorithm can now be applied to the test input.\n\nI have found a set of logic that seems consistent across the given examples and which also applies to the test input. Now, I have to carefully create the output grid for the test input.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the examples and the provided description, here is the solution:\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1.  **Parse Input**: The input grid contains pairs of 3x3 patterns separated by a vertical line of color 4 (at column 7). There are 5 such blocks (rows 0, 4, 8, 12, 16).\n    *   Block 0: Left=1, Right=1.\n    *   Block 1: Left=2, Right=1.\n    *   Block 2: Left=6, Right=6.\n    *   Block 3: Left=3, Right=3.\n    *   Block 4: Left=6, Right=2.\n2.  **Determine Mode**: The gray marker (5) is at column 10. Relative to the separator (column 7), the index is $10 - 8 = 2$ (assuming the right side starts at col 8). Since 2 is an **Even** number, the mode is **Interleaved**.\n3.  **Path Navigation (Left)**: We navigate the blocks based on the color of the Left pattern, starting at Block 0.\n    *   **Start at Block 0** (Color 1). Rule for 1 (inferred from Ex 2 start): Jump +2. Next is Block 2.\n    *   **At Block 2** (Color 6). Rule for 6 (inferred from Ex 2 mid-chain): Step +1. Next is Block 3.\n    *   **At Block 3** (Color 3). Rule for 3 (inferred from generic step logic): Step +1. Next is Block 4.\n    *   **At Block 4** (Color 6). Rule for 6 (end of grid): Stop.\n    *   **Chain**: 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4.\n4.  **Generate Draw List (Interleaved Mode)**: For each block in the chain, we add both patterns to the list. If the Left pattern is 6, we swap the order (Right, then Left). Otherwise, it's (Left, then Right).\n    *   **Block 0** (L=1, R=1): Add **1, 1**.\n    *   **Block 2** (L=6, R=6): Left is 6 -> Swap. Add **6, 6**.\n    *   **Block 3** (L=3, R=3): Add **3, 3**.\n    *   **Block 4** (L=6, R=2): Left is 6 -> Swap. Add **2, 6**.\n    *   **Final List**: 1, 1, 6, 6, 3, 3, 2, 6.\n5.  **Render**: Draw the shapes vertically on a 7-wide grid.\n    *   **Shapes**: Color 1 = Width 3 line. Color 2 = Width 2 line. Color 3 = Width 4 line. Color 6 = Vertical line (Height 2).\n    *   **Positioning**: Start at the Marker's relative column index (2) and drift left (-1) for subsequent blocks (similar to Example 3).\n        *   Block 0 (Shapes 1, 1) at Col 2.\n        *   Block 2 (Shapes 6, 6) at Col 1.\n        *   Block 3 (Shapes 3, 3) at Col 1.\n        *   Block 4 (Shapes 2, 6) at Col 0.\n\n**Output Generation**:\n*   Row 0: Marker at Col 2 (`0,0,5,0...`).\n*   Rows 1-2: Shape 1 at Col 2 (`0,0,1,1,1,0,0`).\n*   Rows 3-6: Two Shape 6s at Col 1 (`0,6,0,0...`).\n*   Rows 7-8: Two Shape 3s at Col 1 (`0,3,3,3,3,0,0`).\n*   Row 9: Shape 2 at Col 0 (`2,2,0,0...`).\n*   Rows 10-11: Shape 6 at Col 0 (`6,0,0,0...`).\n\n0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,1,1,0,0\n0,0,1,1,1,0,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,3,3,3,3,0,0\n0,3,3,3,3,0,0\n2,2,0,0,0,0,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

Separator: Vertical line of color 4.\n2.  Marker: Single pixel of color 5.\n3.  Patterns: 3x3 glyphs or simple lines in colors 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n4.  Background: Fields of color 0.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1.  **Parse Blocks**: Identify pairs of 3x3 patterns (Left/Right) at rows 0, 4, 8, etc.\n2.  **Determine Mode**: Use the relative column index ($x$) of the gray marker (5). Odd $x$ = Sequential Mode; Even $x$ = Interleaved Mode.\n3.  **Path Navigation (Left)**: Generate a chain of active blocks starting at index 0 based on Left pattern colors:\n    *   Color 1 -> Jump +2.\n    *   Color 2 -> Jump +k (k starts at 1, increments).\n    *   Color 6 -> Stop.\n4.  **Generate Draw List**:\n    *   *Sequential*: Collect Left patterns from the chain. Then, generate a Right-chain (Start at index 1 if $L_0$=2 else 0; Nav: 2->+2, 3/6->+1, 1->Stop) and collect Right patterns.\n    *   *Interleaved*: For each block in the Left-chain, add both patterns. Order is ($L, R$) normally, but ($R, L$) if Left color is 6.\n5.  **Render**: Draw shapes corresponding to the pattern colors in the generated order onto the output grid, stacking them vertically.\n    *   1: Width 3 line.\n    *   2: Width 2 line.\n    *   3: Width 4 line.\n    *   6: Vertical line.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Below is how I derived an output that is consistent with the structure shown in the examples and with the user\u2011given description (blocks, mode, draw-list, and basic rendering of shapes).\n\n---\n\n## 1. Parse the input into (Left, Right) 3\u00d73 blocks\n\nThe separator column is color `4` at column index 7 (0\u2011based).  \nLeft side spans columns 0\u20136, split into two 3\u00d73 glyphs per block:\n\n- Left glyph: columns 0\u20132\n- Right glyph: columns 4\u20136  \nBlocks are 3 rows tall, separated by a blank row (only `4` in the separator column).\n\nFor the test grid (19 rows), the blocks are:\n\n**Block 0 (rows 0\u20132)**  \nLeft (cols 0\u20132): color `1`  \nRight (cols 4\u20136): color `1`\n\n**Block 1 (rows 4\u20136)**  \nLeft: color `2`  \nRight: color `1`\n\n**Block 2 (rows 8\u201310)**  \nLeft: color `6`  \nRight: color `6`\n\n**Block 3 (rows 12\u201314)**  \nLeft: color `3`  \nRight: color `3`\n\n**Block 4 (rows 16\u201318)**  \nLeft: color `6`  \nRight: color `2`\n\nSo (L,R) color pairs per block are:\n\n- b0: (1,1)\n- b1: (2,1)\n- b2: (6,6)\n- b3: (3,3)\n- b4: (6,2)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Determine mode from marker (color 5)\n\nThe marker `5` is on the right of the separator. Its input column is:\n\nRow 0:  \n`1,1,0,0,1,1,0,4,0,0,5,0,0,0,0`  \nSo `5` is at column index 10 (0\u2011based).\n\nWe define the *relative* x index on the right side as:\n\n\\[\nx_\\text{rel} = (\\text{col of 5}) - 8 = 10 - 8 = 2\n\\]\n\nThis matches the pattern in the examples:  \n\n- Example 1: `x_rel = 1` (odd) \u2192 Sequential  \n- Example 2: `x_rel = 3` (odd) \u2192 Sequential  \n- Example 3: `x_rel = 4` (even) \u2192 Interleaved  \n\nThus for the test: `x_rel = 2` is **even**, so we are in **Interleaved Mode**.\n\nThe output marker position is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{out\\_col\\_5} = x_\\text{rel} = 2\n\\]\n\nSo on the output, row 0 will have a `5` at column 2 and zeros elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Decide block order (Left-chain) in Interleaved mode\n\nFrom the examples, in interleaved mode (Example 3) all blocks are used once, and blocks whose left color is `6` are processed last, preserving vertical order within each group. This matches Example 3\u2019s observed order [0,2,1].\n\nApply that to the test:\n\nLeft colors per block:  \n`[1, 2, 6, 3, 6]`\n\n- Non\u20116 Left blocks (in original order): indices `[0, 1, 3]`\n- 6\u2011Left blocks (in original order): indices `[2, 4]`\n\nSo the **Left-chain order** is:\n\n\\[\n[0, 1, 3, 2, 4]\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## 4. Build the draw list (Interleaved)\n\nIn interleaved mode, for each block index `i` in the Left-chain:\n\n- If `L_i \u2260 6`: append patterns in order `(L_i, R_i)`  \n- If `L_i = 6`: append in order `(R_i, L_i)` (swap when left is 6)\n\nUsing (L,R) from step 1 and Left-chain `[0,1,3,2,4]`:\n\n- Block 0: (1,1), L\u22606 \u2192 `(L0,R0)` \u2192 `1,1`\n- Block 1: (2,1), L\u22606 \u2192 `(L1,R1)` \u2192 `2,1`\n- Block 3: (3,3), L\u22606 \u2192 `(L3,R3)` \u2192 `3,3`\n- Block 2: (6,6), L=6 \u2192 `(R2,L2)` \u2192 `6,6`\n- Block 4: (6,2), L=6 \u2192 `(R4,L4)` \u2192 `2,6`\n\nConcatenating:\n\n**Draw list of colors:**\n\n\\[\n[1,\\;1,\\;2,\\;1,\\;3,\\;3,\\;6,\\;6,\\;2,\\;6]\n\\]\n\nEach element corresponds to one primitive shape to draw (line or vertical segment).\n\n---\n\n## 5. Rendering rules and vertical stacking\n\nFollowing the description and examples:\n\n- Color `1` \u2192 horizontal line of width 3.\n- Color `2` \u2192 horizontal line of width 2.\n- Color `3` \u2192 horizontal line of width 4.\n- Color `6` \u2192 vertical line of height 2.\n- Shapes are drawn from top to bottom on the output, starting from row 1 (row 0 holds the marker).  \n  - Horizontal shapes consume 1 row each.\n  - Vertical shapes consume 2 consecutive rows.\n\nWidth of output is always 7 columns. To keep things simple and consistent, we horizontally center the lines in a fixed way:\n\n- Color 1 (width 3): columns 2\u20134.\n- Color 2 (width 2): columns 2\u20133.\n- Color 3 (width 4): columns 1\u20134.\n- Color 6 vertical: column 4.\n\nThen we stack according to the draw list.\n\nStart `row = 1`:\n\n1. Color 1 \u2192 row 1, cols 2\u20134 = `1 1 1` \u2192 row=2\n2. Color 1 \u2192 row 2, cols 2\u20134 \u2192 row=3\n3. Color 2 \u2192 row 3, cols 2\u20133 = `2 2` \u2192 row=4\n4. Color 1 \u2192 row 4, cols 2\u20134 \u2192 row=5\n5. Color 3 \u2192 row 5, cols 1\u20134 = `3 3 3 3` \u2192 row=6\n6. Color 3 \u2192 row 6, cols 1\u20134 \u2192 row=7\n7.

Background: Fields of color 0.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1.  **Parse Blocks**: Identify pairs of 3x3 patterns (Left/Right) at rows 0, 4, 8, etc.\n2.  **Determine Mode**: Use the relative column index ($x$) of the gray marker (5). Odd $x$ = Sequential Mode; Even $x$ = Interleaved Mode.\n3.  **Path Navigation (Left)**: Generate a chain of active blocks starting at index 0 based on Left pattern colors:\n    *   Color 1 -> Jump +2.\n    *   Color 2 -> Jump +k (k starts at 1, increments).\n    *   Color 6 -> Stop.\n4.  **Generate Draw List**:\n    *   *Sequential*: Collect Left patterns from the chain. Then, generate a Right-chain (Start at index 1 if $L_0$=2 else 0; Nav: 2->+2, 3/6->+1, 1->Stop) and collect Right patterns.\n    *   *Interleaved*: For each block in the Left-chain, add both patterns.

Got it.\n\nFirst, I always begin by quickly scanning each grid. I'm looking for patterns, common features, anything that stands out.  Right off the bat, I notice a few things. Sometimes there's a vertical line running down the middle - color 4.  That seems to separate the grid into two zones. Then, there's almost always a single pixel, color 5, kind of floating around near the top.\n\nNext, I look at the color clusters. There are groups of pixels, but they aren't random. In some grids, these clusters form distinct 3x3 shapes using colors 1, 2, 3, and 6. I'd call these \"glyph-like.\" They're stacked vertically if the grids have a separator or simply clustered together if the grid is smaller. But I need to be careful with the smaller grids; those shapes aren't perfect 3x3s. Sometimes they are simple lines or small blocks. So it's best to generalize that the shapes are monochromatic and formed from lines/ blocks.\n\nFinally, I have to account for the empty space (color 0). It acts as the background.\n\nSo, boiling it down, I see four basic object types:  a vertical separator (color 4), a lone marker (color 5),  monochromatic lines/ blocks or more structured 3x3 glyphs (colors 1, 2, 3, 6), and the background (color 0). I'm confident in those descriptions; they cover all the variations I see across the grids.  It's a straightforward description without inferring any special relationships between them.\n\nHere's the `<objects_summary>` I'd give:\n\n<objects_summary>\n1.  Separator: Vertical line of color 4.\n2.  Marker: Single pixel of color 5.\n3.  Patterns: 3x3 glyphs or simple lines in colors 1, 2, 3, and 6.\n4.  Background: Fields of color 0.\n</objects_summary>",

                "response": "**My thought process in tackling this challenge involves meticulously dissecting the provided examples and inferring the underlying rules governing the transformations between input and output grids.**\n\nFirstly, I focus on the structure of the input, noting the paired 3x3 colored patterns within the left section and the significance of the gray pixel (5) in the right section as a marker. The output, with its narrow width, appears to be a composite of shapes, possibly derived from these input patterns.\n\nMy initial hypothesis centered around examining the input shape \"numbers\" and their relationship to the output. This was quickly discarded. I moved onto an analysis of the marker (5) to the shapes of the output. I also determined that there was an interleaved system between the 3x3 blocks.\n\nThrough careful comparison of multiple examples, I started to form a more concrete picture of the logic. The key seems to lie in the marker's position (x coordinate relative to separator), which dictates the mode of operation. If the marker is at an odd column number, the system works in a sequential or phase-based manner. If the marker is at an even column number, the system works in an interleaved manner.\n\nThe colors within the 3x3 blocks are seen as commands of a state machine to create the resulting output shape.\n\nFor odd mode:\n*   First, a chain is created by following rules set out by the left color.\n*   Second, the rights of the chain are executed.\n\nFor even mode:\n*   The system executes the left, and then the right.\n\nThe central component of the transformations involves a block-based navigation system. Each block represents a node in a kind of graph.\n*   The `Left` and `Right` colors represent instructions on the chain.\n*   There's also some state machine where the number of times a certain state has been entered, effects the next path that is chosen.\n\nThese insights have been reached through repeated analysis and synthesis of information, which should allow for a solution based on this complex transformation pattern.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the input and output grids, the transformations involve interpreting the 3x3 pixel patterns in the input as instructions to draw a path in the output. The input is divided into a sequence of \"Blocks\" (pairs of patterns, Left and Right) found at vertical intervals (rows 0, 4, 8, etc.). A marker pixel (color 5) in the right section of the input determines the execution mode and starting parameters.\n\nHere are the identified transformations:\n\n1.  **Grid Parsing**:\n    *   The input is parsed into a list of **Blocks**. Each block $B_i$ (where $i$ is the index 0, 1, 2...) consists of a Left Pattern ($L_i$) and a Right Pattern ($R_i$).\n    *   The column index of the **Marker** (color 5) relative to the separator (column 7) is identified as $x$.\n        *   If $x$ is **Odd** (1, 3...), the mode is **Sequential** (Lefts then Rights).\n        *   If $x$ is **Even** (2, 4...), the mode is **Interleaved** (Left/Right per block).\n\n2.  **Navigation Logic (Chain Generation)**:\n    *   A sequence of blocks (the \"L-Chain\") is determined starting from Block 0. The next block is determined by the color of the current block's Left Pattern ($C_L$):\n        *   If $C_L = 1$: Jump forward 2 blocks ($+2$).\n        *   If $C_L = 2$: Jump forward $k$ blocks, where $k$ starts at 1 and increments by 1 for each consecutive block with $C_L = 2$ encountered.\n        *   If $C_L = 6$: Stop navigation.\n\n3.  **Execution Sequence Generation**:\n    *   **Sequential Mode (Odd Marker)**:\n        1.  Add $L_i$ for every block in the L-Chain to the execution list.\n        2.  Determine the starting block for the Right patterns. If $L_0$ color is 2, start at the second block of the L-Chain ($B_{next}$); otherwise, start at $B_0$.\n        3.  Follow a separate navigation logic for Right patterns based on Right Pattern color ($C_R$):\n            *   $C_R = 2$: Jump $+2$.\n            *   $C_R = 3$ or $6$: Jump $+1$.\n            *   $C_R = 1$: Stop.\n        4.  Add $R_i$ for every block in this R-Chain to the execution list.\n    *   **Interleaved Mode (Even Marker)**:\n        1.  Iterate through the L-Chain.\n        2.  For each block, check $L_i$ color:\n            *   If $L_i$ color is **6**: Add $R_i$ then $L_i$ to the execution list (Swap).\n            *   Otherwise: Add $L_i$ then $R_i$.\n\n4.  **Rendering (Drawing)**:\n    *   The output grid is constructed by processing the execution list sequentially.\n    *   Each pattern corresponds to a specific shape drawn downwards from the previous position (or start position defined by the marker):\n        *   **Color 1**: Horizontal bar of width 3 (`1,1,1`).\n        *   **Color 2**: Horizontal bar of width 2 (`2,2`).\n        *   **Color 3**: Horizontal bar of width 4 (`3,3,3,3`).\n        *   **Color 6**: Vertical bar of height 4 (`6` stacked vertically), or width 1.\n    *   The shapes connect to form a continuous path.\n\n<transformation_summary>\n1.  **Parse Blocks**: Identify pairs of 3x3 patterns (Left/Right) at rows 0, 4, 8, etc.\n2.  **Determine Mode**: Use the relative column index ($x$) of the gray marker (5). Odd $x$ = Sequential Mode; Even $x$ = Interleaved Mode.\n3.  **Path Navigation (Left)**: Generate a chain of active blocks starting at index 0 based on Left pattern colors:\n    *   Color 1 -> Jump +2.\n    *   Color 2 -> Jump +k (k starts at 1, increments).\n    *   Color 6 -> Stop.\n4.  **Generate Draw List**:\n    *   *Sequential*: Collect Left patterns from the chain. Then, generate a Right-chain (Start at index 1 if $L_0$=2 else 0; Nav: 2->+2, 3/6->+1, 1->Stop) and collect Right patterns.\n    *   *Interleaved*: For each block in the Left-chain, add both patterns. Order is ($L, R$) normally, but ($R, L$) if Left color is 6.\n5.  **Render**: Draw shapes corresponding to the pattern colors in the generated order onto the output grid, stacking them vertically.\n    *   1: Width 3 line.\n    *   2: Width 2 line.\n    *   3: Width 4 line.\n    *   6: Vertical line.\n</transformation_summary>",
