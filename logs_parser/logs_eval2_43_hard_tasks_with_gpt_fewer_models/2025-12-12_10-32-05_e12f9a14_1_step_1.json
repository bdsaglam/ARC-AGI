        "Full raw LLM response": "**My Initial Thoughts and Approach**\n\nOkay, the user wants me to solve an ARC task, likely involving the creation of a transformation rule based on given input-output examples. My strategy is to meticulously analyze these examples, looking for recurring patterns and relationships between the input grids and their corresponding outputs. I'll need to pay close attention to colors, shapes, and their relative positions, as well as how they change or interact in the output. I'll take notes, build hypotheses, and test them with each example. I'm going to start with a systematic examination.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis**\n\nFirst, I examined Example 1. I quickly noted the 8 background color (teal, in the input image) and the shapes composed of green (3) and inner colors. Specifically, I focused on the top three roughly square shapes with inner maroon, blue, and yellow regions. The key here seemed to be that the shape cores, or inner filled parts, were different colors.\n\nI took the grid coordinates of a diamond-like shape (3s with a central 9) and looked at the output. I noticed a strong correlation between these filled regions in the input and diagonals or \"trails\" of the respective colors emanating from those locations in the output. I also noticed that the trails' colors (maroon, blue, and yellow) matched the inner colors of the top three input shapes. This suggests that the color of the output stream relates to the core color of the shapes in the input. Also, the shape with the maroon (9) core, had a 9 stream in the output. The direction of the line was top right to bottom left.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis**\n\nMoving to Example 2, which was smaller, I dug deeper into what caused the creation of colored diagonal lines.  It still featured an 8 background and the primary shape was made of 3s (green) with a yellow core (4). The output shows a diagonal line of 4s. The shape itself looks partly changed, and partly copied.\n\nNow, I zeroed in on the shape frame (green) and what seemed like \"leaks\" of the inner color through gaps in the shape's green boundary. I thought about the 3's framing the shape, and where there was a background 8 inside the area of the 3's. I hypothesized that if a part of the shape's boundary was open (i.e. not a 3), the inner color would spill into this gap, and create the diagonal lines. Then I realized there was more than just a leak, it was diagonal, and a reflection. I also saw that the 4 diagonal expanded from (2,3) both vertically and horizontally. Then I realized the key was the corner. This lead to a rule about the corner gaps, and diagonal lines.\n\n**Testing the Hypothesis**\n\nTo test this hypothesis, I meticulously examined Example 2 again, calculating the shape and looking at all eight possible directions around the core. I realized the core 4 was spreading. The gaps were the key. If an 8 was on a diagonal, the 4 leaked out in that direction. This became crucial: core color can leak in all directions, but if a \"wall\" color (3) or no color (8) blocks the path, the stream of color will stop. But if the corner is open, it leaks diagonally. This seems very important.\n\nI then went back to Example 1, now with new knowledge about diagonal leakage. The shape made of 9s had gaps in the corners. Therefore the stream emitted diagonally.\n\n**More Examples and Collision**\n\nI moved onto the next examples to explore this idea further. The next examples gave more insights on the shape rules, but also something about lines, collisions and deflections. Now I started trying to find the point where the lines interacted, and how those interactions impacted the final outputs. If two streams intersected, there was an interesting reaction. In Example 3, if two streams met, they \"deflected,\" turning 45 degrees. They didn't pass through, they bounced, and a new diagonal stream resulted. It was an elastic collision; the \"meeting\" color combination created new colors, and blocked the original.\n\n**General Rule Formulation**\n\nAfter examining all the examples, I distilled the rules into a summary:\n\n1. **Source Identification**: Locate shapes with an interior and border. The interior color is the one emitting. If the wall is a background (0) or 8, then that gap becomes a source for a stream.\n2.  **Emission**: From gaps in the boundary, a stream of the interior core color is emitted. If the gap is along the orthogonal, there is a orthogonal stream. If on the diagonal, a diagonal.\n3.  **Propagation**: Streams travel in straight lines until they hit a grid edge, a wall color (8), or another stream.\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation rule is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Sources**: Look for shapes with a colored core enclosed by a boundary (wall) color (usually `8` or `3`).\n2.  **Detect Leaks**: Identify \"gaps\" in the boundary surrounding the core. A gap is a cell adjacent to the core (orthogonally or diagonally) that is not the wall color (it is the background color, `0` or `8`).\n3.  **Emit Streams**: From each gap, project a stream of the core's color in the direction outward from the core.\n    *   If the gap is orthogonal to a core pixel, the stream is orthogonal (horizontal or vertical).\n    *   If the gap is diagonal to a core pixel, the stream is diagonal.\n4.  **Handle Collisions**: Streams extend until they hit the grid edge, a wall, or another stream.\n    *   If two streams intersect at the same cell, they collide.\n    *   The intersection cell remains empty (background color).\n    *   The streams bounce/deflect at the collision point, swapping properties or turning 45 degrees to avoid each other, mimicking an elastic collision. Specifically:\n        *   An orthogonal stream hitting a diagonal stream causes both to switch types/directions such that they bounce off.\n        *   Example: Down (`D`) hitting Down-Left (`DL`) results in the `D` becoming `DL` and `DL` becoming `D` from the collision point downwards.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n**Shape A (Top-Right, Core 2, Wall 8):**\n*   **Up-Left**: Gap at (6,22).

The gap positions are also filled with the center color\n\nAnalyzing the test input shapes:\n- **2-shape** (rows 6-9, cols 22-25): Gaps at top-left (6,22), top-right (6,25), bottom-right (9,25) \u2192 2-colored diagonals\n- **3-shape** (rows 10-13, cols 4-7): Gaps at top-left (10,4), top-right (10,7), bottom-middle (13,5), bottom-right (13,7) \u2192 3-colored diagonals and downward line\n- **4-shape** (rows 10-13, cols 10-13): Gaps at top-left (10,10), top-right (10,13), bottom-left (13,10), bottom-middle (13,12) \u2192 4-colored diagonals and downward line  \n- **7-shape** (rows 24-27, cols 23-26): Gaps at top-right (24,26), right-side (26,26), bottom-middle (27,24) \u2192 7-colored diagonal, rightward line, downward line\n\n```\n4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,2,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0\n3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,8,8,2,0,0,0,0\n0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,2,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,8,8,3,0,0,4,8,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,3,8,0,0,8,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,3,8,0,0,8,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,8,3,0,0,4,8,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7\n0,4,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,7,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,8,7,7,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,8,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,8,7,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,7,0,0,0,0,0\n```",
