        "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task Analysis and Solution Strategy**\n\nThe core of this ARC task is a transformation of input grids, where specific colored patterns or individual pixels are replaced by larger, structured patterns in the output. My initial focus is on understanding the pattern-to-pattern mappings by analyzing the example inputs and outputs. \n\nI've determined that the input grid primarily contains black (0) and colored pixels (1-9). Specific colored pixels trigger a transformation, replacing them with a distinct 4x4 output pattern. I've broken down example 1 to figure this out, identifying the colors that are transformed.\n\nA key challenge is handling overlaps. Input pixels that are close together are not always individually translated and are sometimes overwritten by later/higher priority patterns. I have also found that grid cells (4x4) are an important factor. I then used examples 2 and 3 to verify this logic and build up my understanding. I have worked out that the process needs to be:\n\n1.  **Identify \"seed\" pixels**: Based on the observed transformations, it seems that there are certain pixels (colors) which will trigger the pattern drawing. (These are usually single/isolated pixels.)\n2.  **Mapping between inputs to outputs**: Each valid \"seed\" color is mapped to a predefined 4x4 pattern.\n3.  **Process seeds by reverse raster order, rejecting overlaps**: I process seeds from the bottom-right of the input grid to the top-left (this is a rule and priority). If a 4x4 pattern, resulting from a particular seed, overlaps an area that has already been occupied by a pattern generated from a higher-priority seed (i.e. processed earlier), that pattern is discarded or overwritten. (This is a priority rule.)\n\nThrough a detailed analysis of the provided examples, I have been able to map:\n\n*   2 (red) -> 4 (yellow) hollow square\n*   3 (green) -> 1 (blue) diamond\n*   5 (gray) -> 6 (magenta) \"corners\"\n*   8 (teal) -> 7 (orange) \"X\" or \"hourglass\" shape\n\nI have worked out that a 7 pixel color does not result in an output, as well as several other colors.\n\nWhen applying this to the Test Input, the only valid seed color is 8, leading to a 7 pattern. \nThe algorithm is:\n1.  Read the Test input as a grid.\n2.  Iterate, identifying all 8 pixels\n3.  The algorithm processes the pixel from the bottom row to the top rows and right column to left column, in reverse.\n4.  If the seed position in the pattern overlaps an already painted pixel, it is skipped.\n5.  If there are no pixel overlaps, render the 4x4 teal 7-pattern at the seed location in the output grid.\n\n\nThe transformation rule involves identifying \"seed\" pixels in the input grid and replacing them with specific 4x4 patterns in the output grid. The position of the seed pixel corresponds to the top-left corner of the 4x4 output pattern.\n\n**Rules inferred from examples:**\n1.  **Seeds and Patterns:**\n    *   **Input 2 (Red)** $\\rightarrow$ **Output 4 (Yellow)** Pattern: A hollow 4x4 square.\n        ```\n        4 4 4 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 0 0 4\n        4 4 4 4\n        ```\n    *   **Input 3 (Green)** $\\rightarrow$ **Output 1 (Blue)** Pattern: A diamond/hexagon shape.\n        ```\n        0 0 1 1\n        0 1 0 0\n        0 1 0 0\n        0 0 1 1\n        ```\n        *(Note: Based on Ex 2, this shape is actually defined by the blue pixels).*\n    *   **Input 5 (Gray)** $\\rightarrow$ **Output 6 (Magenta)** Pattern: 2x2 blocks in corners.\n        ```\n        6 6 0 0\n        6 6 0 0\n        0 0 6 6\n        0 0 6 6\n        ```\n    *   **Input 8 (Teal)** $\\rightarrow$ **Output 7 (Orange)** Pattern: An X or Hourglass shape.\n        ```\n        7 0 0 7\n        0 7 7 0\n        0 7 7 0\n        7 0 0 7\n        ```\n\n2.  **Conflict Resolution:**\n    *   If 4x4 patterns generated by seeds overlap, only one is kept.\n    *   The priority is determined by **reverse raster order** (bottom-to-top, right-to-left). A seed later in the reading order (or with higher row/col coordinates) takes precedence and suppresses any earlier seed that overlaps with its 4x4 area.\n    *   If a seed is suppressed, its pattern is not drawn at all.\n\n3.  **Noise Handling:**\n    *   Any pixels in the input that are not valid seeds (colors other than 2, 3, 5, 8) or are seeds that get suppressed are treated as background (0) or ignored. Existing patterns in the input (like the blocks of 6s in Ex 1 or 7s in the Test Input) are cleared.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Grid Size:** 20x20.\n*   **Seeds:** The test input contains only '8' as a valid seed color. The '7's form a pre-drawn pattern (noise) and are ignored.\n*   **Seed Locations (Color 8):**\n    *   Row 1: Cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n    *   Row 5: Cols 0, 16.\n    *   Row 9: Cols 0, 8, 16.\n    *   Row 13: Cols 0, 12, 16.\n    *   Row 17: Cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16.\n*   **Overlap Check:** None of the 4x4 regions defined by these seeds overlap vertically or horizontally. All seeds are valid.\n*   **Rendering:**\n    *   We draw the 4x4 \"Orange X\" pattern at every seed location.\n    *   The seeds at Row 17 will have their pattern cut off at Row 19 (since the grid ends at Row 19).\n\n**Output Construction:**\n\n*   **Rows 0:** All 0s.\n*   **Rows 1-4:** Pattern repeated 5 times horizontally.\n*   **Rows 5-8:** Pattern at cols 0 and 16. Middle is 0.\n*   **Rows 9-12:** Pattern at cols 0, 8, 16.\n*   **Rows 13-16:** Pattern at cols 0, 12, 16.\n*   **Rows 17-19:** Pattern repeated 5 times horizontally (only top 3 rows of the pattern visible).\n\nOutput Grid:\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Pattern identification**: The input contains a reference pattern (drawn in a specific color) and markers (single colored cells at grid positions).\n\n2. **Marker-to-pattern mapping**: Each marker color corresponds to a specific pattern:\n   - Marker 2 \u2192 Pattern 4 (hollow rectangle)\n   - Marker 3 \u2192 Pattern 1 (inverted hollow)\n   - Marker 5 \u2192 Pattern 6 (diagonal 2x2 blocks NW-SE)\n   - Marker 8 \u2192 Pattern 7 (diagonal 2x2 blocks NE-SW)\n\n3. **Output generation**: Patterns are placed at marker positions. The original reference pattern is cleared unless a marker exists at that position.\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n- Grid structure: Markers at rows 1, 5, 9, 13, 17 (4-row blocks starting from row 1)\n- Reference pattern: A 7-colored diagonal pattern at rows 5-8, cols 4-7\n- Markers: All are 8s at various positions\n- The position (5,4) contains 7 (part of the pattern), not marker 8\n\n**Marker positions (8s):**\n- Row 1: cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16\n- Row 5: cols 0, 16 (cols 4-7 has pattern 7, no marker)\n- Row 9: cols 0, 8, 16\n- Row 13: cols 0, 12, 16\n- Row 17: cols 0, 4, 8, 12, 16\n\nEach marker 8 places the 7 pattern (diagonal NE-SW):\n```\n7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7\n```\n\nThe region (5-8, 4-7) becomes zeros since there's no marker there.\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "From the examples we can see that the output is built by \u201cstamping\u201d a fixed **4\u00d74 tile** at the position of certain single colored pixels in the input (the pixel is the **top-left** of the tile). The tile depends only on the input pixel\u2019s color.\n\nThe four tiles (deduced most clearly from Example 4) are:\n\n- Input color **2** \u21d2 draw a 4\u00d74 hollow square frame of color **4**:\n  ```\n  4 4 4 4\n  4 0 0 4\n  4 0 0 4\n  4 4 4 4\n  ```\n- Input color **3** \u21d2 draw a 4\u00d74 diamond of color **1**:\n  ```\n  0 1 1 0\n  1 0 0 1\n  1 0 0 1\n  0 1 1 0\n  ```\n- Input color **5** \u21d2 draw two 2\u00d72 blocks on the diagonal in color **6**:\n  ```\n  6 6 0 0\n  6 6 0 0\n  0 0 6 6\n  0 0 6 6\n  ```\n- Input color **8** \u21d2 draw an \u201cX\u201d pattern in color **7**:\n  ```\n  7 0 0 7\n  0 7 7 0\n  0 7 7 0\n  7 0 0 7\n  ```\n\nAlso, Examples 1 and 3 show that sometimes one pixel of a \u201cmarker\u201d color is just a **label** next to an already-drawn sample tile (one cell down-right from that 4\u00d74 sample). That label pixel itself is **not** expanded. Any marker whose 4\u00d74 tile would go out of bounds is ignored.\n\n### Apply to the test\nThe test input contains many **8** pixels (so we stamp the 8\u2192(X of 7s) tile). It also contains one already-drawn 4\u00d74 X made of **7s** at rows 5\u20138, cols 4\u20137; the **8** at (9,8) is the down-right label for that sample, so we do **not** expand that particular 8. The row-17 8s are too low to fit a 4\u00d74 tile, so they are ignored.\n\nStamp the 4\u00d74 \u201cX of 7s\u201d tile at every other in-bounds 8 position.\n\n## Output grid\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",
