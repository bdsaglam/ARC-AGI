        "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition:**\n\nOkay, here we go. I'm given an ARC task with three examples and a test case, all involving 20x20 grids filled with digits 0-9. My job is to find the pattern by which the input grid is transformed to the output grid. The first thing I'll do is break the problem into smaller, manageable chunks. I'll need to analyze each example individually, looking for similarities, differences, and any recurring motifs. I know from my experience that it's often useful to think of the grid as having \"objects\" or \"agents\". So, let's start by looking at those shapes and the digit '4'.\n\n**Analyzing Example 1: Object Identification and Movement:**\n\nThe input grid has objects that seem to be \"containers\" or \"enclosures,\" mainly made up of 5s and 7s. Digits inside seem to define keys. I'm seeing that the 4s in the input, which I'll call agents, shift their positions in the output. This seems like a key behavior I need to understand.\n\n**Pattern Hunting: Movement, Directionality, and the Keys:**\n\nI'm noticing that the '4's are moving in a particular direction. For example, some moved right and some moved left. But, there seems to be a connection between what color enclosure it is in, and which direction it moves. The 'keys' at the top-left also seem relevant. I suspect they're somehow linked to the direction of movement.\n\n**Key Exploration: Decoding the Directionality:**\n\nFocusing on the keys, each appears to be a 5x5 block of a color (5 or 7 in this example) that defines direction. 1s and 2s appear within those blocks. I think these numbers might represent movement vectors somehow. I noticed that 1 = Blue and 2 = Red is the typical pattern in this kind of ARC. It's time to start interpreting the key as a direction, and the '2' as the head of an arrow.\n\n**Uncovering the Rule: Gravity and Walls:**\n\nI think the key is linked to gravity or a \"wind\" affecting the 4s. The '1's could be the body, and the '2's the head of an arrow. In the 7-enclosure key, the '1 1 2' suggests that the agent moves right. In the 5-enclosure it suggests move left. I also noticed that the agents always move until they hit a wall. In other words, the '4's keep moving in the 'wind' direction until they hit the boundary.\n\n**Extending the Rule: Arrow Head, Arrow Body:**\n\nNow I'm hypothesizing that the '1's represent the body of an arrow and the '2's represent the head. In Example 2 it means an up-right movement. Example 3 has only an up-down movement.\n\n**Test Input Application: Key Identification and Movement:**\n\nAlright, let's test this in the test input. It has color 6 at the top-left, and color 3 in the middle-bottom. I'll examine the Key.\n\n**Key 1 Analysis (Color 6): Upward Gravity:**\n\nThe key has a 2, 1 pattern in a vertical column, which I interpret as an \"Up\" movement direction, from the body (1s) to the head (2).\n\n**Key 2 Analysis (Color 3): Up-Left Gravity:**\n\nThere's no key but a shape instead. The key must be somewhere.\n\n**Rule Application: Enclosure and Obstacles:**\n\nNow I'm going to look for '4's inside enclosures formed by color 6 or color 3. I'll determine the movement direction for each agent based on the key, and then shift that '4' upwards until I hit a wall. In each step, I will need to check the grid to find if the agent's path is free.\n\n**Test Input Solution: Grid Transformation:**\n\nI'm ready to move through the test input grid, row by row. Any 4 inside an enclosure will be moved. I'll move the agents, and record where they go.\n\n**Code Verification:**\nI'm now going through the grid line by line, making sure that each location of a 4 corresponds to one step based on the rules.\n\n**Output Construction and Conclusion:**\n\nI'm constructing the final output grid, placing the '4's in their new positions and filling everything else with the original values. I've finished the transformation, and I am confident in the solution.\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the final positions of the yellow pixels (4) based on their enclosing shapes and a \"key\" that defines the transformation.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Enclosures:** The grid contains regions bounded by specific colors (e.g., 7-colored borders, 5-colored borders). Inside these regions, there are yellow pixels (4).\n2.  **Keys:** For each boundary color, there is a corresponding 5x5 \"key\" block located in the grid (usually at corners). This key contains a pattern of 1s (blue) and 2s (red).\n3.  **Pattern Decoding:**\n    *   In the keys, we observe sequences of `1, 1, 2`.\n    *   The spatial arrangement of this sequence defines a direction vector. The \"arrow\" points from the 1s towards the 2.\n    *   **Example 1 (Color 7):** The key has `1, 1, 2` arranged horizontally left-to-right. Direction: **Right**. The 4s in the 7-enclosure move right until they hit a wall.\n    *   **Example 1 (Color 5):** The key has `2, 1, 1` arranged horizontally left-to-right (which is `1, 1, 2` right-to-left). Direction: **Left**. The 4s in the 5-enclosure move left until they hit a wall.\n    *   **Example 2 (Color 5):** The key has `1, 1, 2` arranged diagonally (top-left to bottom-right). Direction: **Down-Right**.\n    *   **Example 3 (Color 5):** The key has `1, 1, 2` arranged vertically top-to-bottom. Direction: **Down**.\n4.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   Identify the color of the enclosure surrounding a yellow pixel (4).\n    *   Find the key corresponding to that color.\n    *   Determine the direction from the `1, 1, 2` pattern in the key.\n    *   Move the yellow pixel (4) in that direction step-by-step.\n    *   Stop the movement just before the pixel would overwrite a non-zero pixel (a wall). The 4 occupies the last empty (0) cell in the path.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Keys:**\n    *   **Color 6 Key (Top-Left):** Columns 1 and 3 show `2` at row 1, `1` at row 2, `1` at row 3. This corresponds to a `1, 1, 2` sequence pointing **Up**.\n    *   **Color 3 Key (Bottom-Right):** We find patterns like `(19,16)=1`, `(18,15)=1`, `(17,14)=2`. This is a diagonal line pointing **Up-Left**.\n\n2.  **Processing Yellow Pixels (4):**\n    *   **Pixel at (5, 16):** Enclosed by **6**.

The 4s inside irregular shapes move toward boundaries, with direction determined by template positions.\n\n**Key observations from examples:**\n\n- **Example 1**: Two templates (7-bordered top-left, 5-bordered top-right). 4s in 7-shapes move RIGHT (toward 5-template), 4s in 5-shapes move LEFT (toward 7-template).\n\n- **Example 3**: Single 5-template at top-right. 4s move DOWN (away from template).\n\n**Test input analysis:**\n\n- **6-template** at top-left (rows 0-4, cols 0-4)\n- **3-template** at bottom-right (rows 14-19, cols 13-19)\n- **6-bordered shape** on right side with 4s at (5,16), (8,18)\n- **3-bordered shape** in middle with 4s at (7,9), (8,11), (13,6), (17,5)\n\n**Transformation rule**: 4s move toward the \"other\" template until adjacent to a boundary:\n- 6-shape 4s \u2192 move right/down (toward 3-template at bottom-right)\n- 3-shape 4s \u2192 move left/up (toward 6-template at top-left)\n\n**Tracing each 4:**\n1. (5,16) \u2192 moves right to (5,18), adjacent to 6 at col 19\n2. (8,18) \u2192 blocked right, moves down to (9,18), adjacent to 6 at row 10\n3. (7,9) \u2192 moves left to (7,3), adjacent to 3 at col 2\n4. (8,11) \u2192 moves left to (8,4), adjacent to 3 at col 3\n5. (13,6) \u2192 moves left to (13,5), adjacent to 3 at col 4\n6. (17,5) \u2192 moves left to (17,4), adjacent to 3 at col 3\n\n```\n6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,6,0,0,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,6,6,6,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,0,4,6\n0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,4,6\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3\n0,0,3,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### Inferred rule from the examples\n\n1. **Find the \u201cdirection key\u201d for each moving color.**  \n   In every puzzle there is at least one solid rectangular block of some color (e.g. 5, 7, \u2026) that contains some **1** cells and **2** cells inside it.  \n   For that block\u2019s color, the **movement direction** is the direction **from the center (centroid) of all 1-cells to the center of all 2-cells**, reduced to a step in `{\u22121,0,1}` for row and column (so it becomes one of the 8 grid directions).\n\n2. **Assign each 4-pixel to one of those colors.**  \n   For each cell with value **4**, look for the nearest non-background, non-4 cell; the **color of that nearest cell** is the color whose direction key this 4 will use.\n\n3. **Slide the 4 in that direction until blocked.**  \n   Move the 4 step-by-step through **0** cells in its direction until the next step would hit a **non-zero** cell (or the edge).  \n   Place the 4 in the last valid 0-cell before the obstacle; set its original position to 0.  \n   (All other cells stay unchanged.)\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\n- The **6-block** at the top-left has **2s above 1s**, so direction for color **6** is **up** `(\u22121,0)`.\n- The **3-block** at the bottom-right has **2s up-left of the 1s**, so direction for color **3** is **up-left** `(\u22121,\u22121)`.\n\nMoving the 4s accordingly gives the grid below.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n6,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,2,6,2,6,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,6,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,6,0,4,6\n6,1,6,1,6,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,6,6,6,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,0,4,0,0,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,6,0,0,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,6,6,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,6,0,0,6\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,6,6,0,6\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,3,3,3,2,3,3,3\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,2,3,3,1,3,3\n0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,3,1,3\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,1,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3",
