        "Full raw LLM response": "**Analyzing and Solving the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task. My job is to figure out the rule that transforms the input to the output. I'm given several solved examples and a test case. Let's dig in.\n\nFirst, I examine Example 1. It's a grid with a bunch of zeros and some colorful shapes, including gray ones. I start by tracing the positions and patterns of these shapes. The colored shapes seem to stack in columns. I notice the gray pixels form a specific shape, maybe the output's structure?  Let's check the output and see if this gray pattern has any structural resemblance.\n\nThe output for example 1 is also a grid with a basic pattern that looks like the number '2' if we think of it as a connected line or snake. I start to wonder if the color and shape have any connection. \n\nSo now I look at the color and the layout in example 1. The output has a '2' shape in red. There's also a red object in the input. Let's check: I'm trying to determine if the output's shape is somehow generated from the input's red shape. The red shape has several segments, but the output's shape does not match.\n\nI return my focus to the gray shape in example 1, it's 3 rows high and 6 columns wide and has a bounding box. Let's compare the bounding box size to the output. That could be a clue. The outputs for example 1 is 3 rows and 6 columns, so they have the same dimension. I'm wondering if the grey box defines a section, or a template somehow.\n\nI look at Example 2. Here, I see the output is just two columns wide and really long, with different colors. It's almost like a vertical slice of the input. I pay closer attention to the gray pixels to see if this explains the column-based approach. The output contains colors not only present in the input but also other colors. The layout is vertical. Looking closer, there seem to be repeating vertical patterns or columns in the input. And the color arrangement in these columns matches the output's row order. It looks like it.\n\nI focus in on Example 2 and identify the two output columns. I want to see how these two target columns relate to the gray pixels. The grey pixels seem to span the range from top to bottom. It's almost like they define the row range that we will pull the information from.\n\nOkay, let's explore this further. I now go back to Example 1, thinking the gray pixels might be indicating a bounding box or \"selector.\" The gray shape here is also the same height as the output. I also verify that there is no obvious pattern matching in the gray shape, but maybe the 5s select the region and some operations are done with it?\n\nI now focus in on Example 1 and, while there's no obvious mapping between the gray shape and the output values, it's clear the gray shape specifies the output dimensions. Then the colored segments seem to have a shape and size of their own.\n\nI look closer at this hypothesis and it seems to work. The number of rows and columns come from the gray pixels of a specific color, but the actual content may or may not be the color. Let's look at more examples.\n\nI look at Example 3, and here I again see a specific shape made by gray pixels at the bottom right. And the output here is a column of a color present elsewhere in the input. I trace, pixel-by-pixel, and I notice that there are other instances of the color repeated through the output. There are markers at both the top and bottom of the same input that I trace. It seems like the output is copying the shape.\n\nThe idea begins to form, that the gray pixels are markers, and it's the target shape that has specific features.\n\nI am starting to believe the rule is: Find an object matching the markers.\n\nSo with these markers, I want to find the top and bottom of the shape and see if there are any specific structures in that part of the shape. Maybe the actual pixels inside define the output.\n\nI reexamine Example 1 with the \"marker shape\" idea. The gray pixels don't point to any specific part of another object directly. But in other examples I had a feeling that specific patterns were repeated, so the hypothesis is: are the corners of an object determined by that position? I think it makes more sense.\n\nI analyze that gray \"template\" pixel-by-pixel, as well as the output. The output grid matches the gray shape size, and the values are all 2s. The output's value is the number present in the input.\n\nMy new hypothesis: The gray pixels form the corners and\n\nBased on the solved examples, the task involves identifying a region of interest defined by \"marker\" pixels (colors 5 and/or 6) and extracting the object fully contained within the horizontal span of those markers.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1.  **Identify Markers:** In Example 1, grey (5) pixels define a 6x3 box. The output is filled with the color of the object (red '2') that fits this shape logic. In Example 2, grey markers define a vertical strip. The output is the content of the strip (from columns 13-14) that matches the marker pattern. In Example 3, grey markers at the top and bottom right define a vertical span and corner shapes. The output is the '7' object, which matches the corner patterns and vertical span.\n2.  **Apply to Test Input:**\n    *   There are grey (5) markers at the top (Rows 11-12) at columns 7,8 and 27,28.\n    *   There are magenta (6) markers at the bottom (Rows 27-29).\n    *   These markers define a bounding box with a horizontal span from column 7 to column 28.\n    *   Inside this region, there are two patterns: a repeating pattern of yellow '4's and a central object made of magenta '6's.\n    *   The '4's pattern extends beyond the markers (starting at col 5), so it is \"clipped\" or partially outside.\n    *   The '6's object (Rows 18-20) is located between columns 7 and 22 (specifically 7-22 based on the pixel counts). This object is **fully contained** within the horizontal span (7-28) defined by the markers.\n3.  **Construct Output:** The solution is to extract the '6's object.\n    *   **Row 1 (Input Row 18):** Pixels are at cols 9,10; 14,15; 19,20. Relative to start col 7: `0,0,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,0,0`.\n    *   **Row 2 (Input Row 19):** Pixels are at cols 8-11; 13-16; 18-21. Relative to col 7: `0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0`.\n    *   **Row 3 (Input Row 20):** Pixels are at cols 7-8; 11-13; 16-18; 21-22. Relative to col 7: `6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6`.\n\nThe output grid is 3 rows by 16 columns.\n\n0,0,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,6,6,0,0\n0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0\n6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify the pattern for the transformation:\n\n1. **Two 5-shaped L-markers** define the output dimensions:\n   - Top-left L: `5,5 / 5,0`\n   - Bottom-right L: `0,5 / 5,5`\n   - The span between them determines output size\n\n2. **Extract/extend the pattern** to fill the defined region based on the main colored patterns in the input.\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n\nFinding the 5-markers:\n- Top-left L at rows 11-12, cols 7-8: `5,5 / 5,0`\n- Bottom-right L at rows 11-12, cols 26-27: `0,5 / 5,5`\n\nThis defines a **2 rows \u00d7 21 columns** region (rows 11-12, cols 7-27).\n\nThe main pattern uses color 4 (rows 14-16), with a 3-row cycle. Since rows 11-12 are 3 rows above 14-15, they would have the same pattern as rows 14-15 in a continuing cycle.\n\n**Extracting the pattern at cols 7-27:**\n\nRow 14 (maps to output row 0), cols 7-27:\nLooking at row 14: `0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0`\nCols 7-27: `0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0`\n\nRow 15 (maps to output row 1), cols 7-27:\nLooking at row 15: `0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0`\nCols 7-27: `0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0,0,0`\n\n```\n0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0\n0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0,0,0\n```",
