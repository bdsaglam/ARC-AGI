        "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task: Flower and Wire Logic**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got to do: solve this ARC problem by analyzing examples and applying the pattern.  I see a \"wire\" of a specific color, and a bunch of shapes, which I'm calling \"flowers\".  These flowers are blocks with a center of one color and a border of another. The game is: some flowers disappear, some stay, and their centers might change.\n\n**Analyzing the Examples**\n\nI'm looking at how flowers interact, especially those adjacent or connected to the wire. In Example 1, I noticed that the shapes connected to a wire composed of the same color are the key. There are some \"Sender\" flowers that disappear, and their centers get \"transferred\" to \"Receiver\" flowers that stay.  In particular, a flower's border acts as an indicator, it should transfer the center color of flowers with the matching border.  I'm trying to figure out which flowers are senders and which are receivers.  This \"chain\" logic appears to be critical.\n\n**Key Observations and Hypotheses**\n\n*   **Wire as Connector:** The wire color is constant, and flowers connect by touching or being inside it. I hypothesize that the 5s act as a connector - there are no two flowers that are not connected through the 5s.\n*   **Sender vs. Receiver:**\n    *   Senders disappear.\n    *   Receivers stay.\n    *   The center values move.\n*   **Center Transfer Rules:** The border color of the Sender flowers is important because the \"value\" moves from the Sender to the Receiver.\n\n**Testing the Pattern**\n\nI carefully check each example to see if this pattern holds. In Example 2, the behavior becomes less straightforward. I think the flowers that are disconnected from the wire are the ones that should disappear. I was a bit confused by the value the 1s flower received; after more observations, I realized that the value comes from other flowers.\n\nIn Example 3, I confirmed the basic ideas and developed more precise conditions. It seems that the flowers must be in the same color for the chain to stay.\n\n**Chain Logic**\n\nI think there are flower target logic. I am trying to formalize how to determine which flower has what outcome and to where the values come from.\nThere are a set of rules:\n1.  Identify the Flowers. They have to have borders different from the centers.\n2.  Each flower targets another if the other flower has the same value.\n3.  If Flower A targets B, Flower A is a sender, Flower B may be a receiver.\n4.  If Flower Y is a receiver, it should be the center to the sending Flower. And receive the original center of the Sender.\n5.  If a Receiver IS a sender itself. It disappears, and the chain of message will disappear.\n6.  An unconnected Flower disappears. It does not transfer the value.\n\n**Applying to the Test Input**\n\nI need to apply the rules to the test input.\n\nI am analyzing the input by identifying the different shapes. I see, from the wire (color 5) and these flowers. I have four flowers. One of them should be a 4s(Center 2), the second is a 2s(center 3), the third is a 1s(center 9), and the fourth is a 7s(center 1) and the last is a 3s(center 3). From here, I need to understand what happens to their values. It looks like the flowers connect via a wire.\n\nI am going to check where each value should go and construct the output image.\n\n**Test Case Analysis**\n\nHere is what I am doing:\nI am now building the output, considering the flower that disappear.\n\n-   3s Block with center 3 is sending values to 2s block (center 3).\n-   2s Block with border 2 is sending values to 4s block (center 2).\n-   1s Block with border 1 is sending values to 7s block (center 1).\n-   7s block gets value of 9.\n-   4s block gets value of 3.\n\n**Result**\n\nI am constructing the output using the steps above.\n\n*I have completed the logic and the steps I need.*\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the logic inferred from three examples.\n\n**Inferred Logic:**\n1.  **Identify \"Flowers\"**: A Flower is a distinct shape (usually a 3x3 square or a \"+\" cross) of a specific **Border Color** with a single **Center Pixel** of a different (or same) color. The grid also contains a \"wire\" or \"structure\" of color 5, and a background of 0.\n2.  **Determine Relationships (Sender -> Receiver)**:\n    *   A Flower acts as a **Sender** if its **Border Color** matches the **Center Color** of another Flower.\n    *   The targeted Flower is the **Potential Receiver**.\n3.  **Determine Outcomes**:\n    *   **Senders** always disappear (their pixels become 0).\n    *   **Receivers** (Potential Receivers that are *not* also Senders) stay on the grid.\n    *   **Transformation**: A Receiver keeps its original border shape and color but updates its **Center Pixel** to match the **Center Color** of the Sender that targeted it.\n    *   Any Flower that is neither a Sender nor a Receiver (unconnected in this logic, though none appeared in examples) would likely behave as noise or follow the \"Sender disappears\" rule if ambiguous. In the test case, all flowers participate in chains.\n    *   The wire (color 5) persists unchanged.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n**1. Identify Flowers:**\n*   **4s Block**: Border 4, Center 2. (Location: Top-Left)\n*   **2s Block**: Border 2, Center 3. (Location: Top-Right)\n*   **1s Block**: Border 1, Center 9. (Location: Middle-Left)\n*   **7s Block**: Border 7, Center 1. (Location: Bottom-Left)\n*   **3s Block**: Border 3, Center 3. (Location: Middle-Right)\n\n**2. Map Relationships (Sender Border -> Receiver Center):**\n*   **3s (Border 3) -> 2s (Center 3)**:\n    *   Sender: 3s.\n    *   Target: 2s.\n*   **2s (Border 2) -> 4s (Center 2)**:\n    *   Sender: 2s.\n    *   Target: 4s.\n*   **1s (Border 1) -> 7s (Center 1)**:\n    *   Sender: 1s.\n    *   Target: 7s.\n*   **4s (Border 4)** -> No flower has center 4. Out-degree 0.\n*   **7s (Border 7)** -> No flower has center 7. Out-degree 0.\n\n**3. Determine Actions:**\n*   **Chain 1**: 3s -> 2s -> 4s.\n    *   **3s** is a Sender. **Disappears**.\n    *   **2s** is a Sender (targets 4s). **Disappears**. (It passes its center, 3, to 4s).\n    *   **4s** is targeted by 2s and targets no one. **Stays**.\n        *   New Center = Center of 2s = **3**.\n*   **Chain 2**: 1s -> 7s.\n    *   **1s** is a Sender. **Disappears**. (It passes its center, 9, to 7s).\n    *   **7s** is targeted by 1s and targets no one. **Stays**.\n        *   New Center = Center of 1s = **9**.\n\n**4. Construct Output Grid:**\n*   **Wire (5s)**: Remains at original positions.\n*   **4s Block**: Remains at original position (Top-Left), Center becomes 3.\n*   **7s Block**: Remains at original position (Bottom-Left), Center becomes 9.\n*   **2s, 1s, 3s Blocks**: Replaced by 0s.\n*   **Background**: 0s.\n\n**Output Grid Details:**\n*   Row 0: All 0s (2s block removed).\n*   Row 1: `0,0,4,0...` (Top of 4s block).\n*   Row 2: `0,4,3,4...` (Middle of 4s block, center updated to 3).\n*   Row 3: `0,0,4,0...` (Bottom of 4s block) + Wire pixel `5` at col 7.\n*   Row 4: Wire `5` at col 6.\n*   Row 5: Wire `5` at col 6. (1s and 3s blocks removed).\n*   Row 6: `0,7,0...` (Top of 7s block) + Wire `5`.\n*   Row 7: `7,9,7...` (Middle of 7s block, center updated to 9) + Wire `5`.\n*   Row 8: `0,7,0...` (Bottom of 7s block) + Wire `5`s.\n*   Row 9: Wire `5`s.\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,4,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,5,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n7,9,7,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,7,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0",

Each grid contains multiple 3x3 cross-shaped patterns with a colored \"border\" (plus sign shape) and a different colored center\n2. The 5s form a boundary that separates the grid into regions\n3. Blocks \"inside\" the boundary are removed (set to 0)\n4. Blocks \"outside\" the boundary are kept, but their centers are transformed\n5. The transformation rule: For a kept block with center color X, find the removed block whose border color equals X, then replace the center with that removed block's center value\n\n**Identifying blocks in test input:**\n- Block 1: Border 4, center 2 at position (2,2) - rows 1-3, cols 1-3\n- Block 2: Border 2, center 3 at position (1,7) - rows 0-2, cols 6-8  \n- Block 3: Border 1, center 9 at position (6,4) - rows 5-7, cols 3-5\n- Block 4: Border 7, center 1 at position (7,1) - rows 6-8, cols 0-2\n- There's also a cross of 3s at (6,8) that stays unchanged\n\n**Determining inside/outside using transformation logic:**\nTesting which 2-2 split makes the transformation work:\n- Blocks 2,3 inside \u2192 Blocks 1,4 outside works:\n  - Block 1 (center 2): Find removed block with border 2 \u2192 Block 2 has center 3 \u2192 new center = 3 \u2713\n  - Block 4 (center 1): Find removed block with border 1 \u2192 Block 3 has center 9 \u2192 new center = 9 \u2713\n\n**Applying transformations:**\n- Remove Block 2 (the 2s and 3 at rows 0-2, cols 6-8)\n- Remove Block 3 (the 1s and 9 at rows 5-7, cols 3-5)\n- Block 1: Change center from 2 to 3\n- Block 4: Change center from 1 to 9\n- Keep 5s boundary and the 3s cross unchanged\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,4,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,5,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,3,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,5,3,3,3\n7,9,7,0,0,0,5,0,3,0\n0,7,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0\n```",
