            "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**\n\nAlright, the task is to solve an ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) puzzle.  I need to provide a complete solution, including an explanation, but I'm explicitly instructed *not* to provide any intermediate CoT (chain-of-thought) steps or reasoning. Hmm, that's a bit tricky! The prompt also has contradictory instructions. I need to be careful to ensure that my approach aligns with this nuanced set of directives. Let's break this down into smaller, manageable chunks. The goal is to figure out the rule, explain it concisely, and then apply it to the test input. I'll need to use the hidden scratchpad for my reasoning.\n\n**Pattern Recognition and Hypothesis Generation**\n\nI begin by examining the three example grids.  The key seems to be identifying the relationship between the input and output grids. My thinking is to isolate pixels of \"4\" and figure out their movement in the \"output\" grid. I notice that these \"4\"s are always located *within* enclosed shapes of another color (5 or 7, sometimes 1). The shapes 5 or 7 and 1 look like enclosures. I develop a hypothesis:  the enclosing color likely dictates a directional movement, and there is a \"Legend\" or \"Control Block\" that helps determine the movement direction and pattern.\n\n**Rule Extraction & Validation**\n\nNext, I meticulously study these \"Legend\" blocks to find clues. Each color \"5\" or \"7\" or \"1\" (the enclosure), has a corresponding 5x5 block with a distinct internal pattern. I hypothesize that the internal pattern directs how to move the 4s. I start with Example 1, where I identify a pattern like \"1 1 2\" inside blocks of 7 and 5. By carefully tracking the positions, I conclude that the \"2\" indicates the movement direction and that the \"4\"s move towards the location that the \"2\" is pointing to. I then test this hypothesis on all example grids to check if this pattern and rule are consistent and holds for all cases. I realized the final destination of the movement is always a wall, and then the algorithm steps backward to make sure that the final position doesn't collide with the wall or enclosure color.\n\n**Edge Cases & Generalization**\n\nI encounter a more complex scenario in Example 2. It introduces a diagonal movement. However, applying the same \"1, 1, 2\" pattern logic, I interpret the sequence now as diagonal, \"1 1 2\" forming a sequence.  I need to make sure to account for that. I verify this diagonal hypothesis and make sure that this still makes sense. I have to adapt my rule to account for the new direction. I have to verify that the movement in Example 3 is consistent with the rule with the appropriate new direction. I also have to account for any color that functions as the final destination wall. I need to generalize the rule so it applies to any enclosing color and any direction.\n\n**Test Input Application and Solution Construction**\n\nNow, I'm ready to tackle the test input. First, I have to re-evaluate the test input and identify all of the 4's, as well as the enclosing color. I identify that there can be multiple enclosure colors present in a grid. I meticulously locate the 4s in the test input. Then, I apply the extracted rule. For each agent (4) pixel, I determine the enclosure, the Control Block, the Direction Vector (defined by the Control Block), and project the agent's position step-by-step in the vector direction while making sure that the destination is not of the enclosure's color and stop immediately before entering a cell of color C (Wall), which is the surrounding color. Finally, to ensure I don't overlook any details, I need to create a plan that goes over each agent and test that the proposed positions match.\n\n**Output Grid generation and Verification**\n\nI will now create the final answer grid. I'll construct the final grid by starting with the original test input grid and making the minimum necessary modifications. I'll mark the final destinations of each of the 4's. The output will be the grid and then a written response explaining my thinking.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the grid by moving the yellow pixels (4), which act as \"agents\". The transformation rules are inferred from the relationship between the agents, their enclosing structures, and \"control blocks\" or \"legends\" that dictate movement direction.\n\n### Solution Logic\n\n1.  **Identify Agents and Enclosures:**\n    *   The moving objects are yellow pixels (4).\n    *   Each yellow agent is enclosed within a \"room\" or structure formed by a specific color (the \"Wall\" color).\n    *   In the test input, there are two types of enclosures:\n        *   **Gray (5) Enclosures:** Found in the top half of the grid.\n        *   **Blue (1) Enclosures:** Found in the bottom half of the grid.\n\n2.  **Decode Movement Rules from Control Blocks:**\n    *   For each enclosure color, there is a specific 5x5 \"Control Block\" that defines the direction of movement for agents in that color's rooms. The direction is determined by the internal pattern of the block, specifically the vector formed by a sequence of pixels leading to a red pixel (2).\n    *   **Gray (5) Control Block:** Located at the top-left (rows 0-4, cols 0-4).\n        *   The internal pattern contains 1s (Blue) and 2s (Red).\n        *   The sequence of `1`s leads to a `2` in a diagonal down-right direction (e.g., `1` at (2,1), `1` at (3,2), `2` at (4,3)).\n        *   **Rule:** Agents in Gray enclosures move **Diagonally Down-Right (+1, +1)**.\n    *   **Blue (1) Control Block:** Located at the bottom-left (rows 15-19, cols 0-4).\n        *   The internal pattern contains 5s (Gray) and 2s (Red).\n        *   The sequence `5, 5, 2` is arranged vertically upwards (e.g., `5` at row 18, `5` at row 17, `2` at row 16).\n        *   **Rule:** Agents in Blue enclosures move **Vertically Up (-1, 0)**.\n\n3.  **Apply Movement to Agents:**\n    *   Agents move in their defined direction until they are about to hit a wall (a pixel of their enclosure's color). They stop at the last empty cell (0) before the wall.\n\n    *   **Agent 1 (Gray Room):** Start at **(3, 11)**.\n        *   Direction: (+1, +1).\n        *   Path: (4,12) -> (5,13) -> (6,14) -> (7,15) -> (8,16).\n        *   Next step (9,17) is a wall (color 5).\n        *   **End Position: (8, 16).**\n\n    *   **Agent 2 (Gray Room):** Start at **(6, 11)**.\n        *   Direction: (+1, +1).\n        *   Path: (7,12) -> (8,13) -> (9,14).\n        *   Next step (10,15) is a wall (color 5).\n        *   **End Position: (9, 14).**\n\n    *   **Agent 3 (Blue Room):** Start at **(12, 9)**.\n        *   Direction: Up (-1, 0).\n        *   Path: (11,9).\n        *   Next step (10,9) is a wall (color 1).\n        *   **End Position: (11, 9).**\n\n    *   **Agent 4 (Blue Room):** Start at **(17, 16)**.\n        *   Direction: Up (-1, 0).\n        *   Path: (16,16) -> (15,16) -> (14,16).\n        *   Next step (13,16) is a wall (color 1).\n        *   **End Position: (14, 16).**\n\n    *   **Agent 5 (Blue Room):** Start at **(18, 11)**.\n        *   Direction: Up (-1, 0).\n        *   Path: (17,11) -> (16,11).\n        *   Next step (15,11) is a wall (color 1).\n        *   **End Position: (16, 11).**\n\n4.  **Construct Final Grid:**\n    *   Start with the input grid.\n    *   Remove the yellow pixels (4) from their original positions.\n    *   Place yellow pixels (4) at their calculated end positions.\n\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n5,5,5,1,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n5,1,5,5,1,5,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n5,5,1,5,5,2,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0\n5,5,5,2,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,5,5,5,0,4,5,5,5,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,1,1,0\n1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0\n1,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0\n1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0\n1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0\n1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**The ARC Task: A Deep Dive**\n\nOkay, here's what I've figured out. This task is all about manipulating colored grids, specifically moving yellow pixels (4s) within \"containers\" or loops defined by other colors. The core logic seems to involve these 5x5 blocks, which I'm calling \"reference blocks\" or \"keys.\"\n\n**The Reference Blocks: Decoding the Direction**\n\nThese blocks are crucial. The pattern of blue (1) and red (2) pixels *inside* the blocks dictates the direction the yellow pixels *inside* the matching color loop will move. The general rule I've nailed down:\n\n1.  Identify the 5x5 reference blocks for *each* color loop present in the grid.\n2.  Decode the direction from the `1, 1,..., 2` sequence where the `2` indicates the arrowhead of the movement.\n3. For each loop of that color, find all yellow pixels (4).\n4. Move each yellow pixel in the decoded direction as far as possible until it is adjacent to a wall (pixel of the loop's color) or the grid edge (though loops seem closed).\n\n**The Movement Rule: Move to the Wall**\n\nThe key to the movement is this: the yellow pixels move in the direction indicated by the block's pattern until they bump into the edge of the loop. It's a \"move until collision\" scenario. It\u2019s like they're sliding along until they hit a barrier.\n\n**Example 1: Putting it to the Test**\n\nLet's say, for example, the pattern inside one of the reference blocks is `1,1,2`. It\u2019s like an arrow pointing to the right. So, *all* the yellow pixels inside the matching color loop will shift to the right, one spot at a time until they are directly next to a wall. If the pattern is `2, 1, 1`, for example, the yellow pixels would move to the left in the matching loop. The pattern of 1s and 2s can be cardinal (Up, Down, Left, Right) or diagonal.\n\n**Example 2 and 3: The Pattern Holds**\n\nI checked this against the other provided examples, and the \u201cmove-to-wall\u201d rule holds up perfectly. In the second example, I had to analyze diagonals. In Example 3, I confirmed the pattern with multiple cells.\n\n**Implementation (Test Input)**\nI started with the 5x5 blocks. Then, after deciphering how to move the dots to the target, I created a final set.\n\n\nThe task involves moving yellow pixels (value 4) inside closed loops of a specific color based on a direction vector encoded in a \"reference block\" of the same color.\n\n**Logic:**\n1.  **Identify Reference Blocks:** Locate the 5x5 square blocks in the grid. Each block has a border color (e.g., Grey 5, Orange 7, Blue 1).\n2.  **Decode Direction:** Inside each reference block, there is a pattern of pixels (usually Blue 1 and Red 2, or sometimes Grey 5 and Red 2). This pattern forms an arrow or vector. The \"tail\" consists of one or more pixels, and the \"head\" (indicating the destination/direction) is a distinct pixel (often Red 2).\n    *   **Example 1:**\n        *   Orange Block: `1,1,2` horizontally. Points **Right**.\n        *   Grey Block: `2,1,1` horizontally. Points **Left**.\n    *   **Example 2:**\n        *   Grey Block: Diagonal pattern of `1`s ending in `2` at bottom-right. Points **Diagonal Down-Right**.\n    *   **Example 3:**\n        *   Grey Block: Vertical columns of `1,1,2`. Points **Down**.\n    *   **Test Input:**\n        *   **Grey Block (Top-Left):** Diagonal pattern `1` (2,1), `1` (3,2), `2` (4,3). Points **Diagonal Down-Right**.\n        *   **Blue Block (Bottom-Left):** Vertical columns in the 5x5 block (indices 1 and 3) have `5`s below `2`s (e.g., `2` at row 16, `5` at 17, 18). If we consider the progression from tail to head, it's `5,5,2` going upwards. Points **Up**. (Alternatively, looking at the layout, the \"tip\" `2` is at the top of the columns within the block).\n3.  **Move Yellow Pixels:** For each colored loop (Grey or Blue) in the grid:\n    *   Find all yellow pixels (4) contained within that loop.\n    *   Move each yellow pixel in the decoded direction (Diagonal Down-Right for Grey loop pixels, Up for Blue loop pixels).\n    *   The pixel continues moving in that direction until it is adjacent to a wall (a pixel of the loop's color).

The **direction is determined by the position of the \"2\" in the template** - the 4 moves toward that direction until it hits the boundary wall\n\nFor the test input:\n- **5-template (top-left)**: The 2s are in the bottom-right area, so 4s in 5-regions move **down-right**\n- **1-template (bottom-left)**: The 2s are at the top, so 4s in 1-regions move **up**\n\nTracing each yellow marker:\n\n1. **4 at (3,11)** in 5-region \u2192 moves down-right \u2192 stops at **(8,16)** (hits 5 wall at (9,17))\n2. **4 at (6,11)** in 5-region \u2192 moves down-right \u2192 stops at **(9,14)** (hits 5 wall at (10,15))\n3. **4 at (12,9)** in 1-region \u2192 moves up \u2192 stops at **(11,9)** (hits 1 wall at (10,9))\n4. **4 at (17,16)** in 1-region \u2192 moves up \u2192 stops at **(14,16)** (hits 1 wall at (13,16))\n5. **4 at (18,11)** in 1-region \u2192 moves up \u2192 stops at **(16,11)** (hits 1 wall at (15,11))\n\n```\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n5,5,5,1,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n5,1,5,5,1,5,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0\n5,5,1,5,5,2,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0\n5,5,5,2,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,5,5,5,0,4,5,5,5,5,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,1,1,0\n1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0\n1,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0\n1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0\n1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0\n1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "### Observations from the solved examples\n\n1. **Only the color `4` pixels move.**  \n   All other colors stay exactly the same.\n\n2. Each example contains a **\u201ccontrol panel\u201d**: a solid rectangular block (a \u201cfill\u201d color) with two other colors embedded in it.  \n   That panel encodes a **direction**.\n\n3. The direction is obtained like this:\n   - Inside the panel, look at the two non-fill colors (the \u201cmarks\u201d).\n   - The color that appears **more often** is the **tail**, the color that appears **less often** is the **head**.\n   - Compute the vector from the **centroid of the tail pixels** to the **centroid of the head pixels**.\n   - That vector always corresponds to one of the 8 grid directions (N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW).\n\n4. **Movement rule (\u201cgravity\u201d in that direction):**  \n   For every `4` pixel, slide it step-by-step in the encoded direction through `0`s until the next step would hit a **non-zero** cell (a wall/object).  \n   Place the `4` on the last `0` cell before the obstacle; its original cell becomes `0`.\n\n5. If there are multiple panels (Example 1), different groups of `4`s use different directions (they belong to different wall systems).  \n   In the test grid we also have **two panels**, so we apply each panel\u2019s direction to the `4`s in its corresponding region.\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\n#### Panel 1 (top-left, fill color `5`)\nIt matches the same pattern as Example 2, so its direction is **down-right (SE)**.\n\n#### Panel 2 (bottom-left, fill color `1`)\nInside that 5\u00d75 block, the embedded colors are `5` (4 pixels) and `2` (2 pixels).  \nTail = `5`, head = `2`, and their centroids give a direction of **up (N)**.\n\n#### Move the `4`s\n\n- `4` at (row4,col12) slides SE \u2192 stops at (row9,col17)\n- `4` at (row7,col12) slides SE \u2192 stops at (row10,col15)\n- `4` at (row13,col10) slides N \u2192 stops at (row12,col10)\n- `4` at (row18,col17) slides N \u2192 stops at (row15,col17)\n- `4` at (row19,col12) slides N \u2192 stops at (row17,col12)\n\nAll original `4` cells become `0`.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n5,5,5,1,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n5,1,5,5,1,5,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n5,5,1,5,5,2,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0  \n5,5,5,2,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5,0  \n5,5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,5,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,5,5,5,0,4,5,5,5,5,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,1,1,0  \n1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0  \n1,2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0  \n1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0  \n1,5,1,5,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0  \n1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Only the yellow 1\u00d71 markers change position; wall outlines and corner \u201cinstruction\u201d panels stay identical.\n* Each wall-color region appears to have its own corner panel (matching background color), implying independent processing per region.\n* The red/blue motifs in the corner panel likely encode a movement direction/displacement applied to yellow markers.\n* Yellow movement appears constrained by the fixed outlines/dividers, suggesting sliding/translation within enclosed spaces rather than free relocation.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**My Strategy for Solving the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm thinking about this ARC puzzle.  My goal is to figure out the rule that transforms the input grid into the output. I've been given some examples and a test input, and I need to come up with a generalized solution.\n\n1.  **Understand the Basics:** First, I'm noting the basic structure: 20x20 grids filled with numbers 0-9, representing colors. The key here seems to be that most of the grid stays the same.\n\n2.  **Focus on the Changes:** The task tells me that \"wall outlines and corner 'instruction' panels stay identical\" and that only some \"yellow 1\u00d71 markers change position.\" This means I need to focus on *why* the yellow markers move.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Examples:** I'm carefully examining the provided examples. I'm looking at how the \"walls\" (defined by a certain color) define regions. There are \"instruction panels\" attached to the walls, these must be the key.  I'm also looking for patterns in the inputs and outputs, paying close attention to where the yellow markers start and where they end up.\n\n4.  **Isolate the Instruction:** I'm analyzing the 5x5 instruction panels which are color-coded, next to the wall of the associated color. I'm focusing on the non-wall pixels inside the panel and looking for how those color patterns might relate to how the yellow markers move. I'm trying to find an internal logic (direction vector, maybe).\n\n5.  **Hypothesis Formulation:** My current working hypothesis is that the instruction panel encodes a direction for the yellow markers. This direction might be determined by the sequence of 1s and 2s within the panel, where the 2 is the 'head' of an arrow. I think the movement is \"slide until you hit a wall\", or reach the edge of the grid. This means I'll need to check for blockages.\n\n6.  **Verify and Refine:** I'm testing my hypothesis on the different examples and the new test input. If my initial hypothesis doesn't work, I'm ready to look again at what these numbers represent.\n\n7.  **Identify Directions:** I need to look at both vertical and horizontal movement and define rules that are robust. I need to make sure the direction is not subjective (is the arrow pointing up, or pointing down).\n\n8.  **Test the Rule:** With a solid rule, I need to check the test input and see if I correctly determine the movement for all yellows. I'm ready to construct an output string from the output grid for the test input and submit the answer!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the grid by moving the yellow pixels (4) based on instructions encoded in corner panels associated with the wall color enclosing the region.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Identify Regions and Panels:**\n    The grid contains regions enclosed by colored walls. In the test input, we have two main regions:\n    *   **Grey Region (Color 5):** Located at the top/right. Its \"Instruction Panel\" is the 5x5 block in the top-left corner (Rows 0-4, Cols 0-4) with background color 5.\n    *   **Blue Region (Color 1):** Located at the bottom. Its \"Instruction Panel\" is the 5x5 block in the bottom-left corner (Rows 15-19, Cols 0-4) with background color 1.\n\n2.  **Decode Instructions:**\n    The panels contain patterns of \"markers\" that define a movement vector for the yellow pixels within that region. The markers appear to be `1` (Blue) and `2` (Red) generally, or `2` (Red) and `5` (Grey) in the Blue region where Blue is the background.\n    *   **Direction Logic:** A sequence from a \"Tail\" value to a \"Head\" value defines the direction. Based on the solved examples:\n        *   Horizontal `1 ... 2` (Left to Right) means **Right**.\n        *   Vertical `1 ... 2` (Top to Bottom) means **Down**.\n        *   Vertical `2 ... 1` (Top to Bottom) means **Up** (as 2 is Head).\n        *   For the Blue region in the test input, the sequence is `2` (Top) to `5` (Bottom). Assuming `2` (Red) is always the \"Head\" (target) and the other color is the \"Tail\", `2 ... 5` with Head at Top implies an **Up** direction.\n    \n    *   **Grey Region Instruction:**\n        *   **Vertical:** Column 3 has `1` at Row 1 and `2` at Row 4. Sequence `1...2` (Top to Bottom). Direction: **Down** (+1 Y).\n        *   **Horizontal:** Row 3 has `1` at Col 2 and `2` at Col 5. Sequence `1...2` (Left to Right). Direction: **Right** (+1 X).\n        *   **Result:** Move **Diagonally Down-Right** (+1 X, +1 Y).\n\n    *   **Blue Region Instruction:**\n        *   **Vertical:** Columns 1 and 3 have `2` at Row 16 and `5`s below. Red (2) is the Head. Head is at the top. Direction: **Up** (-1 Y).\n        *   **Horizontal:** Rows are symmetric `1,2,1,2,1`. No direction.\n        *   **Result:** Move **Up** (0 X, -1 Y).\n\n3.  **Apply Movement:**\n    We slide every yellow pixel (4) in the specified direction until it hits a wall (a pixel of the region's border color) or another obstruction.\n\n    *   **Grey Region (Diagonal Down-Right):**\n        *   Yellow at **(3, 11)**: Path is (4,12) -> (5,13) -> (6,14) -> (7,15) -> (8,16). The next step (9,17) is a wall (5). Final Position: **(8, 16)**.\n        *   Yellow at **(6, 11)**: Path is (7,12) -> (8,13) -> (9,14). The next step (10,15) is a wall (5). Final Position: **(9, 14)**.\n\n    *   **Blue Region (Up):**\n        *   Yellow at **(12, 9)**: The cell above (11, 9) is a wall (1). It cannot move. Final Position: **(12, 9)**.\n        *   Yellow at **(13, 9)**: The cell above is (12, 9), occupied by the other yellow pixel (which is stuck). It cannot move.

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Only the yellow 1\u00d71 markers change position; wall outlines and corner \u201cinstruction\u201d panels stay identical.\n* Each wall-color region appears to have its own corner panel (matching background color), implying independent processing per region.\n* The red/blue motifs in the corner panel likely encode a movement direction/displacement applied to yellow markers.\n* Yellow movement appears constrained by the fixed outlines/dividers, suggesting sliding/translation within enclosed spaces rather than free relocation.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Only the yellow 1\u00d71 markers change position; wall outlines and corner \u201cinstruction\u201d panels stay identical.\n* Each wall-color region appears to have its own corner panel (matching background color), implying independent processing per region.\n* The red/blue motifs in the corner panel likely encode a movement direction/displacement applied to yellow markers.\n* Yellow movement appears constrained by the fixed outlines/dividers, suggesting sliding/translation within enclosed spaces rather than free relocation.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

Describe the observable structures**\n\nDescribe what you see **without guessing** the rule:\n\n* What objects exist? (shapes, colors, connected components)\n* How are they arranged? (locations, orientations, bounding boxes)\n* What changes from input to output? (additions, removals, movements)\n* What stays the same?

            "Full raw LLM response": "## 1. Describe the observable structures (literal)\n\n### Pair 1 (Input 1 \u2192 Output 1)\n- **Background:** predominantly black.\n- **Corner \u201cpanels\u201d:**\n  - A small **orange** rectangle in the **top-left corner**, containing small **red** and **blue** blocks arranged in two similar rows.\n  - A small **gray** rectangle in the **top-right corner**, also containing small **red** and **blue** blocks arranged in two similar rows.\n  - These corner panels appear **unchanged** from input to output.\n- **Main objects:**\n  - A large **orange** connected outline/path-like shape in the upper/left portion of the grid.\n  - A large **gray** connected outline/path-like shape spanning much of the lower/right portion.\n  - Several **yellow 1\u00d71** cells appear in black interior spaces near/inside these outlined regions.\n- **Change:** the **yellow** cells are in **different positions** in the output, while the orange/gray outlines and the corner panels appear the same.\n\n### Pair 2 (Input 2 \u2192 Output 2)\n- **Background:** black.\n- **Corner panel:** one small **gray** rectangle at the **top-right**, containing multiple **blue** and **red** 1\u00d71 cells. Panel appears **unchanged**.\n- **Main object:** one large **gray** outline/enclosure with an additional **internal gray** segment (like a \u201cpillar\u201d/divider).\n- **Yellow cells:** a small number of **yellow 1\u00d71** cells inside the gray-bounded black area.\n- **Change:** yellow cells move to **new positions**; gray walls/enclosure and corner panel stay the same.\n\n### Pair 3 (Input 3 \u2192 Output 3)\n- **Background:** black.\n- **Corner panel:** one small **gray** rectangle at the **top-right**, containing **blue** and **red** blocks arranged as two similar vertical motifs. Panel appears **unchanged**.\n- **Main object:** one large **gray** outline/enclosure with a prominent **internal horizontal gray** segment (divider).\n- **Yellow cells:** a small number of **yellow 1\u00d71** cells inside the enclosure.\n- **Change:** yellow cells are repositioned; the gray enclosure/dividers and the corner panel stay the same.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identify transformation categories\n\n- **Object movement:** **present** (yellow markers change location).\n- **Object recoloring:** **absent** (colors of existing shapes look preserved).\n- **Bordering / outlining:** **absent** (no new outlines appear).\n- **Filling holes or cavities:** **absent** (enclosures remain enclosures; no obvious filling).\n- **Removing noise / extracting main shape:** **absent**.\n- **Copying / pasting / repositioning:** **present** (repositioning of small objects).\n- **Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center):** **present** (fixed corner panels appear relevant).\n- **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors:** **maybe** (yellow is sparse and is the only moved color).\n- **Size-based filtering or selection:** **maybe** (only tiny 1\u00d71 objects are affected).\n- **Symmetry or reflection operations:** **maybe** (repositioning could be directional/symmetric, unclear).\n- **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion:** **absent**.\n- **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping:** **absent** (icons/panels don\u2019t appear to be generated; they persist).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Key non-obvious insights (crucial)\n\n1. **The corner mini-rectangles are stable \u201cinstruction-like\u201d structures**: they remain identical input\u2192output while other things change, suggesting they act as control data rather than part of the arena.\n2. **When multiple wall colors exist (pair 1), there are multiple panels** whose **background color matches** a corresponding large outline color (orange panel \u2194 orange outline; gray panel \u2194 gray outline). When only gray walls exist (pairs 2\u20133), only the gray panel appears.\n3. **Only the yellow singletons are \u201cactive\u201d objects**: outlines/walls (orange/gray) remain fixed; the transformation is localized to relocating yellow markers.\n4. **Movement seems constrained by barriers**: the walls and internal dividers remain and visually partition interior black space, implying yellow relocation happens *within* these constrained regions rather than freely across the grid.\n5. **The red/blue blocks inside the panels have consistent structured motifs** (paired/adjacent blocks), suggesting an encoding of *direction or displacement* rather than arbitrary decoration.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)\n\nThe task keeps all \u201cwall\u201d outlines (gray/orange) and the small corner panels unchanged, and **repositions the yellow markers inside the enclosed arenas**. The **red/blue pattern in each corner panel** likely encodes a **movement direction and/or displacement**; that instruction is applied to the yellow markers associated with the matching wall color region (orange-region markers use the orange panel; gray-region markers use the gray panel). A likely mechanism is either (a) **sliding/rolling** the yellow markers in an instructed direction until blocked by walls/dividers, or (b) translating them by a fixed vector derived from the red\u2192blue relationship in the panel, with collisions handled by obstacles.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Checks to perform when solving\n\n1. **Derive direction/vector from the panel**: compute the relative offset(s) between red and blue blocks (e.g., treat them as arrow tail/head) and see if that matches the observed yellow displacement.\n2. **Test \u201cslide until blocked\u201d vs \u201cfixed-step translate\u201d**: for each yellow cell, simulate movement along the derived direction, either until collision with a wall or by N steps (possibly N = length of the blue segment).\n3. **Associate panels to regions by color**: confirm that yellow cells near/within orange walls follow the orange panel\u2019s instruction and those within gray walls follow the gray panel\u2019s instruction.\n4. **Check mapping if multiple instructions exist**: if a panel contains multiple repeated motifs, test whether they correspond to multiple yellow cells (e.g., ordered by reading order) or to multiple sequential moves.\n5. **Confirm invariants**: number of yellow cells preserved, corner panels preserved, wall geometry preserved.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Summarize final insights\n\nHINT_START\n* Only the yellow 1\u00d71 markers change position; wall outlines and corner \u201cinstruction\u201d panels stay identical.\n* Each wall-color region appears to have its own corner panel (matching background color), implying independent processing per region.\n* The red/blue motifs in the corner panel likely encode a movement direction/displacement applied to yellow markers.\n* Yellow movement appears constrained by the fixed outlines/dividers, suggesting sliding/translation within enclosed spaces rather than free relocation.\nHINT_END",

\u201cstructures\u201d in color 5 and sometimes color 7 (and sometimes color 1), including solid blocks, bar/line-like runs, irregular shapes, and frame-like shapes with color 0 holes; compact bordered rectangular motifs (border in color 5/7/1) containing interior pattern pixels in color 1 and/or color 2 (and sometimes color 5); isolated single-cell marker dots in color 4 and occasional tiny accent clusters of color 1/2.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nKeep all non-4 pixels unchanged (0 background; structures in 5/7/1; motif rectangles with 1/2 stay fixed). For each motif rectangle of color C (5 or 7), derive a movement direction from the relative position of interior 1 pixels toward interior 2 pixels (one of 8 directions). Each 4 marker selects the direction from the motif whose color matches its associated/nearest structure color, then slides stepwise through 0 cells in that direction until the next step would hit a non-0 cell or the grid edge; place 4 at the last 0 cell before the block and set its original cell to 0.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Decomposition**\n\nAlright, the task is to decipher a pattern-matching puzzle within a grid, based on examples and a test input.  The core challenge appears to be figuring out how specific colors (represented by numbers) are moved around within the grid, and how these moves are determined by certain \"motifs\". Let's break this down.\n\n**Motif Identification and Direction Derivation**\n\nThe key seems to be in these \"motifs\", which are rectangular patterns containing two colors. Analyzing the examples, I'm thinking:\n*   **Identify the Motif:** Find these rectangular blocks with colored borders and internal patterns (1s and 2s or potentially a mix).\n*   **Calculate the Vector:** Figure out the direction of the color-2 relative to color-1. Where are the color-1 pixels, and where are the color-2 pixels? The general position of the \"2s\" with respect to \"1s\" is important. (Down, Right, Up, Left).\n*   **Associate Direction with Color:** This vector direction appears to be linked to the border color of the motif. It is the direction of the movement of marker dots associated with this color.\n\n**Marker Dot Tracking and Movement**\n\n*   **Marker Dot Detection:** The target elements are the \"marker dots\" (color 4). The prompt indicates these marker dots are associated with structures of a particular color.\n*   **Find the Structure:** Figure out which structure each marker belongs to. Usually, they are contained within an enclosure of the target color.\n*   **Apply the Direction:** Once the marker's structure color is known, the derived direction from the motif associated with the same color determines the move.\n\n**Movement Logic**\n\n*   **Move Through Zeroes:** Move the marker dot in the determined direction, but ONLY through pixels with the value \"0\" (empty spaces).\n*   **Stop at a Barrier:** If a move would hit a non-zero pixel (or the edge of the grid), the marker stops *just* before that. This means the destination is always the last zero before an edge.\n\n**Test Input Application**\n\nI will now apply this process to the test input:\n1.  **Identify Motifs:** Locate the specific rectangular areas to determine the direction.\n2.  **Direction** Based on the positions of \"1s\" and \"2s\" within a motif, figure out the direction and the border color.\n3.  **Trace Marker Movement:** Find the marker dots and move them following these rules.\n\n**Final Processing**\n\nI'm ready to apply all of the above to the test data. I will systematically identify markers and move them according to their corresponding derived directions. The final step is to construct the output grid with the marker dots in their new positions (old locations will be zeros).\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples and the test input, the transformation follows these rules:\n\n1.  **Identify Motif Rectangles and Determine Direction:**\n    *   Find rectangular motifs defined by a specific border color.

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nBackground color 0; large orthogonally-aligned monochrome polyomino \u201cstructures\u201d in color 5 and sometimes color 7 (and sometimes color 1), including solid blocks, bar/line-like runs, irregular shapes, and frame-like shapes with color 0 holes; compact bordered rectangular motifs (border in color 5/7/1) containing interior pattern pixels in color 1 and/or color 2 (and sometimes color 5); isolated single-cell marker dots in color 4 and occasional tiny accent clusters of color 1/2.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nKeep all non-4 pixels unchanged (0 background; structures in 5/7/1; motif rectangles with 1/2 stay fixed). For each motif rectangle of color C (5 or 7), derive a movement direction from the relative position of interior 1 pixels toward interior 2 pixels (one of 8 directions). Each 4 marker selects the direction from the motif whose color matches its associated/nearest structure color, then slides stepwise through 0 cells in that direction until the next step would hit a non-0 cell or the grid edge; place 4 at the last 0 cell before the block and set its original cell to 0.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nBackground color 0; large orthogonally-aligned monochrome polyomino \u201cstructures\u201d in color 5 and sometimes color 7 (and sometimes color 1), including solid blocks, bar/line-like runs, irregular shapes, and frame-like shapes with color 0 holes; compact bordered rectangular motifs (border in color 5/7/1) containing interior pattern pixels in color 1 and/or color 2 (and sometimes color 5); isolated single-cell marker dots in color 4 and occasional tiny accent clusters of color 1/2.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nKeep all non-4 pixels unchanged (0 background; structures in 5/7/1; motif rectangles with 1/2 stay fixed). For each motif rectangle of color C (5 or 7), derive a movement direction from the relative position of interior 1 pixels toward interior 2 pixels (one of 8 directions). Each 4 marker selects the direction from the motif whose color matches its associated/nearest structure color, then slides stepwise through 0 cells in that direction until the next step would hit a non-0 cell or the grid edge; place 4 at the last 0 cell before the block and set its original cell to 0.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

Objects Description\nBackground color 0; large orthogonally-aligned monochrome polyomino \u201cstructures\u201d in color 5 and sometimes color 7 (and sometimes color 1), including solid blocks, bar/line-like runs, irregular shapes, and frame-like shapes with color 0 holes; compact bordered rectangular motifs (border in color 5/7/1) containing interior pattern pixels in color 1 and/or color 2 (and sometimes color 5); isolated single-cell marker dots in color 4 and occasional tiny accent clusters of color 1/2.",
                "response": "### Observed object-level invariants\n- **0** is the background.\n- Large, fixed \u201cstructures\u201d made of **5** and/or **7** (and sometimes **1**) remain **unchanged** in shape, color, and position.\n- The compact rectangular \u201cmotifs/panels\u201d (border/fill in **5** or **7**) containing embedded **1**/**2** pixels remain **unchanged**.\n- The **only** pixels that change between input and output are the **single-cell markers of color 4**: their original cells become **0**, and new **4** cells appear elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n### Transformation 1 \u2014 Extract a movement direction from each rectangular motif\nFor each rectangular motif whose main color is **C \u2208 {5,7}**:\n- Use the relative placement of **1** pixels vs **2** pixels inside the motif to define a **direction**.\n- A robust way consistent with all examples:\n  - Compute a representative position for the **1** pixels (e.g., centroid/average row & col).\n  - Compute a representative position for the **2** pixels.\n  - The direction is the **sign** of the row/col difference from **1 \u2192 2**, producing one of the 8 possible step directions:\n    - (\u0394r,\u0394c) \u2208 {(-1,-1),(-1,0),(-1,1),(0,-1),(0,1),(1,-1),(1,0),(1,1)}.\n- Directions actually demonstrated:\n  - **(0,1)** (move right)\n  - **(0,-1)** (move left)\n  - **(1,0)** (move down)\n  - **(1,1)** (move down-right)\n\n---\n\n### Transformation 2 \u2014 Assign each 4-marker to a motif/direction\n- If there is only one motif, all **4** markers use its direction.\n- If there are multiple motifs (e.g., one in **7** and one in **5**), each **4** marker uses the direction from the motif whose border/fill color matches the **nearest/associated structure color** for that marker (in the examples: **4** near **7** follows the **7** motif direction; **4** near **5** follows the **5** motif direction).\n\n(Association can be interpreted as \u201cthe dominant/closest non-0 structure color around the marker\u201d or \u201cthe structure it is conceptually placed within/near\u201d.)\n\n---\n\n### Transformation 3 \u2014 Slide each 4-marker until it hits an obstacle\nFor each **4** marker, independently:\n1. Let **dir = (\u0394r,\u0394c)** from the assigned motif.\n2. Repeatedly attempt to move the marker one step in **dir** through **0** cells:\n   - While the next cell `(r+\u0394r, c+\u0394c)` exists and is **0**, advance to it.\n3. Stop when the next step would enter a **non-0** cell (any of **1,2,4,5,7,\u2026**) or leave the grid.\n4. Write **4** at the last valid **0** cell reached (the cell immediately before the blocking non-0 / boundary).\n5. Replace the original marker position with **0**.\n\nNet effect: **4** \u201cslides\u201d along the motif-defined direction until it becomes adjacent (in that direction) to a non-0 obstacle.\n\n---\n\n### Additional potential/implicit behaviors (not contradicted by examples)\n- If a **4** is already blocked immediately in its movement direction, it would stay in place (distance 0 move).\n- If multiple **4** markers would try to land on the same cell, a collision/overwrite rule would be needed (not shown in provided examples).\n\n---\n\n<transformation_summary>\nKeep all non-4 pixels unchanged (0 background; structures in 5/7/1; motif rectangles with 1/2 stay fixed). For each motif rectangle of color C (5 or 7), derive a movement direction from the relative position of interior 1 pixels toward interior 2 pixels (one of 8 directions). Each 4 marker selects the direction from the motif whose color matches its associated/nearest structure color, then slides stepwise through 0 cells in that direction until the next step would hit a non-0 cell or the grid edge; place 4 at the last 0 cell before the block and set its original cell to 0.\n</transformation_summary>",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nBackground color 0; large orthogonally-aligned monochrome polyomino \u201cstructures\u201d in color 5 and sometimes color 7 (and sometimes color 1), including solid blocks, bar/line-like runs, irregular shapes, and frame-like shapes with color 0 holes; compact bordered rectangular motifs (border in color 5/7/1) containing interior pattern pixels in color 1 and/or color 2 (and sometimes color 5); isolated single-cell marker dots in color 4 and occasional tiny accent clusters of color 1/2.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nKeep all non-4 pixels unchanged (0 background; structures in 5/7/1; motif rectangles with 1/2 stay fixed). For each motif rectangle of color C (5 or 7), derive a movement direction from the relative position of interior 1 pixels toward interior 2 pixels (one of 8 directions). Each 4 marker selects the direction from the motif whose color matches its associated/nearest structure color, then slides stepwise through 0 cells in that direction until the next step would hit a non-0 cell or the grid edge; place 4 at the last 0 cell before the block and set its original cell to 0.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
