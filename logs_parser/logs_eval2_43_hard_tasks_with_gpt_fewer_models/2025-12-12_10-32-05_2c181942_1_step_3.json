with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task Solution Strategy**\n\nThe task involves transforming input grids with colored shapes into output grids of the same size, with shapes moved and clustered. Here's my approach:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structure**: I begin by recognizing the presence of a \"hub\" in the input, usually represented by a central arrangement of small colored markers (often single pixels or small lines). The other larger colored shapes in the periphery of the grid are the \"pieces\" to be moved.\n\n2.  **Hub-Centric Approach**: The core idea is that the final output's structure is determined by the \"hub.\" In most examples, the output grid's shapes are clustered around an area, which corresponds with the \"hub\" in the input.\n\n3.  **Rotation and Attachment**: The key transformation involves rotating the peripheral shapes and attaching them to the hub. The peripheral pieces are rotated so that a specific \"connector\" part (a side that matches a hub side length and color) is now facing the hub. We will need to test all examples to find any hidden rotation rules.\n\n4.  **Connectors and Overlap/Touch**: When attaching the rotated shape to the hub, whether the resulting combined section overlaps or touches is important. In several cases, the new shapes appear to fit smoothly in the hub.\n\n5. **Test Input**: I applied the rules to a test grid to confirm the process, carefully identifying the Hub, peripheral Shapes, and their connectors. I followed the Rotation and Connect steps. The new input's answer should match the known results.\n\nThe transformation rule involves assembling a composite object in the center of the grid from scattered component shapes. \n\n**Steps to Solve:**\n1.  **Identify the Hub:** Locate the central cluster of multicolored pixels. This acts as the \"skeleton\" or \"docking station\" for the other shapes.\n    *   In the test input, the Hub is found around rows 11-14, columns 13-16.\n    *   **Hub Structure:**\n        *   **Top (Row 11):** Blue `1,1` (Indices 14, 15). Width 2.\n        *   **Bottom (Row 14):** Pink `6,6` (Indices 14, 15). Width 2.\n        *   **Left (Rows 12-13):** Yellow `4` (Index 13). Height 2.\n        *   **Right (Rows 12-13):** Red `2` (Index 16). Height 2.\n\n2.  **Identify Peripheral Shapes:** Find the large colored shapes scattered around the grid. Each shape corresponds to a side of the Hub based on color.\n    *   **Top Shape (Blue):** A diamond/cross shape at the top right.\n    *   **Bottom Shape (Pink):** A large block at the bottom left.\n    *   **Left Shape (Yellow):** A block at the bottom right.\n    *   **Right Shape (Red):** A \"Space Invader\" shape at the top left/center.\n\n3.  **Transform and Dock:** For each peripheral shape, identify the \"Connector\" side (the side matching the length of the corresponding Hub side) and rotate the shape so the Connector faces the Hub.

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Find the central cross structure**: A cross shape made of 4 different colors forming the top, bottom, left, and right edges around a 2x2 center.\n\n2. **Find scattered patterns**: Each color in the cross has a matching scattered pattern elsewhere in the grid.\n\n3. **Transform and attach**: Each scattered pattern is rotated appropriately and attached to its matching edge of the cross, extending outward. Non-matching patterns are removed.\n\n**For the test input:**\n\nCentral cross (rows 10-13, cols 13-16):\n- Top (row 10): color 1 at cols 14-15\n- Left (rows 11-12): color 4 at col 13  \n- Right (rows 11-12): color 2 at col 16\n- Bottom (row 13): color 6 at cols 14-15\n\nScattered patterns:\n- Color 1 (rows 1-4, cols 17-19): 3\u00d74 pattern \u2192 rotates to extend UP\n- Color 4 (rows 13-16, cols 20-23): 4\u00d74 pattern \u2192 rotates to extend LEFT\n- Color 2 (rows 3-6, cols 2-5): 4\u00d74 pattern \u2192 rotates to extend RIGHT\n- Color 6 (rows 17-22, cols 9-12): 4\u00d76 pattern \u2192 rotates to extend DOWN\n- Color 3 pattern: not part of cross, gets removed\n\nEach pattern is rotated 90\u00b0 and placed adjacent to its matching cross edge, with the extension connecting smoothly to the cross structure.\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### How to infer the rule\n\n1. **Background** is color **8** (almost the whole grid). The output keeps the same size and uses 8 everywhere except for a reconstructed figure.\n2. In each example there is a distinctive **\u201chub\u201d**: a **2\u00d72 block of background (8)** with **four 2-cell colored markers** around it:\n   - top: a **horizontal** 2-cell segment  \n   - bottom: a **horizontal** 2-cell segment  \n   - left: a **vertical** 2-cell segment  \n   - right: a **vertical** 2-cell segment\n3. Only the **four hub colors** matter. All other colors in the input are discarded (set to background).\n4. For each hub color, there is one additional \u201cpiece\u201d of that color elsewhere in the grid.  \n   The task is to **move each piece to the hub**, attaching it on the side indicated by the marker:\n   - top color\u2019s piece goes **above** the top marker\n   - bottom color\u2019s piece goes **below** the bottom marker\n   - left color\u2019s piece goes **left** of the left marker\n   - right color\u2019s piece goes **right** of the right marker\n5. Before attaching, each piece is **rotated (and if needed flipped)** so that the edge touching the hub is \u201cnarrow\u201d:\n   - for left/right attachments: in the piece column closest to the hub, the **top and bottom** rows are empty (so it only connects through the middle, matching the 2-cell marker)\n   - for top/bottom attachments: in the piece row closest to the hub, only the **two central cells** (aligned with the marker) are filled\n\n### Applying to the test\nThe hub is at rows **12\u201313**, cols **15\u201316** (all 8), with markers:\n- top = **1** at row 11, cols 15\u201316\n- bottom = **6** at row 14, cols 15\u201316\n- left = **4** at col 14, rows 12\u201313\n- right = **2** at col 17, rows 12\u201313\n\nWe move and rotate the other 1/2/4/6 pieces to attach to these markers and erase everything else.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",
