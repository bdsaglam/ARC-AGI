        "Full raw LLM response": "**The ARC Puzzle's Logic**\n\nAlright, let's break down this ARC problem. My goal is to figure out the pattern and apply it. It seems I need to analyze examples and then extrapolate the rule to a test case.\n\nFirstly, I'm analyzing the provided examples. It's a matter of identifying the \"objects,\" their key characteristics, and how they interact. The critical feature seems to be these 3x3 blocks within the image, or now I recognize, the diamond shaped \"crosses\". I observe that each block has a specific color in its center, which may be different from the color that surrounds it.\n\nHere's the pattern: \"Objects\" are linked to each other based on their \"Surround\" color and \"Center\" color. If the \"Surround\" color of one object matches the \"Center\" color of another, a link is created. It's like, the \"5's\" in the examples serve as this constant background that doesn't really affect any of the relationships and transformations.\n\nNow, here's what happens: these linked objects form \"chains.\" A chain is a sequence of blocks linked by that Surround-Center color matching. Some chains are longer, some are shorter, but it seems there's a limit to how long these chains can be. Any block within the chain that *points to another* (meaning the \"Surround\" of it matches something else's \"Center\") is a \"Source\" and, importantly, disappears completely. I call the end of the chain, the object that doesn't point to anything else, the \"Destination\". Any object that is *not* a source is a \"Destination\", and it stays.\n\nHere comes the twist! Those \"Destinations\" don't stay the same. If a \"Destination\" object stays, its \"Center\" color is *replaced* with the \"Center\" color of its direct predecessor. It's like the color \"moves\" along this chain, from the source to the destination. It is the original center of a block that passes to the destination object, not a previously changed one. The intermediate blocks and the start of the chain are destroyed, but not the last object.\n\nSo, the steps are pretty simple: find these object diamonds, establish the links, identify the chains, remove the sources, update the destination objects' centers, and preserve the rest of the image.\n\nThe test input seems to follow the same rules, despite a shift in the shapes from the first examples to diamond crosses. The algorithm now accounts for it. Let's see if this rule holds true. In the test, I apply the established procedure: identifying diamonds, creating the correct chain (E -> B -> A and C -> D), removing the sources, and setting the \"Center\" of the destination to the \"Original Center\" of its predecessor. I get a grid where the input colors shift based on my calculations. The 5s that are part of the original grid should stay constant.\n\nBy applying these steps carefully, I can render the final output as a transformed image, and be ready to submit my solution.\n\n\nThe problem involves identifying distinct objects in the grid, determining relationships between them based on their colors, and applying a transformation where some objects disappear and transfer their properties to others.\n\n**1. Object Identification:**\nThe objects are diamond-shaped (or cross-shaped) blocks of size 3x3. Each object consists of a **Center** pixel and 4 adjacent **Arm** pixels (up, down, left, right), all surrounded by a different color (or 0s). We can define an object by its **Surround Color** (the color of the arms) and its **Center Color**.\n\nIn the test input, we identify the following objects:\n- **Object A (Top Left):** Centered at `(2, 2)`. Surround color is **4** (Yellow). Center color is **2** (Red).\n- **Object B (Top Right):** Centered at `(1, 7)`. Surround color is **2** (Red). Center color is **3** (Green).\n- **Object C (Middle):** Centered at `(6, 4)`. Surround color is **1** (Blue). Center color is **9** (Maroon).\n- **Object D (Bottom Left):** Centered at `(7, 1)`. Surround color is **7** (Orange). Center color is **1** (Blue).\n- **Object E (Bottom Right):** Centered at `(6, 8)`. Surround color is **3** (Green). Center color is **3** (Green).\n\nAdditionally, there are static structural pixels in color **5** (Grey) scattered throughout the grid, which are preserved in all examples.\n\n**2. Determining Relationships (Chains):**\nA directed link exists from a **Source Object** to a **Destination Object** if the **Surround Color** of the Source matches the **Center Color** of the Destination.\n\nLet's find the links:\n- **A (Surround 4):** No object has Center 4. No outgoing link.\n- **B (Surround 2):** Matches **A** (Center 2). Link: **B \u2192 A**.\n- **C (Surround 1):** Matches **D** (Center 1). Link: **C \u2192 D**.\n- **D (Surround 7):** No object has Center 7. No outgoing link.\n- **E (Surround 3):** Matches **B** (Center 3). Link: **E \u2192 B**.\n\nCombining these, we get two chains:\n1. **E \u2192 B \u2192 A**\n2. **C \u2192 D**\n\n**3. Applying the Transformation:**\nBased on the solved examples, the rule for a chain is:\n- Any object that is a **Source** (has an outgoing link) disappears (pixels become 0).\n- Any object that is a **Destination** but *not* a Source (end of the chain) stays.\n- The **Center Color** of the remaining Destination object is updated to match the **original Center Color** of its immediate Predecessor in the chain.\n\nApplying this to our chains:\n\n**Chain 1: E \u2192 B \u2192 A**\n- **E** is a source. It disappears.\n- **B** is a source (for A) and destination (for E). It disappears.\n- **A** is the destination (end of chain). It stays.\n- **A's new center:** Receives the original center color of its predecessor **B**. B's center was **3**. So, A's center becomes **3**.\n\n**Chain 2: C \u2192 D**\n- **C** is a source. It disappears.\n- **D** is the destination. It stays.\n- **D's new center:** Receives the original center color of its predecessor **C**. C's center was **9**. So, D's center becomes **9**.\n\n**4. Constructing the Output:**\n- **Preserve 5s:** All grey (5) pixels from the input remain unchanged.\n- **Draw Object A:** A diamond of 4s centered at `(2, 2)` with the center pixel changed to **3**.\n- **Draw Object D:** A diamond of 7s centered at `(7, 1)` with the center pixel changed to **9**.\n- **Clear B, C, E:** The pixels corresponding to objects B, C, and E become 0.\n\n**Output Grid Details:**\n- **Row 0:** All 0s (Top of B removed).\n- **Row 1:** `0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0` (Top of A kept; B removed).\n- **Row 2:** `0,4,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0` (Middle of A with new center **3**; B removed).\n- **Row 3:** `0,0,4,0,0,0,0,5,0,0` (Bottom of A kept; 5 kept).\n- **Row 4:** `0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0` (5 kept).\n- **Row 5:** `0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0` (Top of C removed; 5 kept; Top of E removed).\n- **Row 6:** `0,7,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0` (Top of D kept; C removed; 5 kept; E removed).\n- **Row 7:** `7,9,7,0,0,0,5,0,0,0` (Middle of D with new center **9**; C removed; 5 kept; E removed).\n- **Row 8:** `0,7,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0` (Bottom of D kept; 5s kept).\n- **Row 9:** `0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0` (5s kept).\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,4,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,5,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n7,9,7,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,7,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to identify the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Analyzing the Examples:**\n\nIn each example, I notice:\n1. There are cross/plus-shaped patterns (3x3 with center and border colors)\n2. There are 5s forming boundary lines\n3. Some patterns survive with modified centers, others are removed\n\n**The Key Rule:**\nFor each pattern, if its center color matches another pattern's border color, it can receive from that pattern. The receiving pattern keeps its border but gets the donor's center value. The donor pattern is then removed.\n\nWhen conflicts occur (a pattern could be both receiver and donor), it prioritizes being a receiver.\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\nIdentifying the cross patterns:\n- Pattern at (1,7): border=2, center=3\n- Pattern at (2,2): border=4, center=2  \n- Pattern at (6,4): border=1, center=9\n- Pattern at (6,8): border=3, center=3\n- Pattern at (7,1): border=7, center=1\n\n**Finding receiver-donor pairs:**\n- (1,7) center=3 \u2192 matches (6,8) border=3 \u2192 can receive center=3 from (6,8)\n- (2,2) center=2 \u2192 matches (1,7) border=2 \u2192 wants (1,7) as donor\n- (7,1) center=1 \u2192 matches (6,4) border=1 \u2192 can receive center=9 from (6,4)\n\n**Resolving conflicts:**\n- (1,7) appears as both potential receiver and donor\n- Prioritizing receiver role: (1,7) receives from (6,8)\n- This means (1,7) can't be a donor for (2,2)\n- (2,2) has no valid donor \u2192 removed\n\n**Final survivors:**\n- (1,7): border=2, new center=3 (from (6,8))\n- (7,1): border=7, new center=9 (from (6,4))\n\nThe 5-boundary is preserved, and patterns (2,2), (6,4), and (6,8) are removed.\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,2,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,7,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n7,9,7,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\n0,7,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0\n```",
