        "Full raw LLM response": "**The Architect's Blueprint: A Geometric Assembly**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. It's an interesting challenge\u2014we're given a task based on examples where scattered shapes come together. The goal? To predict how the Test Input will be assembled.\n\nFirst, I examined the examples. What stood out? A constant background color, which I'll ignore for the most part, and various shapes with different colors. Each example seems to follow the same basic logic\u2014shapes *move* towards some sort of central axis. Now, what defines this \"axis\"? I noticed a recurring pattern of 2x1 blocks or pairs (horizontal, of the same color) that remain stationary (or \"anchors\") in the input and output. I called these \"Anchor Colors\" (e.g., Magenta and Blue in Ex. 1, Yellow in Ex. 2). The scattered shapes of other colors I tagged as the \"Mobile Colors\".\n\nPixel conservation is key! I meticulously counted the pixels for each color in the input and confirmed they appeared (rearranged) in the output. This suggests that pixels are neither created nor destroyed, but simply *reassembled* into specific configurations. So the objective becomes reassembling the pixels into known shape configurations relative to the anchoring horizontal bar.\n\nExamining the outputs, I noticed these Mobile colors seemed to always form compact, symmetric shapes, like thick crosses or rectangles around this Anchor structure. My hypothesis crystallized: the task is to rearrange the pixel composition of the shapes. Shapes with Anchor colors remain in place while the mobile color pixels arrange themselves into a recognizable shape about that anchor.\n\nIn Ex. 3, I confirmed the presence of anchor shapes in the input. In the output, the mobile pixels stack above or below the anchor structures. In the last stage, I focused on extracting the Anchor and Mobile colors from the Test input. Using the Anchor information, I constructed the blueprint. The logic is that any given \"Mobile\" color will use the Anchor for placement, and assemble a recognizable shape. I verified that the pixels aligned correctly, and that this shape formed the central part of the solution.\n\nSpecifically: Mobile pixels with the same color as the anchor extend the anchor vertically. Mobile pixels without an anchor color attach themselves to the structure and assume their placement from some other prior analysis. The \"glue\" to form a complete shape is from the Mobile pixels. This seems to hold for every example. And that's the logic!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on a pattern observed in three solved examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Pattern:**\n\n1.  **Anchors and Mobile Pixels:**\n    *   In all examples, there are specific **Anchor Shapes** that remain in their original positions or define the core structure of the output. These are identified as horizontal bars of length 2 (e.g., `1,1`, `6,6`, `4,4`) aligned in a vertical column.\n    *   All other pixels of colors that form an Anchor are considered **Mobile Anchor Pixels**. These pixels move to extend the Anchor shape vertically (upwards or downwards away from the center).\n    *   Pixels of colors that *do not* form an Anchor are **Mobile Shape Pixels**. These gather to form compact, symmetrical shapes that attach to the sides of the vertical axis defined by the Anchors.\n\n2.  **Specific Logic for Test Input:**\n    *   **Identify Anchors:**\n        *   Scanning the test input, we find two 2x1 bars aligned in the same columns (14 and 15):\n            *   **Blue (1):** Row 11, Columns 14-15 (`1,1`).\n            *   **Magenta (6):** Row 14, Columns 14-15 (`6,6`).\n        *   These define the vertical axis of the structure (Cols 14-15) and a central core spanning Rows 11-14.\n\n    *   **Process Anchor Extensions:**\n        *   **Blue (1):** The anchor is at the top (Row 11). There are 8 mobile Blue pixels in the input. These form a 2-pixel wide column extending **upwards** from the anchor.\n            *   8 pixels / width 2 = 4 rows.\n            *   Placement: Rows 7, 8, 9, 10 at Cols 14-15.\n        *   **Magenta (6):** The anchor is at the bottom (Row 14). There are 12 mobile Magenta pixels in the input. These form a 2-pixel wide column extending **downwards** from the anchor.\n            *   12 pixels / width 2 = 6 rows.\n            *   Placement: Rows 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 at Cols 14-15.\n\n    *   **Process Side Shapes:**\n        *   We have three groups of mobile pixels: Red (2), Yellow (4), and Green (3).\n        *   **Red (2):** 8 pixels. Input location is Top Left.\n            *   Shape: 8 pixels forms a `1,3,3,1` symmetrical shape (Diamond-like).\n            *   Placement: Attaches to the **Left** of the Blue Extension (top section). Rows 7-10.\n        *   **Yellow (4):** 10 pixels. Input location is Right.\n            *   Shape: 10 pixels forms a `2,3,3,2` symmetrical shape (Rounded Rectangle).\n            *   Placement: Attaches to the **Right** of the Core (central section). Rows 11-14.\n        *   **Green (3):** 7 pixels. Input location is Bottom Left.\n            *   Shape: 7 pixels forms a `2,3,2` symmetrical shape.\n            *   Placement: Attaches to the **Left** of the Magenta Extension (bottom section). Rows 15-17.\n\n3.  **Final Construction details:**\n    *   **Blue Extension:** R7-10, C14-15.\n    *   **Blue Anchor:** R11, C14-15.\n    *   **Magenta Anchor:** R14, C14-15.\n    *   **Magenta Extension:** R15-20, C14-15.\n    *   **Gap:** R12-13, C14-15 (Remains background `8,8`).\n    *   **Red Shape (Left):** R7-10, centered on C12-13.\n        *   R7/10: `2` at C13.\n        *   R8/9: `2,2,2` at C11-13.\n    *   **Yellow Shape (Right):** R11-14, centered on C16-17.\n        *   R11/14: `4,4` at C16-17.\n        *   R12/13: `4,4,4` at C16-18.\n    *   **Green Shape (Left):** R15-17, centered on C12-13.\n        *   R15: `3,3` at C12-13.\n        *   R16: `3,3,3` at C11-13.\n        *   R17: `3,3` at C12-13.\n\noutput:\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

The output keeps the same grid size and is mostly background.\n\n2. In each input there is a special **\u201ccross frame\u201d**:\n   - a **2\u00d72 background (8) empty center**, and\n   - four **2-cell markers** around it:\n     - **north**: a horizontal 2-cell segment,\n     - **south**: a horizontal 2-cell segment,\n     - **west**: a vertical 2-cell segment,\n     - **east**: a vertical 2-cell segment.  \n   These four markers have four different colors.\n\n3. For each marker color, there is another group of pixels of the **same color elsewhere** in the grid (the \u201csource piece\u201d).\n   - Take **all pixels of that color excluding the 2-cell marker**, and take their **bounding-box pattern** (it may be disconnected).\n   - **Rotate/flip** this source pattern so that its **2-cell \u201cconnector\u201d** lies on the side that will touch the marker:\n     - north arm: connector on the **bottom** edge,\n     - south arm: connector on the **top** edge,\n     - west arm: connector on the **right** edge,\n     - east arm: connector on the **left** edge.\n   - **Attach** the transformed source pattern **adjacent** to the marker **away from the center** (do not overlap the marker), aligning the connector with the marker\u2019s two cells.\n\n4. **Erase everything else** (all original source pieces disappear from their original positions). The output contains only the rebuilt enlarged cross.\n\n---\n\n### Applied to the test input\nThe 2\u00d72 empty center is at rows 11\u201312 and cols 14\u201315 (0-based), with markers:\n- North marker: color `1`\n- West marker: color `4`\n- East marker: color `2`\n- South marker: color `6`\n\nEach corresponding source piece is rotated to present a matching 2-cell connector on the correct side, then attached outward from its marker.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",
