            "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's how I cracked this ARC task:**\n\nI was presented with a problem that involved filling in a missing section (or \"hole\") in a grid, given several solved examples and a test input. My main goal was to identify the underlying pattern used to fill these holes.\n\nI began by systematically analyzing the solved examples. The inputs were 30x30 grids and the outputs were small sub-grids (like 9x4). This suggested the outputs were derived from a smaller section of the input grids. I looked for repeating patterns or symmetries within the input grids, particularly around the locations of the \"holes\" (marked by the number 8).\n\nThrough a process of elimination, I dismissed simple symmetries like vertical, horizontal, or point reflection because they didn't consistently relate the input data with the output. I also ruled out rotational symmetries as the primary mechanism.\n\nMy crucial breakthrough was recognizing a diagonal symmetry in the test input. It's an inner grid, where values from a cell's coordinates are mirrored using the equation (31 - row_index, 31 - col_index). In other words, I noticed the value at (row, col) was often the same as the value at (col, row). Diagonal symmetry explains the \"hole\" is filled from the cells located along the diagonal of the grid. It worked because the main inputs had this pattern, and using diagonal symmetry filled the holes correctly. It required checking that this held throughout the 0-29 index grid (which didn't hold in all cases).\n\nFor the Test Input, this diagonal relationship solved everything. It used the main diagonal where the values of the holes were located in the other quadrants, so the output had to use Diagonal to fill it. \n\nAfter careful verification and ensuring this diagonal symmetry matched the known solutions, I used it to derive the final output grid.\n\nThe problem asks us to infer the content of a \"missing\" region (indicated by the digit 8) in a large grid, based on the patterns found in the rest of the grid. By analyzing the solved examples, we can identify specific symmetries that govern the grid's structure.\n\n**Analysis of Symmetries:**\n1.  **Horizontal Reflection:** In several examples, there is a strong horizontal reflection symmetry where row $i$ corresponds to row $N-1-i$ (or a shifted version depending on the specific \"active\" area of the grid). For instance, in Example 2, the hole in the top rows is filled by mirroring the bottom rows. In Example 1 and the Test Input, this symmetry appears as `Row[i] == Row[31-i]` (where indices are 0-based), connecting rows with holes to valid rows on the opposite side.\n2.  **Diagonal Symmetry:** The test input exhibits a strong main diagonal symmetry ($Grid[r][c] == Grid[c][r]$) in the valid (non-hole) regions. For example, checking the intersection of row 13 and column 0 against row 0 and column 13 reveals they both contain the same value (4). This holds for multiple test points around the hole.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\nThe test input contains a region of 8s (the \"hole\") in **Rows 14 to 22** and **Columns 0 to 2**.\nTo reconstruct this region, we can use the symmetries found.\n*   **Rows 18-22:** Using the horizontal reflection symmetry ($Row[i] \\leftrightarrow Row[31-i]$), these rows map to **Rows 13-9**, which contain valid data in columns 0-2.\n    *   Row 18 maps to Row 13.\n    *   Row 19 maps to Row 12.\n    *   Row 20 maps to Row 11.\n    *   Row 21 maps to Row 10.\n    *   Row 22 maps to Row 9.\n*   **Rows 14-17:** These rows map to **Rows 17-14** under horizontal reflection, which are also part of the hole. Thus, horizontal reflection cannot supply the values. However, using the **Diagonal Symmetry** ($Grid[r][c] == Grid[c][r]$), we can fetch the missing values from **Columns 14-17** of **Rows 0-2**.\n    *   For the hole at $Grid[14][0]$, we look at $Grid[0][14]$.\n    *   For $Grid[14][1]$, we look at $Grid[1][14]$, and so on.\n\n**Step-by-Step Reconstruction:**\n\n*   **Row 14 (Hole cols 0-2):**\n    *   $Grid[14][0] \\leftarrow Grid[0][14] = 7$\n    *   $Grid[14][1] \\leftarrow Grid[1][14] = 7$\n    *   $Grid[14][2] \\leftarrow Grid[2][14] = 9$\n    *   Result: `7, 7, 9`\n\n*   **Row 15:**\n    *   $Grid[15][0] \\leftarrow Grid[0][15] = 7$\n    *   $Grid[15][1] \\leftarrow Grid[1][15] = 2$\n    *   $Grid[15][2] \\leftarrow Grid[2][15] = 9$\n    *   Result: `7, 2, 9`\n\n*   **Row 16:**\n    *   $Grid[16][0] \\leftarrow Grid[0][16] = 7$\n    *   $Grid[16][1] \\leftarrow Grid[1][16] = 2$\n    *   $Grid[16][2] \\leftarrow Grid[2][16] = 9$\n    *   Result: `7, 2, 9`\n\n*   **Row 17:**\n    *   $Grid[17][0] \\leftarrow Grid[0][17] = 7$\n    *   $Grid[17][1] \\leftarrow Grid[1][17] = 7$\n    *   $Grid[17][2] \\leftarrow Grid[2][17] = 9$\n    *   Result: `7, 7, 9`\n\n*   **Row 18:** (Using partner Row 13, cols 0-2)\n    *   $Grid[13][0..2]$ is `4, 4, 7`.\n    *   (Diagonal check: $Grid[0][18]=4, Grid[1][18]=4, Grid[2][18]=7$.

The grids have reflection symmetry around row 15.5 (row r maps to row 31-r)\n\n**Key insight:** The 8s mark a region where the grid's symmetry is \"broken.\" The task is to restore these values based on the symmetry pattern.\n\n**Transformation rules:**\n- For rows in the 8-region where the symmetric row is OUTSIDE the 8-region: copy values from the symmetric row at the same columns\n- For rows where BOTH the row and its symmetric counterpart are within the 8-region: use column reflection symmetry (column c maps to column 29-c)\n\n**Applying to test input:**\n\nThe 8-region is at rows 14-22, columns 0-2 (9\u00d73).\n\n**For rows 18-22** (symmetric counterparts rows 13-9 are outside 8-region):\n- Row 18 \u2190 Row 13, cols 0-2: 4,4,7\n- Row 19 \u2190 Row 12, cols 0-2: 4,4,7  \n- Row 20 \u2190 Row 11, cols 0-2: 6,6,1\n- Row 21 \u2190 Row 10, cols 0-2: 6,6,6\n- Row 22 \u2190 Row 9, cols 0-2: 1,6,1\n\n**For rows 14-17** (symmetric counterparts are within 8-region, use column reflection):\n- Row 14: cols 0-2 \u2190 cols 29-27 = 9,1,3\n- Row 15: cols 0-2 \u2190 cols 29-27 = 9,9,2\n- Row 16: same as row 15 = 9,9,2\n- Row 17: same as row 14 = 9,1,3\n\n```\n9,1,3\n9,9,2\n9,9,2\n9,1,3\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n6,6,1\n6,6,6\n1,6,1\n```",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**The Task: Decoding Symmetrical Grids**\n\nAlright, here's the deal: I'm staring at these grids, these colorful mosaics with a clear pattern. The goal? I gotta figure out how to \"fix\" them \u2013 specifically, a part of the grid that's messed up, usually a solid color \"block\" that breaks the visual harmony. The inputs are big and repetitive. The outputs, much smaller.\n\nMy initial observations? Inputs are like fancy carpets, symmetrical in a 4-way or 2-way fashion (like reflections!). But there's always a \"patch\" that's a single color, disrupting the balance. My job is to deduce the logic and restore the \"true\" pattern by finding a smaller region (the output), which should be what's *underneath* the patch.\n\n**The Strategy: Reflection & Symmetry (and a Dash of Continuity)**\n\nI've learned to recognize some common tools in ARC tasks.\n1.  **Vertical Symmetry**: Think top half mirrored to bottom, or vice-versa.\n2.  **Horizontal Symmetry**: Left side mirrored to the right.\n3.  **Rotation**: Clockwise or Counterclockwise by a certain angle\n4.  **Symmetry around a Diagonal Line**: like the `\\` shape mirroring the `/` shape\n\nIt seems like those simple tools are at play.  In many cases, the \"right\" parts of the grid are mirrored on the \"left.\" Sometimes, the upper part mirrors the bottom.\n\nIf I'm missing a part of the grid, it's very often *not* completely lost, but rather a perfect copy from another region.\n\nSo, here's my general workflow:\n*   First, spot the problem patch (it's usually obvious).\n*   Then, analyze the size of the Input patch and the Output grid.\n*   The \"patch\" region can be defined by some rows (vertical) and columns (horizontal).\n*   Look for a symmetrical source, using the tools above.\n*   Once I have a symmetrical correspondence between the source (clean region) and destination (patch), copy the values.\n*   If the source is corrupted as well, then this technique fails.\n\n**The Key Insight: Reflection, But With A Twist (And a bit of wrapping)**\n\nHere's the problem: The inputs aren't *always* perfect reflections. Sometimes there is an \"offset\". Sometimes the axis of symmetry is shifted to a middle point of a region. Sometimes, if the mirrored section falls inside a region which is also blocked, I have to rely on horizontal mirroring. Here, the columns are mapped from right to left with an offset. Here it seems to be defined by `c' = 31 - c`. If the target row contains the patch, then resort to this technique to retrieve the value. The column indices in this problem wrap around if they go out of bounds (mod 30). This is similar to a periodic pattern, in the sense that the last column maps to the first column. This also means that, if I want to have a good reconstruction, I should find a symmetric region around the middle and then copy this region to complete the blocked part.\n\n**Example 1: The First Puzzle**\n\nLet's say my block of \"corruption\" is found in the upper-right area of the grid. It's Rows 14-22 and Cols 25-28 and filled with the value 8. I realized that, when you have a reflection, it doesn't work if the source is occluded. Then I apply the horizontal continuity along those rows to determine the missing values.\n\nHere's my logic:\n*   Identify the block of 8s (the problematic region).\n*   My horizontal axis of symmetry is `15.5`.  Here `Row(r)` maps to `Row(31-r)`.\n*   Rows 18-22 get filled correctly as vertical reflections, mapping values from rows above.\n*   But, Rows 14-17 are inside this \"zone\", the Vertical Symmetry mapping yields corrupted cells too, so that doesn't work.\n*   The only solution is to apply horizontal continuity in these rows, i.e., copy values from $c'$ where $c' = 31 - c$.\n*   Since I am given the right side, the left side is copied.\n\n**Let's Recap, and My Solution for Test Input**\n\nI've learned that I need to find the correct symmetry axes in order to complete the occluded section. The test case has a vertical symmetry axis.\nHere are the steps to my solution:\n1. Identify the block (14-22, 0-2).\n2.  Use vertical symmetry on all rows with the formula $r' = \n\nTo solve the ARC task, I analyzed the provided examples to identify the underlying transformation rule.\n\n**Observations:**\n1.  **Input:** Large grids (typically 30x30) with complex symmetrical patterns (kaleidoscopic). Each input contains a \"corrupted\" rectangular block filled with a specific color (often 8s or another solid color) that disrupts the pattern.\n2.  **Output:** A small grid corresponding exactly to the dimensions of the corrupted block. The content of the output restores the original pattern that was occluded by the solid color block.\n3.  **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   The grids exhibit a **Vertical Reflection symmetry** across a horizontal axis. For a 30x30 grid (indices 0-29), the axis is at $y=15.5$. This means Row $r$ corresponds to Row $31-r$.\n        *   Example 1: Block at Rows 14-22. Row 22 matches Row $31-22=9$. Row 18 matches Row $31-18=13$.\n        *   Example 2: Block at Rows 2-5. Row 2 matches Row $31-2=29$.\n        *   Example 3: Block at Rows 19-21. Row 19 matches Row $31-19=12$.\n        *   Example 4: Block at Rows 7-10. Row 7 matches Row $31-7=24$.\n    *   **Handling the Center:** When the block covers the center rows (e.g., Rows 14-17 in Example 1 and the Test Input), the vertical reflection maps rows within the block to other rows within the block (e.g., $14 \\leftrightarrow 17$), which are also occluded. In these cases, a **Horizontal Reflection symmetry** or **Pattern Continuity** is used.\n        *   The horizontal symmetry observed is $c' = 31 - c$.\n        *   However, for columns close to the edge (0, 1, 2), the symmetric columns (31, 30, 29) might be out of bounds or require wrapping.\n        *   Alternatively, continuity from adjacent unblocked rows is a reliable predictor.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n1.  **Locate Block:** Scanning the input, a block of **8s** is found at **Rows 14 to 22** and **Columns 0 to 2**.\n    *   Height: 9 rows.\n    *   Width: 3 columns.\n    *   Output size: 9x3.\n\n2.  **Reconstruct Rows 18-22 (Bottom Half):**\n    *   Using Vertical Reflection ($r_{src} = 31 - r_{dst}$):\n    *   Row 22 corresponds to Row 9. Input Row 9 cols 0-2 are `1, 6, 1`.\n    *   Row 21 corresponds to Row 10. Input Row 10 cols 0-2 are `6, 6, 6`.\n    *   Row 20 corresponds to Row 11. Input Row 11 cols 0-2 are `6, 6, 1`.\n    *   Row 19 corresponds to Row 12. Input Row 12 cols 0-2 are `4, 4, 7`.\n    *   Row 18 corresponds to Row 13. Input Row 13 cols 0-2 are `4, 4, 7`.\n\n3.  **Reconstruct Rows 14-17 (Top Half - Occluded Reflection):**\n    *   These rows reflect to themselves (14<->17, 15<->16), so we cannot use vertical reflection.\n    *   **Column 2:** Using Horizontal Symmetry $c' = 31 - c$, Column 2 maps to Column 29.\n        *   Check Row 14, Column 29: Value is `9`.\n        *   Check Rows 15-17, Column 29: Value is `9`.\n        *   So, Column 2 is `9` for these rows.\n    *   **Columns 0 and 1:** Using Pattern Continuity from the vertical neighbors (Rows 13 and 18).\n        *   Rows 13 and 18 both have `4, 4` in columns 0 and 1.\n        *   The sequence of columns 0 and 1 in the surrounding rows suggests a stable \"plateau\" of `4, 4` filling the gap.\n        *   Thus, Rows 14-17 columns 0 and 1 are `4, 4`.\n    *   Result for Rows 14-17: `4, 4, 9`.\n\n**Constructed Output:**\nRow 14: 4, 4, 9\nRow 15: 4, 4, 9\nRow 16: 4, 4, 9\nRow 17: 4, 4, 9\nRow 18: 4, 4, 7\nRow 19: 4, 4, 7\nRow 20: 6, 6, 1\nRow 21: 6, 6, 6\nRow 22: 1, 6, 1\n\noutput:\n4,4,9\n4,4,9\n4,4,9\n4,4,9\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n6,6,1\n6,6,6\n1,6,1",

Locate the bounding box of all `8` cells \u2192 this is the output size.\n2. For each cell `(r,c)` inside that box:\n   - If the horizontal mirror `(33-r, c)` is inside the grid and not `8`, copy it.\n   - Otherwise, if the vertical mirror `(r, 33-c)` is inside the grid and not `8`, copy it.\n   - If neither mirror exists inside the grid, the cell remains `8`.\n\nThis reproduces all given examples (sometimes both symmetries work; sometimes you need the fallback).\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test input\nThe `8` rectangle is at:\n\n- **Rows 15\u201323**\n- **Columns 1\u20133**\n\nSo the output is **9\u00d73**.\n\nFor rows 19\u201323, the horizontal mirror rows (14\u201310) are valid and give the full 3 values.\nFor rows 15\u201318, the horizontal mirror lands inside the `8` area again, so we try vertical mirroring:\n- Only column 3 has a valid vertical mirror inside the grid (`3 \u2194 30`), giving `9`.\n- Columns 1\u20132 mirror outside the grid (`32,31`), so they remain `8`.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n8,8,9  \n8,8,9  \n8,8,9  \n8,8,9  \n4,4,7  \n4,4,7  \n6,6,1  \n6,6,6  \n1,6,1",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Every input contains one large, uniform cyan rectangle touching an edge; that cyan color is absent in the outputs.\n* Outputs are much smaller and look like a denoised/coarse segmentation into a few large rectangular color regions.\n* The output shape/aspect ratio appears tied to the cyan rectangle\u2019s shape (suggesting it defines the target output area/dimensions).\n* Many input colors behave like \u201cdetail/noise\u201d and are dropped; outputs keep only a small representative palette.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "The problem asks us to reconstruct the content of a rectangular region obscured by a cyan (color 8) block in the input grid. The output grid dimensions correspond exactly to the dimensions of this cyan block.\n\n**Analysis of the task:**\n1.  **Output Dimensions:** In all examples, the output size matches the height and width of the continuous block of cyan pixels (8s) found in the input.\n2.  **Pattern Reconstruction:** The input grids exhibit global symmetries or periodic patterns (tiling). The task is to identify the pattern and fill in the missing (cyan-covered) region using information from other parts of the grid.\n    *   In Example 4, rows containing the cyan block matched perfectly with rows elsewhere in the grid (e.g., Row 7 matched Row 24). The content for the cyan region in Row 7 could be copied from the corresponding columns in Row 24.\n    *   In Example 1, the grid had a reflection symmetry (Row `i` matched Row `31-i` for the outer parts), and the center rows (covered by cyan) formed a self-contained symmetric block.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n1.  **Locate Cyan Block:**\n    Scanning the Test Input, the cyan (8) block is found in **Rows 15 to 23** (0-indexed) and **Columns 0 to 2**.\n    *   Height: 9 rows.\n    *   Width: 3 columns.\n    *   Target Output Size: 9x3.\n\n2.  **Find Matching Rows:**\n    We examine the \"visible\" parts of the rows containing the cyan block (Columns 3 to 29) and search for identical rows elsewhere in the grid.\n\n    *   **Row 19 (Input):** Visible part `2,7,9,4...` matches **Row 14** visible part `2,7,9,4...`.\n        *   Row 14 is fully visible. Its columns 0-2 are `4,4,7`.\n        *   Therefore, Row 19's hidden part is `4,4,7`.\n        *   This corresponds to Output Row 4 (since Row 19 is the 5th row of the block 15-23).\n\n    *   **Row 20 (Input):** Visible part `7,9,7,7...` matches **Row 13** visible part `7,9,7,7...`.\n        *   Row 13 columns 0-2 are `4,4,7`.\n        *   Therefore, Row 20's hidden part is `4,4,7`.\n        *   Output Row 5: `4,4,7`.\n\n    *   **Row 21 (Input):** Visible part `6,7,2,1...` matches **Row 12** visible part `6,6,1,6...` (cols 3-29 match).\n        *   Row 12 columns 0-2 are `6,6,1`.\n        *   Output Row 6: `6,6,1`.\n\n    *   **Row 22 (Input):** Visible part `6,7,7,9...` matches **Row 11** visible part `6,6,6,6...` (cols 3-29 match).\n        *   Row 11 columns 0-2 are `6,6,6`.\n        *   Output Row 7: `6,6,6`.\n\n    *   **Row 23 (Input):** Visible part `5,4,4,7...` matches **Row 10** visible part `1,6,1,5...` (cols 3-29 match).\n        *   Row 10 columns 0-2 are `1,6,1`.\n        *   Output Row 8: `1,6,1`.\n\n3.  **Handling the Remaining Rows (15-18):**\n    *   The matching logic establishes a reflection symmetry where Row `i` matches Row `33-i`.\n        *   19 matches 14 (19+14=33).\n        *   20 matches 13 (20+13=33).\n        *   ...\n        *   15 matches 18 (15+18=33).\n        *   16 matches 17 (16+17=33).\n    *   Rows 15, 16, 17, and 18 are *all* within the cyan block. Because they map to each other, we cannot retrieve their values from outside the block using this vertical symmetry.\n    *   However, observing the reconstructed block from rows 19-20 (`4,4,7`, `4,4,7`), and the matched rows 14 (`4,4,7`) and 13 (`4,4,7`), we see a consistent region of `4,4,7`.\n    *   The problem describes \"denoised/coarse segmentation\". The grid appears to be composed of large rectangular regions of uniform pattern. The block of `4,4,7` extends from Row 13 down to Row 20.\n    *   It is logical to infer that the rows 15, 16, 17, and 18 continue this `4,4,7` pattern, connecting the upper identified rows (13, 14) with the lower identified rows (19, 20).\n    *   Therefore, we reconstruct Rows 15-18 as `4,4,7`.\n\n**Constructed Output Grid:**\n*   Row 0 (Input 15): `4,4,7`\n*   Row 1 (Input 16): `4,4,7`\n*   Row 2 (Input 17): `4,4,7`\n*   Row 3 (Input 18): `4,4,7`\n*   Row 4 (Input 19): `4,4,7`\n*   Row 5 (Input 20): `4,4,7`\n*   Row 6 (Input 21): `6,6,1`\n*   Row 7 (Input 22): `6,6,6`\n*   Row 8 (Input 23): `1,6,1`\n\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n6,6,1\n6,6,6\n1,6,1",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Every input contains one large, uniform cyan rectangle touching an edge; that cyan color is absent in the outputs.\n* Outputs are much smaller and look like a denoised/coarse segmentation into a few large rectangular color regions.\n* The output shape/aspect ratio appears tied to the cyan rectangle\u2019s shape (suggesting it defines the target output area/dimensions).\n* Many input colors behave like \u201cdetail/noise\u201d and are dropped; outputs keep only a small representative palette.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to identify the cyan (8) rectangle in each input and determine what values should fill that region.\n\n**Analyzing the Examples:**\n\nIn each example, I notice:\n1. There's a rectangular region of 8s (cyan) that occludes part of the pattern\n2. The output dimensions match the 8-region dimensions exactly\n3. The grids appear to have 180\u00b0 rotational (point) symmetry around the center\n\n**Verification with Example 3:**\n- 8s are at rows 19-21, cols 12-18 (3\u00d77 region)\n- For 180\u00b0 symmetry around center (14.5, 14.5):\n  - Row 19 maps to row 10, Row 20 maps to row 9, Row 21 maps to row 8\n  - Cols 12-18 map to cols 11-17 (reversed)\n\nChecking row 10, cols 12-18: `7,6,9,7,7,9,6` matches output row 2 \u2713\nChecking row 11, cols 12-18: `6,7,7,9,9,7,7` matches output row 1 \u2713\nChecking row 12, cols 12-18: `3,7,4,4,4,4,7` matches output row 0 \u2713\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\nFinding the 8-region: Rows 14-22, Cols 0-2 (9 rows \u00d7 3 cols)\n\nFor 180\u00b0 rotation, this maps to rows 7-15, cols 27-29.\n\nExtracting and applying 180\u00b0 rotation (reverse row order and each row):\n\n| Source Row | Cols 27-29 | 180\u00b0 Rotated |\n|------------|------------|--------------|\n| Row 15 | 2,9,9 | 9,9,2 |\n| Row 14 | 3,1,9 | 9,1,3 |\n| Row 13 | 7,2,7 | 7,2,7 |\n| Row 12 | 9,7,7 | 7,7,9 |\n| Row 11 | 7,6,1 | 1,6,7 |\n| Row 10 | 7,6,6 | 6,6,7 |\n| Row 9 | 4,5,1 | 1,5,4 |\n| Row 8 | 4,1,5 | 5,1,4 |\n| Row 7 | 4,9,7 | 7,9,4 |\n\n**Output:**\n```\n9,9,2\n9,1,3\n7,2,7\n7,7,9\n1,6,7\n6,6,7\n1,5,4\n5,1,4\n7,9,4\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Every input contains one large, uniform cyan rectangle touching an edge; that cyan color is absent in the outputs.\n* Outputs are much smaller and look like a denoised/coarse segmentation into a few large rectangular color regions.\n* The output shape/aspect ratio appears tied to the cyan rectangle\u2019s shape (suggesting it defines the target output area/dimensions).\n* Many input colors behave like \u201cdetail/noise\u201d and are dropped; outputs keep only a small representative palette.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking

Identify transformation categories**\n\nFor each, say \u201cpresent\u201d, \u201cmaybe\u201d, or \u201cabsent\u201d:\n\n* **Object movement**\n* **Object recoloring**\n* **Bordering / outlining**\n* **Filling holes or cavities**\n* **Removing noise / extracting main shape**\n* **Copying / pasting / repositioning**\n* **Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center)**\n* **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors**\n* **Size-based filtering or selection**\n* **Symmetry or reflection operations**\n* **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion**\n* **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping**\n\nThis helps narrow down plausible rule families.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Extract the key non-obvious insights**\n\nList 3\u20136 insights that are **crucial and not immediately obvious**.\nExamples of the kind of insights to extract:\n\n* \u201cOnly the *largest* blue cluster receives a border; smaller ones are ignored.\u201d\n* \u201cNew colors in the output correspond to *inside* regions of hollow shapes.\u201d\n* \u201cThe transformation only acts on objects touching the top edge.\u201d\n* \u201cThe rule depends on which color appears in the **top-left tile** of the input.\u201d\n* \u201cObjects are replaced with templated icons depending on their color.\u201d\n* \u201cInternal holes are treated as objects and recolored independently.\u201d\n\nFocus on the subtle but general behavior.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)**\n\nIn 2\u20134 sentences, propose a **general transformation mechanism** that would explain the mapping *across inputs and outputs*.\n\nAvoid low-level pixel descriptions; describe conceptual behavior.\n\nExample styles:\n\n* \u201cThe task identifies hollow shapes and outlines them in red while recoloring their interior according to hole depth.\u201d\n* \u201cThe task compresses all meaningful objects to the top-left quadrant while preserving their original shapes.\u201d\n* \u201cAll scattered singletons are deleted and replaced by large structured blocks based on color frequency.\u201d\n\nIf ambiguous, propose the *two or three* most likely rule families.\n\n---\n\n## **5. List checks you would perform when solving**\n\nGive 3\u20135 quick algorithmic checks for validation, e.g.:\n\n* \u201cVerify whether recoloring depends on hole depth or on adjacency to perimeter.\u201d\n* \u201cCheck if the anchor color is always the top-left non-background pixel.\u201d\n* \u201cTest whether clusters are preserved or converted into icons.\u201d\n* \u201cDetermine whether the largest cluster always receives the transformation.\u201d\n\nThese guide a solver toward the correct general rule.\n\n---\n\n## **6.

            "Full raw LLM response": "## 1. Observable structures (literal)\n\nAcross the 4 **input \u2192 output** pairs:\n\n### Inputs\n- Each input is a large grid densely filled with many colors (a \u201cmicro-mosaic\u201d look with many tiny colored cells/patches).\n- In every input there is **one clearly visible large, solid light-blue/cyan rectangle** (uniform color) that:\n  - is axis-aligned,\n  - touches an outer edge/corner of the grid (e.g., right edge, top-right corner, bottom edge),\n  - is much larger than the typical tiny patches elsewhere.\n- Aside from that cyan block, the rest of each input contains many small regions of various colors; no single uniform background dominates visually.\n\n### Outputs\n- Each output is a **smaller** grid than its corresponding input.\n- Outputs are composed of **large contiguous monochrome regions** (axis-aligned rectangles and blocky shapes), forming a complete filled rectangle (no empty space).\n- The output palette is **much smaller** than the input palette: only a handful of colors appear.\n- The **light-blue/cyan color seen as the big rectangle in every input does not appear in any output** (visually absent).\n- Colors in outputs appear in structured blocks; some colors are dominant (occupying large area), others appear in smaller blocks.\n\n### What changes from input to output\n- Strong reduction in apparent resolution/complexity: many tiny varied patches in input become a few large uniform regions in output.\n- Palette reduction: many input colors disappear; only a subset remains.\n- The prominent cyan rectangle present in inputs is not present in outputs.\n\n### What stays the same (at least visually)\n- Output colors generally look like they are chosen from colors that already exist in the input (except the cyan seems specifically excluded).\n- Everything remains axis-aligned and rectilinear (no diagonal/curved structures introduced).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Transformation categories\n\n- **Object movement:** absent  \n- **Object recoloring:** maybe (some colors vanish; could be \u201cignored\u201d rather than recolored)\n- **Bordering / outlining:** absent  \n- **Filling holes or cavities:** absent  \n- **Removing noise / extracting main shape:** present (outputs look like a denoised/simplified abstraction)\n- **Copying / pasting / repositioning:** maybe (output could be a patch derived from part of input)\n- **Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center):** present (the large cyan rectangle is edge-attached and consistently special)\n- **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors:** maybe (outputs keep few colors, plausibly the most prevalent)\n- **Size-based filtering or selection:** present/maybe (a uniquely large cyan rectangle exists; small patches disappear)\n- **Symmetry or reflection operations:** maybe (inputs look structured; could be used to infer missing content)\n- **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion:** maybe (effect resembles coarse-graining/aggregation)\n- **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping:** absent  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Key non-obvious insights (crucial patterns)\n\n1. **A single large cyan rectangle is a consistent \u201cspecial region\u201d in every input**, always edge-attached, and **that cyan color never appears in outputs**.\n2. **Outputs look like a coarse segmentation/aggregation**: many micro-patches in input collapse into a small number of large uniform regions.\n3. **Output aspect ratios vary across examples**, and visually they often resemble the *shape* (tall/wide/square-ish) of the cyan rectangle region in the corresponding input (suggesting the cyan block may define target dimensions).\n4. **Outputs are fully tiled by color regions** (no leftover \u201cbackground\u201d), implying the operation produces a complete synthesized/decoded image rather than extracting a sparse set of objects.\n5. **Only a subset of input colors survives**, suggesting either (a) per-region majority/representative-color selection, or (b) selection of globally significant colors (frequency-based), while treating other colors as noise/detail.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Hypothesized general rule (high level)\n\nMost likely: the task treats the large cyan rectangle as a **designated target/blank area (or a special marker)** and produces a **low-resolution, denoised representation** derived from the rest of the input, using only a small set of representative colors. The output appears to be a **coarse \u201cdecoded\u201d image** (blocky Mondrian-like regions) where fine-grained input variation is suppressed.\n\nAlternate plausible family: the task computes a **color-distribution summary** (e.g., packing/aggregating dominant colors) of the non-cyan portion, explicitly excluding cyan, and renders that summary as a small blocky mosaic.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Checks to perform when solving\n\n1. **Dimension check:** verify whether output height/width exactly matches the cyan rectangle\u2019s height/width in the input (or some simple function of it).\n2. **Block decoding check:** test if the non-cyan area can be partitioned into a regular grid (by integer factor) where each output cell equals the **most frequent color** in the corresponding input block.\n3. **Exclusion check:** confirm cyan is always ignored/removed from computation (not counted, not mapped) and serves only as a marker.\n4. **Spatial vs. non-spatial check:** see if output preserves **spatial layout** of dominant regions from input (thumbnail/downsizing) versus being arranged purely by **global color frequencies** (sorted/packed).\n5. **Representative-color rule:** within a candidate block/region, test whether the output color equals the **mode**, a **center pixel**, or a **corner/edge sample**.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Summarize final insights\n\nHINT_START\n* Every input contains one large, uniform cyan rectangle touching an edge; that cyan color is absent in the outputs.\n* Outputs are much smaller and look like a denoised/coarse segmentation into a few large rectangular color regions.\n* The output shape/aspect ratio appears tied to the cyan rectangle\u2019s shape (suggesting it defines the target output area/dimensions).\n* Many input colors behave like \u201cdetail/noise\u201d and are dropped; outputs keep only a small representative palette.\nHINT_END",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nObjects are orthogonally connected single-color regions (colors 1\u20139), including isolated single cells, small compact rectangles/squares, horizontal/vertical bar segments, irregular blobs, and occasional large filled rectangular blocks (often color 8). Attributes include color value, size (1 cell to large panels), shape (dot/rectangle/bar/irregular), and placement (interior or edge/corner).\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nLocate the solid rectangular block of color 8. The output grid has exactly the same height/width as this 8-rectangle and contains the colors that should replace the 8s. Recover those colors by exploiting the input\u2019s mirror symmetry: copy the corresponding rectangle from the mirrored location (across the vertical axis with a horizontal flip, or across the horizontal axis with a vertical flip; equivalently via 180\u00b0 rotation from the doubly-mirrored region). Discard all other cells; color 8 does not appear in the output.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Summary of Thought Process for Solving ARC Task**\n\nOkay, I've got the task: a grid of numbers, find the pattern, and apply it. I see examples, a test input, and a hint about \"objects\" (connected regions, specifically a large block of 8s) and transformations like symmetry.\n\nMy initial thought is to figure out the input and output sizes, and look for that 8-block. Counted commas (ugh) and checked the examples - it's a 30x30 grid, and the output is smaller with dimensions matching that block. Then I started mapping out the exact coordinates of that block in one of the examples.\n\nThe hint about symmetry triggered a more in-depth exploration: horizontal or vertical flip? or 180 rotation? I tried matching up the values in different ways (mirrored columns, mirrored rows, etc.) using the examples. But it wasn't a simple global symmetry - the values didn't match perfectly, and the hint about \"mirroring\" seemed a little misleading at first. I was getting stuck.\n\nI dug deeper into the hint, focusing on the phrase \"copy the corresponding rectangle from the mirrored location.\" I assumed that the block of 8s was *not* the direct source, and began to test the three types of symmetry to find a 'matching' region. I kept finding mismatches.\n\nI then started to over-complicate the problem. The hint made it sound like there was something tricky about the symmetry. I started looking for more complex symmetry cases, and even block-based symmetry. I looked at the sequences of values around the 8-block, trying to relate these to values at mirrored positions. I considered how this could vary based on where the block was located in the grid, too! I considered possible wrap-around of values.\n\nThen, I went back to the examples and just stared at the output patterns. I wondered: *where* are these outputs coming from? I was chasing the individual values, trying to map them back to the input, column by column or even row by row!\n\nThis led to a critical realization. Maybe instead of global symmetry, the symmetry was *local* to the problem space. I re-read the examples and the specific columns. I started noticing values in the examples that seemed similar. And, this gave me a clue! The values had a special relationship: their indices added up to some constant. I found that this was 31.\n\nUsing that clue, it was a lot easier to trace the values. And so, based on this pattern: the symmetry axis is at $i' = 31-i$. I then tested Horizontal and Vertical Mirroring and discovered the key. Vertical Mirroring worked! Now, it's just about applying the solution to the test input!\n\nI found the location of the 8s, used the Vertical Mirror relationship to find the corresponding values. Then I completed the block! Using my pattern, I verified that the output made sense, and the solution was complete! The problem was harder than I thought, but it's solved!\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples and the test input, the solution involves identifying the \"solid rectangular block of color 8\" and recovering the occluded colors using the grid's symmetry.\n\n**Step-by-step Derivation:**\n\n1.  **Locate the 8-block:**\n    In the Test Input, the 8s are located in Rows 14 through 22 (0-indexed) and Columns 0 through 2.\n    -   Rows: 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.\n    -   Columns: 0, 1, 2.\n    -   Output Dimensions: 9 rows $\\times$ 3 columns.\n\n2.  **Determine the Symmetry:**\n    By observing the grid, particularly the rows surrounding the 8-block, we find a **Global Vertical Mirror Symmetry** where `Row[k]` mirrors `Row[31-k]` (using a 1-based index sum of 31, or 0-indexed sum of 29? Let's re-verify the specific pairing).\n    \n    Comparing rows with valid data:\n    -   Row 8 (`6,6,5,1...`) matches Row 23 (`6,6,5,1...`).\n    -   Row 7 (`4,7,7,9...`) matches Row 24 (`4,7,7,9...`).\n    -   Row 9 (`1,6,1,5...`) matches Row 22 (right side `...4,4,5,1` vs Row 9 right side).\n    \n    The symmetry is pairing Row $i$ with Row $31-i$. (Row 8 with 23, sum 31).\n    Therefore, we can recover the content of the 8-block (Rows 14-22) from their symmetric counterparts (Rows 17-9).\n    \n    -   Row 22 pairs with Row 9.\n    -   Row 21 pairs with Row 10.\n    -   Row 20 pairs with Row 11.\n    -   Row 19 pairs with Row 12.\n    -   Row 18 pairs with Row 13.\n    -   Row 17 pairs with Row 14.\n    -   Row 16 pairs with Row 15.\n\n3.  **Recovering the Values:**\n    We need values for Columns 0, 1, 2.\n\n    -   **Rows 18-22 (Source: Rows 13-9):**\n        -   **Row 18:** Source Row 13. Input Row 13 starts with `4,4,7`. -> `4,4,7`\n        -   **Row 19:** Source Row 12. Input Row 12 starts with `4,4,7`. -> `4,4,7`\n        -   **Row 20:** Source Row 11. Input Row 11 starts with `6,6,1`. -> `6,6,1`\n        -   **Row 21:** Source Row 10. Input Row 10 starts with `6,6,6`. -> `6,6,6`\n        -   **Row 22:** Source Row 9. Input Row 9 starts with `1,6,1`. -> `1,6,1`\n\n    -   **Rows 14-17 (Source: Rows 17-14):**\n        Rows 14 and 17 pair with each other, and both contain the 8-block. Rows 15 and 16 pair with each other, and both contain the 8-block. Vertical symmetry alone cannot resolve these.\n        We check for **Horizontal Mirror Symmetry** on these specific rows.\n        Looking at the right side of Row 14 (Cols 27-29), we see `3, 1, 9`.\n        If the row is symmetric (palindromic or mirrored), the left side (Cols 0-2) should be the reverse or mirror. Using a standard mirror ($Col' = 29-Col$), Col 0 maps to 29, Col 1 to 28, Col 2 to 27.\n        -   **Row 14:** Source Cols 29, 28, 27 are `9, 1, 3`. -> `9,1,3`\n        -   **Row 17:** Same right-side pattern (`3,1,9`), so -> `9,1,3`.

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nObjects are orthogonally connected single-color regions (colors 1\u20139), including isolated single cells, small compact rectangles/squares, horizontal/vertical bar segments, irregular blobs, and occasional large filled rectangular blocks (often color 8). Attributes include color value, size (1 cell to large panels), shape (dot/rectangle/bar/irregular), and placement (interior or edge/corner).\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nLocate the solid rectangular block of color 8. The output grid has exactly the same height/width as this 8-rectangle and contains the colors that should replace the 8s. Recover those colors by exploiting the input\u2019s mirror symmetry: copy the corresponding rectangle from the mirrored location (across the vertical axis with a horizontal flip, or across the horizontal axis with a vertical flip; equivalently via 180\u00b0 rotation from the doubly-mirrored region). Discard all other cells; color 8 does not appear in the output.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to:\n1. Find the rectangular block of 8s in the input\n2. Determine the symmetry-based source for those values\n3. Extract the values that should replace the 8s\n\n## Finding the 8-block in the test input\n\nScanning the test input, I find 8s at:\n- Rows 14-22 (9 rows)\n- Columns 0-2 (3 columns)\n\n## Applying the transformation\n\nBased on the examples, the transformation uses vertical symmetry around row 15.5 (so row r maps to row 31-r).\n\n**For rows 18-22** (where mirrors don't overlap with the 8-block):\n- Row 18 \u2190 Row 13, cols 0-2: `4,4,7`\n- Row 19 \u2190 Row 12, cols 0-2: `4,4,7`  \n- Row 20 \u2190 Row 11, cols 0-2: `6,6,1`\n- Row 21 \u2190 Row 10, cols 0-2: `6,6,6`\n- Row 22 \u2190 Row 9, cols 0-2: `1,6,1`\n\n**For rows 14-17** (where mirrors fall within the 8-block):\nUsing 180\u00b0 rotation - position (r, c) maps to (29-r, 29-c):\n\n- Row 14 gets values from row 15, cols 29,28,27: `9,9,2`\n- Row 15 gets values from row 14, cols 29,28,27: `9,1,3`\n- Row 16 (same as row 15): `9,1,3`\n- Row 17 (same as row 14): `9,9,2`\n\nVerifying row 14's source:\n- Row 15, col 29 = 9\n- Row 15, col 28 = 9  \n- Row 15, col 27 = 2\n\nThis gives `9,9,2` \u2713\n\nVerifying row 18's source:\n- Row 13: `4,4,7,2,7,9,...`\n- Cols 0-2: `4,4,7` \u2713\n\n## Output\n\n```\n9,9,2\n9,1,3\n9,1,3\n9,9,2\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n6,6,1\n6,6,6\n1,6,1\n```",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nObjects are orthogonally connected single-color regions (colors 1\u20139), including isolated single cells, small compact rectangles/squares, horizontal/vertical bar segments, irregular blobs, and occasional large filled rectangular blocks (often color 8). Attributes include color value, size (1 cell to large panels), shape (dot/rectangle/bar/irregular), and placement (interior or edge/corner).\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nLocate the solid rectangular block of color 8. The output grid has exactly the same height/width as this 8-rectangle and contains the colors that should replace the 8s. Recover those colors by exploiting the input\u2019s mirror symmetry: copy the corresponding rectangle from the mirrored location (across the vertical axis with a horizontal flip, or across the horizontal axis with a vertical flip; equivalently via 180\u00b0 rotation from the doubly-mirrored region). Discard all other cells; color 8 does not appear in the output.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

Objects Description\nObjects are orthogonally connected single-color regions (colors 1\u20139), including isolated single cells, small compact rectangles/squares, horizontal/vertical bar segments, irregular blobs, and occasional large filled rectangular blocks (often color 8). Attributes include color value, size (1 cell to large panels), shape (dot/rectangle/bar/irregular), and placement (interior or edge/corner).",
                "response": "**1) Identify the target object (the \u201cmissing\u201d area)**  \n- In each input there is a single large, solid **axis-aligned rectangle** of **color 8**.  \n- Compute its **bounding box** (top row, bottom row, left column, right column).  \n- The **output grid size equals this 8-rectangle size** (same height and width).  \n- The output contains the **colors that should replace the 8s** (so **color 8 never appears in the output**).\n\n**2) Use global mirror-symmetry of the non-8 content to recover the missing colors**  \n- The rest of the input (all non-8 cells) forms a pattern that is **mirror-symmetric** about central axes:\n  - A **horizontal mirror axis** (top\u2013bottom reflection).\n  - A **vertical mirror axis** (left\u2013right reflection).\n- Therefore, each 8-cell\u2019s true color can be copied from its **mirrored counterpart** in the symmetric half of the grid.\n\n**3) Equivalent ways to generate the output patch (all consistent with the examples)**  \nLet the 8-rectangle be rows `[r1..r2]` and columns `[c1..c2]`.\n\nYou can reconstruct the output (the missing patch) by copying from a symmetric location and applying the corresponding flip:\n\n- **A) Vertical-mirror method (left\u2013right symmetry):**  \n  1. Find the rectangle at the **same rows** `[r1..r2]` but at the **mirrored columns** (the columns that correspond to `[c1..c2]` under left\u2013right reflection).  \n  2. **Flip horizontally** (reverse column order) to align orientation.  \n  3. The resulting `height x width` block is the output.\n\n- **B) Horizontal-mirror method (top\u2013bottom symmetry):**  \n  1. Find the rectangle at the **same columns** `[c1..c2]` but at the **mirrored rows** (the rows that correspond to `[r1..r2]` under top\u2013bottom reflection).  \n  2. **Flip vertically** (reverse row order) to align orientation.  \n  3. The resulting block is the output.\n\n- **C) 180\u00b0 rotation method (composition of both mirrors):**  \n  1. Take the rectangle mirrored in **both** row and column (diagonally opposite under the two symmetry axes).  \n  2. **Rotate 180\u00b0** (flip vertically + flip horizontally).  \n  3. The result is again the output.\n\n**4) Cropping / discarding everything else**  \n- All other colored objects (colors 1\u20139 except 8) remain only as **sources** for copying.  \n- The final output is **only** the reconstructed rectangular patch (cropped to the 8-rectangle\u2019s bounding box), not the full repaired input.\n\n<transformation_summary>\nLocate the solid rectangular block of color 8. The output grid has exactly the same height/width as this 8-rectangle and contains the colors that should replace the 8s. Recover those colors by exploiting the input\u2019s mirror symmetry: copy the corresponding rectangle from the mirrored location (across the vertical axis with a horizontal flip, or across the horizontal axis with a vertical flip; equivalently via 180\u00b0 rotation from the doubly-mirrored region). Discard all other cells; color 8 does not appear in the output.\n</transformation_summary>",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nObjects are orthogonally connected single-color regions (colors 1\u20139), including isolated single cells, small compact rectangles/squares, horizontal/vertical bar segments, irregular blobs, and occasional large filled rectangular blocks (often color 8). Attributes include color value, size (1 cell to large panels), shape (dot/rectangle/bar/irregular), and placement (interior or edge/corner).\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nLocate the solid rectangular block of color 8. The output grid has exactly the same height/width as this 8-rectangle and contains the colors that should replace the 8s. Recover those colors by exploiting the input\u2019s mirror symmetry: copy the corresponding rectangle from the mirrored location (across the vertical axis with a horizontal flip, or across the horizontal axis with a vertical flip; equivalently via 180\u00b0 rotation from the doubly-mirrored region). Discard all other cells; color 8 does not appear in the output.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
