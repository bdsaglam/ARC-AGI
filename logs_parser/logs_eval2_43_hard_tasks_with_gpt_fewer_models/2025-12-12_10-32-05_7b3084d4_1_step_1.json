        "Full raw LLM response": "**A Deep Dive into ARC Task Solving: A Journey of Quadrant Mapping, Rotation, and Strategic Blending**\n\nOkay, so the challenge is to crack this ARC puzzle using a few examples and a test case. It looks deceptively simple, but there's a definite pattern at play.\n\nThe first step is always analyzing the initial example. I need to dissect the input grid to recognize features, like the distinct shapes, colored regions, and the 0 background. It seems the output is a compact mashup of the input quadrants. I realize this might not be simple stitching, but a clever blending of quadrants. I meticulously check the output, bounding boxes, and relative positions of each quadrant. There appears to be a crucial quadrant, one where the unique color \"5\" is situated. This \"5\" will be a key to the puzzle's underlying mechanism.\n\nAfter the first example, it feels like I'm onto something. In this first example, there's a subtle horizontal swapping of the top two quadrants relative to the original. This is the first signal something more is going on beyond simple stitching. However, looking at the second example, a standard 10x10 stitching shows what I thought may have been happening. I need to get to the core of the problem.\n\nThe second example validates the \"quadrant\" notion and confirms my suspicions about a special marker. The output is a straightforward blend with a clear spatial arrangement. But I keep looking for what happens with the unique color.\n\nWith the third example, things shift a bit. It appears the quadrants are undergoing something more than just simple swapping. We are dealing with an arrangement that requires flipping and swapping both rows and columns. I begin to visualize what might occur. It must be something geometric such as rotation, swapping of quadrants in a very specific order or even something where the central pixel in a shape causes a specific reorientation of where the shape is placed.\n\nThe \"5\" is the key. The grid might be rotated so the 5 (that is unique to a certain quadrant) is always in the top left. Then, it's a matter of figuring out which directions each shape moves with these transformations. With the third example, I can build up a method.\n\nI start testing theories of rotation. After considering grid rotation, I realize there is a pattern to the quadrant arrangement. Each test case reveals more and more of the quadrant mapping. With the third example, the puzzle appears to be \"bringing the 5 to the Top Left.\" This reveals a transformation. Each quadrant has to be rotated by 180 (or flipped in both x and y).\n\nAt this stage, I have to form a general model.\n\nI need a method.\n1. Determine the transformations of each quadrant with the \"5\" at the top left.\n2. Determine where to put the results based on relative rows and columns.\n\nI believe I can now solve the test input.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on a pattern inferred from three solved examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification**: The input grid (20x20) is divided into four 10x10 quadrants (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right). Each quadrant contains a distinct colored shape on a black (0) background.\n2.  **Key Quadrant**: In all examples, one quadrant contains a specific \"marker\" pixel that is distinct from the main color of the shape (e.g., a grey '5' inside a shape of '7's). We identify this as the **Key Quadrant**.\n    *   Example 1: Key is Top-Right (7s with 5).\n    *   Example 2: Key is Top-Left (7s with 5).\n    *   Example 3: Key is Bottom-Left (7s with 5).\n    *   Test Input: Key is **Bottom-Left** (7s with 5).\n3.  **Mapping/Rearrangement**: The four quadrants are cropped to their bounding boxes and rearranged in the output grid. The rearrangement rule aligns the **Key Quadrant to the Top-Left** of the output. The relative positions of the other quadrants follow a specific permutation logic:\n    *   If Key is BL (as in Example 3 and Test Input):\n        *   Input BL $\\to$ Output TL\n        *   Input BR $\\to$ Output TR\n        *   Input TR $\\to$ Output BL\n        *   Input TL $\\to$ Output BR\n4.  **Transformation/Orientation**: The shapes are rotated or flipped to ensure the \"marker\" (5) is in the top-left corner of the output grid (or as close as the shape geometry allows, generally orienting the cluster starting from (0,0)).\n    *   **Rule derived from Example 3**:\n        *   The quadrants moving from the **Bottom** row of the input to the **Top** row of the output (BL $\\to$ TL, BR $\\to$ TR) undergo a **180-degree rotation** (which is equivalent to a horizontal flip followed by a vertical flip). This is required to move the '5' (which is at the bottom-right of the 7s shape in the Test Input) to the top-left.\n        *   The quadrants moving from the **Top** row of the input to the **Bottom** row of the output (TR $\\to$ BL, TL $\\to$ BR) remain in their original orientation (**Identity** transformation). Note: In Example 3, the bottom quadrants were 180-rotated relative to the source, but in our derived logic for the Test Input where the Key requires a 180-rotation to fix the '5', the \"opposite\" row (Top $\\to$ Bottom) stays as Identity to satisfy the relative orientation pattern.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Key Quadrant (BL)**: Contains 7s and a 5. The 5 is at the bottom-right of the shape. We crop this and rotate it 180 degrees so the 5 is at the top-left. This goes to **Output TL**.\n*   **Pair Quadrant (BR)**: Contains 8s. We crop this and rotate it 180 degrees. This goes to **Output TR**.\n*   **Other Quadrant 1 (TR)**: Contains 3s. We crop this and apply Identity (no rotation). This goes to **Output BL**.\n*   **Other Quadrant 2 (TL)**: Contains 2s. We crop this and apply Identity (no rotation). This goes to **Output BR**.\n\n**Construction Details:**\n\n1.  **Output TL** (from Input BL, Rotated 180):\n    *   Input BL crop (7w x 8h). 5 is at bottom-right.\n    *   Rotated: 5 is at top-left. Size 7w x 8h.\n2.  **Output TR** (from Input BR, Rotated 180):\n    *   Input BR crop (8w x 7h).\n    *   Rotated: Size 8w x 7h.\n3.  **Output BL** (from Input TR, Identity):\n    *   Input TR crop (7w x 7h).\n4.  **Output BR** (from Input TL, Identity):\n    *   Input TL crop (7w x 7h).\n\n**Stitching**:\nThe grid is assembled by placing these transformed crops.\n*   Top Row Height: 8 (padded with 0 for TR).\n*   Top Row Width: 7 (TL) + 8 (TR) = 15.\n*   Bottom Row Height: 7.\n*   Bottom Row Width: 7 (BL) + 7 (BR) + 1 (padding) = 15.\n*   Total Size: 15x15.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n\n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,0,2,2,2,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,0\n3,3,3,0,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0\n3,3,3,0,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0\n3,3,3,0,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this ARC task, I need to understand the transformation pattern from the solved examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1. Each input has 4 colored shapes in different quadrants, plus one shape has a \"5\" marker\n2. The shape with the 5 marker determines the transformation - it gets placed in the top-left of the output\n3. The 5 marker gets repositioned to be at the top-left corner (position 0,0) of the output\n4. Other shapes get rearranged based on where the 5 was originally located\n5. When the 5 is in the bottom-left quadrant (like example 3), the arrangement rotates 180\u00b0 - shapes swap diagonally\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\n- Shape 2 (top-left): rows 0-6, cols 1-7\n- Shape 3 (top-right): rows 1-7, cols 9-18  \n- Shape 7 with \"5\" (bottom-left): rows 8-17, cols 0-6, with 5 at position (17,6)\n- Shape 8 (bottom-right): rows 11-19, cols 9-16\n\nSince the 5 is in the bottom-left quadrant, similar to example 3:\n- Shape 7 (with 5) \u2192 top-left, rotated 180\u00b0 so 5 is at (0,0)\n- Shape 8 \u2192 top-right\n- Shape 3 \u2192 bottom-left  \n- Shape 2 \u2192 bottom-right, rotated 180\u00b0\n\n**Constructing the output:**\n\nThe shapes are combined with their internal 0-patterns preserved, overlapping where they meet.\n\n```\n5,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0\n7,7,7,7,7,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0\n7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2\n0,0,0,3,3,3,0,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,0\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2\n0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,0,2\n```",
