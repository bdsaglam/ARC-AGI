with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**Okay, let's break down this ARC problem. Here's how I'm thinking about it:**\n\nI see two examples and a test input \u2013 the goal is to figure out the rule. The first thing that jumps out is the size difference: big input grids (30x30), small outputs (like 5x5 or 4x4). This strongly suggests the output is a *subset* or a *transformation* of some part of the input. I need to find the \"active\" region.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\nI'm visually scanning the input for repetitive patterns and \"boxes\". I'm looking for distinct, rectangular regions within the large grid. The input is noisy, so I focus on finding areas with a consistent border color, specifically a repeating '4' sequence. I see multiple potential rectangular regions (boxes) in Example 1, defined by these borders. The output is 5x5. I pick a region, probably the one on the top left. I trace the inner box values: it contains a '6' with some ones around the '0'.\n\nLooking at the output of Ex 1, I see *another* pattern. It has a diagonal, with all '2' values. I scan around for patterns and see if \"connect the dots\" logic is valid. I'm trying to see if there are connections between 6s. If I connect the 6 and 2 inside a box, I get all the required numbers. Does 6 at (1,0) \"connects\" to 2 at (4,0)? No...\nI focus on the colored region, and it appears the Output has those same colors.\nIf I flip this region horizontally, it seems the region shape is identical and contains the numbers I need to complete the map.\nI deduce a horizontal flip transformation on the region identified using Box 1's values is needed.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n\nAgain, I'm hunting for the \"active\" region. This time, I'm specifically looking for a border of '8'.  I find it and identify a region with the values inside: 0s and 2s. The border 8 clearly indicates there's a different rule in play here. The output shows mostly zeros and 2s.\nIt appears a simple inversion is happening, swap 0 with 2. \nI'm starting to get a sense of *how* these boxes are being transformed: it's not simply extracting part of the input. The output values are changed in a pattern, which is dependent on the border code.\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\nOkay, here's where I apply my knowledge. The input has border codes '5'. I know that '4' means a \"connect the dots\" or Horizontal flip, '8' means invert. '5' is new! This hints at a new transformation, since border values matter. Based on this, I have to guess that the colors might be swapped. I'm focusing on the same box hunting. The border is 5. I want to guess that 5 means an identical shape with changed color mappings.\n\nI see a region framed by '5's. Within the box, I notice two numbers: `4` and `2`. The task might involve just copying the shape. The borders have a strong effect.\n\n**Hypothesis:**\n\nBased on the border values, and looking at prior cases, here's my working hypothesis:\n1.  **Identify the Target Box.** This is the rectangular region bordered by a particular number.\n    *   Ex 1: Yellow (4): A Horizontal Flip is done.\n    *   Ex 2: Teal (8): Invert the pixels inside the border.\n    *   Test: Grey (5).\n2.  **Apply the Transformation.**\n\n    *   For the test, I can *guess* that 5 probably represents a copy operation.\n\nIn this test case, border '5' may indicate: Take the box's contents, and output it. The target box has a very basic pattern with two values (2 and 4), and therefore the same numbers remain! In Ex 1, and Ex 2, a similar approach can be applied. The 'active' box is 5 x 5, and the output is likely 5x5, so the transformation is the exact box, which holds 4s and a 2.\n\n**Solution:**\nI'll select the target shape and copy it.\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0\n0,4,2,4,0\n0,0,4,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0\n```\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a large 30x30 input grid into a smaller output grid (5x5 or 4x4) based on patterns observed in the examples.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Solved Examples**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains multiple \"boxes\" or regions bordered by specific colors.\n        *   Top Left: Border 4 (Yellow), Inner contains 1s, 6s.\n        *   Bottom Left: Border 4 (Yellow), Inner contains 6 and 2s.\n            *   Inner Grid (approx):\n                `0 0 0 0 0`\n                `6 0 0 0 2`\n                `0 0 0 0 0`\n                `0 0 0 0 0`\n                `2 0 0 0 0`\n    *   **Output:** `5x5` grid containing 6 and 2s.\n        `0 0 0 0 0`\n        `6 2 2 2 2`\n        `2 0 0 0 0`\n        `2 0 0 0 0`\n        `2 0 0 0 0`\n    *   **Transformation Logic:** The output corresponds to the Bottom Left box (the one containing the color 2). The transformation appears to be **\"Connect the dots\"**. The points at (1,0), (1,4), and (4,0) are connected by filling the rows and columns between them with the color 2.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains boxes bordered by 8 (Teal).\n        *   Top Left: Inner contains 4s.\n        *   Bottom Right: Inner contains 2s (and 0s).\n            *   Inner Grid:\n                `0 0 2 0`\n                `2 2 2 0`\n                `0 0 0 0`\n                `0 2 2 0`\n    *   **Output:** `4x4` grid.\n        `2 2 0 2`\n        `0 0 0 2`\n        `2 2 2 2`\n        `2 0 0 2`\n    *   **Transformation Logic:** The output corresponds to the Bottom Right box (the one containing the color 2). The transformation is **\"Invert\"** (swap 0 and 2).\n\n**Step 2: Apply Logic to Test Input**\n\n*   **Analyze Test Input:**\n    *   Scanning for borders, we find boxes bordered by **5 (Grey)**.\n    *   We locate the boxes:\n        *   **Box 1 (Top Left):** Contains 1s and 8. Pattern: A small diamond of 1s with 8 in the center.\n        *   **Box 2 (Bottom Left):** Contains 1s and 8s. Pattern: Checkerboard.\n        *   **Box 3 (Bottom Right):** Contains 4s and 2. Pattern: A small diamond of 4s with 2 in the center.\n            *   Location: Rows 22-26, Columns 21-25 (approximate indices).\n            *   Inner Content:\n                `0 0 0 0 0`\n                `0 0 4 0 0`\n                `0 4 2 4 0`\n                `0 0 4 0 0`\n                `0 0 0 0 0`\n\n*   **Identify Target Box:**\n    *   In both Examples, the output was derived from the box containing the color **2 (Red)**.\n    *   In the Test Input, **Box 3** contains the color 2. Thus, Box 3 is the target.\n\n*   **Determine Transformation:**\n    *   The transformation depends on the border color or the context.\n    *   **Ex 1 (Border 4):** \"Connect\".\n    *   **Ex 2 (Border 8):** \"Invert\".\n    *   **Test (Border 5):**\n        *   If we apply \"Connect\" to Box 3: The pixels (4s and 2) are already adjacent and form a connected diamond shape/cross. Connecting them adds no new pixels.\n        *   If we apply \"Invert\": It would create a solid block with a hole, which seems unlikely given the \"clean\" nature of ARC solutions and the diamond shape found in Box 1 as well.\n        *   Border 5 (Grey) often implies \"Identity\" or \"Container\".\n        *   Since Box 1 (TL) shares the exact same shape as Box 3 (BR), the shape is likely the intended output.\n        *   Therefore, the transformation is **Identity (Copy)**.\n\n*   **Construct Output:**\n    *   Copy the inner 5x5 grid of Box 3.\n\n    `0 0 0 0 0`\n    `0 0 4 0 0`\n    `0 4 2 4 0`\n    `0 0 4 0 0`\n    `0 0 0 0 0`\n\n0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0\n0,4,2,4,0\n0,0,4,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0",

The output is essentially the inverse: 2 where R3 has 0, and 0 where R3 has non-zero.\n\n**Analyzing test input:**\n\nI identify 4 rectangles bounded by 5s:\n- R1 (rows 4-8, cols 6-10): Cross of 1s with 8 at center\n- R2 (rows 4-8, cols 20-24): All 0s  \n- R3 (rows 21-25, cols 6-10): Complex pattern with 8s and 1s\n- R4 (rows 21-25, cols 20-24): The answer rectangle\n\n**R4 interior:**\n```\n0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0\n0,4,2,4,0\n0,0,4,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0\n```\n\nR4 has 2 at center (2,2) and 4s in a cross pattern.\n\n**Applying the transformation rule:**\n- Combine left rectangles (R1|R3) - all positions are non-0\n- Where R4 has non-zero (the 4s and 2) \u2192 output 0\n- Where R4 has 0 (and R1|R3 has non-0) \u2192 output 2\n\nThis gives:\n- Row 0: all 0s in R4 \u2192 2,2,2,2,2\n- Row 1: 0s except (1,2)=4 \u2192 2,2,0,2,2\n- Row 2: 0s at edges, 4s at (2,1) and (2,3), 2 at (2,2) \u2192 2,0,0,0,2\n- Row 3: 0s except (3,2)=4 \u2192 2,2,0,2,2\n- Row 4: all 0s in R4 \u2192 2,2,2,2,2\n\n```\n2,2,2,2,2\n2,2,0,2,2\n2,0,0,0,2\n2,2,0,2,2\n2,2,2,2,2\n```",

(This is what happens in example 1.)\n   - If the interior has **no `6`**: perform a binary inversion to only `0` and `2`:\n     - every `0` becomes `2`\n     - every non-`0` becomes `0`  \n     (This matches example 2, where the interior had only `0` and `2`, so it becomes a direct swap.)\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\n- In the test grid, the only `2` appears inside the **bottom-right 7\u00d77 frame of `5`s** (border rows 21\u201327 and cols 20\u201326).  \n- Extract its 5\u00d75 interior (rows 22\u201326, cols 21\u201325):\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0\n0 4 2 4 0\n0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n- There is **no `6`** inside, so use the inversion rule: `0 -> 2`, everything else (`2` and `4`) -> `0`.\n\n### Final output grid\n\n2,2,2,2,2  \n2,2,0,2,2  \n2,0,0,0,2  \n2,2,0,2,2  \n2,2,2,2,2",
