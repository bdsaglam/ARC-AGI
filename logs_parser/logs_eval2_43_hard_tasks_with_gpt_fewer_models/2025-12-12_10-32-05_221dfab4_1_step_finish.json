In the output, that same column span is treated differently depending on the **row index modulo 6** (using 1-based row numbering):\n   - Rows **1, 7, 13, 19, 25, ...** (i.e. `row % 6 == 1`):  \n     - Paint the band with **3**.  \n     - Also recolor every cell of the main drawing color (the non-background non-4 color) in that row to **3**.\n   - Rows **3, 5, 9, 11, 15, 17, ...** (i.e. `row % 6 == 3 or 5`):  \n     - Paint the band with **4** (overwriting whatever was there).\n   - All other rows (`row % 6 == 0, 2, 4`):  \n     - Clear the band back to the **background color** (erasing any drawing pixels that fall inside it).\n\n3. Outside that band, pixels remain unchanged except for the \u201crecolor to 3\u201d on rows where `row % 6 == 1`.\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\n- Background color is **8** (dominant).\n- Main drawing color is **6**.\n- The 4-bar is on the **first row**, spanning **columns 8\u201315** (8 cells).\n\nNow apply the modulo-6 rules across all 25 rows.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8  \n8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n<REASONING_MODEL_B model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_2_step_3\">\nLooking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Marker identification**: There's a row with 4s that defines vertical marker columns\n2. **Row classification**: \n   - Rows 0, 6, 12, 18, 24...

The problem seems to involve transforming grids, likely based on patterns.\n\n**Initial Analysis of the Examples:**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   The input has a blue background (1), teal objects (8), and a horizontal yellow (4) line at the bottom.\n    *   The output replaces columns containing the yellow line with a striped pattern of 3s, 4s, and the background.\n    *   I'm seeing a pattern that repeats every 6 rows. The stripe pattern seems to be based on whether the row number divided by 6 has a specific remainder.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Similar to Example 1, but with a different object color (red, 2), teal background (8), and the horizontal line of 4s is in a slightly different position.\n    *   The output follows a similar stripe pattern as in Example 1.\n    *   I'll need to verify if the stripe pattern is consistent with the background, the horizontal 4 bar, and the object.\n\n**Identifying the Rules Based on the Prompt:**\n\nThe prompt provides some clues:\n\n1.  **Horizontal Bar Detection:** The first step is to recognize the 4-bar and identify its column span.\n2.  **Window Creation:** This span is used as a \"fixed window\" to rewrite the grid.\n3.  **Alternating Row Pattern:** In the output, the bar rows will be rewritten, either with a 3 or 4, and the rows in-between will become the background color, erasing any objects there.\n4.  **\"Every 3rd bar row\" Special Rule:** \"Every third bar-row uses 3 instead of 4\". This seems critical, and I need to figure out what defines the \"3rd\" bar row.\n\n**Rule Refinement and Explanation:**\n\n1.  **Window Detection:** I confirm that the location of the 4's determines the columns that will be \"rewritten\" down the grid.\n2.  **The Window Pattern:** The repeating row cycle of 6 that I observed is related to how the grid will be rewritten\n3.  **Bar Row versus Bar Row Count:** I need to make sure I understand which rows get rewritten and in which order. The prompt says \"every 3rd bar-row (rows 1, 7, 13...)\". I need to verify that this aligns with the pattern I observe in the examples.\n4.  **Row Logic:** To build the output grid, I need to consider row numbers. If a row number divided by 6 has a remainder of 1 or has 0, the bar column is set to 3. If a row number divided by 6 has a remainder of 3 or 5, the bar column is set to 4. All other rows have the background color in the bar columns.\n\n5.  **Object Coloring:**\n    *   If a cell is in a \"bar\" row, and also has an object value, and if it's the \"3\" row, the object is turned into a 3. If it's the \"4\" row, the object is simply overwritten by 4.\n\n**Applying the Rules to the Test Input:**\n\nI will now apply what I figured out to the new grid:\n\n*   **Determine Window:** The 4-bar is at the top row (Row 1).\n*   **Generate Stripe Pattern:** Based on Row 1, I know I must start with the \"3-bar\", thus the stripe pattern will be 3, background, 4, background, 4, background, 3, background,... etc.\n*   **Iterate Through Grid:** I will go through each row and each column, rewriting values based on whether the column is in the \"fixed window\" and based on the repeating pattern, as well as considering if there are objects that need to be overwritten based on the prompt's rules.\n\n**The output grid is being constructed!**\n\n\nTo solve this task, we identify a specific pattern based on the presence of a horizontal \"bar\" of color 4 in the input grid. This bar establishes a vertical column window that dictates the transformation of the entire grid. The transformation creates a new pattern of horizontal stripes (\"bars\" and \"gaps\") while interacting with existing objects in the grid.\n\n**Rules of Transformation:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Window:** Locate the horizontal segment of color `4` in the input. In the test input, this is in Row 1, spanning columns 8 through 15 (0-indexed indices 7-14). This range of columns defines the \"Window\" for the transformation.\n2.  **Identify Colors:**\n    *   **Background:** The dominant uniform color (color `8`).\n    *   **Object Color:** The color of the irregular shapes (color `6`).\n    *   **Bar Colors:** Yellow (`4`) and Green (`3`).\n3.  **Apply Row-by-Row Logic:** Iterate through every row `r` (1-based index) of the grid and apply the following logic based on the row number:\n    *   **Even Rows (Gap Rows):**\n        *   The content within the Window is forced to the Background color (`8`).\n        *   Any Object pixels (`6`) existing inside the Window are erased (become `8`).\n        *   Pixels outside the Window remain unchanged.\n    *   **Odd Rows (Bar Rows):**\n        *   **Green Rows:** Every 6th row starting from row 1 (`r % 6 == 1`, i.e., rows 1, 7, 13, 19, 25...).\n            *   The Window is filled with Green (`3`).\n            *   **Crucially**, any Object pixels (`6`) anywhere in this row (inside or outside the window) are converted to Green (`3`).\n        *   **Yellow Rows:** All other odd rows (`r % 6 == 3` or `5`).\n            *   The Window is filled with Yellow (`4`).\n            *   Object pixels (`6`) *inside* the Window are overwritten by Yellow (`4`).\n            *   Object pixels (`6`) *outside* the Window remain unchanged.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Window:** Columns 8-15 (indices 7-14).\n*   **Row 1 (Green):** Window becomes `3`. No objects to convert.\n*   **Row 2 (Gap):** Window becomes `8`.\n*   **Row 3 (Yellow):** Window becomes `4`.\n*   **Row 4 (Gap):** Window becomes `8`. Object `6`s inside are erased.\n*   **Row 5 (Yellow):** Window becomes `4`. Object `6`s inside become `4`, outside remain `6`.\n*   **Row 6 (Gap):** Window becomes `8`. Object `6`s inside erased, outside remain `6`.\n*   **Row 7 (Green):** Window becomes `3`. All object `6`s become `3`.\n*   ...and so on for the 25 rows.\n\n**Output Generation:**\n\nrow 1: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\nrow 2: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\nrow 3: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\nrow 4: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\nrow 5: 8,8,8,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8\nrow 6: 8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\nrow 7: 8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8\nrow 8: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8\nrow 9: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\nrow 10: 8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\nrow 11: 8,8,8,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\nrow 12: 8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\nrow 13: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\nrow 14: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\nrow 15: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8\nrow 16: 8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8\nrow 17: 8,8,8,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\nrow 18: 8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\nrow 19: 8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\nrow 20: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\nrow 21: 8,8,8,8,8,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8\nrow 22: 8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\nrow 23: 8,8,8,8,8,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\nrow 24: 8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\nrow 25: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_E>\n<REASONING_MODEL_F model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_6_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\nLooking at this problem, I need to understand the transformation from the examples:\n\n1. **Identify key elements**: \n   -

                "response": "**Analysis and Recommendation for ARC Logic Puzzle Solutions**\n\nI've been tasked with acting as an ARC Logic Auditor for two potential solutions to an ARC puzzle. After thoroughly analyzing solved examples, I've developed a deep understanding of the underlying logic and have prepared a detailed audit of each candidate.\n\n**Key Logic:** The core principle appears to revolve around a horizontal bar of a specific color, which I'll call the \"Anchor Row\". The solution generates vertical projections from this bar, creating a repeating pattern. The pattern's behavior depends on the vertical distance from this anchor, which I'm expressing as \"Distance from Anchor\".\n\n**Solved Example Insights:** In these solved examples, the pattern repeats every six rows. In particular:\n\n*   Rows are categorized as \"Yellow,\" \"Gap,\" or \"Green\" based on their distance from the Anchor Row.\n*   On Yellow rows, the bar's columns become the bar color (Yellow), and any existing objects *inside* the bar columns get overwritten. Objects *outside* the columns are preserved.\n*   On Gap rows, the bar's columns are cleared. Any objects that were inside get erased. The pixels outside are unchanged.\n*   On Green rows, bar columns become Green.  Crucially, any non-background objects *on that entire row* are also recolored Green. This last point is essential and the most complex part of the logic.\n\n**Two Candidate Models:** I've carefully examined two candidate solutions.\n\n*   **Candidate 2:** Proposes an \"Absolute\" or fixed grid rule, where every sixth row from the top is a Green row. The Anchor and pattern are not linked.\n*   **Candidate 4:**  Proposes a \"Relative\" rule where the pattern is generated from the Anchor Bar's row. It defines its grid based off the source.\n\n**Audit Findings:**\n\n*   **Candidate 2's Absolute Approach:** While Candidate 2's solution is internally consistent, it's less likely because it assumes a fixed coordinate system (0-6 based) *independent* of the anchor bar's location. The Examples are fully consistent with this. The Test Input has the anchor at the beginning. If the anchor becomes \"green\" with 3 color, it becomes inconsistent. Because of this issue, I can rate it as Silver because it does work to the degree that examples and input are consistent.\n*   **Candidate 4's Relative Approach:** Candidate 4's solution is more elegant and robust. It uses the Anchor Row as the origin, correctly modeling its generation of vertical projections. It matches what happened in the Examples (anchor at end, projecting up) and also handles the test input (anchor at the beginning, projection down). Because the anchor is preserved and can be a source of the pattern, it is rated as Gold.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\n*   **Candidate 4 (Model B) is the Superior Solution. It addresses the anchor's placement by starting with the anchor.** Its relative logic, the generation is better because it:\n    *   It more logically connects the anchor to the created pattern,\n    *   Works consistently with the solved examples.\n*   **Candidate 2 (Model A) is Valid but less elegant (Silver).** It has valid logic.\n*   The final result should include both in the analysis.\n\nI recommend Candidate 4 as the gold standard solution.\n\n\n<AUDIT_LOG>\n### PHASE 1: LOGIC SELECTION & CRYSTALLIZATION\n\n**Candidate 2 (Model A - \"Absolute Phase Logic\"):**\n- **Logic:** The puzzle relies on a fixed grid-row property based on 1-based indexing modulo 6.\n- **Rule:**\n  1. Identify the \"Bar Columns\" from the row containing 4s.\n  2. For every row `r` (0-indexed):\n     - IF `r % 6 == 0`: **Green Row**. Set Bar Columns to 3. Change all Object (6) pixels in this row to 3.\n     - IF `r % 6 == 2` OR `r % 6 == 4`: **Yellow Row**. Set Bar Columns to 4. Overwrite Object pixels inside the bar with 4. Preserve Object pixels outside.\n     - IF `r` is Odd: **Gap Row**. Set Bar Columns to Background (8). Erase Object pixels inside the bar. Preserve Object pixels outside.\n\n**Candidate 4 (Model B - \"Relative Phase Logic\"):**\n- **Logic:** The puzzle relies on a repeating sequence starting from the \"Anchor\" (the row with the 4-bar) and propagating vertically.\n- **Rule:**\n  1. Identify the \"Anchor Row\" ($R_{anchor}$) and \"Bar Columns\".\n  2. For any row `r`, calculate distance $d = |r - R_{anchor}|$.\n  3. IF $d$ is Odd: **Gap Row**. Set Bar Columns to Background (8). Erase Object pixels inside the bar.\n  4. IF $d$ is Even: Calculate Segment Index $k = (d/2) + 1$.\n     - IF $k \\% 3 == 0$: **Green Row**. Set Bar Columns to 3. Change all Object (6) pixels in this row to 3.\n     - IF $k \\% 3 \\neq 0$: **Yellow Row**. Set Bar Columns to 4. Overwrite Object pixels inside the bar with 4.\n\n---\n\n### PHASE 2: THE GROUND TRUTH AUDIT\n\n**Target:** Example 1\n- **Input:** 29x22. Anchor (4-bar) at Row 28 (Bottom). Background 1. Objects 8.\n- **Candidate 2 (Absolute):**\n  - Row 28 ($28 \\% 6 = 4$): Rule says Yellow. **Observation:** Output Row 28 is 4s. **MATCH**.\n  - Row 24 ($24 \\% 6 = 0$): Rule says Green. **Observation:** Output Row 24 is 3s. **MATCH**.\n  - Row 22 ($22 \\% 6 = 4$): Rule says Yellow. **Observation:** Output Row 22 is 4s. **MATCH**.\n- **Candidate 4 (Relative):**\n  - Row 28 ($d=0, k=1$): Rule ($1 \\% 3 \\neq 0$) says Yellow. **Observation:** Output Row 28 is 4s. **MATCH**.\n  - Row 24 ($d=4, k=3$): Rule ($3 \\% 3 == 0$) says Green. **Observation:** Output Row 24 is 3s. **MATCH**.\n  - Row 22 ($d=6, k=4$): Rule ($4 \\% 3 \\neq 0$) says Yellow. **Observation:** Output Row 22 is 4s. **MATCH**.\n\n**Target:** Example 2\n- **Input:** 29x22. Anchor at Row 28. Background 8. Objects 2.\n- **Candidate 2 (Absolute):**\n  - Row 28 ($28 \\% 6 = 4$): Yellow. **Observation:** Match.\n  - Row 24 ($24 \\% 6 = 0$): Green. **Observation:** Match.\n- **Candidate 4 (Relative):**\n  - Row 28 ($d=0, k=1$): Yellow. **Observation:** Match.\n  - Row 24 ($d=4, k=3$): Green. **Observation:** Match.\n\n**Verdict:** Both candidates perfectly explain the solved examples because the Anchor Row (28) in the examples happens to align with the \"Yellow\" phase of the Absolute grid ($28 \\% 6 = 4$).\n\n---\n\n### PHASE 3: EXECUTION CONSISTENCY & DISCRIMINATION\n\n**Target:** Test Input\n- **Input:** 25x25. Anchor (4-bar) at **Row 0** (Top). Background 8. Objects 6.\n- **Critical Divergence:**\n  - **Candidate 2 (Absolute):** Row 0 is index 0. $0 \\% 6 = 0 \\to$ **Green Row**.\n    - **Prediction:** The Anchor (4-bar) at Row 0 must change to 3s.\n    - **Grid:** Candidate 2 proposes `3333...` at Row 0. Consistent with its rule.\n  - **Candidate 4 (Relative):** Row 0 is Distance 0. Segment 1. $1 \\% 3 \\neq 0 \\to$ **Yellow Row**.\n    - **Prediction:** The Anchor (4-bar) at Row 0 stays 4s.\n    - **Grid:** Candidate 4 proposes `4444...` at Row 0. Consistent with its rule.\n\n**Heuristic Evaluation:**\nIn ARC, \"Instructional Objects\" (like the 4-bar) often define the rule but are usually preserved unless the rule implies their transformation.\n- Candidate 4's logic (\"Relative\") creates a pattern *emanating* from the Anchor (4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3...). This preserves the Anchor as the start of the sequence.\n- Candidate 2's logic (\"Absolute\") assumes a global invisible grid where Row 0 is always Green. This forces the destruction of the Anchor.\n- **Key Observation from Ex 1:** The Anchor (Row 28) was 4. The row 4 steps away (Row 24) was 3. This establishes the phase relationship: Anchor=Yellow, Anchor+4=Green.\n- **Applying Ex 1 Phase to Test:** Anchor (Row 0) should be Yellow. Row 4 should be Green.\n- **Candidate 4** perfectly replicates this phase relationship (Row 0=4, Row 4=3).\n- **Candidate 2** reverses/shifts the phase (Row 0=3, Row 4=4), likely due to overfitting the coordinate math of Ex 1 rather than the relative object relationship.\n\n**Conclusion:** Candidate 4 is the robust logical solution. Candidate 2 is a plausible but \"overfit\" solution that fails to respect the Anchor's role as the pattern origin.\n\n### PHASE 4: STACK RANKING\n1. **Candidate 4 (GOLD):** Perfect logic, preserves Anchor, generalizes directionality (downwards vs upwards), consistent execution.\n2. **Candidate 2 (SILVER):** Valid logic based on coordinates, consistent execution, but unnecessarily destructive to the Anchor and assumes global coordinates over local relationships.\n\n</AUDIT_LOG>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 4,\n      \"score\": 9.5,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Perfectly captures the relative phase relationship (4, 4, 3...) starting from the Anchor row, explaining both solved examples and the test input without contradictions.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Consistent\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Define a vertical cycle (Yellow, Yellow, Green) on even rows relative to the 4-bar anchor.

horizontal \u201ckey bar\u201d of color 4** (in the examples it\u2019s on the last row).  \n   Its **column span** (start/end columns of the contiguous 4s) is used as a fixed vertical band in the whole grid.\n\n2. In the output, that same column span is treated differently depending on the **row index modulo 6** (using 1-based row numbering):\n   - Rows **1, 7, 13, 19, 25, ...** (i.e. `row % 6 == 1`):  \n     - Paint the band with **3**.  \n     - Also recolor every cell of the main drawing color (the non-background non-4 color) in that row to **3**.\n   - Rows **3, 5, 9, 11, 15, 17, ...** (i.e. `row % 6 == 3 or 5`):  \n     - Paint the band with **4** (overwriting whatever was there).\n   - All other rows (`row % 6 == 0, 2, 4`):  \n     - Clear the band back to the **background color** (erasing any drawing pixels that fall inside it).\n\n3. Outside that band, pixels remain unchanged except for the \u201crecolor to 3\u201d on rows where `row % 6 == 1`.\n\n---\n\n### Apply to the test input\n\n- Background color is **8** (dominant).\n- Main drawing color is **6**.\n- The 4-bar is on the **first row**, spanning **columns 8\u201315** (8 cells).\n\nNow apply the modulo-6 rules across all 25 rows.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8  \n8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6  \n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8  \n8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8  \n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,6,6,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6\n      8,8,8,8,8,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8\n      8,8,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"B\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_2_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Marker identification**: There's a row with 4s that defines vertical marker columns\n2. **Row classification**: \n   - Rows 0, 6, 12, 18, 24...

model_id=\"gemini-3-high_6_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Here's how I'm thinking about this task:**\n\nI'm being asked to solve an ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) task, which means I'll need to figure out the underlying rule based on a few examples and apply it to a new test input. The problem seems to involve transforming grids, likely based on patterns.\n\n**Initial Analysis of the Examples:**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   The input has a blue background (1), teal objects (8), and a horizontal yellow (4) line at the bottom.\n    *   The output replaces columns containing the yellow line with a striped pattern of 3s, 4s, and the background.\n    *   I'm seeing a pattern that repeats every 6 rows. The stripe pattern seems to be based on whether the row number divided by 6 has a specific remainder.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Similar to Example 1, but with a different object color (red, 2), teal background (8), and the horizontal line of 4s is in a slightly different position.\n    *   The output follows a similar stripe pattern as in Example 1.\n    *   I'll need to verify if the stripe pattern is consistent with the background, the horizontal 4 bar, and the object.\n\n**Identifying the Rules Based on the Prompt:**\n\nThe prompt provides some clues:\n\n1.  **Horizontal Bar Detection:** The first step is to recognize the 4-bar and identify its column span.\n2.  **Window Creation:** This span is used as a \"fixed window\" to rewrite the grid.\n3.  **Alternating Row Pattern:** In the output, the bar rows will be rewritten, either with a 3 or 4, and the rows in-between will become the background color, erasing any objects there.\n4.  **\"Every 3rd bar row\" Special Rule:** \"Every third bar-row uses 3 instead of 4\". This seems critical, and I need to figure out what defines the \"3rd\" bar row.\n\n**Rule Refinement and Explanation:**\n\n1.  **Window Detection:** I confirm that the location of the 4's determines the columns that will be \"rewritten\" down the grid.\n2.  **The Window Pattern:** The repeating row cycle of 6 that I observed is related to how the grid will be rewritten\n3.  **Bar Row versus Bar Row Count:** I need to make sure I understand which rows get rewritten and in which order. The prompt says \"every 3rd bar-row (rows 1, 7, 13...)\". I need to verify that this aligns with the pattern I observe in the examples.\n4.  **Row Logic:** To build the output grid, I need to consider row numbers. If a row number divided by 6 has a remainder of 1 or has 0, the bar column is set to 3. If a row number divided by 6 has a remainder of 3 or 5, the bar column is set to 4. All other rows have the background color in the bar columns.\n\n5.  **Object Coloring:**\n    *   If a cell is in a \"bar\" row, and also has an object value, and if it's the \"3\" row, the object is turned into a 3. If it's the \"4\" row, the object is simply overwritten by 4.\n\n**Applying the Rules to the Test Input:**\n\nI will now apply what I figured out to the new grid:\n\n*   **Determine Window:** The 4-bar is at the top row (Row 1).\n*   **Generate Stripe Pattern:** Based on Row 1, I know I must start with the \"3-bar\", thus the stripe pattern will be 3, background, 4, background, 4, background, 3, background,... etc.\n*   **Iterate Through Grid:** I will go through each row and each column, rewriting values based on whether the column is in the \"fixed window\" and based on the repeating pattern, as well as considering if there are objects that need to be overwritten based on the prompt's rules.\n\n**The output grid is being constructed!**\n\n\nTo solve this task, we identify a specific pattern based on the presence of a horizontal \"bar\" of color 4 in the input grid. This bar establishes a vertical column window that dictates the transformation of the entire grid. The transformation creates a new pattern of horizontal stripes (\"bars\" and \"gaps\") while interacting with existing objects in the grid.\n\n**Rules of Transformation:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Window:** Locate the horizontal segment of color `4` in the input. In the test input, this is in Row 1, spanning columns 8 through 15 (0-indexed indices 7-14). This range of columns defines the \"Window\" for the transformation.\n2.  **Identify Colors:**\n    *   **Background:** The dominant uniform color (color `8`).\n    *   **Object Color:** The color of the irregular shapes (color `6`).\n    *   **Bar Colors:** Yellow (`4`) and Green (`3`).\n3.  **Apply Row-by-Row Logic:** Iterate through every row `r` (1-based index) of the grid and apply the following logic based on the row number:\n    *   **Even Rows (Gap Rows):**\n        *   The content within the Window is forced to the Background color (`8`).\n        *   Any Object pixels (`6`) existing inside the Window are erased (become `8`).\n        *   Pixels outside the Window remain unchanged.\n    *   **Odd Rows (Bar Rows):**\n        *   **Green Rows:** Every 6th row starting from row 1 (`r % 6 == 1`, i.e., rows 1, 7, 13, 19, 25...).\n            *   The Window is filled with Green (`3`).\n            *   **Crucially**, any Object pixels (`6`) anywhere in this row (inside or outside the window) are converted to Green (`3`).\n        *   **Yellow Rows:** All other odd rows (`r % 6 == 3` or `5`).\n            *   The Window is filled with Yellow (`4`).\n            *   Object pixels (`6`) *inside* the Window are overwritten by Yellow (`4`).\n            *   Object pixels (`6`) *outside* the Window remain unchanged.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Window:** Columns 8-15 (indices 7-14).\n*   **Row 1 (Green):** Window becomes `3`. No objects to convert.\n*   **Row 2 (Gap):** Window becomes `8`.\n*   **Row 3 (Yellow):** Window becomes `4`.\n*   **Row 4 (Gap):** Window becomes `8`.

Row % 6 == 0: GREEN (3) - extends to cover full shape width if shapes present\n   - Row % 6 == 2 or 4: YELLOW (4) - only in marker columns\n   - Row % 6 == 1, 3, or 5: GAP - marker columns become background\n\n3. **Shape handling**:\n   - On GREEN rows: Green fills marker columns AND extends to cover entire shape regions (merging if adjacent)\n   - On YELLOW rows: Only marker columns become yellow; shapes outside marker columns are preserved\n   -

It may have multiple ANSWER blocks, all with the same OUTPUT_GRID.\n  2. Among its ANSWERs, choose a \"representative explanation\":\n     - Prefer the explanation that is:\n       - most complete,\n       - least self-contradictory,\n       - easiest to understand.\n  3.

Take its representative rule (from STEP 1).\n  2. Apply the rule *conceptually* to the TEST_INPUT:\n     - You do not need to compute a perfect output from scratch;\n       focus on key structural consequences of the rule.\n  3. Check whether the candidate's test OUTPUT_GRID is a reasonable outcome\n     of that rule.\n     - If the grid blatantly violates the described rule, mark this as a\n       contradiction.\n     - If the grid is broadly consistent, mark it as plausible.\n\nSTEP 4 -- SCORING AND GLOBAL RANKING\n\nFor each candidate, assign a numeric SCORE from 0 to 10:\n  - 10: Rule is simple and coherent, strongly consistent with all training\n        examples, and the test grid fits the rule.\n  - 7-9: Mostly consistent with examples; minor ambiguities or small issues.\n  - 4-6: Some consistency, but noticeable contradictions or hand-wavy parts.\n  - 1-3: Major contradictions with examples or test grid; rule not credible.\n  - 0: Completely incompatible with examples; or explanation is nonsense.\n\nThen:\n  - Rank all candidates in descending order of SCORE.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>\n<OUTPUT_FORMAT>\nReturn a single JSON object with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 8.7,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Partial\"\n          /* add more keys if there are more training examples */\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Rule matches main behaviors across examples; minor ambiguity in example 3.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Short, 1-3 sentence description of this candidate's representative rule.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 1,\n      \"score\": 6.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Partial\",\n          \"2\": \"Fail\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Contradiction in example 2; seems overfitted.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Contradictory\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"...\"\n    }\n    /* etc. for all candidates */\n  ],\n  \"final_ranking_by_candidate\": [\n    0,\n    4,\n    5,\n    1\n    /* list all candidate_ids, ordered from most to least plausible */\n  ]\n}\n\nConstraints:\n- Do not add any fields outside this schema.\n- All candidate_id values must match the id attributes in the <CANDIDATE> tags.\n</OUTPUT_FORMAT>",
                "response": "**Initial Assessment: Auditing Candidates for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, I'm being asked to deeply analyze two candidates (IDs 2 and 4) who've attempted to solve a specific ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) problem. The goal is to determine which candidate provides a more accurate and logically sound solution. The problem itself involves manipulating a grid based on the presence of a horizontal bar of a specific color, with the output showing transformations.\n\n**Understanding the Task**\n\nThe key to this problem lies in understanding the interaction between the colored shapes and background, and a uniquely colored horizontal \"bar\". This bar dictates how the grid will be transformed. Based on initial analysis, I've gathered the core steps:\n1.  Identify the horizontal bar (color 4, \"yellow\").\n2.  The bar defines a set of vertical columns, a \"strip\".\n3.  The output grid is built using a repeating pattern applied to this strip. The pattern looks like it has a period or cycle.\n\n**Training Example Exploration**\n\nI'm starting by carefully analyzing the provided training examples. This is where I'll build my rule.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n*   First, I'm looking at the input grid's dimensions, colors, and bar coordinates.  This will help me build the transformation rule.\n*   I carefully check the bar's position and width. It spans 4 cells in the bottom row.\n*   The bar's columns seem to have an interesting vertical pattern (period 6).\n*   The pattern is: 3 (color), BG (background), 4 (bar color), BG, 4, BG.\n*   Now, I have a preliminary idea about how the horizontal bar in the input interacts with the shapes in that region and how to extrapolate this idea to every row.\n*   The output changes pixels in the columns where the bar is located.\n*   It seems shapes in the \"3\" rows change to the color 3.  The shape outside of bar columns seems to stay the same.  If the bar is in a BG row, everything is clear in those columns.\n*   For Example 1, rows start with 1. It also seems that the cycle is tied to the grid rows themselves, not the bar's position. This is an important detail. The first row appears to be the \"3\" row in the output.\n\n**Example 2 Exploration:**\n*   I'm now repeating the process with the second example to validate the pattern.\n*   It confirms the pattern length (6 rows).\n*   Shape pixels also react to the \"3\" rows (shape = 2 turns into 3).\n\n**Rule Summary**\nBased on both examples, I can now summarize my rule:\n\n1.  Find the columns where the horizontal bar is present (strip).\n2.  This strip is patterned by row index mod 6:\n    *   `Row % 6 == 1`: The strip becomes color 3. All shape pixels on the row in that column become 3.\n    *   `Row % 6 == 3 or 5`: The strip becomes color 4. Shape pixels within the strip change to 4.\n    *   `Row % 6 == 0, 2, or 4`: The strip becomes the background.\n\n**Candidate 2 Audit**\n\nNow, I'm auditing Candidate 2's solution.\n\n*   Candidate 2's explanation is reasonable; it seems to match my derived rule.\n*   I'll carefully analyze Candidate 2 against the Test Input.\n*   The Test Input has a yellow bar at the first row (1).\n*   Row 1 becomes 3 (per Candidate 2's logic).\n*   Looking at the example, this *looks* consistent... but I need to consider it carefully.\n*   But is the cycle absolute (tied to the grid) or relative (starts at the bar)? Let's check.\n*   It seems Candidate 2 takes the \"fixed to grid\" approach. The examples have the bar at the bottom, and row 1 *just happens* to be the right phase.\n*   Now, I have to think about how I would generalize this to an input where the bar is *not* in the bottom row.\n*   So, if I assume fixed (row 1 is ALWAYS the start of a \"3\"), what happens in the test? The model turns my *yellow bar* into a green one. That breaks the marker semantic.\n\n**Candidate 4 Audit**\nNext, I'm looking at Candidate 4.\n\n*   Candidate 4 states that the horizontal 4-bar is key.\n*   Candidate 4 seems to focus on the bar, creating a pattern *relative* to it.\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 4,\n      \"score\": 10.0,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"The rule (pattern relative to marker row) perfectly explains both training examples, correctly identifying the 4-4-3 cycle starting from the marker.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Identify the 4-bar columns.
