            "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Thoughts and Problem Decomposition**\n\nAlright, the user wants me to tackle an ARC task. My initial assessment is to break this down into understanding the input-output relationship through the provided examples. I need to identify the core transformation rules.\n\n**1. Example Analysis and Pattern Extraction**\n\nFirst, I looked at example grids. My initial thought was to identify the key elements: shapes, colors, and their arrangement. I saw the input grids have several colored objects enclosed within a background grid. In the examples, the walls were usually color 3 (green), and the background was 8 (teal). The inner colors (let's say \"payload\") were the ones I was interested in.\n\nI began to hypothesize. Based on the examples, I thought about how the \"payload\" seems to \"leak\" out of the containers, and I realized there were specific rules:\n\n*   **Orthogonal Leak:** If there's an opening on one side of a container, the inner color extends outwards in that direction. The key is to find the opening or \u201cgap\u201d.\n*   **Diagonal Leak:** If a corner of a container is open (meaning there's a diagonal \"gap\" in the walls), the inner color extends diagonally.\n\nI confirmed my thinking with the provided examples; gaps would result in colored \"beams\" that went across the board until they hit another object or the edge of the grid. I recognized that these leaks were the key to the solution. I also saw that walls or objects can block these leaking paths.\n\n**2. Algorithm Design and Refinement**\n\nNext, I worked on formalizing the algorithm. I came up with these major steps:\n\n*   **Object Identification:** The first step is to recognize connected blocks (objects) of non-background colors. I assumed that walls and inner objects are different and can be distinguished by specific colors (3 as wall, the rest as content).\n*   **Leak Detection:** I had to identify the \"leaks\". I thought if a color cell is not a wall and is next to the background, it starts a leak in a specific direction. I had two cases:\n    *   **Orthogonal Leak:** If a cell is surrounded on one side by the background, then a straight line is drawn from this \"leaking\" pixel until it hits another object.\n    *   **Diagonal Leak:** If two common neighbors of the background pixel are walls and a cell is connected diagonally to that pixel, then a beam is created in a diagonal direction.\n*   **Beam Propagation:** This is about drawing the leaked \"beams\" starting from the leaked pixel. I created a list that contains positions, leak directions, and leaking color. I propagated each beam step-by-step to the grid edge or until it hit a blocking object.\n\n**3. Beam Collision Handling**\n\nI then had to take into account beams that hit each other. The key question was: which beam takes precedence? My reasoning here was a bit complex. First I assumed that no collision causes beams to stop and that beams had the same \"power\". However, based on the examples and tests, it looked like there were some rules:\n\n*   **Beam Blocking:** Beams would stop if they hit a wall, other objects, or another beam.\n*   **Crossing Avoidance** If two beams are diagonally set to cross, it looks like they will take vertical directions instead to avoid crossing.\n*   **Power/Precedence** in the case of colliding, verticals win over diagonals, and diagonals over horizontals.\n\n**4. Test Input Application**\n\nI thought about how to apply this to the new test input. In this input:\n\n*   I saw that the wall color was 8 (teal) and that background was 0.\n*   I identified the objects:  There were red, green, yellow, and orange objects, each with specific positions in the input grid.\n*   I then applied my leak detection and propagation steps and manually traced the beams to verify the correctness of my thinking, and made sure that there were no bugs.\n\n**Final Steps**\n\nFinally, after validating my logic with the detailed path tracing and conflict resolution, I can generate the final output grid. The primary task is now converting the ideas into a code function to process all inputs.\n\n\nThe logic for the transformation is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** The grid consists of a background (0), walls (8), and \"content\" objects (regions of colors 2, 3, 4, 7). The content objects are enclosed by walls.\n2.  **Identify Leaks:** A \"leak\" occurs where the wall enclosing the content is breached.\n    *   **Orthogonal Leak:** If a content pixel is directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to a background pixel (0), a beam of that color shoots out in that direction.\n    *   **Diagonal Leak (Corner Gap):** If a content pixel is diagonally adjacent to a background pixel, and the two common neighbors are wall pixels (8), this constitutes a \"corner gap\". A beam of that color shoots out diagonally through the gap.\n3.  **Propagate Beams:**\n    *   Beams travel in straight lines until they hit the grid edge or an obstacle.\n    *   **Interactions:**\n        *   **Vertical vs. Horizontal:** Vertical beams block horizontal beams (observed in Example 1 and 3).\n        *   **Vertical vs. Diagonal:** Vertical beams block diagonal beams.\n        *   **Diagonal vs. Diagonal:** If paths cross without landing on the same cell, they pass through. If they land on the same cell, a collision occurs (not present in this specific test case).\n    *   **Beam Directions in Test Input:**\n        *   **Red (2, Top Right):**\n            *   Top-Left Corner Gap -> Diagonal Up-Left Beam.\n            *   Top-Right Corner Gap -> Diagonal Up-Right Beam.\n            *   Bottom-Right Corner Gap -> Diagonal Down-Right Beam.\n        *   **Green (3, Mid Left):**\n            *   Bottom Orthogonal Gap -> Vertical Down Beam.\n            *   Top-Left Corner Gap -> Diagonal Up-Left Beam.\n            *   Bottom-Right Corner Gap -> Diagonal Down-Right Beam.\n        *   **Yellow (4, Mid Right):**\n            *   Bottom Orthogonal Gap -> Vertical Down Beam.\n            *   Top-Right Corner Gap -> Diagonal Up-Right Beam.\n            *   Bottom-Left Corner Gap -> Diagonal Down-Left Beam.\n        *   **Orange (7, Bottom Right):**\n            *   Right Orthogonal Gap -> Horizontal Right Beam.\n            *   Bottom Orthogonal Gap -> Vertical Down Beam.\n4.  **Resolve Collisions:**\n    *   The Green Down-Right beam intersects the Yellow Vertical Down beam at `(18, 12)`. The Vertical beam acts as a wall, stopping the Green beam at `(17, 11)`.\n    *   The Yellow Down-Left beam intersects the Green Vertical Down beam at `(18, 5)`. The Vertical beam acts as a wall, stopping the Yellow beam at `(17, 6)`.\n\n**Final Output Grid:**\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0\n0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,2,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,8,8,0,0,0,0,8,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,3,8,0,0,8,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,3,8,0,0,8,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,8,3,0,0,4,8,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,3,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,7,7,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Deep Dive into a Complex Pattern**\n\nAlright, here's how I'm thinking about this ARC puzzle: the goal is to process an image and generate a new one, based on some hidden rules, that I have to work out by looking at a bunch of examples and the output grids.\n\nI'm starting by carefully dissecting an example image. There's a background color (that teal 8!), and then these \"objects\" - groups of colored pixels that are surrounded by a kind of \"frame\". The first thing I'm trying to see is if the frame shape, the color of the \"fill\" inside, and any \"openings\" work together. For instance, sometimes those frames are like boxes that are missing a corner, or have a side missing.\n\nThe key I think is the \"rays\" which are lines that begin from the \"openings\" in these frames. Now the shape of the frame seems to define where these openings are, but also what the \"direction\" of the line coming out is. It's like the color inside that frame is \"shooting out\" and creating a line of it's self to hit the edge of the screen, or perhaps another line!\n\nThe key is in where those lines begin, and how to define them. I'm focusing on \"holes\" in the frame.\n\nAs an expert, I'm trying to refine my initial guess as I discover a more nuanced set of rules. I start to think that objects have a color, and that the missing parts of the \"frame\" are critical. For simple frames, I can see a \"box\" that has 4 sides, and a color in the middle. Where a corner is missing, there's a starting \"point\" for a ray. And if a side is missing, it's a starting point too.\n\nThen I get to the interaction. So rays come from holes. In the example, rays of different colors collide. It's all about how they meet:\n\n-   If it's straight on, the two merge into a vertical line. It is like the sum of their 'directions', if the direction sums to zero, they form a vertical line. This is easy!\n-   If two come together \"diagonally\" with a 1 pixel gap - they turn vertical at that gap. \n-   But when rays cross orthogonally, it's like they form a stream in the average direction.\n\nHere is the really interesting part:\n\nIf one ray hits an existing beam, it changes that ray's path. I've been thinking about this in terms of *energy* or *momentum*. If another ray is blocking a particle, it will go the next direction instead!\n\nThe examples show how the lines act. And I have to get it right. So, I have found a set of very specific rules, so I should be able to get the right output.\n\nFrom there, I've got a system, so it is just math and pattern recognition. I am basically taking the problem, calculating the steps, and predicting the outcome.\n\nI've tested all this on the test input, it looks like all the pieces fit!\n\n\n\nThe task involves identifying objects (colored frames with an inner color), finding \"holes\" in the frames (missing pixels in the rectangular boundary), and extending rays of the inner color from these holes. The rays travel in the direction defined by the hole's position relative to the object's center (corners -> diagonal, sides -> orthogonal). Rays interact when they collide:\n1.  **Symmetric Collision:** If two rays meet head-on or converge symmetrically (e.g., adjacent columns/rows), they merge and form a parallel stream perpendicular to the axis of collision (usually vertical).\n2.  **Asymmetric/Line Collision:** If a ray hits an existing ray path, it merges and changes direction based on the vector sum of the two rays (e.g., diagonal + diagonal crossing -> vertical).\n3.  **Obstacle:** If a ray hits a solid object or a stream it cannot merge with (e.g. perpendicular hit), it stops.\n\n**Object Analysis for Test Input:**\n-   **Red Object (Top-Right):** Frame 8, Inner 2. Holes at NW(6,22), NE(6,25), SE(9,25).\n    -   Rays: NW (Diag), NE (Diag), SE (Diag).\n-   **Green Object (Mid-Left):** Frame 8, Inner 3. Holes at NW(10,4), NE(10,7), S(13,5).\n    -   Rays: NW (Diag), NE (Diag), S (Down).\n-   **Yellow Object (Mid-Right):** Frame 8, Inner 4. Holes at NW(10,11), NE(10,14), S(13,12).\n    -   Rays: NW (Diag), NE (Diag), S (Down).\n-   **Orange Object (Bottom-Right):** Frame 8, Inner 7. Holes at NE(24,26), E(26,26), S(27,24).\n    -   Rays: NE (Diag), E (Right), S (Down).\n\n**Ray Interactions:**\n1.  **Green NE (3) vs Yellow NW (4):**\n    -   Green NE starts at (10,7). Yellow NW starts at (10,11).\n    -   At Row 9, they are at cols 8 and 10 (Gap 1).\n    -   This triggers a symmetric collision. They merge into a vertical stream at Row 8.\n    -   Stream occupies cols 8 and 9, going UP from Row 8 to Row 0.\n    -   Color pattern: Left ray (Green 3) takes left col (8), Right ray (Yellow 4) takes right col (9).\n2.  **Yellow NE (4) vs Red NW (2):**\n    -   Red NW ray exists from (6,22) traveling Up-Left. Path includes (4,20).\n    -   Yellow NE ray travels Up-Right from (10,14). Path: (9,15)->(8,16)->(7,17)->(6,18)->(5,19)->(4,20).\n    -   Yellow ray hits Red ray at (4,20).\n    -   Interaction: Merge and turn Vertical Up (Vector Sum: NW+NE -> Up).\n    -   Yellow ray becomes a vertical line at col 20 from row 4 upwards (0-4).\n    -   Pixel (4,20) becomes 4 (Yellow overwrites Red).\n3.  **Other Rays:** Extend to grid edges without collision.\n\n**Output Generation:**\n-   Fill holes in objects with inner colors.\n-   Draw calculated rays.\n-   **G2/Y1 Stream:** Cols 8,9 from Row 8 up to 0. (Col 8=3, Col 9=4).\n-   **Y2 Stream:** Col 20 from Row 4 up to 0. (Color 4).\n-   **R1 Ray:** Diagonal from (6,22) to (0,16). (Color 2). Segment at (4,20) is 4.\n-   **R2, R3, G1, G3, Y3, O1, O2, O3:** Draw standard paths.\n\n```\n0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,4,0,3,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,4,0,0,0,2,8,8,2,0,0,0,0\n0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,0,0\n3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,0,0\n0,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,2,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,0,3,8,8,3,0,4,0,4,8,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,8,3,3,8,0,0,8,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,3,8,0,0,8,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,8,0,0,0,0,8,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,7,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,7,7,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,7,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

The frames have \"gaps\" - positions where the frame color is missing\n3. From each gap, a line of the center color extends outward:\n   - Corner gaps create diagonal lines going away from the center\n   - Edge gaps create straight lines perpendicular to that edge\n4. Lines extend until they hit the grid boundary\n\nFor the test input (background 0, frame color 8):\n\n**Square with color 2** (rows 6-9, cols 22-25):\n- Gaps at corners (6,22), (6,25), (9,25)\n- Lines: diagonal up-left from (6,22), diagonal up-right from (6,25), diagonal down-right from (9,25)\n\n**Square with color 3** (rows 10-13, cols 4-7):\n- Gaps at (10,4), (10,7), (13,5), (13,7)\n- Lines: diagonal up-left, diagonal up-right, straight down, diagonal down-right\n\n**Square with color 4** (rows 10-13, cols 10-13):\n- Gaps at (10,10), (10,13), (13,10), (13,12)\n- Lines: diagonal up-left, diagonal up-right, diagonal down-left, straight down\n\n**Square with color 7** (rows 24-27, cols 23-26):\n- Gaps at (24,26), (26,26), (27,24)\n- Lines: diagonal up-right, straight right, straight down\n\n```\n4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,2,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0\n3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,8,8,2,0,0,0,0\n0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,2,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,8,8,3,0,0,4,8,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,3,8,0,0,8,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,3,8,0,0,8,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,8,3,0,0,4,8,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7\n0,4,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,8,8,8,7,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,8,7,7,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,8,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,8,7,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Solution for ARC Problem**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC problem. The goal is to figure out the rule based on example grids and apply it to a new one.  It's all about 2D grids of numbers (0-9).  I've got a lot of hints, and my initial thought is, let's look at the examples and see if the hints hold up, and what they really mean.\n\nThe hints talk about \"green framed markers,\" \"wire/path structures,\" and \"Manhattan shortest-path routing.\" I see a lot of diagonal and orthogonal stuff.  Okay, so, starting with the examples, I need to look for specific structures. The \"green framed markers\" seem important.  Those are the *starting points* or *destinations* of the \"wires\". I'm thinking they are a central clue.  So, I start looking for these \"markers\" in the examples.\n\nI focus on the colors and the structures they form.  It's clear that certain structures have the same inner number, and a frame of another number. And that's usually the \"marker.\" Then I trace each \"marker\" back to a structure. Ok, so these \"markers\" are the key.  From the \"markers,\" these wires/paths sprout.\n\nI confirm the \"green framed marker\" is, in fact, the frame, and the core inner color is what the paths are made of.  The next big thing I'm trying to figure out is the *direction* of the paths.  It seems to involve either diagonal or orthogonal lines, but the hint says \"Manhattan\".  I suspect it may be a mix.\n\nAfter much investigation, it all seems to boil down to, *If* there is a break or \"opening\" (a missing pixel) in the frame of this marker, then there is a path extending from that opening.  I can define whether the path will be an orthogonal line or diagonal line based on whether there is an orthogonal opening (on the side) or a corner opening. The \"markers\" create either straight horizontal/vertical lines *or* diagonal lines depending on where there's an opening on their frames.  I also see that it is all based on a 4 pixel \"frame\", similar to the examples.\n\nThe most complex bit is when paths cross or overlap.  It seems that for the most part, newer paths seem to overwrite the older ones? (or the horizontal beams get overwritten).\n\nI finally formulate a set of rules:\n\n1.  **Identify Markers:** Find structures with the same number in the center of an enclosing frame of another.\n2.  **Openings:** For each, check the pixel neighbors of the core.  If a neighbor is *not* green (not the frame color), that's an opening.\n3.  **Path Direction:** If it is Orthogonal (Top, Bottom, Left, Right of the core), then use a straight (horizontal/vertical) line. If it is Diagonal (corners of the frame), use a diagonal line.\n\nNow I am ready to implement this logic on the test input.\n\nI go through each area with a suspected marker in the new grid. I figure out each of the start and end-points for the new lines.\n\nFinally, I draw the paths according to the rules I found: draw the diagonals first, then the orthogonal lines, ensuring that paths do not pass into an area where there's a frame.\n\nTo solve this ARC task, we analyze the relationship between the input and output grids in the provided examples.\n\n**Rule Inference:**\n\n1.  **Identify Markers:** The input contains \"green framed markers\" (in the examples, color 3 frames; in the test input, color 8 frames). These are rectangular structures consisting of a \"Core\" of a specific color enclosed by a \"Frame\" of the frame color.\n    *   Example 1 uses Green (3) frames.\n    *   Test Input uses Teal (8) frames.\n    *   The core pixels determine the color of the paths to be drawn.\n\n2.  **Identify Openings:** We examine the boundary of the marker (the frame and its corners) to find \"openings\" (pixels that are not the frame color, usually background 0 or 8).\n    *   **Orthogonal Openings:** If a pixel directly adjacent to the core (Up, Down, Left, Right) is open (i.e., the frame is missing on that side), a straight **Orthogonal Beam** (Vertical or Horizontal) is projected from that opening in that direction.\n    *   **Corner Openings:** If a pixel diagonally adjacent to the frame (Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right relative to the bounding box) is open (background), a **Diagonal Beam** is projected from that corner in the corresponding diagonal direction (Up-Left, Up-Right, Down-Left, Down-Right).\n\n3.  **Path Extension:**\n    *   Paths extend until they reach the grid boundary or a blocking object (like another fixed marker frame).\n    *   Fixed markers (the frames) block paths.\n    *   Where paths intersect:\n        *   Orthogonal beams appear to overwrite Diagonal beams (based on observing intersections in examples).\n        *   Generally, the specific logic for this puzzle involving non-colliding diagonals and clear orthogonal paths simplifies the conflicts.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\nThe grid background is 0. The frames are 8 (Teal).\n\n*   **Marker A (Core 2 - Red):** Located at Top-Right (Rows 7-8, Cols 23-24). Frame Rows 6-9, Cols 22-25.\n    *   **TL Corner (6, 22):** Open (0). -> **Path Up-Left.**\n    *   **TR Corner (6, 25):** Open (0). -> **Path Up-Right.**\n    *   **BL Corner (9, 22):** Blocked (8). -> No Path.\n    *   **BR Corner (9, 25):** Open (0). -> **Path Down-Right.**\n\n*   **Marker B (Core 3 - Green):** Located at Mid-Left (Rows 11-12, Cols 5-6). Frame Rows 10-13, Cols 4-7.\n    *   **TL Corner (10, 4):** Open (0). -> **Path Up-Left.**\n    *   **TR Corner (10, 7):** Open (0). -> **Path Up-Right.**\n    *   **BL Corner (13, 4):** Blocked (8). -> No Path.\n    *   **BR Corner (13, 7):** Open (0). -> **Path Down-Right.**\n    *   **Bottom Side (13, 5):** Open (0). -> **Orthogonal Path Down.**\n\n*   **Marker C (Core 4 - Yellow):** Located at Center (Rows 11-12, Cols 11-12). Frame Rows 10-13, Cols 10-13.\n    *   **TL Corner (10, 10):** Open (0). -> **Path Up-Left.**\n    *   **TR Corner (10, 13):** Open (0). -> **Path Up-Right.**\n    *   **BL Corner (13, 10):** Open (0). -> **Path Down-Left.**\n    *   **BR Corner (13, 13):** Blocked (8). -> No Path.\n    *   **Bottom Side (13, 12):** Open (0). -> **Orthogonal Path Down.**\n\n*   **Marker D (Core 7 - Orange):** Located at Bottom-Right (Rows 25-26, Cols 24-25). Frame Rows 24-27, Cols 23-26.\n    *   **TL Corner (24, 23):** Blocked (8). -> No Path.\n    *   **TR Corner (24, 26):** Open (0). -> **Path Up-Right.**\n    *   **Right Side (26, 26):** Open (0). -> **Orthogonal Path Right.**\n    *   **Bottom Side (27, 24):** Open (0). -> **Orthogonal Path Down.**\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\nWe draw the paths on the grid. Orthogonal paths overwrite diagonals if they overlap (though in this specific configuration, overlaps are minimal or handled by start points).\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0\n3,0,4,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0\n0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,4,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,2,0,0,0,0\n4,0,0,0,3,8,8,3,0,0,4,8,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0\n0,4,0,0,8,3,3,8,0,0,8,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,4,0,8,3,3,8,0,0,8,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,4,8,3,8,3,0,0,4,8,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7\n0,4,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,7,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,8,7,7,7,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,8,7,7,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,8,0,8,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Green framed markers remain fixed; their inner color is the palette used for newly drawn pixels.\n* The output adds 1-cell-wide \u201cwire/path\u201d structures, often using stair-step diagonals consistent with Manhattan shortest-path routing.\n* Many paths extend until they hit the grid boundary (edges/corners look like endpoints/targets).\n* Where paths meet/overlap, colors are not simply overwritten; multi-color junctions/alternation patterns appear.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Green-framed shapes** (using 8 as frame in test, 3 in examples) with colored interiors remain fixed\n2. **Gaps in the frame** (background color where frame should be) indicate where paths extend from\n3. **Corner gaps** create diagonal paths outward; **edge gaps** create perpendicular paths\n4. **Paths extend until hitting the grid boundary**\n5. The **inner color** fills the gaps and draws the paths\n\nFor the test input, I identify:\n- **Shape 1** (color 2) at rows 6-9, cols 22-25: gaps at top-left (6,22), top-right (6,25), bottom-right (9,25) \u2192 diagonal paths\n- **Shape 2** (color 3) at rows 10-13, cols 4-7: gaps at corners (10,4), (10,7), and edges (13,5), (13,7) \u2192 diagonal and vertical paths\n- **Shape 3** (color 4) at rows 10-13, cols 10-13: gaps at corners (10,10), (10,13), (13,10) and edge (13,12) \u2192 diagonal and vertical paths\n- **Shape 4** (color 7) at rows 24-27, cols 23-26: gaps at corner (24,26), edge (26,26), edge (27,24) \u2192 diagonal, horizontal, and vertical paths\n\n```\n4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,2,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0\n3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,8,8,2,0,0,0,0\n0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,2,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,8,8,3,0,0,4,8,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,3,8,0,0,8,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,3,8,0,0,8,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,8,3,0,0,4,8,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7\n0,4,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,7,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,8,7,7,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,8,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,8,7,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,7,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Green framed markers remain fixed; their inner color is the palette used for newly drawn pixels.\n* The output adds 1-cell-wide \u201cwire/path\u201d structures, often using stair-step diagonals consistent with Manhattan shortest-path routing.\n* Many paths extend until they hit the grid boundary (edges/corners look like endpoints/targets).\n* Where paths meet/overlap, colors are not simply overwritten; multi-color junctions/alternation patterns appear.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "### What to detect (from the examples)\n\n1. **Background** is the most frequent color (in the examples it was `8`, in the test it is `0`).\n2. A **marker** is a **2\u00d72 solid-colored block** surrounded by a **1-cell-thick frame** (in the examples the frame was `3`, in the test the frame is `8`).\n3. The frame is *not always complete*: some frame-border cells are missing (they are background).  \n   These missing border cells are **ports**.\n\n### What to draw\n\nFor each marker, let `C` be its inner 2\u00d72 color. For every **port** cell:\n\n- If the port is on a **side** of the 4\u00d74 frame, draw a 1-cell-wide wire of color `C` straight outward (up/down/left/right).\n- If the port is on a **corner** of the 4\u00d74 frame, draw a wire of color `C` diagonally outward (up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right).\n- Extend until the **grid boundary**.\n\nThe original framed markers remain in place.\n\n### How overlaps are handled (the important part)\n\nWhen a **diagonal wire** would step into a cell already used by a **vertical wire** (same overall vertical direction), the output does *not* overwrite. Instead it forms the same \u201cbraid\u201d behavior visible in the solved examples:\n\n- The **vertical wire keeps** the shared cell.\n- From that point on, the vertical wire **turns to follow the diagonal direction**.\n- The diagonal wire **sidesteps** by taking a vertical step (so it becomes a **parallel diagonal** one cell to the side) and then continues.\n\nIn the test, this happens twice:\n- At `(18,12)`: the `3` down-right diagonal meets the `4` vertical.\n- At `(18,5)`: the `4` down-left diagonal meets the `3` vertical.\n\n---\n\n## Completed output grid\n\n4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,2,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0\n3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,8,8,2,0,0,0,0\n0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,2,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,8,8,3,0,0,4,8,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,3,8,0,0,8,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,3,8,0,0,8,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,8,3,0,0,4,8,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,4,3,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,4,0,0,3,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,7,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,7,7,8,0,0,0\n0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,7,8,8,0,0,0\n3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "## 1. Describe the observable structures (literal)\n\nAcross all pairs:\n\n- **Background** is a uniform **light blue/cyan** grid.\n- There are one or more small **green framed components** (\u201cframes/brackets\u201d), each containing **one single non-green colored cell** (e.g., dark red, blue, yellow, magenta, orange).  \n  These framed components are separated from each other by background and are not touching the grid border in the inputs shown.\n\nPer-pair observations:\n\n**Input 1 \u2192 Output 1**\n- **Input 1:** four green framed components on the cyan background:\n  - Three are roughly aligned horizontally in the upper/middle area, each with a different inner color (dark red, blue, yellow).\n  - One more is in the lower-left area with a magenta inner cell.\n- **Output 1:** the same four framed components remain in the same locations and colors.\n  - Many new **1-cell-wide colored paths/lines** are added over the cyan background.\n  - These paths use the same colors as the inner cells (dark red, blue, yellow, magenta).\n  - The paths include **vertical segments, horizontal segments, and \u201cstair-step\u201d diagonals** (alternating orthogonal steps to approximate a diagonal).\n  - Several paths **meet/cross**, producing junction regions where multiple colors appear adjacent/alternating.\n\n**Input 2 \u2192 Output 2**\n- **Input 2:** one framed component with a **yellow** inner cell.\n- **Output 2:** the framed component stays; additional yellow path pixels are added, forming an extended **line-like structure** reaching toward the grid boundary (includes at least one long straight segment).\n\n**Input 3 \u2192 Output 3**\n- **Input 3:** three framed components with inner colors **dark red**, **yellow**, **orange**.\n- **Output 3:** all framed components remain unchanged.\n  - New colored paths are added, including **long horizontal segments** and at least one **stair-step diagonal** near the right/top-right area.\n  - Some new path segments appear to **share space or touch**, creating multi-color adjacency in the same corridor/area.\n\n**Input 4 \u2192 Output 4**\n- **Input 4:** one framed component with a **magenta** inner cell.\n- **Output 4:** framed component stays; additional magenta path pixels are added near/emanating from that component, forming a short **line/stair-step extension** toward a nearby border region.\n\nWhat stays the same:\n- Cyan background is largely preserved (only overwritten where new path pixels are drawn).\n- The green framed components are **not moved** and appear **not recolored**.\n\nWhat changes:\n- Output adds **new colored path pixels** (no obvious deletions).\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identify transformation categories\n\n- **Object movement:** absent  \n- **Object recoloring:** absent (existing objects keep their colors; new pixels are added)  \n- **Bordering / outlining:** absent  \n- **Filling holes or cavities:** absent  \n- **Removing noise / extracting main shape:** absent  \n- **Copying / pasting / repositioning:** maybe (colors are \u201cpropagated\u201d outward, but full objects aren\u2019t copied)  \n- **Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center):** present (new paths often reach edges/corners)  \n- **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors:** maybe (the inner colors\u2014rare\u2014are the ones propagated)  \n- **Size-based filtering or selection:** absent  \n- **Symmetry or reflection operations:** absent  \n- **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion:** present (growth/extension into long lines)  \n- **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping:** absent  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Key non-obvious insights (crucial)\n\n1. **The inner single colored cell acts like a \u201csource color\u201d**: new pixels in the output reuse those same inner colors, while green framing stays unchanged.\n2. **New structures are predominantly 1-cell-wide 4-connected paths**, with \u201cdiagonal\u201d directions rendered as **Manhattan staircases**, suggesting shortest-path / grid-walk construction rather than thick fills.\n3. **Paths frequently terminate at the grid boundary**, implying borders/corners act as stopping points or targets.\n4. **When multiple paths meet or overlap, the output does not simply overwrite with one color**; instead you often see **multi-color junction/zipper-like alternation** in shared areas, implying a defined collision/merging rule.\n5. The behavior exists even with a **single framed source** (Inputs 2 & 4), so the rule is not solely \u201cconnect sources to each other\u201d; there is an inherent \u201crouting to boundary\u201d (or similar) step.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)\n\nMost likely, each green-framed marker is treated as a node containing a \u201csignal color,\u201d and the task **draws grid paths (wires/roads/flows) in that color** that extend away from the node toward one or more **boundary destinations** (edges/corners) using **Manhattan/stair-step routing**.  \nWith multiple nodes, these paths can **merge or intersect**, and the output encodes overlaps by **alternating/combining the involved colors** rather than choosing a single winner.\n\nAlternate plausible family: the outputs resemble a **constructed network of shortest paths** from each node to a common anchor (often a border/corner), with shared trunk segments rendered as **multi-color braids**.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Checks to perform when solving (validation ideas)\n\n1. **Locate the \u201cemission point\u201d**: is the path starting from the inner colored cell, from a specific side/opening of the green frame, or from the frame\u2019s center?\n2. **Determine the target selection**: do paths go to the nearest edge/corner, a fixed corner, or an edge determined by frame orientation?\n3. **Confirm routing metric**: verify that added paths are consistent with **Manhattan shortest paths** (stair-step diagonals where \u0394x and \u0394y both nonzero).\n4. **Characterize intersections**: when two paths collide, check whether the shared segment is **checker/alternating**, and whether it alternates with a fixed period (e.g., ABAB\u2026).\n5. **Check multi-node interaction**: do paths stop upon reaching another path/node, or do they pass through and continue to the border?\n\n---\n\n## 6. Summarize final insights\n\nHINT_START\n* Green framed markers remain fixed; their inner color is the palette used for newly drawn pixels.\n* The output adds 1-cell-wide \u201cwire/path\u201d structures, often using stair-step diagonals consistent with Manhattan shortest-path routing.\n* Many paths extend until they hit the grid boundary (edges/corners look like endpoints/targets).\n* Where paths meet/overlap, colors are not simply overwritten; multi-color junctions/alternation patterns appear.\nHINT_END",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nBackground is usually uniform color 8 (sometimes color 0). Objects include: (1) single-color connected components from 1 pixel up to larger blobs/rectangles, (2) 1-cell-thick horizontal/vertical bars and diagonal pixel chains (sometimes two-colored), and (3) small multi-color \u201cframed\u201d squares/rectangles with a 1-cell border (often color 3 or 8) surrounding a small filled interior (often colors 1/2/4/6/7/9). Objects may appear singly or as repeated grouped motifs.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nKeep grid size and background (`8` in examples, `0` in test). For each framed object (border often `3`, sometimes `8`) with interior color `C`, treat any perimeter \u201choles\u201d (background cells on the border) as exits: recolor each hole to `C` and extend a 1-cell-thick ray of `C` outward (up/down/left/right or diagonal from corners). Rays typically run until the grid edge but may stop/deflect to avoid overlaps/adjacent contact with other non-background pixels, creating parallel two-color bands instead of crossings in multi-object cases.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Okay, so here's the deal. I'm being asked to figure out a rule for transforming a grid and then apply it. It seems straightforward: input grid, some transformation, and bam, output grid. My task is to crack the code by examining the examples and then apply the logic to a new situation. It looks like the grids are filled with numbers from 0 to 9, each a \"color.\"\n\nThe initial goal is to find the right logic in the examples.\n\nI'm starting by analyzing the examples. The input has colored squares, kind of like picture frames. Some frames have gaps (holes), and that seems key. The output fills these holes with the frame's color, and then these filled holes start radiating lines of the same color. It seems the output lines have a specific pattern, but figuring it out is tricky.\n\nI started examining one example in detail, looking at the pattern of numbers in each row and column. I tried to identify the \"holes\" in each frame and then see how the output reacted. I initially thought the rays extended straight out or diagonally, but it was more complex than that. I noticed objects had multiple holes, and they interacted with each other. Sometimes they form an up and down ray or a left and right ray.\n\nI saw the rays interacting and sometimes colliding, but, the most interesting parts were the directions of the extended rays. They sometimes change direction to avoid an overlap. And the lines from the colors seem to collide as well.\n\nI started making up hypotheses. At first, I thought they were simple diagonal rays, but there were exceptions, and sometimes they became vertical or horizontal to avoid colliding. I also considered this \"pressure\" model or deflection from the edges. When multiple rays met, they'd straighten out or become adjacent, forming those vertical or horizontal lines.\n\nI got to making a set of rules for the transformation.\n1. I found the object frames\n2. Then all the holes in the frame are determined.\n3. The holes are filled.\n4. Ray start.\n    - If it's a corner hole, diagonal.\n    - Non-corner hole, perpendicular.\n5. Ray interactions: They extend, if boundary or other ray they must change direction.\n\nThen I am now testing this against all the existing patterns. Also, the pattern could be disrupted if new objects were closer, because of the direction of the ray. It's like the objects are \"pushing\" each other.\n\nI keep reviewing my rules and checking to make sure they hold up in all cases, especially when the rays meet.\n\nI'm ready to take the rules and start working on the test input. It's time to find the objects, the holes, and start tracing those lines. It's looking to be a multi-step process.\n\n\nTo solve this ARC task, we analyze the input images to identify objects and their properties, then deduce the rules for generating the \"rays\" seen in the output.\n\n### Logic and Rules\n\n1.  **Object Identification**:\n    *   The grid contains \"framed\" objects: rectangular borders (typically single-color, often `3` or `8`) enclosing an interior of a different single color.\n    *   The border is not always continuous; it contains \"holes\" (cells of the background color, `0`).\n    *   These holes act as \"exits\" or \"emitters\" for rays.\n\n2.  **Ray Generation**:\n    *   For each hole in a frame, a ray of the **interior color** is emitted outwards.\n    *   **Direction**:\n        *   **Corner Holes**: If the hole is at a corner of the frame, the ray extends **diagonally** outwards from that corner.\n        *   **Edge Holes**: If the hole is on a straight edge (non-corner), the ray extends **perpendicularly** outwards (horizontally or vertically).\n    *   **Filling**: The hole itself is filled with the interior color.\n\n3.  **Ray Interaction and Propagation**:\n    *   Rays extend until they hit the grid boundary, another object, or another ray.\n    *   **Deflection/Parallelism**: When two rays converge or are about to cross:\n        *   They generally deflect to run parallel to each other to avoid overlapping or crossing.\n        *   For example, if a diagonal ray meets a vertical ray or another diagonal ray from the opposite direction, they straighten out (become vertical or horizontal) and run side-by-side.\n        *   Left-originating rays typically take the left path, and right-originating rays take the right path.\n    *   **Stopping**: If a ray runs directly into a solid object (frame), it stops.\n\n### Application to Test Input\n\n**Object 1 (Top-Left)**:\n*   **Location**: Rows 10-13, Cols 4-7. Frame `8`, Interior `3`.\n*   **Holes**:\n    *   Top-Left (10,4): Corner -> Ray **Diag Up-Left** (Color 3).\n    *   Top-Right (10,7): Corner -> Ray **Diag Up-Right** (Color 3). *Interaction*: Converges with Obj 2's Top-Left ray. Becomes **Vertical Up** at Col 8.\n    *   Bottom Edge (13,5): Edge -> Ray **Vertical Down** (Color 3).\n    *   Bottom-Right (13,7): Corner -> Ray **Diag Down-Right** (Color 3). *Interaction*: Hits Obj 2's vertical ray. Deflects to **Vertical Down** at Col 10.\n\n**Object 2 (Top-Middle)**:\n*   **Location**: Rows 10-13, Cols 10-13.

Becomes **Vertical Up** at Col 19.\n    *   Bottom Edge (13,11): Edge -> Ray **Vertical Down** (Color 4). Acts as a barrier for Obj 1's diagonal ray.\n    *   Bottom-Right (13,13): Corner -> Ray **Diag Down-Right** (Color 4). Stops when it hits Object 4 at (23,23).\n\n**Object 3 (Top-Right)**:\n*   **Location**: Rows 6-9, Cols 22-25. Frame `8`, Interior `2`.\n*   **Holes**:\n    *   Top-Left (6,22): Corner -> Ray **Diag Up-Left** (Color 2). *Interaction*: Converges with Obj 2's Top-Right ray. Becomes **Vertical Up** at Col 20.\n    *   Top-Right (6,25): Corner -> Ray **Diag Up-Right** (Color 2).\n    *   Bottom-Right (9,25): Corner -> Ray **Diag Down-Right** (Color 2).\n\n**Object 4 (Bottom-Right)**:\n*   **Location**: Rows 24-27, Cols 23-26. Frame `8`, Interior `7`.\n*   **Holes**:\n    *   Top-Right (24,26): Corner -> Ray **Diag Up-Right** (Color 7).\n    *   Right Edge (26,26): Edge -> Ray **Horizontal Right** (Color 7).\n    *   Bottom Edge (27,24): Edge -> Ray **Vertical Down** (Color 7).\n\n### Final Output Generation\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,8,8,2,0,0,0,0\n0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,2,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,8,8,3,0,0,4,8,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,3,8,0,0,8,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,3,8,0,0,8,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,8,3,0,0,0,8,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,7,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,7,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,7,7,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nBackground is usually uniform color 8 (sometimes color 0). Objects include: (1) single-color connected components from 1 pixel up to larger blobs/rectangles, (2) 1-cell-thick horizontal/vertical bars and diagonal pixel chains (sometimes two-colored), and (3) small multi-color \u201cframed\u201d squares/rectangles with a 1-cell border (often color 3 or 8) surrounding a small filled interior (often colors 1/2/4/6/7/9). Objects may appear singly or as repeated grouped motifs.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nKeep grid size and background (`8` in examples, `0` in test). For each framed object (border often `3`, sometimes `8`) with interior color `C`, treat any perimeter \u201choles\u201d (background cells on the border) as exits: recolor each hole to `C` and extend a 1-cell-thick ray of `C` outward (up/down/left/right or diagonal from corners). Rays typically run until the grid edge but may stop/deflect to avoid overlaps/adjacent contact with other non-background pixels, creating parallel two-color bands instead of crossings in multi-object cases.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to identify framed objects and extend rays from holes in their borders.\n\n**Analysis of Test Input:**\n\n1. **Frame 1 (color 2)** at rows 6-9, cols 22-25:\n   - Border structure with holes at (6,22) top-left corner, (6,25) top-right corner, (9,25) bottom-right corner\n   - Rays extend diagonally from corners\n\n2. **Frame 2 (color 3)** at rows 10-13, cols 4-7:\n   - Holes at (10,4) top-left, (10,7) top-right, (13,5) bottom edge, (13,7) bottom-right\n   - Corner holes get diagonal rays, edge hole gets straight ray\n\n3. **Frame 3 (color 4)** at rows 10-13, cols 10-13:\n   - Holes at (10,10) top-left, (10,13) top-right, (13,10) bottom-left, (13,12) bottom edge\n   - Similar pattern of diagonal/straight rays\n\n4. **Frame 4 (color 7)** at rows 24-27, cols 23-26:\n   - Holes at (24,26) top-right, (26,26) right edge, (27,24) bottom edge\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- When diagonal rays from different frames would cross, they run parallel instead (as in Example 1)\n- Frame 2's up-right and Frame 3's up-left diagonals meet at row 9 (cols 8,9) - continue parallel\n- Frame 2's down-right and Frame 3's down-left diagonals meet at row 14 (cols 8,9) - continue parallel\n- Frame 1's up-left and Frame 3's up-right cross near row 4 - continue parallel at cols 19,20\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0\n3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,2,8,8,2,0,0,0,0\n0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,2,8,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,2,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,8,8,3,0,0,4,8,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,3,8,0,0,8,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,3,8,0,0,8,4,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0\n0,0,0,0,8,3,8,3,0,0,4,8,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,7,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,7,7,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,7,7,7,7,7,7\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,7,8,8,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,3,4,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0\n```",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nBackground is usually uniform color 8 (sometimes color 0). Objects include: (1) single-color connected components from 1 pixel up to larger blobs/rectangles, (2) 1-cell-thick horizontal/vertical bars and diagonal pixel chains (sometimes two-colored), and (3) small multi-color \u201cframed\u201d squares/rectangles with a 1-cell border (often color 3 or 8) surrounding a small filled interior (often colors 1/2/4/6/7/9). Objects may appear singly or as repeated grouped motifs.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nKeep grid size and background (`8` in examples, `0` in test). For each framed object (border often `3`, sometimes `8`) with interior color `C`, treat any perimeter \u201choles\u201d (background cells on the border) as exits: recolor each hole to `C` and extend a 1-cell-thick ray of `C` outward (up/down/left/right or diagonal from corners). Rays typically run until the grid edge but may stop/deflect to avoid overlaps/adjacent contact with other non-background pixels, creating parallel two-color bands instead of crossings in multi-object cases.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

                "response": "Most grids have a single uniform background (commonly color 8; one set uses color 0). Against this background, the non-background cells form several recurring kinds of objects:\n\n- **Single-color connected shapes (polyominoes):** Contiguous regions made of one color (e.g., color 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 1). These range from **single isolated pixels** to **small blocks** (including 2\u00d72-type chunks) and **larger irregular blobs**.\n\n- **Line-like objects:**  \n  - **Horizontal and vertical segments** that are 1 cell thick, sometimes fairly long (bar/stripe objects).  \n  - **Diagonal chains** made from single pixels stepping diagonally; in some cases the diagonal is **two-colored** (adjacent/alternating colors along the diagonal).\n\n- **Framed / outlined objects (multi-color composites):** Small square/rectangular motifs where one color forms a **1-cell-thick border** and another color fills the **interior**. Commonly:\n  - A border in **color 3** with a compact interior fill in **color 9**, **color 1**, **color 4**, or **color 6**.\n  - A border in **color 8** with a compact interior fill in **color 2**, **color 3**, **color 4**, or **color 7**.\n  These framed objects often look like **3\u00d73-style frames with a 2\u00d72 interior**, but also appear in slightly varied rectangular sizes.\n\n- **Grouped motifs:** Multiple small framed squares/rectangles and/or small blocks can appear together in the same grid, separated by background, sometimes roughly aligned.\n\n<objects_summary>\nBackground is usually uniform color 8 (sometimes color 0). Objects include: (1) single-color connected components from 1 pixel up to larger blobs/rectangles, (2) 1-cell-thick horizontal/vertical bars and diagonal pixel chains (sometimes two-colored), and (3) small multi-color \u201cframed\u201d squares/rectangles with a 1-cell border (often color 3 or 8) surrounding a small filled interior (often colors 1/2/4/6/7/9).

Objects Description\nBackground is usually uniform color 8 (sometimes color 0). Objects include: (1) single-color connected components from 1 pixel up to larger blobs/rectangles, (2) 1-cell-thick horizontal/vertical bars and diagonal pixel chains (sometimes two-colored), and (3) small multi-color \u201cframed\u201d squares/rectangles with a 1-cell border (often color 3 or 8) surrounding a small filled interior (often colors 1/2/4/6/7/9). Objects may appear singly or as repeated grouped motifs.",
                "response": "**Observed / possible transformations from input \u2192 output (across the 4 examples):**\n\n1. **Grid-level invariants**\n   - The **output grid keeps the same height/width** as the input.\n   - The **background color stays the same** (examples use mostly `8`; the test grid uses mostly `0`).\n\n2. **Object preservation**\n   - Existing non-background pixels that form the original objects (notably the **frame/border pixels**, e.g. `3` in the examples) are **kept in place**.\n   - The interior \u201cfill\u201d pixels (e.g. `2,4,6,7,9,1`) are also **preserved**; the main change is the **addition** of new pixels of those same interior colors into background areas.\n\n3. **Detect \u201cframed\u201d objects and their interior color**\n   - Identify small rectangle/square-like objects with a **1-cell-thick border** (commonly `3` in the examples; can be `8` in the test) surrounding a compact interior of some color `C` (where `C` is not the background and not the border).\n   - The transformation uses **that interior color `C`** as the paint color for new pixels associated with that frame.\n\n4. **Find \u201copenings\u201d (missing border cells) on the perimeter**\n   - On the perimeter of each frame\u2019s bounding rectangle, some cells that \u201cshould\u201d be border are instead **background** (these are the \u201choles\u201d/openings).\n   - **Each such opening is recolored from background to the frame\u2019s interior color `C`.**\n\n5. **Ray/line extension through each opening**\n   - From every opening cell, draw a **1-cell-thick ray (straight line) of color `C`** extending outward into the background.\n   - The direction is determined by *where* the opening sits on the frame perimeter:\n     - Opening on **top edge** \u2192 extend **up**.\n     - Opening on **bottom edge** \u2192 extend **down**.\n     - Opening on **left edge** \u2192 extend **left**.\n     - Opening on **right edge** \u2192 extend **right**.\n     - Opening on a **corner** \u2192 extend **diagonally outward** (`NW`, `NE`, `SW`, `SE` depending on the corner).\n   - These rays can become long bars/chains reaching far from the original frame.\n\n6. **Stopping / interaction behavior (multi-object cases)**\n   - Rays generally extend through background until reaching the **grid boundary**, **but** in multi-frame scenes they can be **shortened**:\n     - A ray can stop **before** it would overlap or become immediately adjacent to another non-background structure (including other rays).\n     - This produces visible **1-cell background gaps** between differently-colored rays/objects in some examples.\n   - When two rays approach in a way that would naturally cause an intersection/crossing, the output suggests they may be **rerouted/deflected rather than crossing**, producing patterns such as:\n     - **Two-color parallel vertical segments** replacing what would have been crossing diagonals (seen with interior colors like `9` and `1`).\n     - **Two-color parallel diagonals** (e.g. adjacent `2` and `4` diagonals) replacing what would have been a perpendicular meeting of a horizontal and vertical ray.\n   - In all cases, the newly drawn pixels remain in the **same interior color(s)** of the originating frame(s); there is no arbitrary recoloring to unrelated colors.\n\n<transformation_summary>\nKeep grid size and background (`8` in examples, `0` in test). For each framed object (border often `3`, sometimes `8`) with interior color `C`, treat any perimeter \u201choles\u201d (background cells on the border) as exits: recolor each hole to `C` and extend a 1-cell-thick ray of `C` outward (up/down/left/right or diagonal from corners).

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nBackground is usually uniform color 8 (sometimes color 0). Objects include: (1) single-color connected components from 1 pixel up to larger blobs/rectangles, (2) 1-cell-thick horizontal/vertical bars and diagonal pixel chains (sometimes two-colored), and (3) small multi-color \u201cframed\u201d squares/rectangles with a 1-cell border (often color 3 or 8) surrounding a small filled interior (often colors 1/2/4/6/7/9). Objects may appear singly or as repeated grouped motifs.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nKeep grid size and background (`8` in examples, `0` in test). For each framed object (border often `3`, sometimes `8`) with interior color `C`, treat any perimeter \u201choles\u201d (background cells on the border) as exits: recolor each hole to `C` and extend a 1-cell-thick ray of `C` outward (up/down/left/right or diagonal from corners). Rays typically run until the grid edge but may stop/deflect to avoid overlaps/adjacent contact with other non-background pixels, creating parallel two-color bands instead of crossings in multi-object cases.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
