            "Full raw LLM response": "**Okay, let's break down this ARC task!** I need to figure out how these input grids are transformed into the outputs. It seems like the core concept is the appearance of new objects based on the positions and types of existing objects.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n*   **Background:** The grids are mostly filled with a background color (7 in most examples).\n*   **Objects:**  There are objects of a different color (like 9 or 0). These are the key to the transformation.\n*   **New Objects:** The outputs have new objects in specific locations.\n*   **Example 1's \"Mystery\":** In Example 1, a new row of objects appeared, and one cell changed to color 1 in this new row.  The input had \"V\" shapes at the bottom.\n*   **Example 2's \"Inverted Vs\":** Example 2 had \"V\" shapes, both right-side up and upside down. The transformation created new objects in the upper portion of the grid.\n*   **Example 3's \"L-Shapes\":** In Example 3, there were \"L\" shapes and the rule seems to include the position and direction of shapes.\n\n**Hypothesis Building:**\n\nI believe that these objects \"project\" new objects upward, potentially influenced by object type and the presence or type of other objects.\n\n1.  **Object types:** The \"V\" and \"L\" shapes seem to be the primary emitters.  Their shape influences how they project objects.\n2.  **Projection Direction:** It appears that the \"tip\" of the V or a specific \"corner\" of the L is the key to understanding the projection's direction and location. It looks like the direction of the projection depends on the type of shape and sometimes on its orientation, but not always.\n3.  **Projection Vector:**  The new objects' positions are determined by a \"vector\" applied to the tip or a \"key\" location within the object. I've seen that vector to be of the form (0, -5), (+5, -5), or (-5, -5).  The vector might be different based on the shape.\n4.  **Color Determination:** The color of the projected object might depend on the original object's color or a fixed color (9, in a lot of examples), or maybe is determined by overlaps or intersections with other projections. Overlaps are interesting, since they change color.\n\n**Analysis and Generalization:**\n\n*   **\"V\" Shape Projections:** In the examples, \"V\" shapes almost always seem to project a single new pixel upwards. The location is 5 rows above the \"tip\" pixel, and the horizontal position matches the \"tip\" pixel's column.\n*   **\"L\" Shape Projections:** \"L\" shapes seem to project diagonally. The projection is influenced by the L-shape, where the corner, with 2 neighbors, is the target to determine projection direction. The vector is based on the position of the corner of the shape.\n*   **Collisions:** If two projectiles hit the same spot, the resulting color is likely 1.  It seems that colliding projectiles may also result in changing the color of existing pixels.\n\n**Test Case Predictions and Solution:**\n\nI need to apply these rules to the test input.\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** I'll scan the input to identify all existing \"V\" and \"L\" shapes, determining the \"tip\" (for Vs) and the \"corner\" (for Ls).\n2.  **Determine Vector:** For each object, I'll calculate the projection vector. Based on my analysis, Downward-V has vector (+5,0), Upward-V (-5,0), and different L shapes based on which corner is present in the shape.\n3.  **Calculate Target Locations:**  I'll apply each object's vector to determine the location of the new pixel.\n4.  **Handle Collisions:** I will look for overlapping projections.  If there are two projectiles at the same spot, the output pixel color will be 1, if there are not intersections it will be 9, and the existing color of the shape will be preserved.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nI need to construct the output grid by placing the original objects (color 6), and then adding the new pixels (9) in their calculated positions, with the exception of any collisions where the color is set to 1.  The projection calculation should be carefully carried out on the test input.\n\n\nThe problem involves predicting the position and color of new pixels generated by \"emitters\" (small shapes) present in the input grid. Based on the solved examples, the transformation follows these rules:\n\n1.  **Identify Emitters**: Emitters are small, contiguous shapes of non-background color. There are two primary types:\n    *   **V-Shapes** (3 pixels forming a triangle): These project a new pixel 5 steps in the cardinal direction they point.\n        *   **Up-Pointing V (Lambda)**: Tip is at the top (lowest y). Projects **Up** (y - 5).\n        *   **Down-Pointing V**: Tip is at the bottom (highest y). Projects **Down** (y + 5).\n        *   **Left-Pointing V**: Tip is at the left (lowest x). Projects **Left** (x - 5).\n        *   (Right-Pointing V would presumably project Right).\n    *   **L-Shapes** (3 pixels forming a 2x2 square with one missing corner): These project a new pixel 5 steps in a diagonal direction. The direction is determined by the \"corner\" pixel (the one with two neighbors). The L-shape points in the direction of this corner (away from the bulk of the shape).\n        *   **Top-Left Corner**: Projects **Top-Left** (x - 5, y - 5).\n        *   **Top-Right Corner**: Projects **Top-Right** (x + 5, y - 5).\n        *   **Bottom-Left Corner**: Projects **Bottom-Left** (x - 5, y + 5).\n        *   **Bottom-Right Corner**: Projects **Bottom-Right** (x + 5, y + 5).\n\n2.  **Projection**:\n    *   Calculate the target coordinates for each emitter.\n    *   The generated pixel usually has color **9** (maroon), regardless of the input shape's color.\n\n3.  **Collision Handling**:\n    *   If two projectiles land on the same coordinate, they interact. Based on Example 1, a collision results in a pixel of color **1** (blue).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Group A (L-Shape)** at top-left region:\n    *   Pixels: `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)`.\n    *   Corner is at `(3,2)` (Bottom-Right).\n    *   Action: Project Bottom-Right (+5, +5).\n    *   Target: `(2+5, 3+5)` = **(7, 8)**.

Result is color **1**.\n\nThe final grid retains the original background (7) and shapes (6), with these new pixels superimposed.\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,9,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n**Example 1:** V-shapes (hats) at bottom, L-shape at top \u2192 markers placed 5 rows above each V apex, with middle marker becoming 1 (different value) due to presence of anomaly (L-shape).\n\n**Example 2:** Multiple V-shapes scattered \u2192 9 markers placed 5 rows above each V apex (no anomalies, all 9s).\n\n**Example 3:** L-shapes in repeating rows + isolated L-shape \u2192 markers added at different phase, one L-shape changed to 9.\n\n**For the test input:**\n\nIdentifying V-shapes (apex at top, feet below):\n1. Rows 5-6, cols 8-10: apex at (5, 9)\n2. Rows 7-8, cols 1-3: apex at (7, 2)  \n3. Rows 13-14, cols 3-5: apex at (13, 4)\n4. Rows 14-15, cols 13-15: apex at (14, 14)\n\nAnomalies (non-V shapes):\n- Inverted V at rows 2-3, cols 8-10\n- L-shape at rows 2-3, cols 1-2 (overlaps with marker position)\n- L-shape at rows 14-15, cols 8-9\n\n**Applying transformation:**\n1. Marker at (0, 9) - 5 rows above V apex at (5,9)\n2. Marker at (2, 2) - overwrites L-shape cell with 9\n3. Marker at (8, 4) - 5 rows above V apex at (13,4)\n4. Marker at (9, 14) - 5 rows above V apex at (14,14)\n\nDue to anomaly presence, the marker closest to the midpoint of V range (cols 2-14, midpoint=8) becomes 1. V at col 9 is closest to midpoint \u2192 marker at (0,9) becomes 1.\n\n```\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n```",

For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Task Solution Summary**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got. The task involves transforming a 16x16 grid with orange (color 7) as the background.  My job is to analyze three examples to figure out the rules.  I'm looking for patterns, especially in how different colored shapes interact and change between the input and output grids.\n\nInitially, I see the grid is 16x16 with an orange (7) background. The focus is on finding how colors change.\n\n**Example 1**: Input has an L-shaped object in maroon (9) at the top-right and some \"pyramid\" shapes at the bottom, also in maroon.  The output grid is different - the maroon L-shape stays, the pyramids remain, *and* some new pixels appear at Row 9.  Those new pixels are either maroon or blue (1). There is an L shape, and the center bullet is blue.\n\n**Example 2**: Input has Black (0) \"pyramids,\" or, actually, what I start to see as *shooters* that have a pyramid like shape.  Output has bullets in row 5 through 9, but bullets are now Maroon. There\u2019s a change.  The objects are \"black pyramids,\" and I am looking for the new pixels (bullets).\n\nI'm thinking those new pixels might be \"bullets\" fired by specific objects.  I start defining \u201cshooters\u201d: An (x, y) with (x-1, y+1) and (x+1, y+1) of the same color, or inverted, the \u201ctip\u201d of the pyramid.\n\nIt turns out that I am seeing what the patterns look like on a number of these grids. What I am seeing is that the \"bullet\" (the new pixel) appears a certain number of rows above the tip of the shooter, and the column is *almost* the same. I start checking and the \"bullets\" appear 5 rows above, so this makes me think that all of the bullets I'm seeing are all based on a central rule.\n\nThe center bullet being blue is confusing, so I read the colors closely.  I begin to wonder if the blue color is arbitrary.\n\n**Example 3**: Input has Red (2) \"invaders\" at the top and bottom.  The output shows pixels (bullets) in Row 1 and Row 9 (Maroon), and the \"invader\" at Col 8 changed to maroon.\n\nMy working hypothesis: there are objects that shoot \"bullets.\"  The \"shooters\" have a direction based on their shape (up or up-left). The bullets always move up, with a shift to the left if the shooter is in a corner shape.\n\nThe color of the bullet is always Maroon (9), with the occasional exception of the Blue.  If a bullet hits an object, the object becomes Maroon.\n\nI create a bullet, five steps from the shooter in the direction of the shooter, then I change the bullets to Maroon.\n\n**Test Input**: I scan the grid for the shape.  I find some shapes and start with shapes.  I have been working with a number of different shapes. I see, I see. I then put the \"bullets\" and transform based on this.\n\n**Revised Rules**:\n*   **Shooters**: Identified by specific shapes (Pyramid, Corner).\n*   **Shooter Direction**: Determined by the shooter's orientation (Up, Down, Up-Left).\n*   **Bullet Trajectory**: The bullet travels 5 steps in the shooter\u2019s direction.\n*   **Bullet Color**: Maroon (9) by default.\n*   **Collision**: If a bullet hits a non-background object, that object becomes Maroon.\n*   The \"center\" pixel will move.\n\n**Final Steps**: I scan the test input for the shooter. I confirm each shape in the test input. I determine the trajectory and generate the output grid.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on rules inferred from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Examples:**\n1.  **Objects:** There are \"shooter\" objects and sometimes \"target\" objects.\n    *   **Shooters** are small clusters of colored pixels (not orange/7). Their shape determines their shooting direction.\n        *   **Upward Pyramid** (1 pixel on top, 2 pixels below): Shoots **UP** 5 cells.\n        *   **Inverted Pyramid** (2 pixels on top, 1 pixel below): Shoots **DOWN** 5 cells.\n        *   **Corner Shape** (3 pixels in a 2x2 square): Shoots diagonally 5 cells in the direction of the \"filled corner\" or tip.\n            *   Example 3 shows \"Top-Left\" filled corners shooting **UP-LEFT** (-5, -5).\n            *   We can infer other orientations shoot in their respective diagonal directions.\n    *   **Targets** are other objects in the grid.\n2.  **Action:**\n    *   Each shooter fires a \"bullet\" (a single pixel) 5 cells away in its shooting direction.\n    *   The bullet color is **Maroon (9)** (in the test case).\n    *   If the bullet lands on an empty cell (7), that cell becomes the bullet color (9).\n    *   If the bullet hits an existing object, the **entire object changes color** to Maroon (9).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\nThe input grid contains Pink (6) objects on an Orange (7) background.\n\n1.  **Identify Shooters:**\n    *   **(3, 9)**: Inverted Pyramid (Base at row 2, Tip at row 3). Direction: **DOWN**.\n        *   Target: (3+5, 9) = **(8, 9)**. Cell is empty. -> Place 9 at (8, 9).\n    *   **(5, 9)**: Upward Pyramid (Tip at row 5, Base at row 6). Direction: **UP**.\n        *   Target: (5-5, 9) = **(0, 9)**. Cell is empty. -> Place 9 at (0, 9).\n    *   **(7, 2)**: Upward Pyramid (Tip at row 7, Base at row 8). Direction: **UP**.\n        *   Target: (7-5, 2) = **(2, 2)**.\n        *   Cell (2, 2) is part of an object (pixels at (2,2), (3,1), (3,2)).\n        *   **HIT!** The object turns Maroon (9).\n    *   **(14, 4)**: Upward Pyramid (Tip at row 14, Base at row 15). Direction: **UP**.\n        *   Target: (14-5, 4) = **(9, 4)**. Cell is empty. -> Place 9 at (9, 4).\n    *   **(15, 8)**: Corner Shape (Top-Left filled: (15,8), (15,9), (16,9)). Direction: **UP-LEFT**.\n        *   Target: (15-5, 8-5) = **(10, 3)**. Cell is empty. -> Place 9 at (10, 3).\n    *   **(15, 14)**: Upward Pyramid (Tip at row 15, Base at row 16). Direction: **UP**.\n        *   Target: (15-5, 14) = **(10, 14)**. Cell is empty. -> Place 9 at (10, 14).\n    *   **(2, 2) Object**: This object is a Corner Shape (Bottom-Right filled: (2,2), (3,1), (3,2)). Direction: **DOWN-RIGHT**.\n        *   Tip is at (3, 2). Target: (3+5, 2+5) = **(8, 7)**. Cell is empty. -> Place 9 at (8, 7).\n        *   Note: Even though this object is hit and changes color, based on Example 3, hit shooters still fire.\n\n2.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   Copy Input.\n    *   Change object at `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)` from 6 to 9.\n    *   Add pixel 9 at `(0, 9)`.\n    *   Add pixel 9 at `(8, 7)`.\n    *   Add pixel 9 at `(8, 9)`.\n    *   Add pixel 9 at `(9, 4)`.\n    *   Add pixel 9 at `(10, 3)`.\n    *   Add pixel 9 at `(10, 14)`.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,7,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6",

Markers (9) are placed 5 rows above each V-shape's top center. The V at column 7 (= 12-5) is marked with 1 instead, indicating it corresponds to the reference position.\n\n2. **Example 2**: Has multiple V-shapes scattered in lower half. Each gets a marker (9) placed 5 rows above.\n\n3. **Example 3**: Has repeating L-shapes and an isolated L-shape reference (rows 11-12, col 13). Markers appear 5 rows above and 5 columns left of each L-shape. The L-shape at column 8 (= 13-5) is changed to color 9.\n\n**Key Rules:**\n- For each shape, place a marker 5 rows above (and 5 columns left for L-shapes)\n- If there's a reference shape at column C, the shape at column C-5 is \"special\"\n- If shape color \u2260 9: change special shape to 9\n- If shape color = 9: mark special position with 1\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\nShapes identified (color 6):\n- L-shape: rows 2-3, cols 1-2\n- Inverted V-shape: rows 2-3, cols 8-10 (center col 9) \u2192 **REFERENCE**\n- V-shape: rows 5-6, cols 8-10 (center col 9) \u2192 marker at (0, 9)\n- V-shape: rows 7-8, cols 1-3 (center col 2) \u2192 marker at (2, 2) - occupied!\n- V-shape: rows 13-14, cols 3-5 (center col 4) \u2192 **SPECIAL** (9-5=4)\n- L-shape: rows 14-15, cols 8-9 \u2192 marker at (9, 3)\n- V-shape: rows 14-15, cols 13-15 (center col 14) \u2192 marker at (9, 14)\n\nThe special V-shape at rows 13-14, cols 3-5 gets changed from 6 to 9 (since shape color \u2260 9).\n\n```\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "### What the examples show\n\n1. **Background color** is the most frequent color (here it is `7`).\n2. All non-background pixels form **small 3-cell \u201ccorner\u201d objects** (each object has exactly 3 cells of one color).  \n   Each such object has a unique **vertex** cell: the one from which the vectors to the other two cells are **perpendicular** (a right angle).  \n   - This covers both \u201cL\u201d corners (orthogonal arms) and \u201cV\u201d corners (diagonal arms).\n3. For each corner-object:\n   - Let the vertex be `V`.\n   - Let the two step-vectors from `V` to the other two cells be `v1` and `v2`.\n   - The **opening direction** is `v1 + v2` (then reduced to a unit direction by taking the sign of each component).\n   - Place a **marker 5 cells away from the vertex in the opposite direction**.\n4. Markers are normally colored **`9`**.\n   - If **two markers land on the same cell**, that cell becomes **`1`** (overlap marker).\n   - If a marker lands on an existing 3-cell corner-object, the **entire object is recolored to `9`**.\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\nThe `6` pixels form eight 3-cell corner-objects. Their projections (5 steps opposite the corner opening) produce markers at:\n\n- `(0,9) = 9`\n- `(4,8) = 9`\n- `(8,4) = 9`\n- `(8,7) = 9`\n- `(8,9) = 9`\n- Two projections land on `(9,14)` \u2192 overlap \u2192 `(9,14) = 1`\n- One projection lands on an existing corner-object cell at `(2,2)`, so that whole 3-cell object is recolored from `6` to `9`.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task: Shape Identification and Marker Placement**\n\nOkay, I've got this. The task seems to involve identifying specific shapes within a grid and then placing markers based on those shapes. I've broken down the steps and I'm ready to roll:\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the provided examples. The goal is to figure out the rules for the marker placement. It's clear that the position of the marker is horizontally aligned with a base shape, but it seems shifted vertically. Example 1 has a pattern of \"caret\" shapes at the bottom and a seemingly L-shape on top. The shift is 5 rows up and 0 columns offset. However, the color of a marker changes, which might be a clue for a specific condition. I'm going to look at the other example to see if any general rule would apply.\n\nAfter looking at Example 2, the shape is still \"Caret\" with a background of grey. The shift is still -5, meaning it's 5 rows above the top pixel of the caret. Example 3 is Gamma-shaped instead of caret. I'm going to focus on shapes and colors. So the location and type of shape define where to mark. I think it is safe to assume that a shift is determined by color.\n\nIn my Test Input, it seems that there are many Caret shapes, some Inverted Caret, Gamma, and Left Arrow. Based on the previous examples, it seems likely that the rule depends on the most recurring shape, with a set offset. I must consider the shape from the top of the grid and the one at the bottom.\n\nIf I apply the \"Caret\" rule, I see that 4 carets exists in the Test Input. It will define the objects that receive a marker. The others are just extra noise.\nThe markers change the object to color 9, but in Ex 1, color 1 was used. If a marker collides with an existing color, Ex 3 shows the color turns to 9. It is only color 9 unless a rule applies. Let's see if all 3 examples are the same rule.\n\nFinally, I will generate the grid output by adding the 9s, change the existing objects that the new 9 collide with. Double-checking on colors and locations to make sure all is consistent. I have to look into \"Lone Blue marker\" from Ex 1. I still don't see any hint. After checking, I will be ready.\n\n\nThe transformation involves identifying a specific repeating \"source\" shape in the grid and placing \"marker\" pixels relative to each instance of that shape.\n\n1.  **Identify the Source Shape:**\n    *   In Example 1, the repeating source shape is a \"Caret\" or \"Up-Triangle\" (3x2 bounding box: 1 top center pixel, 2 bottom pixels).\n    *   In Example 2, the source shape is the same \"Caret\" (even formed by fragments).\n    *   In Example 3, the source shape is a \"Gamma\" (2x2 top-left corner).\n    *   In the Test Input, the recurring shape is the **\"Caret\"** (Color 6). It appears 4 times at anchors (top pixel coordinates): **(5,9), (7,2), (13,4), (14,14)**. Note that the shape at (2,2) is not a Caret (it's an L-shape), and other shapes like the one at (3,14) or (14,8) are different.\n\n2.  **Determine Marker Position:**\n    *   The rule derived from the examples is to place a marker **5 rows above** the shape's anchor position.\n        *   Example 1 & 2 (Caret): Offset is (-5, 0).\n        *   Example 3 (Gamma): Offset is (-5, -5) (relative to anchor? or maybe just shape specific). Since the Test Input has Carets, we use the Caret offset **(-5, 0)**.\n    *   Target positions for Test Input:\n        *   From (5,9) -> (0,9)\n        *   From (7,2) -> (2,2)\n        *   From (13,4) -> (8,4)\n        *   From (14,14) -> (9,14)\n\n3.  **Apply Markers:**\n    *   The marker color is **9** (maroon).\n    *   If the target cell is empty (7), place a 9.\n    *   If the target cell is occupied by an existing object, **change that object's color to 9**.\n        *   Target (0,9) is empty -> Set to 9.\n        *   Target (8,4) is empty -> Set to 9.\n        *   Target (9,14) is empty -> Set to 9.\n        *   Target (2,2) contains a pixel of an L-shaped object (pixels at (2,2), (3,1), (3,2)). This entire connected component changes from color 6 to 9.\n\n**Output Generation:**\n*   Row 0: Add 9 at col 9.\n*   Row 2: Pixel at (2,2) becomes 9.\n*   Row 3: Pixels at (3,1) and (3,2) become 9 (connected to (2,2)).\n*   Row 8: Add 9 at col 4.\n*   Row 9: Add 9 at col 14.\n*   All other pixels remain unchanged.\n\noutput:\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to identify the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n**Example 1:** V-shapes at the bottom (rows 14-15) get markers 5 rows above at the tip column. The middle V (of 3) gets a special color (1 instead of 9). An L-shape exists in the upper area.\n\n**Example 2:** Multiple V-shapes scattered get markers 5 rows above their tips. All markers are color 9 (no special case - even number of shapes).\n\n**Example 3:** L-shapes in bands get markers 5 rows above with column offset of 5. An isolated L causes one L-shape in the first band to change color to 9 (the one corresponding to the isolated shape's column).\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\nI identify these shapes:\n- V-shape (rows 5-6, cols 8-10): tip at (5,9)\n- V-shape (rows 7-8, cols 1-3): tip at (7,2) - but marker position (2,2) is occupied\n- V-shape (rows 13-14, cols 3-5): tip at (13,4)  \n- V-shape (rows 14-15, cols 13-15): tip at (14,14)\n- L-shape (rows 14-15, cols 8-9)\n- Inverted V at (rows 2-3, cols 8-10) - anomalous shape at same column range as L-shape\n\n**Transformation Applied:**\n\n1. **Markers for V-shapes** (5 rows above tips):\n   - (0, 9) for V at (5,9)\n   - (8, 4) for V at (13,4)\n   - (9, 14) for V at (14,14)\n\n2. **Marker for L-shape** (using col-5 offset like Example 3):\n   - (9, 3) for L at (14,8)\n\n3. **L-shape color change**: The inverted V at cols 8-10 overlaps with L at cols 8-9, triggering the L to change from color 6 to 9 (similar to Example 3's pattern).\n\n**Output:**\n```\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,6,7,6\n```",

Treat each object as an **8-connected component** (diagonals connect).  \n3. Compute `min_col`: the **leftmost column index occupied by any non-background pixel** in the whole grid.  \n   - This is used to \u201cleft-normalize\u201d marker positions (as in example 3).\n4. For **each component**, find its **top-left pixel**: the pixel with smallest row; if tied, smallest column.\n5. Create a **1\u00d71 marker** of color `9` at:\n   \\[\n   (r_{\\text{top-left}} - 5,\\; c_{\\text{top-left}} - \\text{min\\_col})\n   \\]\n   - If that coordinate is outside the grid, do nothing for that component.\n   - If the target cell is background (`7`), place the `9` there.\n   - If the target cell is already part of an object, **recolor that whole destination component to `9`** (this matches example 3\u2019s behavior).\n6. (From example 1) If a marker row contains an odd \u201crun\u201d of \u22653 markers, the horizontal middle one becomes `1`.  \n   - In this test case, no row has \u22653 markers, so no `1` appears.\n\n### Apply to the test grid\n\n- `min_col` among all `6` pixels is `1`.\n- Markers (or recolors) that land in-bounds:\n  - Component with top-left at `(5,9)` \u2192 marker at `(0,8)`\n  - Component with top-left at `(7,2)` \u2192 marker at `(2,1)`\n  - Component with top-left at `(14,8)` \u2192 marker at `(9,7)`\n  - Component with top-left at `(14,14)` \u2192 marker at `(9,13)`\n  - Component with top-left at `(13,4)` \u2192 marker at `(8,3)`, but `(8,3)` is on an existing component, so that whole component is recolored to `9` (cells `(7,2),(8,1),(8,3)`).\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6",

The new singletons are placed **in empty orange space above the main cluster region**, often **horizontally aligned** into one or more rows.\n4. **Vertical layering matters** (pair 3): when there are multiple \u201cbands\u201d of objects at different heights, the added markers appear in **multiple corresponding rows**, suggesting the marker row depends on an object\u2019s vertical placement.\n5. Pair 1 suggests **selective marking**: the upper-right L-shape does not obviously produce a corresponding marker, while the bottom-edge components do, implying a **location- or role-based filter** (e.g., only bottom-touching / lower-band objects are processed).\n6. Marker **color can encode a distinction** even among same-colored source objects (pair 1 has a **blue** singleton among maroon ones), implying a secondary property is being signaled (shape/size/position/class).\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Marker placement appears to preserve **horizontal association** with the source component, while marker **color** may encode a component property (e.g., type/size/\u201cspecial\u201d position).\n\nAlternate plausible family: compute representative points of components (topmost point / centroid / anchor corner) and \u201cproject\u201d them upward into free space as 1\u00d71 icons, leaving originals unchanged.\n\n---\n\n## 5.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**The Big Picture**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a visual puzzle. The goal is to transform a 16x16 grid based on a set of rules I'm going to figure out. I've got examples to guide me, and my task is to apply the learned rules to a new test case. The underlying assumption is that there are specific geometric shapes and that their positions and relationships trigger certain transformations - basically, a sort of pattern-recognition and rule-following system.\n\n**Initial Observations**\n\nThe background is orange (color 7), and there are scattered objects in the grid. My first impression is that the objects are relatively small, and their arrangement is key. I'm looking for consistent patterns that will define the transformation logic.\n\n**Example 1: Getting My Bearings**\n\nThis example is crucial. I spot two primary shapes: a \"chevron\" (an up-pointing triangle) made of '9's and an \"L-shape\" (a 2x2 square with one corner missing). My main aim is to understand what happens to these shapes in the transformation. I observe that each chevron spawns a new '9' pixel that's offset vertically from the apex, while the L shape also spawns new pixels. However, the exact offset for the L-shape puzzled me.\n\nI noticed a key detail: when a new pixel lands on a filled space, it can turn into the color 1. I need to figure out what controls the offset for the L-shape (in this case, it was a bottom-left corner). Also, since this example doesn't have multiple markers hitting the same pixel, I need to check the remaining examples to find out what controls those intersections.\n\n**Example 2: Deepening the Understanding**\n\nExample 2 confirms the chevron rule: the new dot appears directly above the apex (r-5). All shapes in the example are chevrons (color 0). No L-shapes here, which is a key point to notice. Also, the shapes (chevrons) are not changed/recored.\n\n**Example 3: Adding the Third Piece**\n\nThe third example introduces the L-shape again, this time with a 2 (red) background. Now I see that the orientation matters: I noticed a \"corner\" of the L-shape, where two sides meet and form a corner. It also introduced a twist: if an L-shape marker \"hits\" (lands on) an existing L-shape, it recolors the entire L-shape to the marker's color. I found a formula to calculate offsets for L-shapes. It has a vertical and horizontal component and is dependent on the orientation of the L-shape corner. I also verified the 5-row offset.\n\n**Forming the Rules**\n\nBy analyzing the examples, I can extract the transformation rules:\n*   **Chevrons**: Based on the apex, add a 9, five rows up\n*   **L-shapes**: Use an algorithm to find the corner to determine where a 9 gets added (row \u00b1 5, and column always -5).\n*   **Interactions**: If marker at an empty place -> 9. If two overlap, change to 1. If an L-shape gets hit, recolor it to 9.\n\n**Applying the Rules to the Test Input**\n\nI need to apply what I learned to a new grid. I have a new color and new shapes to identify, plus the same rules to apply. I'm going to start by scanning row by row and locate the geometric figures (chevrons and L-shapes). I need to be careful with the chevron's apex coordinates and also determine the correct L-shapes, with an emphasis on their orientation, to generate offsets. The rule \"if an L-marker hits an existing L-shape recolor the whole hit L-shape to 9\" is of concern here. I also need to calculate the target positions from the offsets, taking the edge of the grid into account to keep everything inside the 16x16 grid. Any pixel overlap (marker-to-marker or markers on existing shapes) must be solved.\n\nOnce I've identified all shapes, I need to follow the rules (shape-marker, collision rules) and place those markers accordingly. I will start by identifying the shapes (chevrons) and applying the chevron rules (shift vertically), then finding L-shapes with their respective marker locations (determined from L-shape orientation), and then handling any overlaps.\n\nI'm making a key assumption here. Since the descriptions use the term chevron specifically in a particular shape (an Up-pointing triangle), I'm assuming that \"chevron\" means exactly that, and not a general rotated shape. I'm also assuming the marker creation rule should apply to other geometric shapes of interest, like a down-\n\nThe transformation follows these rules derived from the examples:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:**\n    *   **Chevrons:** A pattern of three dots consisting of an apex at `(r, c)` and a base at `(r+1, c-1)` and `(r+1, c+1)`. We also identify rotated variations (Down: apex at bottom, base above; Left: apex left, base right).\n    *   **L-shapes:** A cluster of 3 dots forming a $2 \\times 2$ square with one corner missing. The \"corner\" is the vertex with two neighbors in the cluster.\n\n2.  **Generate Markers:**\n    *   **From Chevrons:** A new dot is created at a position offset by 5 from the apex in the direction the chevron points.\n        *   Up-pointing (apex `r,c`): Target `(r-5, c)`.\n        *   Down-pointing (apex `r,c`): Target `(r+5, c)`.\n        *   Left-pointing (apex `r,c`): Target `(r, c-5)`.\n        *   Right-pointing: Target `(r, c+5)`.\n    *   **From L-shapes:** Calculate the target based on the orientation. The logic inferred is: Find the vector from the L-corner to the missing (open) corner of the $2 \\times 2$ box, let's call it `(dr, dc)`. The offset is `(-dr*5, -dc*5)`.\n        *   Example: Top-Left corner (Open is Down-Right, `+1, +1`) $\\to$ Offset `(-5, -5)`.\n        *   Example: Bottom-Left corner (Open is Up-Right, `-1, +1`) $\\to$ Offset `(+5, -5)`.\n        *   This rule generalizes to: Row offset is $\\pm 5$ opposite to the vertical opening, Column offset is $\\pm 5$ opposite to the horizontal opening.\n\n3.  **Apply Transformations & Handle Collisions:**\n    *   **Standard Marker:** Place a dot of color **9** at the target location.\n    *   **Collision (Marker on Marker):** If two generated markers land on the same cell, place a dot of color **1**.\n    *   **Interaction (Marker on L-shape):** If a marker lands on any cell belonging to an existing L-shape, recolor the **entire** L-shape to color **9**.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Chevron 1 (Up):** Apex at `(5,9)`. Target: `(0,9)`. Color 9.\n*   **Chevron 2 (Up):** Apex at `(7,2)`. Target: `(2,2)`. This hits **L-shape 1**.\n*   **Chevron 3 (Up):** Apex at `(13,4)`. Target: `(8,4)`. Color 9.\n*   **Chevron 4 (Up):** Apex at `(14,14)`. Target: `(9,14)`. Hits same spot as L-shape 2 marker.\n*   **Chevron 5 (Down):** Apex at `(3,9)` (Base `2,8`, `2,10`). Target: `(3+5, 9) = (8,9)`. Color 9.\n*   **Chevron 6 (Left):** Apex at `(4,13)` (Base `3,14`, `5,14`). Target: `(4, 13-5) = (4,8)`. Color 9.\n*   **L-shape 1:** Pixels `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)`. Corner `(3,2)`. Open `(2,1)` (Up-Left).\n    *   Target: Offset Down-Right `(+5, +5)`. Corner `(3,2)` $\\to$ Target `(8,7)`. Color 9.\n    *   **Interaction:** The marker from Chevron 2 lands at `(2,2)`, which is part of this L-shape. The whole L-shape `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)` changes color from 6 to **9**.\n*   **L-shape 2:** Pixels `(14,8), (14,9), (15,9)`. Corner `(14,9)`. Open `(15,8)` (Down-Left).\n    *   Target: Offset Up-Right `(-5, +5)`. Corner `(14,9)` $\\to$ Target `(9,14)`.\n*   **Collision at (9,14):** Marker from Chevron 4 and Marker from L-shape 2 meet. Result is color **1**.\n\n**Final Grid Construction:**\n*   Start with Input (Background 7, Objects 6).\n*   Recolor L-shape 1 at `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)` to **9**.\n*   Add markers:\n    *   `(0,9)`: 9\n    *   `(4,8)`: 9\n    *   `(8,4)`: 9\n    *   `(8,7)`: 9\n    *   `(8,9)`: 9\n    *   `(9,14)`: 1 (Collision)\n\noutput:\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6",

(2) 3-cell L-shaped clusters (2\u00d72 minus one corner) in colors 2, 6, 9, with variable orientation.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Keep background color 7 and grid size unchanged.  \n- Find 3-dot chevrons (dots at (r,c), (r+1,c-1), (r+1,c+1)); for each apex at (r,c) add a new dot at (r-5,c) colored 9.  \n- Find each 3-cell L-shape; compute its corner cell; add a marker dot offset diagonally from the corner by 5 rows and 5 columns (observed as col-5 and row\u00b15), typically colored 9.  \n- If an L-marker hits an existing L-shape, recolor the whole hit L-shape to 9.  \n- If multiple generated marks overlap, the overlap may be resolved by overwriting/priority or by using color 1 (as seen in one case).\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

(2) 3-cell L-shaped clusters (2\u00d72 minus one corner) in colors 2, 6, 9, with variable orientation.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Keep background color 7 and grid size unchanged.  \n- Find 3-dot chevrons (dots at (r,c), (r+1,c-1), (r+1,c+1)); for each apex at (r,c) add a new dot at (r-5,c) colored 9.  \n- Find each 3-cell L-shape; compute its corner cell; add a marker dot offset diagonally from the corner by 5 rows and 5 columns (observed as col-5 and row\u00b15), typically colored 9.  \n- If an L-marker hits an existing L-shape, recolor the whole hit L-shape to 9.  \n- If multiple generated marks overlap, the overlap may be resolved by overwriting/priority or by using color 1 (as seen in one case).\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

Example 1 does the same from **9** chevrons, producing new dots at r-5.)\n\n---\n\n#### 3) Detect 3-cell L-shaped clusters and create an offset \u201cmarker\u201d dot from the L-corner\nForeground also contains connected **3-cell L-shapes** (a **2\u00d72** block missing one corner), in colors like **2** or **9**.\n\n**Key identification step:**\n- Find the **corner cell** of the L (the cell touching the other two by 4-neighborhood).\n\n**Transformation (as seen):**\n- Place a new single-cell marker at a fixed offset from the L-corner:\n  - **5 columns left** from the corner, and\n  - **5 rows up or down** depending on which diagonal is \u201coutside\u201d the L (equivalently: move diagonally away from the missing 2\u00d72 corner).\n- In the examples this shows up as:\n  - **(corner_row-5, corner_col-5)** in Example 3\n  - **(corner_row+5, corner_col-5)** in Example 1 (because the other diagonal direction would go out of bounds)\n\n**Marker color (observed possibilities):**\n- Often the marker is **9** (Example 3).\n- A special case produces **1** (Example 1), suggesting either:\n  - the L-marker color can be **1** for certain L-shapes (notably when the L itself is **9**), **or**\n  - **1** is used when this L-marker position coincides with another generated mark (see #5).\n\n---\n\n#### 4) If an L-marker lands on an existing L-shape, recolor that entire L-shape\nExample 3 shows that when the computed L-marker position coincides with an existing **2** L-shape location, the output doesn\u2019t just change one cell\u2014it recolors the **entire 3-cell L-shape** to **9**.\n\nSo a plausible rule is:\n- If a generated marker hits any cell of an existing L-cluster (especially its corner), then **recolor the whole L-cluster** to the marker color (**9** in the example).\n\n(Equivalent interpretation: the marker \u201cselects\u201d the target L-shape and highlights it.)\n\n---\n\n#### 5) Overlap / priority behavior can create color 1\nExample 1 has a newly created cell of **1** exactly where a \u201cchevron apex projection\u201d would land, and that location also matches the L-based offset point.\n\nThis implies a possible additional rule about collisions:\n- If **two different generation rules** want to write a marker to the same cell, that cell may become **1** (instead of **9**), **or**\n- The L-derived write has priority and writes **1** over an existing/proposed **9**, **or**\n- The L-shape provides a \u201cselector\u201d that causes one of the projected markers to be recolored from **9** to **1**.\n\n(Only one overlap is shown, so all of these remain plausible.)\n\n---\n\n<transformation_summary>\n- Keep background color 7 and grid size unchanged.  \n- Find 3-dot chevrons (dots at (r,c), (r+1,c-1), (r+1,c+1)); for each apex at (r,c) add a new dot at (r-5,c) colored 9.  \n- Find each 3-cell L-shape; compute its corner cell; add a marker dot offset diagonally from the corner by 5 rows and 5 columns (observed as col-5 and row\u00b15), typically colored 9.  \n- If an L-marker hits an existing L-shape, recolor the whole hit L-shape to 9.  \n- If multiple generated marks overlap, the overlap may be resolved by overwriting/priority or by using color 1 (as seen in one case).  \n</transformation_summary>",

(2) 3-cell L-shaped clusters (2\u00d72 minus one corner) in colors 2, 6, 9, with variable orientation.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Keep background color 7 and grid size unchanged.  \n- Find 3-dot chevrons (dots at (r,c), (r+1,c-1), (r+1,c+1)); for each apex at (r,c) add a new dot at (r-5,c) colored 9.  \n- Find each 3-cell L-shape; compute its corner cell; add a marker dot offset diagonally from the corner by 5 rows and 5 columns (observed as col-5 and row\u00b15), typically colored 9.  \n- If an L-marker hits an existing L-shape, recolor the whole hit L-shape to 9.  \n- If multiple generated marks overlap, the overlap may be resolved by overwriting/priority or by using color 1 (as seen in one case).\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
