Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**Deep Dive into ARC Task Resolution**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to crack this ARC puzzle, which is all about transforming grids of numbers. I see a 20x20 input grid, and the goal is to produce a similarly sized output. I've got four examples to learn from. My initial thought is to look for patterns, right? The input numbers are simple (0-9), and there's definitely some structure at play.\n\nFirst, I break down Example 1. It seems to have these \"markers\" - like, color 6 at certain positions that correspond to something in the output. The grid's 20x20, and I'm guessing it's built of smaller blocks, maybe 4x4. That math checks out! 20/4=5, so a 5x5 grid of 4x4 blocks feels right. I start to trace those colors, like where are the 6's? Where are the 2's? And what do they translate to in the output?\n\nThen, I make a crucial leap: the input isn't just a random blob of numbers, it's a *map*. Each non-black number might point to a *shape* in the output. The specific color defines which shape, and its position defines where it goes. I note that 6's show up in a 2x2 grid, and that in the output, this leads to an output block being empty. This shape removal logic pops out!\n\nI start to formalize this: input is 5x5 blocks (R,C) of 4x4 pixels, and the numbers are \"seeds\". Each input grid cell can be viewed as being in one of these blocks. If a block has just a \"seed\", draw the shape. If a block has the seed *and* the shape (or part of the shape), remove the shape and put 0 (black). If a block is just the shape, then remove it and put 0 (black). Empty stays empty.\n\nExample 2 reinforces this. There are seeds (3, 2) that appear, and the output is related to a new shape. Input value 1,2,3 define output shapes. Aha! Each seed has a corresponding shape. Also, there's a hollow square and diamond shape appearing in Ex 2, too.\n\nExample 3 complicates things... a little. There are a few key seeds, but there's a case where a *shape* from an earlier example is present in the input. I realize that the mapping is as follows: If there's an existing Shape in the Input block, clear this block and place 0 (Black).\n\nNow, the grid structure comes into focus. It's a grid of 4x4 blocks, but where are these blocks *exactly*? Ex 3 makes me realize they're not always aligned to the pixel positions. It's time to refine the \"Grid\" hypothesis. The blocks seem to be where seeds are present. This means that a grid structure emerges by looking at the input locations! The grid is defined based on the input itself. I must snap these seed locations.\n\nSo in Example 1, (1,8) input corresponds to (0,8) output (Snapping). It's no longer just a fixed 4x4 block grid, it's seed aligned.\n\nI introduce the concept of \"snapping.\" The seed is placed in the top-left corner of the grid in some cases, and it places the grid at the position where it is located. Some numbers \"snap\" better (and get the same location), while others change!\n\nNow, Example 4: This is where I start identifying *which* shapes map to *which* numbers, and test this hypothesis:\n\n-   `2` -> Hollow Square 4.\n-   `3` -> Diamond (or Hollow Octagon) 1.\n-   `5` ->  Diagonal Square 6.\n-   `8` -> Cross 7.\n\nOkay, now let's apply all that knowledge to the \"Test Input\". I see numbers! Most notably the seed *8*! It appears in a regular grid structure. I decide this is a good seed and output should just expand from these locations!\nI have to make sure to clear the existing `7` shape, too.\nNow I am very confident, let's double check and proceed to construct the grid. I use the 4x4 Shape 7 (Cross) structure (found in Ex 4) and draw in the output cells appropriately. After writing each block, I step back to verify (and find no issues). Finally, I create the full output.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid based on rules inferred from examples.\n\n**Analysis of the Task**\n1.  **Grid Structure:** The grids in the examples (especially 20x20 ones) appear to be divided into 5x5 sections of **4x4 pixel blocks**. The test input is 20x20.\n2.  **Transformation Logic:**\n    *   The input grid contains \"seed\" pixels (single non-zero pixels) and sometimes \"complete shapes\".\n    *   Specific seed colors map to specific 4x4 output shapes (colors and patterns).\n    *   **Mapping from Examples:**\n        *   Seed `2` (Red) $\\rightarrow$ Output Shape `4` (Yellow Hollow Square).\n        *   Seed `3` (Green) $\\rightarrow$ Output Shape `1` (Blue Hollow Diamond).\n        *   Seed `5` (Gray) $\\rightarrow$ Output Shape `6` (Magenta Split 2x2s).\n        *   Seed `8` (Azure) $\\rightarrow$ Output Shape `7` (Orange X/Cross).\n    *   **Placement Rule:** If a 4x4 block region in the input contains a seed, that entire 4x4 block in the output is filled with the corresponding shape.\n    *   **Removal Rule:** If a 4x4 block region in the input contains a \"complete shape\" but *no seed pixel*, the output for that block is cleared (becomes all 0s). This is observed in Example 1 (Top-Left) and Example 3 (Top-Left).\n3.  **Application to Test Input:**\n    *   **Grid Size:** 20x20.\n    *   **Seeds:** The input contains only seed `8` (Azure) and a pre-existing shape of `7`s (Orange).\n    *   **Seed `8` Locations:**\n        *   Row 1: Columns 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 (Blocks 0,0 to 0,4).\n        *   Row 5: Columns 0, 16 (Blocks 1,0 and 1,4).\n        *   Row 9: Columns 0, 8, 16 (Blocks 2,0; 2,2; 2,4).\n        *   Row 13: Columns 0, 12, 16 (Blocks 3,0; 3,3; 3,4).\n        *   Row 17: Columns 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 (Blocks 4,0 to 4,4).\n    *   **Shape `7` Location:**\n        *   A \"Cross\" shape made of `7`s exists in the block at Rows 4-7, Columns 4-7 (Block 1,1).\n        *   There is no seed `8` inside this block.\n    *   **Action:**\n        *   Blocks containing seed `8` will be filled with the Shape `7` pattern.\n        *   Block (1,1) containing the shape without a seed will be cleared (become empty).\n        *   Empty blocks remain empty.\n\n**Shape 7 Pattern (from Example 4):**\n```\n7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7\n```\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n*   **Rows 0-3:** Seeds in all 5 blocks. (Fill Pattern $\\times$ 5)\n*   **Rows 4-7:** Seeds in blocks 0, 4. Block 1 is cleared. Blocks 2, 3 empty. (Fill, Empty, Empty, Empty, Fill)\n*   **Rows 8-11:** Seeds in blocks 0, 2, 4. (Fill, Empty, Fill, Empty, Fill)\n*   **Rows 12-15:** Seeds in blocks 0, 3, 4. (Fill, Empty, Empty, Fill, Fill)\n*   **Rows 16-19:** Seeds in all 5 blocks.

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Grid Structure**: The input contains markers (non-zero values) that define a grid of cells. Each cell is 4x4.\n\n2. **Pattern Mapping**: Each marker value maps to a specific 4x4 pattern:\n   - 2 \u2192 Pattern 4 (solid hollow rectangle): `4,4,4,4 / 4,0,0,4 / 4,0,0,4 / 4,4,4,4`\n   - 3 \u2192 Pattern 1 (hollow, empty corners): `0,1,1,0 / 1,0,0,1 / 1,0,0,1 / 0,1,1,0`\n   - 5 \u2192 Pattern 6 (diagonal 2x2): `6,6,0,0 / 6,6,0,0 / 0,0,6,6 / 0,0,6,6`\n   - 8 \u2192 Pattern 7 (hollow, filled corners): `7,0,0,7 / 0,7,7,0 / 0,7,7,0 / 7,0,0,7`\n\n3. **Cell Assignment**: Each cell is filled based on the marker at its top-left corner position.\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n- Markers are at rows 1, 5, 9, 13, 17 and columns 0, 4, 8, 12, 16\n- Row 1: All markers are 8 \u2192 all cells get pattern 7\n- Row 5: markers at (5,0)=8, (5,4)=7 (template), (5,16)=8; positions (5,8) and (5,12) are 0 \u2192 empty cells\n- Row 9: markers at (9,0)=8, (9,8)=8, (9,16)=8; positions (9,4) and (9,12) are 0 \u2192 empty cells\n- Row 13: markers at (13,0)=8, (13,12)=8, (13,16)=8; positions (13,4) and (13,8) are 0 \u2192 empty cells\n- Row 17: All markers are 8 \u2192 all cells get pattern 7\n\nThe 7 pattern template at positions (5,4)-(8,7) confirms the pattern shape.\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0\n```",
