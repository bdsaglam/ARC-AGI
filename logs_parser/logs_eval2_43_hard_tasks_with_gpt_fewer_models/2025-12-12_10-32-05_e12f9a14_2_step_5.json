            "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Thoughts and Problem Decomposition:**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I need to transform input grids based on colored shapes. The goal is to figure out the underlying pattern, which, from what I can tell, involves extending lines or \"beams\" from those shapes. I'll need to meticulously examine the provided examples, starting with the first one, to deduce the transformation rules. My plan is to start by identifying all the unique shapes, map the colors, the way the pattern changes. I will then compare the input and output to work out what\u2019s being generated.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis: Shape Identification and Color Mapping:**\n\nI'm analyzing the 24x24 grid in the first example. The background is teal (8). I can see some distinct small shapes using non-teal colors. Starting to list the Shapes (Shape 1 - the shape at top-middle-ish, Shape 2 - to the right of Shape 1 and Shape 3 - to the right of Shape 2, Shape 4 - bottom-left).\n\n**Shape 1:** It's an \"Octagon,\" with the color pattern \"3,3; 3,9,9,3; 3,9,9,3; 3,3;\". I\u2019m using the color 9 (Maroon) inside and 3 (Green) for the border.\n\n**Shape 2:** This shape has the color 1 (Blue) inside and 3 (Green) for the border.\n\n**Shape 3:** This shape is tricky. The colors and structure are a bit mixed up or broken, maybe it\u2019s a diagonal.\n\n**Shape 4:** This one in the bottom left, is more straightforward. The pattern is \"3,3,3,3; 3,6,6,8; 3,6,6,3; 3,3,3,3;\u201d. The color 6 (Pink) for the interior and 3 (Green) for the border.\n\n**Output Pattern Discovery: Beams and Interactions:**\n\nNow I'll compare the inputs to the corresponding outputs. I notice that the 8s (background) are replaced with the colors related to those shapes, and that lines shoot out from the inside.\n\n**Shape 1 output is diagonal lines up-left and up-right.**\n\n**Shape 2 output shows vertical line in certain cols.**\n\nLet's look more carefully at the pattern to map the beams. I see a diagonal lines are extending, up and to the right from the upper-right corner. It seems the direction depends on the shape type, but for now I will try mapping it out.  I\u2019ll refer to it as \"beams.\"\n\nThe beams are diagonal going Top-Left (-1,-1) and Down-Left (+1,-1).\n\n**Deconstructing Beams: Detailed Analysis and Direction Determination:**\n\nFor the Maroon Shape, I'm observing and mapping out the beams. I'm taking the input and output values to try and see if I can figure out the beam direction.  I'm trying to figure out where those lines come from. I've narrowed it down to four corners, and now to which beam will be assigned a certain shape.\n\nMy analysis reveals:\n\n*   **Beams radiate from specific points**: It looks like beams emerge from corners of a frame around the colored core of the shape.\n*   **Collision Detection and Beam Interaction:** The more shapes that exist, the more likely a beam will interact with the shapes, the shapes are also beams. Beams seem to reflect or turn when close to one another! The rules I\u2019m defining will need to consider interactions between the various beams, and also the shapes themselves.\n*   **Beam Directions and Collision:** It is based on the orientation of the shape. I\u2019m starting to test and make sure everything is working the way I\u2019m imagining. If 2 beams are close, they change direction from diagonal to vertical? \n\nI am starting to organize the beams.\n\nI think the 2 beams will create a vertical line.\n\n**Generalizing the Rule:  Hole in Wall Theory (Algorithm Formulation):**\n\nLet\u2019s try to define the rules:\n\n*   **Shape Identification:** A shape consists of connected non-background pixels.\n*   **Core Identification:** Within each shape, the \"core\" is comprised of non-border color (I will ignore borders).\n*   **Emitter Determination:** A core cell is an \"emitter\" if it's adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to a background cell.\n*   **Beam Emission:** If an emitter exists, shoot a beam in the direction of the background cell (orthogonal or diagonal).\n*   **Beam Propagation:** Beam color is the core color.\n*   **Collision/Interaction:** If beams from different shapes\n\nThe transformation rule involves emitting \"beams\" of color from the \"core\" (interior color) of each object through \"holes\" (background color 8) in the object's border (color 3).\n\n**Step-by-Step Logic:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects and Cores**:\n    *   **Shape A (Red 2)**: Located at top-left. Core cells are at `(5,4), (5,5), (6,4), (6,5)`.\n    *   **Shape B (Yellow 4)**: Located at top-middle. Core cells are at `(5,15), (5,16), (6,15), (6,16)`.\n    *   **Shape C (Magenta 6)**: Located at middle-right. Core cells are at `(14,23), (14,24), (15,23), (15,24)`.\n    *   **Shape D (Orange 7)**: Located at bottom-right. Core cells are at `(20,22), (20,23), (21,22), (21,23)` (based on Input R20/21). Note: Input R20 shows `3,7,7,8` at cols 21-24 implies core is `(20,22),(20,23)`.\n    *   **Shape E (Maroon 9)**: Located at bottom-left. Core cells are at `(25,1), (25,2), (26,1), (26,2)`.\n\n2.  **Identify Emitters (Holes)**:\n    For each core cell, check its immediate neighbors (orthogonal) for the background color (8). If found, a beam shoots out in that direction.\n    *   **Red (2)**:\n        *   Core `(5,4)` has Left neighbor `(5,3)` as 8. **Beam Left**.\n        *   Core `(5,4)` (or adjacent core/border gap) has Top neighbor `(4,4)` as 8. **Beam Up**.\n    *   **Yellow (4)**:\n        *   Core `(5,16)` has Right neighbor `(5,17)` as 8. **Beam Right**.\n        *   Core `(6,15)` has Bottom neighbor `(7,15)` as 8. **Beam Down**.\n    *   **Magenta (6)**:\n        *   Core `(14,23)` has Top neighbor `(13,23)` as 8. **Beam Up**.\n    *   **Orange (7)**:\n        *   Core `(20,23)` has Right neighbor `(20,24)` as 8. **Beam Right**.\n    *   **Maroon (9)**:\n        *   Core `(25,2)` has Top neighbor `(24,2)` as 8. **Beam Up**.\n\n3.  **Trace Beams and Handle Collisions**:\n    Beams travel in straight lines. If two beams moving roughly perpendicularly intersect, they deflect diagonally away from each other to avoid crossing.\n    *   **Collision 1 (Red Left vs Maroon Up)**:\n        *   Red Left beam travels on Row 5. Maroon Up beam travels on Col 2. Intersection at `(5,2)`.\n        *   They deflect diagonally toward the Top-Left.\n        *   **Red Path**: `(5,4) -> (5,3)`. At `(5,3)` it deflects UL to `(4,2) -> (3,1) -> (2,0)`.\n        *   **Maroon Path**: `(24,2) -> ... -> (6,2)`. At `(6,2)` it deflects UL to `(5,1) -> (4,0)`.\n    *   **Collision 2 (Yellow Right vs Magenta Up)**:\n        *   Yellow Right beam travels on Row 5. Magenta Up beam travels on Col 23. Intersection at `(5,23)`.\n        *   They deflect diagonally toward the Top-Right.\n        *   **Yellow Path**: `(5,17) -> ... -> (5,22)`. At `(5,22)` it deflects UR to `(4,23) -> (3,24) -> (2,25) -> (1,26) -> (0,27)`.\n        *   **Magenta Path**: `(13,23) -> ... -> (6,23)`. At `(6,23)` it deflects UR to `(5,24) -> (4,25) -> (3,26) -> (2,27) -> (1,28) -> (0,29)`.\n\n4.  **Uninterrupted Beams**:\n    *   **Red Up**: `(4,4)` up to `(0,4)`.\n    *   **Yellow Down**: `(7,15)` down to `(29,15)`.\n    *   **Orange Right**: `(20,24)` right to `(20,29)`.\n\n5.  **Final Grid**: Apply these paths to the input grid.\n\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8\n2,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8\n8,2,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8\n9,8,2,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8,8\n9,9,8,2,8,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,8,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,7,7,7,7,7\n9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**1. Problem Breakdown and Initial Analysis:**\n\nThe user is asking me to solve an ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) problem, a task that seems to involve identifying patterns in visual data and generating a corresponding output. My initial focus is on understanding the rules through careful analysis of provided examples and a test input. I immediately notice some repeating visual themes: a teal (8) background, green (3) outlines forming box-like structures, and objects with a defined inner color. The problem seems to be about how these inner colors are extended or modified based on the surrounding green barriers, and I start to hypothesize about \"gaps\" and \"flow\" of color.\n\n**2. Example-Driven Hypothesis Formulation:**\n\nI examine the first example meticulously. I observe that the \"green boxes\" aren't always perfect squares, but have corners open and act as barriers to the inner colour that is surrounded. The color extends from the inside to the gaps (the holes or missing corners) in the form of rays. I refine my understanding to say, \"The 'green' pixels form a barrier, and the inner color 'flows' out through any gaps in the barrier,\". I notice that the directions for the rays seem to be orthogonal (horizontal or vertical) or diagonal.\n\n**3. Hypotheses Testing and Rule Refinement:**\n\nI test this hypothesis with the first example's multiple objects, carefully analyzing each output. It confirms that the color flows from the inner block through gaps in the \"bounding box\" (defined by adjacent pixels) of '3', and that it's the absence of '3' that allows color to expand. I note that lines continue until they hit the grid edge or another barrier. This leads me to create a refined rule: for each cell of the inner colored block, check its eight neighbors (cardinal and diagonal). If the neighbor is '8' (background/hole) and the path is not blocked by a '3' (green wall), extend a line in that direction. The \"path\" is crucial, and it becomes the key for the diagonal directions as I continue to examine more examples and refine the direction to be consistent.\n\n**4. Expanding Complexity and Interaction Rules:**\n\nAnalyzing the second example introduces a more complex interaction. I find that a ray can \"squeeze\" through a diagonal corner even if the cardinal neighbors are blocked, expanding the rule to: if the immediate next cell in that direction is NOT a wall (3), continue the ray from the pixel in the inner block. I start thinking about the ray behavior. What happens when these rays meet or interact? I begin to suspect that their behaviour might include \"stopping\", \"bouncing\", or \"reflecting\". Analyzing output and re-evaluating the grid leads me to suspect that the lines cross or interact with one another. I start to think about the order or position of colors and how they may influence each other.\n\n**5.  The Critical Breakthrough: Identifying Core Transformation:**\n\nI encounter another crucial observation: Sometimes, the inner color and the green \"wall\" swap positions! This forces me to revisit my rules. I start to carefully examine all of the examples again and I formulate a new hypothesis: \"If the wall is complete, the color permeates the wall and they swap.\" I discover that there are two core behaviours: *sealed* and *leaky*, with different associated ray behaviours. Sealed is \"complete\" walls, leading to a swap, and diagonal-only rays. Leaky is \"incomplete\" walls, with cardinal or diagonal rays emerging through the gaps.\n\n**6. Formalizing the Algorithm and Key Steps:**\n\nThe next example helps me to confirm my algorithm, and I formulate it into specific steps. I'm now able to explain:\n\n1.  Identify the inner colour and the wall\n2.  Check for \"sealed\" vs. \"leaky\".\n3.  If sealed, swap and shoot diagonal rays from the new walls.\n4.  If leaky, no swap and shoot cardinal or diagonal rays through gaps.\n\nI add that rays stop at wall (3) or the edge. I make a detailed analysis of all the specific ray behaviours.\n\n**7.  Addressing the Test Input and Intersection Behaviour:**\n\nFinally, I reach the actual test input. I meticulously apply the rules and ray propagation logic.  I start to run into more complex interactions between rays, specifically how those rays that are diagonal interact with those that are vertical. Through extensive tracing of the grid and ray direction, I come to another realization about ray behavior: when rays of different colours come into adjacency vertically, they merge and continue down in the grid.\n\n**8.  Finalizing the Algorithm and Construction of the Solution:**\n\nI have now distilled the process into a set of well-defined steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Connected components of non-8, non-3 colors (Inner), 3s as the wall.\n2.  **Type Check:** Sealed\n\nThe solution involves simulating the \"flow\" of colored liquids from containers defined by green (3) walls.\n\n**Analysis of the Rules:**\n\n1.  **Objects:** The grid contains objects consisting of an inner rectangular block of color (not 3 or 8) surrounded by a \"wall\" of green (3) pixels.\n2.  **Sealed vs. Leaky:**\n    *   **Sealed:** If the inner color block is completely enclosed by green walls in the four cardinal directions (Top, Bottom, Left, Right), it is \"Sealed\".\n    *   **Leaky:** If there is a gap (an '8' or grid edge) in the immediate cardinal neighbors of the inner block, it is \"Leaky\".\n3.  **Transformation:**\n    *   **Sealed Objects:**\n        *   **Swap:** The inner color and the green wall swap roles. The green pixels become the inner color, and the inner pixels become green (or empty '8' in some interpretations, but here walls effectively turn into the source color).\n        *   **Flow:** Diagonal rays of the object's color are emitted from the corners of the new bounding box outwards.\n    *   **Leaky Objects:**\n        *   **No Swap:** The object retains its shape.\n        *   **Flow:** Rays of the inner color are emitted through any **gaps** in the wall.\n            *   **Cardinal Gaps:** If a cardinal neighbor is open, a straight line extends in that direction.\n            *   **Diagonal Gaps:** If a diagonal neighbor is open (and not blocked by the source block itself), a diagonal line extends in that direction.\n4.  **Ray Interaction:**\n    *   Rays travel until they hit the grid edge or another object.\n    *   **Merge/Drop:** If two rays of different colors moving generally downwards or sideways meet and become **horizontally adjacent**, they merge and travel **vertically down** side-by-side.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\nThe test input contains 5 \"Leaky\" objects. None are fully sealed.\n*   **Red (2) [Top-Left]:** Leaks Up (Col 5), Left (Row 6), and Diagonal SE (from corner 8,7).\n*   **Yellow (4) [Top-Right]:** Leaks Right (Row 6) and Down (Col 16).\n*   **Pink (6) [Mid-Right]:** Leaks Up (Col 24), Diagonal NE (from 14,26), and Diagonal SE (from 17,26).\n*   **Orange (7) [Bot-Right]:** Leaks Right (Row 21) and Diagonal SE (from 23,26).\n*   **Maroon (9) [Bot-Left]:** Leaks Up (Col 3) and Diagonal SE (from 28,4).\n\n**Interaction:**\n*   **Red SE & Yellow Down:** The Red diagonal ray (moving SE) meets the Yellow vertical ray (moving Down at Col 16).\n    *   Red path: Starts (8,7)... reaches (16,15).\n    *   Yellow path: Vertical at Col 16.\n    *   At Row 16, Red is at Col 15 and Yellow is at Col 16. They are adjacent.\n    *   Result: The Red ray turns vertical. From Row 16 downwards, we have a stripe of `2` at Col 15 and `4` at Col 16.\n\n**Final Ray Paths:**\n1.  **Maroon (9):** Up at Col 3. Diagonal SE from (28,4) to (29,5).\n2.  **Red (2):** Up at Col 5. Left at Row 6. Diagonal SE from (8,7) to (16,15), then Vertical Down at Col 15 (merging with Yellow).\n3.  **Yellow (4):** Right at Row 6. Vertical Down at Col 16.\n4.  **Pink (6):** Up at Col 24. Diagonal NE from (14,26). Diagonal SE from (17,26).\n5.  **Orange (7):** Right at Row 21. Diagonal SE from (23,26).\n\n**Output Generation:**\nOverlay these lines onto the input grid. At simple crossing points (like Red Left vs Maroon Up), one color overwrites the other (Maroon overwrites Red here).\n\n8,8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,9,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,3,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6\n7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,4,7,7,3,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n3,3,3,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. Each small colored square has a border of 3s (green) with some cells missing (gaps)\n2. The colored fill (non-3, non-8) inside each pattern determines the line color\n3. Lines extend from gap positions in the direction pointing away from the pattern:\n   - Edge gaps \u2192 straight lines (vertical or horizontal)\n   - Corner gaps \u2192 diagonal lines\n4. Lines extend until they reach the grid boundary\n\nFor the test input, I identify these patterns and their gaps:\n- **Pattern 1 (color 2)**: rows 4-7, cols 3-6 - gaps create UP, LEFT, and DOWN-RIGHT lines\n- **Pattern 2 (color 4)**: rows 4-7, cols 14-17 - gaps create UP-LEFT diagonal, RIGHT, and DOWN lines\n- **Pattern 3 (color 6)**: rows 13-16, cols 22-25 - gaps create UP, UP-RIGHT diagonal, and DOWN-RIGHT diagonal\n- **Pattern 4 (color 7)**: rows 19-22, cols 21-24 - gaps create RIGHT and DOWN-RIGHT diagonal lines\n- **Pattern 5 (color 9)**: rows 24-27, cols 0-3 - gaps create UP and DOWN-RIGHT diagonal lines\n\n```\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Green container shapes remain fixed; the main change is **adding long, thin path-like pixels** on the cyan background.\n* Added paths use **only the interior (payload) colors**; green is not propagated into the new structures.\n* New paths frequently run to **edges/corners** and can form **staircase diagonals** (grid-approximated straight lines).\n* With multiple containers, the added paths can **meet at junctions**, forming a connected network rather than isolated lines.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, here's my breakdown of how I'm approaching this ARC task. The core idea is to understand how these green shapes in the input grid influence the output, which seems to involve drawing lines or paths.**\n\n**First**, I'm trying to figure out the connection between the green shapes (the \"containers\" with color 3) and the colored pixels inside them. These colors act as \"payloads\" that will be used to generate the output. Examining the examples, I see that the shapes have different colors within their borders, and these internal colors seem to determine the color of the output lines.\n\n**Next**, I need to understand the output pattern. Based on the \"Test Input\" prompts I got from the user, the goal is to create connecting lines that extend to borders and form staircase-like diagonals. Each shape appears to act like a source or hub, with lines emanating from it.\n\n**The Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Identify the \"Ports\" or \"Entry points\":** Gaps or openings in the green borders of the shapes seem to be the most obvious starting points. In my reasoning, I am referring to those as \"Openings\" in the summary. Straight lines in the color of each shape's interior fill those openings.\n2.  **Corners:** If there are corners/missing border pixels, then they originate diagonal lines. The diagonals have 45 degree angle with respect to the shape.\n\n**This is what I learned from reviewing the examples given, with an emphasis on my observations:**\n\n*   In Example 1, the output had lines extending towards the edges of the grid.\n*   In Example 2, the lines followed a more rectangular pattern, like connections.\n*   In Example 3, there was a connection between multiple shapes.\n*   The hint on the staircase pattern led me to find \"diagonals\" and vertical connections.\n\n**Based on this, I'm forming the hypothesis:**\n\nEach shape has one or more ports where it connects to the background, in a sort of \"ray\" or path. Lines are created from the shapes, extending from those ports to connect to boundaries.\n\n**Now I'm looking for a way to model this and make the process algorithmic:**\n\n1.  First, the location of shapes is detected in the input, by their green borders.\n2.  Next, identify \"openings\" within that border by looking for missing pixels. The key here will be correctly transcribing coordinates and comparing pixels.\n3.  Each \"opening\" creates a ray, path or line, in one or more directions depending on the shape, the type of the opening and neighboring shapes or existing paths.\n4.  In the final step, these lines are generated in the output.\n\n**What I'm expecting is:**\n\nThe final output will be a grid with single-pixel-wide lines that connect or trace from each shape to the edges of the image or other shapes.\nI will draw them one by one. I will use the internal color to create the appropriate color in the output. I will manage color intersections by assuming all lines exist.\n\n**To implement this, I will:**\n\n1.  Scan the input grid to locate the green shapes.\n2.  Within each shape, detect the internal color (payload) and the openings in the green border.\n3.  For each shape, determine the \"ports\" and their associated directions.\n4.  Trace the lines in the corresponding color from each port, extending to the edges of the grid or the intersection of other lines.\n\nThis strategy will get the result, and that's the approach.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation follows these rules:\n\n1.  **Identify Containers**: The input consists of green (3) border shapes enclosing \"payload\" pixels of various colors.\n2.  **Identify Openings**:\n    *   **Missing Side**: If a side of the green border has a gap (replaced by background 8), a straight line of the payload color extends from that gap outwards to the grid edge.\n    *   **Missing Corner**: If a corner of the rectangular bounding box of the shape is missing its green border pixel, a diagonal line (staircase pattern) of the payload color extends from that corner outwards.\n3.  **Draw Paths**:\n    *   Paths stop at the grid boundaries.\n    *   Vertical/Horizontal lines are 1 pixel wide.\n    *   Diagonal lines are 1 pixel wide steps.\n    *   Where paths cross, one color takes precedence (the specific precedence isn't strictly defined by examples but standard layering applies; generally vertical lines or lines from \"lower\" shapes might overlay, or simple crossing).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Shape 1 (Color 2)** [Rows 4-7, Cols ~3-6]:\n    *   **Top Opening** at (4,4): Extends **Vertical Up** (Color 2) at Column 4.\n    *   **Left Opening** at (5,3): Extends **Horizontal Left** (Color 2) at Row 5.\n    *   **Missing BL Corner** at (7,3): Extends **Diagonal Down-Left** (Color 2) starting from (8,2).\n\n*   **Shape 2 (Color 4)** [Rows 4-7, Cols ~14-17]:\n    *   **Right Opening** at (5,17): Extends **Horizontal Right** (Color 4) at Row 5.\n    *   **Missing TR Corner** at (4,17): Extends **Diagonal Up-Right** (Color 4) starting from (3,18).\n    *   **Bottom Opening** at (7,15): Extends **Vertical Down** (Color 4) at Column 15.\n\n*   **Shape 3 (Color 6)** [Rows 13-16, Cols ~22-25]:\n    *   **Top Opening** at (13,23): Extends **Vertical Up** (Color 6) at Column 23.\n\n*   **Shape 4 (Color 7)** [Rows 19-22, Cols ~21-24]:\n    *   **Right Opening** at (20,24): Extends **Horizontal Right** (Color 7) at Row 20.\n    *   **Missing BR Corner** at (22,24): Extends **Diagonal Down-Right** (Color 7) starting from (23,25).\n\n*   **Shape 5 (Color 9)** [Rows 24-27, Cols ~0-3]:\n    *   **Top Opening** at (24,2): Extends **Vertical Up** (Color 9) at Column 2.\n    *   **Missing BR Corner** at (27,3): Extends **Diagonal Down-Right** (Color 9) starting from (28,4).\n\n**Completed Output Grid:**\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,2,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

interior (payload) colors**; green is not propagated into the new structures.\n* New paths frequently run to **edges/corners** and can form **staircase diagonals** (grid-approximated straight lines).\n* With multiple containers, the added paths can **meet at junctions**, forming a connected network rather than isolated lines.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Green (3) containers remain fixed** - they contain colored interiors\n2. **Gaps in green frames** indicate where lines should extend from the interior color\n3. **Line direction** depends on gap position:\n   - Edge gaps \u2192 perpendicular lines (vertical or horizontal)\n   - Corner gaps \u2192 diagonal lines\n4. **Lines extend** until they hit the grid boundary or approach another line (leaving a 1-cell gap)\n\nLet me identify the containers in the test input:\n- Container 1 (2s): rows 4-7, cols 3-6 - gaps at (4,4) top, (5,3) left, (7,6) corner\n- Container 2 (4s): rows 4-7, cols 14-17 - gaps at (4,14) corner, (5,17) right, (7,15) bottom\n- Container 3 (6s): rows 13-16, cols 22-25 - gaps at (13,23) top, (13,25) corner, (16,25) corner\n- Container 4 (7s): rows 19-22, cols 21-24 - gaps at (20,24) right, (22,24) corner\n- Container 5 (9s): rows 24-27, cols 0-3 - gaps at (24,2) top, (27,3) corner\n\nLines to draw:\n- Vertical 9s at col 2 (up from container 5)\n- Vertical 2s at col 4 (up from container 1)\n- Horizontal 4s at row 5 (right from container 2, stopping before 6s)\n- Vertical 4s at col 15 (down from container 2)\n- Vertical 6s at col 23 (up from container 3)\n- Diagonal 2s from (7,6) going down-right\n- Diagonal 4s from (4,14) going up-left\n- Diagonal 6s from corners of container 3\n- Diagonal 7s from (22,24) going down-right\n- Horizontal 7s at row 20 (right from container 4)\n- Diagonal 9s from (27,3) going down-right\n\n```\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "## 1. Describe the observable structures (literal)\n\n### Common to all pairs\n- **Background** is a uniform light-blue/cyan field.\n- There are one or more **green outlined \u201ccontainer/frame\u201d shapes**.  \n  - Each container encloses a **non-green \u201cpayload\u201d color** (e.g., maroon/red, dark blue, yellow, magenta, orange).\n  - Containers are small (roughly a few cells across) and appear **hollow/outlined** rather than solid.\n- In the **outputs**, the original green containers and their internal payload colors remain in the **same locations** and appear **unchanged**.\n\n### Pair 1 (Input 1 \u2192 Output 1)\n- **Input 1:**  \n  - Three small green containers are arranged roughly in a **horizontal row** near the middle, each with a different single-cell payload color (maroon/red, dark blue, yellow).\n  - A larger green container with a **magenta/pink payload** sits in the **bottom-left** region.\n- **Output 1:**  \n  - Many **new colored pixels** are added, forming **thin, long, connected line-like structures** (some straight, some staircase/zigzag).\n  - These line structures use the **same colors as the payloads** (maroon/red, dark blue, yellow, magenta) and extend across large parts of the grid, reaching toward **edges** and meeting at **junction-like intersections**.\n  - No comparable new structures appear in green; green remains concentrated in the original containers.\n\n### Pair 2 (Input 2 \u2192 Output 2)\n- **Input 2:** one green container enclosing a **yellow** payload.\n- **Output 2:** adds **yellow line segments** extending outward from the container region, reaching at least **two borders** (visually forming an L-like extension in this sketch).\n\n### Pair 3 (Input 3 \u2192 Output 3)\n- **Input 3:** three green containers with payloads **red**, **yellow**, **orange** at different positions (one upper-left-ish, one right-ish, one lower-left-ish).\n- **Output 3:** adds long **line-like structures** in **red/yellow/orange**, including at least one **staircase diagonal** segment and multiple long axis-aligned segments; containers remain.\n\n### Pair 4 (Input 4 \u2192 Output 4)\n- **Input 4:** one green container enclosing **magenta/pink**.\n- **Output 4:** adds **magenta/pink** pixels forming a **staircase diagonal** extension from near the container toward a border/corner; container remains.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identify transformation categories\n\n- **Object movement:** absent  \n- **Object recoloring:** absent (original objects keep their colors; instead, new pixels are added)  \n- **Bordering / outlining:** absent  \n- **Filling holes or cavities:** absent  \n- **Removing noise / extracting main shape:** absent  \n- **Copying / pasting / repositioning:** maybe (payload colors appear \u201ccopied outward\u201d into new line structures)  \n- **Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center):** present (new structures clearly interact with edges/corners)  \n- **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors:** maybe (payload colors are selectively used; background/green not expanded similarly)  \n- **Size-based filtering or selection:** maybe (the \u201clarger\u201d payload/container in Pair 1 also produces output; unclear if size matters)  \n- **Symmetry or reflection operations:** absent  \n- **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion:** present (new pixels \u201cgrow\u201d into long paths/lines)  \n- **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping:** absent  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Key non-obvious insights (crucial)\n\n1. **Only payload colors propagate:** The added pixels in the outputs are in the *same non-green colors* found inside the green containers; green itself is not extended into the new line network.\n2. **Outputs add \u201crouting/line\u201d geometry rather than filling areas:** The background stays mostly intact; the change is a sparse set of long, connected, thin structures (often reaching borders).\n3. **Diagonal-looking segments are rendered as staircase paths:** Several new lines are not purely horizontal/vertical; they form consistent 45\u00b0-trend staircases, suggesting a straight-line/beam/path concept on a grid.\n4. **Containers behave like fixed \u201csources\u201d or \u201cnodes\u201d:** The original green shapes remain untouched and appear to be the only locations from which the new colored structures emanate/attach.\n5. **Multi-source interaction produces junctions:** When multiple containers exist, the added structures meet at shared vertices/intersections rather than remaining isolated per container.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)\n\nThe task appears to treat each **green container + interior payload color** as a source, and then **draws long line/path extensions in the payload color** through the cyan background, often continuing until **hitting a border** and/or **meeting other paths**, producing junctions. The **direction(s)** of these extensions likely depend on some **geometric feature of the green container** (e.g., its opening/orientation) or on **relative placement between sources**.\n\nAlternative plausible family (if container orientation is irrelevant): the outputs could be constructing a **distance-based/straight-line connection graph** (e.g., connecting sources to borders and/or to each other with grid-approximated straight lines).\n\n---\n\n## 5. Checks to perform when solving\n\n1. **Detect openings/orientation of each green container** (e.g., missing side/corner) and test whether added lines leave specifically through those openings.\n2. **For each payload color, trace the added component** and verify whether it is a straight ray/path (horizontal/vertical/45\u00b0 staircase) and whether it ends at a **border**, a **junction**, or the **first obstacle**.\n3. **Check whether paths stop when hitting existing non-background pixels** (containers or previously drawn paths) vs. overwrite/cross them.\n4. **Verify color provenance:** confirm no new colors appear and that each added path\u2019s color matches exactly one container\u2019s payload color.\n5. **In multi-object cases, test if junction locations correspond to midpoints/bisectors** between sources (to distinguish \u201cray casting from openings\u201d vs \u201cdistance-partition skeleton\u201d rules).\n\n---\n\n## 6.

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nBackground field of color 8; foreground objects include (1) isolated single pixels, (2) 1-cell-thick horizontal/vertical/diagonal line segments, (3) filled rectangular blocks (often 2\u00d72 and longer bars), and (4) compact multi-color motifs\u2014especially frames/outlines in color 3 with interior fills in colors 2/4/6/7/9 (and occasionally color 1), plus other connected multi-color polyomino clusters.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Background stays 8; existing outlines in 3 and existing interior fills (e.g., 1/2/4/6/7/9) are preserved.  \n- For each 3-framed object, locate missing outline/border/corner cells that are 8 but adjacent to the object; recolor those gap cells from 8 to the object\u2019s interior color c.  \n- From each such filled gap, extend a 1-cell-thick ray of color c outward in the same direction (horizontal/vertical/diagonal) until the grid edge or until blocked by a non-8 pixel / another ray.  \n- In multi-object cases, rays can stop early near other rays and may continue from their endpoints by turning (often into a diagonal or vertical segment), producing longer connected trails.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Alright, here's my plan. The user wants me to solve an ARC task by analyzing examples and transforming an input grid based on \"Objects\" and their transformations. I need to figure out the rules of this transformation.\n\n**Here's the Breakdown:**\n1.  **Input:** A grid of numbers from 0 to 9.\n2.  **Output:** A transformed grid, same format.\n3.  **Key Hints:** \"Objects Description\" and \"Transformation Description.\"\n    *   **Background:** The value 8 seems important, kind of like an \"empty\" space.\n    *   **Objects:**  \"3-framed objects\" with inner filled shapes (like 2,4,6,7,9, or 1).\n    *   **The Transformation:** It's about finding gaps or missing pieces in the frames and then \"casting rays\" from those gaps.\n\n**My Approach:**\n1.  **Understand the Example Logic:** Carefully examine each example. My goal is to extract the \"recipe\".\n2.  **Verify the Rules:** Make a hypothesis based on hints, and examples, and then prove it with examples\n3.  **Test the Rules:** Apply what I've learned to the test input.\n\n**Diving into the Examples:**\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   There are shapes with corners that are essentially missing. The \"missing corners\" seem critical, as the \"gaps\" get filled in.\n    *   **Rays:**  After filling the gaps, rays shoot out. They can be diagonal, or orthogonal based on the shape of the object.\n    *   **Ray Interactions:**  If rays meet or hit, it gets interesting. Seems like they can stop, continue, or turn.\n\n    *   **Key Observations**: Rays stop at grid edges. This \"gap\" rule is consistent for all objects in Example 1\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   We have a \"missing\" corner that's not a corner like a square. It's a \"notch\" in the rectangle's corner.\n    *   Again, the gap is filled.\n    *   Rays shoot out (like orthogonal rays - up or right).\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Kind of a diamond/cross shape.\n    *   The gap is at the top where the diamond ends.\n    *   A Vertical ray goes upwards.\n\n**Hypothesis Refining:**\n*   **Shape Identification:** I need to identify the \"ideal shape\" of the 3-framed object. Usually, it's a Rectangle.\n*   **Gap Location:**  The missing pixels are the key to the transformation. Fill gaps.\n*   **Ray Directions:**\n    *   **Orthogonal Rays:** gaps at a straight side or edge.\n    *   **Diagonal Rays:** gaps at an indented/corner location.\n\n**Interactions:**\n*   **Rays Meeting:** I need to determine what happens when rays of different colors meet or are close together. Do they cross? Stop? Turn? What's the rule? It seems like orthogonal rays stop, and the existing color, has priority to establish. And the diagonal can pass through (Ex 1).\n\n**Applying to the Test Input:**\n\nI will identify the objects in the test input, analyze their shapes, locate gaps, and draw the rays according to my rules.\n\nLet's start!\n\n\nTo solve this task, we need to apply the transformation rules inferred from the examples to the test input.\n\n### Method Explanation\n\nThe transformation involves identifying objects (frames of color 3 with specific interior colors) and extending \"rays\" from any gaps in their outlines.\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all 3-framed objects in the grid. Note their interior color.\n    *   Object 1 (Top-Left): Frame 3, Interior 2 (Red).\n    *   Object 2 (Top-Right): Frame 3, Interior 4 (Yellow).\n    *   Object 3 (Bottom-Middle): Frame 3, Interior 6 (Pink).\n    *   Object 4 (Bottom-Right): Frame 3, Interior 7 (Orange).\n    *   Object 5 (Bottom-Left): Frame 3, Interior 9 (Maroon).\n\n2.  **Locate Gaps:** Find cells on the perimeter of these frames that are currently background color (8) but represent a \"missing\" piece of the frame (corners or wall segments).\n    *   **Obj 1 (Red):** Gaps at (4,4) [Top], (5,3) [Left], (7,6) [Bottom-Right Corner].\n    *   **Obj 2 (Yellow):** Gaps at (4,18) [Top-Right Corner], (5,18) [Right], (7,16) [Bottom].\n    *   **Obj 3 (Pink):** Gap at (13,23) [Top].\n    *   **Obj 4 (Orange):** Gaps at (20,24) [Right], (22,24) [Bottom-Right Corner].\n    *   **Obj 5 (Maroon):** Gaps at (24,2) [Top], (27,3) [Bottom-Right Corner].\n\n3.  **Fill Gaps:** Recolor the gap cells with the object's interior color.\n\n4.  **Cast Rays:** Extend 1-cell-thick rays from the filled gaps in the direction implied by the gap (outward from the center or extending the line).\n    *   **Ray 2 (Up):** From (4,4) upwards.\n    *   **Ray 2 (Left):** From (5,3) leftwards.\n    *   **Ray 2 (Diag DR):** From (7,6) diagonally down-right.\n    *   **Ray 4 (Diag UR):** From (4,18) diagonally up-right.\n    *   **Ray 4 (Right):** From (5,18) rightwards.\n    *   **Ray 4 (Down):** From (7,16) downwards.\n    *   **Ray 6 (Up):** From (13,23) upwards.\n    *   **Ray 7 (Right):** From (20,24) rightwards.\n    *   **Ray 7 (Diag DR):** From (22,24) diagonally down-right.\n    *   **Ray 9 (Up):** From (24,2) upwards.\n    *   **Ray 9 (Diag DR):** From (27,3) diagonally down-right.\n\n5.  **Handle Interactions:**\n    *   **Ray 9 (Up) vs Ray 2 (Left):** Intersect at (5,2). Ray 2 travels a shorter distance (1 step) compared to Ray 9 (19 steps). Ray 2 claims the cell. Ray 9 stops at (6,2).\n    *   **Ray 6 (Up) vs Ray 4 (Right):** Intersect at (5,23). Ray 4 travels a shorter distance (5 steps) compared to Ray 6 (8 steps). Ray 4 claims the cell. Ray 6 stops at (6,23).\n    *   **Ray 2 (Diag) vs Ray 4 (Down):** Intersect at (17,16). Both continue (diagonal rays pass through).\n\n### Output Grid Generation\n\nThe final grid is constructed by applying these rays to the input grid.\n\n*   **Ray 2 Up:** (0,4) to (3,4) become 2.\n*   **Ray 2 Left:** (5,0) to (5,2) become 2. (Blocks Ray 9).\n*   **Ray 2 Diag:** (8,7), (9,8)... down to edge become 2.\n*   **Ray 4 Diag:** (3,19), (2,20)... up to edge become 4.\n*   **Ray 4 Right:** (5,19) to edge become 4. (Blocks Ray 6).\n*   **Ray 4 Down:** (8,16) to edge become 4.\n*   **Ray 6 Up:** (6,23) to (12,23) become 6. (Stops before row 5).\n*   **Ray 7 Right:** (20,25) to edge become 7.\n*   **Ray 7 Diag:** (23,25), (24,26)... to edge become 7.\n*   **Ray 9 Up:** (6,2) to (23,2) become 9. (Stops before row 5).\n*   **Ray 9 Diag:** (28,4), (29,5) become 9.\n\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nBackground field of color 8; foreground objects include (1) isolated single pixels, (2) 1-cell-thick horizontal/vertical/diagonal line segments, (3) filled rectangular blocks (often 2\u00d72 and longer bars), and (4) compact multi-color motifs\u2014especially frames/outlines in color 3 with interior fills in colors 2/4/6/7/9 (and occasionally color 1), plus other connected multi-color polyomino clusters.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Background stays 8; existing outlines in 3 and existing interior fills (e.g., 1/2/4/6/7/9) are preserved.  \n- For each 3-framed object, locate missing outline/border/corner cells that are 8 but adjacent to the object; recolor those gap cells from 8 to the object\u2019s interior color c.  \n- From each such filled gap, extend a 1-cell-thick ray of color c outward in the same direction (horizontal/vertical/diagonal) until the grid edge or until blocked by a non-8 pixel / another ray.  \n- In multi-object cases, rays can stop early near other rays and may continue from their endpoints by turning (often into a diagonal or vertical segment), producing longer connected trails.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to:\n1. Identify objects framed by 3s with colored interiors\n2. Find gaps in each frame (8s where 3s should be)\n3.

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nBackground field of color 8; foreground objects include (1) isolated single pixels, (2) 1-cell-thick horizontal/vertical/diagonal line segments, (3) filled rectangular blocks (often 2\u00d72 and longer bars), and (4) compact multi-color motifs\u2014especially frames/outlines in color 3 with interior fills in colors 2/4/6/7/9 (and occasionally color 1), plus other connected multi-color polyomino clusters.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Background stays 8; existing outlines in 3 and existing interior fills (e.g., 1/2/4/6/7/9) are preserved.  \n- For each 3-framed object, locate missing outline/border/corner cells that are 8 but adjacent to the object; recolor those gap cells from 8 to the object\u2019s interior color c.  \n- From each such filled gap, extend a 1-cell-thick ray of color c outward in the same direction (horizontal/vertical/diagonal) until the grid edge or until blocked by a non-8 pixel / another ray.  \n- In multi-object cases, rays can stop early near other rays and may continue from their endpoints by turning (often into a diagonal or vertical segment), producing longer connected trails.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

Objects Description\nBackground field of color 8; foreground objects include (1) isolated single pixels, (2) 1-cell-thick horizontal/vertical/diagonal line segments, (3) filled rectangular blocks (often 2\u00d72 and longer bars), and (4) compact multi-color motifs\u2014especially frames/outlines in color 3 with interior fills in colors 2/4/6/7/9 (and occasionally color 1), plus other connected

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nBackground field of color 8; foreground objects include (1) isolated single pixels, (2) 1-cell-thick horizontal/vertical/diagonal line segments, (3) filled rectangular blocks (often 2\u00d72 and longer bars), and (4) compact multi-color motifs\u2014especially frames/outlines in color 3 with interior fills in colors 2/4/6/7/9 (and occasionally color 1), plus other connected multi-color polyomino clusters.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Background stays 8; existing outlines in 3 and existing interior fills (e.g., 1/2/4/6/7/9) are preserved.  \n- For each 3-framed object, locate missing outline/border/corner cells that are 8 but adjacent to the object; recolor those gap cells from 8 to the object\u2019s interior color c.  \n- From each such filled gap, extend a 1-cell-thick ray of color c outward in the same direction (horizontal/vertical/diagonal) until the grid edge or until blocked by a non-8 pixel / another ray.  \n- In multi-object cases, rays can stop early near other rays and may continue from their endpoints by turning (often into a diagonal or vertical segment), producing longer connected trails.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
