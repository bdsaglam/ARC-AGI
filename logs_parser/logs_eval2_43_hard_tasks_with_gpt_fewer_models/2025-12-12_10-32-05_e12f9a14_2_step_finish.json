model_id=\"gemini-3-high_1_step_1\">\n**My Process for Solving the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm thinking about this ARC task. The goal is to figure out the rule that transforms an input grid into an output grid, and then apply that rule to a test input. I'm taking a very structured approach.\n\n**1. Pattern Recognition & Hypothesis Generation**\n\n*   **Analyze Input/Output Pairs:** My initial step is to carefully examine the sample input-output pairs. I'm focusing on identifying the relationship between the shapes, their colors, and how those colors are mapped in the output. I'm looking for consistent transformations.\n*   **Initial Hypothesis:** It looks like some kind of projection or \"ray casting\" is at play. The internal colors of shapes seem to be \"projected\" outwards, but the directions and what \"blocks\" them is a mystery.\n*   **Digging Deeper:** I'm starting to think about containers or \"walls\" around the colored shapes. The green (3) pixels seem to define the boundaries of something, and the colors *inside* those boundaries are the things that get projected.\n*   **Gap Hypothesis:** I'm seeing gaps within the \"walls\" (meaning where there isn't a continuous border) and that the gaps seem to determine the *direction* of projection.\n*   **Refining the Hypothesis:** Looking at Example 2, the idea solidifies. Gaps in the 3's wall around the 4-colored shape clearly indicate the direction to project the 4 color. The output follows the gaps. I'm working with the idea of inner pixels of a color emitting rays. If a neighbor in a specific direction is not wall-color *or* the same color, there's a gap for a ray to form.\n*   **Formalize the Rules** Let me be sure to state my rule explicitly. I'm starting to formalize the rule:\n    1.  I identify shapes by looking for regions of a single color enclosed by the wall color 3.\n    2.  For each inner pixel, I check its 8 neighbors. If a neighbor isn't wall color and isn't the inner pixel's color, there's a gap in that direction.\n    3.  If there's a gap, project the inner color in that direction until you hit the edge of the grid.\n\n**2. Testing and Refinement**\n\n*   **Testing Hypothesis:** I test the hypothesis with the sample examples. I'm working to confirm that it correctly predicts the output for all the given examples. I am also working to find counter-examples.\n*   **Example 4 Check** This checks my edge cases. My diagonal check seems correct.\n*   **Double-Check and Modify:** If the hypothesis doesn't fully explain the behavior, I modify it.\n    *   I realized the *absence* of wall pixels defines the gap where a ray should be projected.\n    *   Diagonal rays require both cardinals to be wall, to make sure the diagonal is a true gap.\n*   **Diagonal Refinement:** I worked on diagonal gaps.\n\n**3.  Handling Edge Cases & Intersections**\n\n*   **Intersection Logic:** Now I need to consider what happens when rays cross.  I suspect that rays might just pass through each other, or perhaps they block one another.  I need to add the correct rules for \"intersections.\" Ex 3 helped. They bounce off each other, forming a perpendicular with a diagonal ray from the original direction.\n*   **Priority Rules:** Given that, I look to see the correct rule for deflection. The bisector of the two rays is the direction the rays turn.\n\n**4.  Applying the Rules to the Test Input**\n\n*   **Test Input Analysis:** After working out the rules, I turn my attention to the test input. I'll need to go through the grid, identify all the shapes, gaps, and ray paths and trace the projected rays.\n*   **Building the Grid:** I start with a blank grid and mark the known walls and shapes and I'm ready to apply my raycasting logic.\n*   **Output Assembly:** Finally, I'll generate the output grid as a string of the output.\n\nI think I've got this. I am now proceeding to step 4!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to identify shapes containing a specific color, enclosed by a border of color 3 (Green). The transformation involves projecting the inner color outwards from the shape in specific directions. The directions are determined by \"gaps\" or openings in the enclosure.\n\n**Transformation Rules:**\n1.  **Identify Shapes:** Locate regions of a color $C$ ($C \\ne 8$) enclosed by walls of color 3.\n2.  **Determine Rays:** For each pixel of the inner color $C$:\n    *   **Cardinal Directions (Up, Down, Left, Right):** Check the immediate neighbor. If the neighbor is not a Wall (3) and not the inner color $C$, it is considered a \"Cardinal Gap\". Emit a ray of color $C$ in that direction.\n    *   **Diagonal Directions (NW, NE, SW, SE):** Check the diagonal neighbor. If the diagonal neighbor is \"Open\" (not Wall, not $C$) AND the two adjacent cardinal neighbors (e.g., for NE, the N and E neighbors) are BOTH Walls (3), then it is a \"Diagonal Gap\". Emit a ray of color $C$ in that direction.\n3.  **Ray Propagation:** Rays travel in a straight line, changing background pixels (8) to color $C$.\n4.  **Ray Interactions:**\n    *   **Collision:** If two rays intersect at a specific cell, the rays stop at the cell before the intersection. The intersection cell remains background (8).\n    *   **Deflection:** Upon collision, the rays deflect.\n        *   If the collision is perpendicular (e.g., Horizontal vs Vertical), the rays deflect by 45 degrees into the \"bisecting\" diagonal direction relative to their incoming paths. (e.g., East + North -> North-East).\n        *   If the collision is acute (e.g., Diagonal vs Vertical), the rays \"swap\" behaviors (e.g., Diagonal becomes Vertical, Vertical becomes Diagonal).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Shape 1 (Color 2, Red):**\n    *   Location: ~Row 5, Col 4.\n    *   **Up Ray:** From (5,4) through gap at (4,4).\n    *   **Left Ray:** From (5,4) through gap at (5,3).\n    *   **Diagonal DR Ray:** From (6,5) through gap at (7,6).\n*   **Shape 2 (Color 4, Yellow):**\n    *   Location: ~Row 5, Col 16.\n    *   **Right Ray:** From (5,16) through gap at (5,17).\n    *   **Down Ray:** From (6,15) through gap at (7,15).\n    *   **Diagonal UL Ray:** From (5,15) through gap at (4,14).\n*   **Shape 3 (Color 6, Magenta):**\n    *   Location: ~Row 14, Col 23.\n    *   **Up Ray:** From (14,23) through gap at (13,23).\n    *   **Diagonal UR Ray:** From (14,24) through gap at (13,25).\n    *   **Diagonal DR Ray:** From (15,24) through gap at (16,25).\n*   **Shape 4 (Color 7, Orange):**\n    *   Location: ~Row 20, Col 22.\n    *   **Right Ray:** From (20,23) through gap at (20,24).\n    *   **Diagonal DR Ray:** From (21,23) through gap at (22,24).\n*   **Shape 5 (Color 9, Maroon):**\n    *   Location: ~Row 25, Col 1.\n    *   **Up Ray:** From (25,2) through gap at (24,2).\n    *   **Diagonal DR Ray:** From (26,2) through gap at (27,3).\n\n**Intersections & Deflections:**\n1.  **Intersection at (5,2):** Ray 2 (Left) meets Ray 9 (Up).\n    *   (5,2) remains 8.\n    *   Ray 2 deflects North-West (from 4,2).\n    *   Ray 9 deflects North-West (from 5,1).\n2.  **Intersection at (5,23):** Ray 4 (Right) meets Ray 6 (Up).\n    *   (5,23) remains 8.\n    *   Ray 4 deflects North-East (from 4,23).\n    *   Ray 6 deflects North-East (from 5,24).\n3.  **Intersection at (16,15):** Ray 2 (Diagonal SE) meets Ray 4 (Vertical Down).\n    *   (16,15) remains 8.\n    *   Ray 2 (Diagonal) becomes Vertical Down (Color 2).\n    *   Ray 4 (Vertical) becomes Diagonal South-East (Color 4).\n4.  **Intersection at (20,29):** Ray 6 (Diagonal SE) meets Ray 7 (Right). Both end at edge. Cell (20,29) set to 7.\n\n**Final Grid Generation:** The grid is filled based on the calculated ray paths and deflections.\n\noutput:\n2,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8\n2,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8\n8,2,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8\n9,8,2,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8,8\n8,9,8,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 0>\n<CANDIDATE 1>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n889828888848888888888886888888\n889828888884888888888886888888\n889828888888488888888886888888\n889828888888848888888886888888\n889323388888884333888886888888\n229222388888883444444446444444\n889322388888883443888886888888\n889333288888883433888886888888\n889888828888888488888886888888\n889888882888888488888886888886\n889888888288888488888886888868\n889888888828888488888886888688\n889888888882888488888886886888\n889888888888288488888836368888\n889888888888828488888836638888\n889888888888882488888836638888\n889888888888888428888833368888\n889888888888888482888888886888\n889888888888888488288888888688\n889888888888888488828333388868\n889888888888888488882377777777\n889888888888888488888277388888\n889888888888888488888333788888\n889888888888888488888828878888\n339388888888888488888882887888\n399388888888888488888888288788\n399388888888888488888888828878\n333988888888888488888888882887\n888898888888888488888888888288\n888889888888888488888888888828\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_1_step_1\">\nLooking at this problem, I need to identify shapes with 3-colored borders containing a 2x2 colored center, find gaps in the borders, and extend lines from those gaps.\n\n**Identifying shapes and their gaps:**\n\n1. **Shape 1 (2s)** at rows 4-7, cols 3-6:\n   -

Analyzing the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task, and it seems I need to figure out the transformation rules applied to input grids to generate output grids. My initial thought process involves breaking down the examples and identifying patterns.\n\n**2. Breaking Down Example 1**\n\nFirst up, Example 1. It's got a big grid filled with teal (8s) except for a few distinct structures outlined in green (3s).  These green outlines surround what I'm calling \"gems.\" Each gem has a core of a specific color and a 2x2 shape. The first gem has a maroon core (9).  I notice these gems are sort of diamond or octagon-shaped. Let's trace their positions and the colors inside.\n\nOkay, so the output... the background remains teal.  Hmm, the gems seem to have *moved*? No, wait... they're still there, but changed! I see diagonal rays or beams coming from the *centers* of these shapes. The output has these colored lines pointing to/from locations. It's a projection problem! I examine the gems closely. The corners of the shapes are filled with the core color (9).\n\nSo, the first step is to fill in the missing corners to make the shape into 4x4 squares. The shape is now:\n\n```\nC B B C\nB C C B\nB C C B\nC B B C\n```\n\nwhere C is the central color and B is the border.  Then, from the corners of this 4x4 box, I need to project a ray of color out from the corners.  Tracing these rays, I realize the main rule is \"project diagonal rays outwards from the corners.\"\n\nOkay, let's verify.  The output shows diagonal lines extending outwards.  Let's look at colors. The outputs show a pattern with the colors. Okay, great, so the diagonal lines extend upwards and left, right.\n\nBut what if these rays intersect? I check the output at the crossing points. This is where it gets interesting... The colors look like they \"bounce\" or swap.\nThis helps explain what happens when the rays run into each other (S1 and S2)... the paths shift to vertical. Okay, so when rays cross or hit an object, they stop at the boundary, and otherwise change to run vertically.\n\n**3. Refining the Hypothesis**\n\nOkay, let's summarize:\n\n1.  We have 4x4 shapes composed of a core and border.\n2.  Fill in the corners to create a solid square with core color.\n3.  Project diagonal rays from the corners of the shape.\n4.  When rays intersect, they turn vertical.\n\nLet's test this with other examples. Example 2 seems simple. The shapes are \"broken\" - the shapes have noise in the output. The broken shape is \"repaired\".  It turns out this is because we need to *reconstruct* the shape based on the core positions.  Even if the original structure is jumbled, the core position is what tells us the positions for corner-filling.\n\n**4. Considering Collision Rules**\n\nNow, I look at Test Input, and the interaction of a lot of shapes. I trace the path and what to do when rays intersect:\n\n*   For example, if two horizontal neighbors (say, S1 and S2) have overlapping or adjacent paths that \"squeeze,\" they will turn vertical at that point.\n*   For two vertical neighbors, they move towards each other, and if the path squeezes, or if they collide at a point, they run parallel vertically.\n\n**5. Applying the Rules**\n\nLet's apply these rules to the Test Input and define the paths of these rays as they travel through the grid. Let's see how each shape works, and how the rays go.\n\nSo, now I create a plan. I'm going to find the shapes, fill them, create the rays, and then resolve any collisions.\n\n\nThe transformation involves identifying \"gem\" structures, repairing them, and projecting \"rays\" from their corners.\n\n**1. Structure Identification & Repair**\n*   **Pattern:** Each structure is a 4x4 block. The inner 2x2 \"core\" determines the structure's color. The surrounding border is color 3 (green), but the 4 corners of the 4x4 block are \"open\" (initially background 8).\n*   **Repair:** Locate the 2x2 cores in the input. Reconstruct the 4x4 box around them. Fill the border with 3s. Crucially, **fill the 4 corners** of the 4x4 box with the **core color**.\n*   **Structures in Test Input:**\n    1.  **S1 (Red 2):** Core at rows 5-6, cols 4-5. Box rows 4-7, cols 3-6.\n    2.  **S2 (Yellow 4):** Core at rows 5-6, cols 15-16. Box rows 4-7, cols 14-17.\n    3.  **S3 (Magenta 6):** Core at rows 14-15, cols 23-24. Box rows 13-16, cols 22-25.\n    4.  **S4 (Orange 7):** Core at rows 20-21, cols 22-23. Box rows 19-22, cols 21-24.\n    5.  **S5 (Maroon 9):** Core at rows 25-26, cols 1-2. Box rows 24-27, cols 0-3.\n\n**2. Ray Projection**\n*   **Source:** Rays emanate from the 4 newly filled corners of each structure.\n*   **Direction:** Diagonal outwards (Top-Left corner $\\to$ Up-Left, Top-Right $\\to$ Up-Right, etc.).\n*   **Color:** Same as the core color.\n*   **Interaction Rules:**\n    *   **Crossing/Collision:** If two rays are on a collision course (either head-on or side-swipe where they would cross or occupy the same cell):\n        *   If they are approaching horizontally and become adjacent (distance 1) or collide, they turn **Vertical** and continue parallel (Up or Down depending on original vertical direction).\n        *   If they are approaching vertically (head-on) or diagonally into the same cell, they **Stop** before the collision.\n    *   **Shearing:** If rays pass each other diagonally on adjacent cells without claiming the same cell, they continue.\n\n**3. Applying Logic to Test Input**\n*   **S1 (Red 2) & S2 (Yellow 4) - Top Interaction:**\n    *   S1 Top-Right ray (Up-Right) and S2 Top-Left ray (Up-Left) converge.\n    *   At Row 1, they are at cols 9 and 11. They turn vertical to avoid collision at Row 0.\n    *   Result: (0,9) is 2, (0,11) is 4.\n*   **S1 (Red 2) & S2 (Yellow 4) - Bottom Interaction:**\n    *   S1 Bottom-Right ray (Down-Right) and S2 Bottom-Left ray (Down-Left) converge.\n    *   At Row 10, they are at cols 9 and 11. They turn vertical to avoid collision at Row 11.\n    *   They continue vertically down at cols 9 and 11 respectively.\n*   **S1 (Red 2) & S5 (Maroon 9) - Vertical Collision:**\n    *   S1's vertical ray (col 9) going down meets S5's Top-Right ray (diagonal Up-Right) coming up.\n    *   S5 TR path: (23,4)...(19,8). Next would be (18,9).\n    *   S1 vertical ray is at (18,9). Head-on collision. Both stop.\n    *   S5 TR ends at (19,8). S1 vertical ends at (17,9).\n*   **S2 (Yellow 4) & S3 (Magenta 6) - Shearing Pass:**\n    *   S2 Bottom-Right ray (Down-Right) and S3 Top-Left ray (Up-Left) pass each other.\n    *   They occupy adjacent diagonal cells (e.g., Row 12: S2@22, S3@21) but never the same cell. They continue to grid edges.\n*   **S3 (Magenta 6) & S4 (Orange 7) - Collision:**\n    *   S3 Bottom-Left ray (Down-Left) and S4 Top-Left ray (Up-Left) converge on (18,20).\n    *   S3 BL path: (16,22) $\\to$ (17,21). Next (18,20).\n    *   S4 TL path starts (19,21). Next (18,20).\n    *   They stop before collision. S3 ends at (17,21).

The goal is to figure out the underlying pattern, which, from what I can tell, involves extending lines or \"beams\" from those shapes. I'll need to meticulously examine the provided examples, starting with the first one, to deduce the transformation rules. My plan is to start by identifying all the unique shapes, map the colors, the way the pattern changes. I will then compare the input and output to work out what\u2019s being generated.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis: Shape Identification and Color Mapping:**\n\nI'm analyzing the 24x24 grid in the first example. The background is teal (8). I can see some distinct small shapes using non-teal colors. Starting to list the Shapes (Shape 1 - the shape at top-middle-ish, Shape 2 - to the right of Shape 1 and Shape 3 - to the right of Shape 2, Shape 4 - bottom-left).\n\n**Shape 1:** It's an \"Octagon,\" with the color pattern \"3,3; 3,9,9,3; 3,9,9,3; 3,3;\". I\u2019m using the color 9 (Maroon) inside and 3 (Green) for the border.\n\n**Shape 2:** This shape has the color 1 (Blue) inside and 3 (Green) for the border.\n\n**Shape 3:** This shape is tricky. The colors and structure are a bit mixed up or broken, maybe it\u2019s a diagonal.\n\n**Shape 4:** This one in the bottom left, is more straightforward. The pattern is \"3,3,3,3; 3,6,6,8; 3,6,6,3; 3,3,3,3;\u201d. The color 6 (Pink) for the interior and 3 (Green) for the border.\n\n**Output Pattern Discovery: Beams and Interactions:**\n\nNow I'll compare the inputs to the corresponding outputs. I notice that the 8s (background) are replaced with the colors related to those shapes, and that lines shoot out from the inside.\n\n**Shape 1 output is diagonal lines up-left and up-right.**\n\n**Shape 2 output shows vertical line in certain cols.**\n\nLet's look more carefully at the pattern to map the beams. I see a diagonal lines are extending, up and to the right from the upper-right corner. It seems the direction depends on the shape type, but for now I will try mapping it out.  I\u2019ll refer to it as \"beams.\"\n\nThe beams are diagonal going Top-Left (-1,-1) and Down-Left (+1,-1).\n\n**Deconstructing Beams: Detailed Analysis and Direction Determination:**\n\nFor the Maroon Shape, I'm observing and mapping out the beams. I'm taking the input and output values to try and see if I can figure out the beam direction.  I'm trying to figure out where those lines come from. I've narrowed it down to four corners, and now to which beam will be assigned a certain shape.\n\nMy analysis reveals:\n\n*   **Beams radiate from specific points**: It looks like beams emerge from corners of a frame around the colored core of the shape.\n*   **Collision Detection and Beam Interaction:** The more shapes that exist, the more likely a beam will interact with the shapes, the shapes are also beams. Beams seem to reflect or turn when close to one another! The rules I\u2019m defining will need to consider interactions between the various beams, and also the shapes themselves.\n*   **Beam Directions and Collision:** It is based on the orientation of the shape. I\u2019m starting to test and make sure everything is working the way I\u2019m imagining. If 2 beams are close, they change direction from diagonal to vertical? \n\nI am starting to organize the beams.\n\nI think the 2 beams will create a vertical line.\n\n**Generalizing the Rule:  Hole in Wall Theory (Algorithm Formulation):**\n\nLet\u2019s try to define the rules:\n\n*   **Shape Identification:** A shape consists of connected non-background pixels.\n*   **Core Identification:** Within each shape, the \"core\" is comprised of non-border color (I will ignore borders).\n*   **Emitter Determination:** A core cell is an \"emitter\" if it's adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to a background cell.\n*   **Beam Emission:** If an emitter exists, shoot a beam in the direction of the background cell (orthogonal or diagonal).\n*   **Beam Propagation:** Beam color is the core color.\n*   **Collision/Interaction:** If beams from different shapes\n\nThe transformation rule involves emitting \"beams\" of color from the \"core\" (interior color) of each object through \"holes\" (background color 8) in the object's border (color 3).\n\n**Step-by-Step Logic:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects and Cores**:\n    *   **Shape A (Red 2)**: Located at top-left. Core cells are at `(5,4), (5,5), (6,4), (6,5)`.\n    *   **Shape B (Yellow 4)**: Located at top-middle. Core cells are at `(5,15), (5,16), (6,15), (6,16)`.\n    *   **Shape C (Magenta 6)**: Located at middle-right. Core cells are at `(14,23), (14,24), (15,23), (15,24)`.\n    *   **Shape D (Orange 7)**: Located at bottom-right. Core cells are at `(20,22), (20,23), (21,22), (21,23)` (based on Input R20/21).

Problem Breakdown and Initial Analysis:**\n\nThe user is asking me to solve an ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) problem, a task that seems to involve identifying patterns in visual data and generating a corresponding output. My initial focus is on understanding the rules through careful analysis of provided examples and a test input. I immediately notice some repeating visual themes: a teal (8) background, green (3) outlines forming box-like structures, and objects with a defined inner color. The problem seems to be about how these inner colors are extended or modified based on the surrounding green barriers, and I start to hypothesize about \"gaps\" and \"flow\" of color.\n\n**2. Example-Driven Hypothesis Formulation:**\n\nI examine the first example meticulously. I observe that the \"green boxes\" aren't always perfect squares, but have corners open and act as barriers to the inner colour that is surrounded. The color extends from the inside to the gaps (the holes or missing corners) in the form of rays. I refine my understanding to say, \"The 'green' pixels form a barrier, and the inner color 'flows' out through any gaps in the barrier,\". I notice that the directions for the rays seem to be orthogonal (horizontal or vertical) or diagonal.\n\n**3. Hypotheses Testing and Rule Refinement:**\n\nI test this hypothesis with the first example's multiple objects, carefully analyzing each output. It confirms that the color flows from the inner block through gaps in the \"bounding box\" (defined by adjacent pixels) of '3', and that it's the absence of '3' that allows color to expand. I note that lines continue until they hit the grid edge or another barrier. This leads me to create a refined rule: for each cell of the inner colored block, check its eight neighbors (cardinal and diagonal). If the neighbor is '8' (background/hole) and the path is not blocked by a '3' (green wall), extend a line in that direction. The \"path\" is crucial, and it becomes the key for the diagonal directions as I continue to examine more examples and refine the direction to be consistent.\n\n**4. Expanding Complexity and Interaction Rules:**\n\nAnalyzing the second example introduces a more complex interaction. I find that a ray can \"squeeze\" through a diagonal corner even if the cardinal neighbors are blocked, expanding the rule to: if the immediate next cell in that direction is NOT a wall (3), continue the ray from the pixel in the inner block. I start thinking about the ray behavior. What happens when these rays meet or interact? I begin to suspect that their behaviour might include \"stopping\", \"bouncing\", or \"reflecting\". Analyzing output and re-evaluating the grid leads me to suspect that the lines cross or interact with one another. I start to think about the order or position of colors and how they may influence each other.\n\n**5.  The Critical Breakthrough: Identifying Core Transformation:**\n\nI encounter another crucial observation: Sometimes, the inner color and the green \"wall\" swap positions! This forces me to revisit my rules. I start to carefully examine all of the examples again and I formulate a new hypothesis: \"If the wall is complete, the color permeates the wall and they swap.\" I discover that there are two core behaviours: *sealed* and *leaky*, with different associated ray behaviours. Sealed is \"complete\" walls, leading to a swap, and diagonal-only rays. Leaky is \"incomplete\" walls, with cardinal or diagonal rays emerging through the gaps.\n\n**6. Formalizing the Algorithm and Key Steps:**\n\nThe next example helps me to confirm my algorithm, and I formulate it into specific steps. I'm now able to explain:\n\n1.  Identify the inner colour and the wall\n2.  Check for \"sealed\" vs. \"leaky\".\n3.  If sealed, swap and shoot diagonal rays from the new walls.\n4.  If leaky, no swap and shoot cardinal or diagonal rays through gaps.\n\nI add that rays stop at wall (3) or the edge. I make a detailed analysis of all the specific ray behaviours.\n\n**7.  Addressing the Test Input and Intersection Behaviour:**\n\nFinally, I reach the actual test input. I meticulously apply the rules and ray propagation logic.  I start to run into more complex interactions between rays, specifically how those rays that are diagonal interact with those that are vertical. Through extensive tracing of the grid and ray direction, I come to another realization about ray behavior: when rays of different colours come into adjacency vertically, they merge and continue down in the grid.\n\n**8.  Finalizing the Algorithm and Construction of the Solution:**\n\nI have now distilled the process into a set of well-defined steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Connected components of non-8, non-3 colors (Inner), 3s as the wall.\n2.  **Type Check:** Sealed\n\nThe solution involves simulating the \"flow\" of colored liquids from containers defined by green (3) walls.\n\n**Analysis of the Rules:**\n\n1.  **Objects:** The grid contains objects consisting of an inner rectangular block of color (not 3 or 8) surrounded by a \"wall\" of green (3) pixels.\n2.  **Sealed vs. Leaky:**\n    *   **Sealed:** If the inner color block is completely enclosed by green walls in the four cardinal directions (Top, Bottom, Left, Right), it is \"Sealed\".\n    *   **Leaky:** If there is a gap (an '8' or grid edge) in the immediate cardinal neighbors of the inner block, it is \"Leaky\".\n3.  **Transformation:**\n    *   **Sealed Objects:**\n        *   **Swap:** The inner color and the green wall swap roles. The green pixels become the inner color, and the inner pixels become green (or empty '8' in some interpretations, but here walls effectively turn into the source color).\n        *   **Flow:** Diagonal rays of the object's color are emitted from the corners of the new bounding box outwards.\n    *   **Leaky Objects:**\n        *   **No Swap:** The object retains its shape.\n        *   **Flow:** Rays of the inner color are emitted through any **gaps** in the wall.\n            *   **Cardinal Gaps:** If a cardinal neighbor is open, a straight line extends in that direction.\n            *   **Diagonal Gaps:** If a diagonal neighbor is open (and not blocked by the source block itself), a diagonal line extends in that direction.\n4.  **Ray Interaction:**\n    *   Rays travel until they hit the grid edge or another object.\n    *   **Merge/Drop:** If two rays of different colors moving generally downwards or sideways meet and become **horizontally adjacent**, they merge and travel **vertically down** side-by-side.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\nThe test input contains 5 \"Leaky\" objects. None are fully sealed.\n*   **Red (2) [Top-Left]:** Leaks Up (Col 5), Left (Row 6), and Diagonal SE (from corner 8,7).\n*   **Yellow (4) [Top-Right]:** Leaks Right (Row 6) and Down (Col 16).\n*   **Pink (6) [Mid-Right]:** Leaks Up (Col 24), Diagonal NE (from 14,26), and Diagonal SE (from 17,26).\n*   **Orange (7) [Bot-Right]:** Leaks Right (Row 21) and Diagonal SE (from 23,26).\n*   **Maroon (9) [Bot-Left]:** Leaks Up (Col 3) and Diagonal SE (from 28,4).\n\n**Interaction:**\n*   **Red SE & Yellow Down:** The Red diagonal ray (moving SE) meets the Yellow vertical ray (moving Down at Col 16).\n    *   Red path: Starts (8,7)... reaches (16,15).\n    *   Yellow path: Vertical at Col 16.\n    *   At Row 16, Red is at Col 15 and Yellow is at Col 16. They are adjacent.\n    *   Result: The Red ray turns vertical. From Row 16 downwards, we have a stripe of `2` at Col 15 and `4` at Col 16.\n\n**Final Ray Paths:**\n1.  **Maroon (9):** Up at Col 3. Diagonal SE from (28,4) to (29,5).\n2.  **Red (2):** Up at Col 5. Left at Row 6. Diagonal SE from (8,7) to (16,15), then Vertical Down at Col 15 (merging with Yellow).\n3.  **Yellow (4):** Right at Row 6. Vertical Down at Col 16.\n4.  **Pink (6):** Up at Col 24. Diagonal NE from (14,26). Diagonal SE from (17,26).\n5.  **Orange (7):** Right at Row 21. Diagonal SE from (23,26).\n\n**Output Generation:**\nOverlay these lines onto the input grid. At simple crossing points (like Red Left vs Maroon Up), one color overwrites the other (Maroon overwrites Red here).\n\n8,8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,9,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,3,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6\n7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,4,7,7,3,7,7,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,3,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n3,3,3,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 6>\n<CANDIDATE 7>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n889828888848888888888886888888\n889828888884888888888886888888\n889828888888488888888886888888\n889828888888848888888886888888\n889323388888884333888886888888\n229222388888883444444446444444\n889322388888883443888886888888\n889333288888883433888886888888\n889888828888888488888886888888\n889888882888888488888886888886\n889888888288888488888886888868\n889888888828888488888886888688\n889888888882888488888886886888\n889888888888288488888836368888\n889888888888828488888836638888\n889888888888882488888836638888\n889888888888888428888833368888\n889888888888888482888888886888\n889888888888888488288888888688\n889888888888888488828333388868\n889888888888888488882377777777\n889888888888888488888377388888\n889888888888888488888333788888\n889888888888888488888888878888\n339388888888888488888888887888\n399388888888888488888888888788\n399388888888888488888888888878\n333988888888888488888888888887\n888898888888888488888888888888\n888889888888888488888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_4_step_5_image\">\nLooking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1.

The core idea is to understand how these green shapes in the input grid influence the output, which seems to involve drawing lines or paths.**\n\n**First**, I'm trying to figure out the connection between the green shapes (the \"containers\" with color 3) and the colored pixels inside them. These colors act as \"payloads\" that will be used to generate the output. Examining the examples, I see that the shapes have different colors within their borders, and these internal colors seem to determine the color of the output lines.\n\n**Next**, I need to understand the output pattern. Based on the \"Test Input\" prompts I got from the user, the goal is to create connecting lines that extend to borders and form staircase-like diagonals. Each shape appears to act like a source or hub, with lines emanating from it.\n\n**The Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Identify the \"Ports\" or \"Entry points\":** Gaps or openings in the green borders of the shapes seem to be the most obvious starting points. In my reasoning, I am referring to those as \"Openings\" in the summary. Straight lines in the color of each shape's interior fill those openings.\n2.  **Corners:** If there are corners/missing border pixels, then they originate diagonal lines. The diagonals have 45 degree angle with respect to the shape.\n\n**This is what I learned from reviewing the examples given, with an emphasis on my observations:**\n\n*   In Example 1, the output had lines extending towards the edges of the grid.\n*   In Example 2, the lines followed a more rectangular pattern, like connections.\n*   In Example 3, there was a connection between multiple shapes.\n*   The hint on the staircase pattern led me to find \"diagonals\" and vertical connections.\n\n**Based on this, I'm forming the hypothesis:**\n\nEach shape has one or more ports where it connects to the background, in a sort of \"ray\" or path. Lines are created from the shapes, extending from those ports to connect to boundaries.\n\n**Now I'm looking for a way to model this and make the process algorithmic:**\n\n1.  First, the location of shapes is detected in the input, by their green borders.\n2.  Next, identify \"openings\" within that border by looking for missing pixels. The key here will be correctly transcribing coordinates and comparing pixels.\n3.  Each \"opening\" creates a ray, path or line, in one or more directions depending on the shape, the type of the opening and neighboring shapes or existing paths.\n4.  In the final step, these lines are generated in the output.\n\n**What I'm expecting is:**\n\nThe final output will be a grid with single-pixel-wide lines that connect or trace from each shape to the edges of the image or other shapes.\nI will draw them one by one. I will use the internal color to create the appropriate color in the output. I will manage color intersections by assuming all lines exist.\n\n**To implement this, I will:**\n\n1.  Scan the input grid to locate the green shapes.\n2.  Within each shape, detect the internal color (payload) and the openings in the green border.\n3.  For each shape, determine the \"ports\" and their associated directions.\n4.  Trace the lines in the corresponding color from each port, extending to the edges of the grid or the intersection of other lines.\n\nThis strategy will get the result, and that's the approach.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation follows these rules:\n\n1.  **Identify Containers**: The input consists of green (3) border shapes enclosing \"payload\" pixels of various colors.\n2.  **Identify Openings**:\n    *   **Missing Side**: If a side of the green border has a gap (replaced by background 8), a straight line of the payload color extends from that gap outwards to the grid edge.\n    *   **Missing Corner**: If a corner of the rectangular bounding box of the shape is missing its green border pixel, a diagonal line (staircase pattern) of the payload color extends from that corner outwards.\n3.  **Draw Paths**:\n    *   Paths stop at the grid boundaries.\n    *   Vertical/Horizontal lines are 1 pixel wide.\n    *   Diagonal lines are 1 pixel wide steps.\n    *   Where paths cross, one color takes precedence (the specific precedence isn't strictly defined by examples but standard layering applies; generally vertical lines or lines from \"lower\" shapes might overlay, or simple crossing).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Shape 1 (Color 2)** [Rows 4-7, Cols ~3-6]:\n    *   **Top Opening** at (4,4): Extends **Vertical Up** (Color 2) at Column 4.\n    *   **Left Opening** at (5,3): Extends **Horizontal Left** (Color 2) at Row 5.\n    *   **Missing BL Corner** at (7,3): Extends **Diagonal Down-Left** (Color 2) starting from (8,2).\n\n*   **Shape 2 (Color 4)** [Rows 4-7, Cols ~14-17]:\n    *   **Right Opening** at (5,17): Extends **Horizontal Right** (Color 4) at Row 5.\n    *   **Missing TR Corner** at (4,17): Extends **Diagonal Up-Right** (Color 4) starting from (3,18).\n    *   **Bottom Opening** at (7,15): Extends **Vertical Down** (Color 4) at Column 15.\n\n*   **Shape 3 (Color 6)** [Rows 13-16, Cols ~22-25]:\n    *   **Top Opening** at (13,23): Extends **Vertical Up** (Color 6) at Column 23.\n\n*   **Shape 4 (Color 7)** [Rows 19-22, Cols ~21-24]:\n    *   **Right Opening** at (20,24): Extends **Horizontal Right** (Color 7) at Row 20.\n    *   **Missing BR Corner** at (22,24): Extends **Diagonal Down-Right** (Color 7) starting from (23,25).\n\n*   **Shape 5 (Color 9)** [Rows 24-27, Cols ~0-3]:\n    *   **Top Opening** at (24,2): Extends **Vertical Up** (Color 9) at Column 2.\n    *   **Missing BR Corner** at (27,3): Extends **Diagonal Down-Right** (Color 9) starting from (28,4).\n\n**Completed Output

model_id=\"gemini-3-high_6_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\nAlright, here's my plan. The user wants me to solve an ARC task by analyzing examples and transforming an input grid based on \"Objects\" and their transformations. I need to figure out the rules of this transformation.\n\n**Here's the Breakdown:**\n1.  **Input:** A grid of numbers from 0 to 9.\n2.  **Output:** A transformed grid, same format.\n3.  **Key Hints:** \"Objects Description\" and \"Transformation Description.\"\n    *   **Background:** The value 8 seems important, kind of like an \"empty\" space.\n    *   **Objects:**  \"3-framed objects\" with inner filled shapes (like 2,4,6,7,9, or 1).\n    *   **The Transformation:** It's about finding gaps or missing pieces in the frames and then \"casting rays\" from those gaps.\n\n**My Approach:**\n1.  **Understand the Example Logic:** Carefully examine each example. My goal is to extract the \"recipe\".\n2.  **Verify the Rules:** Make a hypothesis based on hints, and examples, and then prove it with examples\n3.  **Test the Rules:** Apply what I've learned to the test input.\n\n**Diving into the Examples:**\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   There are shapes with corners that are essentially missing. The \"missing corners\" seem critical, as the \"gaps\" get filled in.\n    *   **Rays:**  After filling the gaps, rays shoot out. They can be diagonal, or orthogonal based on the shape of the object.\n    *   **Ray Interactions:**  If rays meet or hit, it gets interesting. Seems like they can stop, continue, or turn.\n\n    *   **Key Observations**: Rays stop at grid edges. This \"gap\" rule is consistent for all objects in Example 1\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   We have a \"missing\" corner that's not a corner like a square. It's a \"notch\" in the rectangle's corner.\n    *   Again, the gap is filled.\n    *   Rays shoot out (like orthogonal rays - up or right).\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Kind of a diamond/cross shape.\n    *   The gap is at the top where the diamond ends.\n    *   A Vertical ray goes upwards.\n\n**Hypothesis Refining:**\n*   **Shape Identification:** I need to identify the \"ideal shape\" of the 3-framed object. Usually, it's a Rectangle.\n*   **Gap Location:**  The missing pixels are the key to the transformation. Fill gaps.\n*   **Ray Directions:**\n    *   **Orthogonal Rays:** gaps at a straight side or edge.\n    *   **Diagonal Rays:** gaps at an indented/corner location.\n\n**Interactions:**\n*   **Rays Meeting:** I need to determine what happens when rays of different colors meet or are close together. Do they cross? Stop? Turn? What's the rule? It seems like orthogonal rays stop, and the existing color, has priority to establish. And the diagonal can pass through (Ex 1).\n\n**Applying to the Test Input:**\n\nI will identify the objects in the test input, analyze their shapes, locate gaps, and draw the rays according to my rules.\n\nLet's start!\n\n\nTo solve this task, we need to apply the transformation rules inferred from the examples to the test input.\n\n### Method Explanation\n\nThe transformation involves identifying objects (frames of color 3 with specific interior colors) and extending \"rays\" from any gaps in their outlines.\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all 3-framed objects in the grid. Note their interior color.\n    *   Object 1 (Top-Left): Frame 3, Interior 2 (Red).\n    *   Object 2 (Top-Right): Frame 3, Interior 4 (Yellow).\n    *   Object 3 (Bottom-Middle): Frame 3, Interior 6 (Pink).\n    *   Object 4 (Bottom-Right): Frame 3, Interior 7 (Orange).\n    *   Object 5 (Bottom-Left): Frame 3, Interior 9 (Maroon).\n\n2.  **Locate Gaps:** Find cells on the perimeter of these frames that are currently background color (8) but represent a \"missing\" piece of the frame (corners or wall segments).\n    *   **Obj 1 (Red):** Gaps at (4,4) [Top], (5,3) [Left], (7,6) [Bottom-Right Corner].\n    *   **Obj 2 (Yellow):** Gaps at (4,18) [Top-Right Corner], (5,18) [Right], (7,16) [Bottom].\n    *   **Obj 3 (Pink):** Gap at (13,23) [Top].\n    *   **Obj 4 (Orange):** Gaps at (20,24) [Right], (22,24) [Bottom-Right Corner].\n    *   **Obj 5 (Maroon):** Gaps at (24,2) [Top], (27,3) [Bottom-Right Corner].\n\n3.  **Fill Gaps:** Recolor the gap cells with the object's interior color.\n\n4.  **Cast Rays:** Extend 1-cell-thick rays from the filled gaps in the direction implied by the gap (outward from the center or extending the line).\n    *   **Ray 2 (Up):** From (4,4) upwards.\n    *   **Ray 2 (Left):** From (5,3) leftwards.\n    *   **Ray 2 (Diag DR):** From (7,6) diagonally down-right.\n    *   **Ray 4 (Diag UR):** From (4,18) diagonally up-right.\n    *   **Ray 4 (Right):** From (5,18) rightwards.\n    *   **Ray 4 (Down):** From (7,16) downwards.\n    *   **Ray 6 (Up):** From (13,23) upwards.\n    *   **Ray 7 (Right):** From (20,24) rightwards.\n    *   **Ray 7 (Diag DR):** From (22,24) diagonally down-right.\n    *   **Ray 9 (Up):** From (24,2) upwards.\n    *   **Ray 9 (Diag DR):** From (27,3) diagonally down-right.\n\n5.  **Handle Interactions:**\n    *   **Ray 9 (Up) vs Ray 2 (Left):** Intersect at (5,2). Ray 2 travels a shorter distance (1 step) compared to Ray 9 (19 steps). Ray 2 claims the cell. Ray 9 stops at (6,2).\n    *   **Ray 6 (Up) vs Ray 4 (Right):** Intersect at (5,23). Ray 4 travels a shorter distance (5 steps) compared to Ray 6 (8 steps). Ray 4 claims the cell. Ray 6 stops at (6,23).\n    *   **Ray 2 (Diag) vs Ray 4 (Down):** Intersect at (17,16). Both continue (diagonal rays pass through).\n\n### Output Grid Generation\n\nThe final grid is constructed by applying these rays to the input grid.\n\n*   **Ray 2 Up:** (0,4) to (3,4) become 2.\n*   **Ray 2 Left:** (5,0) to (5,2) become 2. (Blocks Ray 9).\n*   **Ray 2 Diag:** (8,7), (9,8)... down to edge become 2.\n*   **Ray 4 Diag:** (3,19), (2,20)... up to edge become 4.\n*   **Ray 4 Right:** (5,19) to edge become 4. (Blocks Ray 6).\n*   **Ray 4 Down:** (8,16) to edge become 4.\n*   **Ray 6 Up:** (6,23) to (12,23) become 6. (Stops before row 5).\n*   **Ray 7 Right:** (20,25) to edge become 7.\n*   **Ray 7 Diag:** (23,25), (24,26)... to edge become 7.\n*   **Ray 9 Up:** (6,2) to (23,2) become 9. (Stops before row 5).\n*   **Ray 9 Diag:** (28,4), (29,5) become 9.\n\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n</CANDIDATE 10>\n<CANDIDATE 11>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 30x30\n888828888848888888888888888888\n888828888884888888888888888888\n888828888888488888888888888888\n888828888888848888888888888888\n888323388888884333888888888888\n222222388888883444444444444444\n889322388888883443888886888888\n889333888888883433888886888888\n889888888888888488888886888888\n889888888888888488888886888886\n889888888888888488888886888868\n889888888888888488888886888688\n889888888888888488888886886888\n889888888888888488888836368888\n889888888888888488888836638888\n889888888888888488888836638888\n889888888888888488888833368888\n889888888888888488888888886888\n889888888888888488888888888688\n889888888888888488888333388868\n889888888888888488888377777777\n889888888888888488888377388888\n889888888888888488888333788888\n889888888888888488888888878888\n339388888888888488888888887888\n399388888888888488888888888788\n399388888888888488888888888878\n333988888888888488888888888887\n888898888888888488888888888888\n888889888888888488888888888888\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_6_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\nLooking at this problem, I need to:\n1.

The core is all about these grids with colored 'objects' inside. The real trick lies in the green frames \u2013 these have gaps, and the inner color \"rays\" shoot out from those gaps. The gaps' positions and shapes (straight edges or corners) dictate if those rays go orthogonal or diagonal. The interesting bit is how the rays interact when they intersect. Sometimes they stop, other times it looks like they deflect. My job is to see if each candidate's logic and the resulting grid patterns align with the way these rays should behave according to the input examples.\n\nMy strategy involves checking specific ray \"emissions\" from these objects. I'm focusing on those rays generated in the 'test input'. The key rays: the red object, the yellow object, the magenta, the orange, and the maroon ones. For example, I need to make sure the red shape creates a left ray and a diagonal one going down-right as described. The same goes for the others, with attention on their direction.\n\nNext, I need to pay close attention to the way the rays intersect. Will they just merge or stop at a point of intersection? Let's check some intersections and see how they are implemented. My main concern will be whether candidates predict a correct implementation of the \"Stopping\" feature from example 3.\n\n**Auditing the Candidates**\n\nFor Candidate 0, it seems to have some physics-based rules (deflections). But this is inconsistent with the behavior, especially in Example 3, where lines just stop when they meet. In addition, the predicted grid seems to not be correct. So this is wrong.\n\nCandidate 1 seems to follow a simple \"overwrite\" logic (one color replaces another). This is not really bad, but isn't as good as other models implementing a stopping rule. In fact, Candidate 1 seems to be incorrectly implementing geometry from the original example.\n\nCandidate 2 is based on a very specific rule \u2013 rays turn vertical when they cross. This behavior isn't supported by the input, so it's probably hallucinated.\n\nCandidate 3 and 5 are similar to candidate 1, but implemented better. This also looks like it has logic error and inconsistent performance.\n\nCandidates 4's rules rely on hallucinated physics, so I dismissed it immediately.\n\nFor candidate 5, it seems to be missing diagonal rays. The logic seems similar to 3, with some layering, but that doesn't actually match how rays form at corners. The code also got geometry wrong, and missed some important corner cases.\n\nCandidate 8 gets the yellow gap right, but messes up the red one. The logic, even though it seems correct, also fails on the same problem as Candidate 1.\n\nCandidate 9 has a bad case of the 14-syndrome \u2013 the dreaded hallucination where the location of a gap is incorrectly observed. Bad input observation!\n\nCandidate 10 seems to correctly identify all gaps, but messes up with yellow gap, and puts the position at (4,18).\n\n**Finding a Winner**\n\nOkay, so I have to weigh the candidates. I'm looking for a solid logic and correct execution. Most of the candidates have some problems with the gap locations and intersections.\n\nCandidate 10's logic seems to be a reasonable interpretation of Example 3 with the \"Stopping\" behavior. Even if the gap coordinates has an error (18 vs 17), the underlying stopping logic is spot on.\n\nI would have to say that, after all the analysis, **Candidate 10** is the strongest. The error in gap location, while concerning, is far less damaging to the logic than the physics hallucinations or crossing behavior. It implements the key behavior (stopping) shown in the example which makes it the winner!\n\n\n<AUDIT_LOG>\n### PHASE 1: LOGIC SELECTION & CRYSTALLIZATION\n\n**Candidate 0:**\n- Logic: \"Project diagonal rays... If two rays intersect... deflect... or swap.\"\n- Algorithm: IF Ray A meets Ray B, THEN deflect 45 degrees or swap behaviors.\n\n**Candidate 1:**\n- Logic: \"Extend lines... Fill each gap\". No mention of interaction rules implies simple overwriting.\n- Algorithm: IF Gap, THEN project ray. IF Ray meets existing pixel, OVERWRITE (implicit).\n\n**Candidate 6 / 10:** (Note: They share very similar logic text)\n- Logic: \"Extend rays... Intersect... Ray traveling shorter distance claims cell... Other ray stops.\"\n- Algorithm: IF Ray A meets Ray B, THEN (IF dist(A) < dist(B) THEN A continues, B stops).\n\n**Candidate 8:**\n- Logic: \"One color takes precedence (standard layering)\".\n- Algorithm: IF Ray A meets Ray B, THEN Overwrite/Cross.\n\n**Candidate 11:**\n- Logic: \"Stops... blocked by object\".\n- Algorithm: IF Ray meets Object/Ray, THEN Stop.\n\n### PHASE 2: THE GROUND TRUTH AUDIT\n\n**Target Rule:** Intersection Behavior.\n- **Example 3 Analysis:**\n    - Input: A green/orange structure (7) on the right emits horizontal rays to the left.\n    - Input: A vertical green/yellow structure (4) exists on the left.\n    - Observation: The Orange (7) rays hit the Yellow/Green structure and **STOP**. They do not cross. They do not bounce.\n- **Verdict:**\n    - **Candidate 0 (Deflect):** FAIL. Rays should stop, not bounce.\n    - **Candidate 1, 8 (Overwrite/Cross):** FAIL. Rays should stop, not cross.\n    - **Candidate 6, 10, 11 (Stop):** PASS. Logic matches Ex 3.\n\n**Secondary Target Rule:** Diagonal Gap Identification.\n- **Test Input Analysis (Yellow Shape, Top Right):**\n    - The shape is bounded by cols 14-17.\n    - Row 4 contains `3 4 4 8` at indices 14-17.\n    - Index 17 is `8` (Background). Index 14 is `3` (Wall).\n    - **Fact:** The gap is at (4,17).\n    - **Candidate 1, 5, 7, 9, 11:** Identify gap at (4,14). **Observation Error.**\n    - **Candidate 6, 10:** Identify gap at (4,18). **Minor Observation Error (Off-by-one).**\n    - **Candidate 8:** Identifies gap at (4,17). **Correct.**\n\n### PHASE 3: EXECUTION CONSISTENCY\n\n**Focusing on \"Stopping\" Candidates (6, 10, 11):**\n\n- **Candidate 6:**\n    - Logic says: \"Ray 9 stops at (6,2).\"\n    - Grid shows: Ray 9 (Col 2) extending all the way to Row 0.\n    - Verdict: **INTERNAL CONTRADICTION.**\n\n- **Candidate 11:**\n    - Logic says: \"Gap at (7,6)... diagonal DOWN-RIGHT\".\n    - Grid shows: Row 8 `...888...`. No diagonal ray of 2s.\n    - Verdict: **INTERNAL CONTRADICTION.**\n\n- **Candidate 10:**\n    - Logic says: \"Ray 9 stops at (6,2).\"\n    - Grid shows: Ray 9 stops correctly (Row 5 is 2s, Row 6 is 9s).\n    - Logic says: \"Ray 6 stops at (6,23).\"\n    - Grid shows: Ray 6 stops correctly.\n    - **Gap Error Check:** Logic says Gap at (4,18). Grid starts ray at (4,18). This leaves a 1-pixel gap from the object (ends at 17).\n    - Verdict: **CONSISTENT** (Grid matches Logic, even though Logic has a coordinate error).\n\n### PHASE 4: STACK RANKING\n\n1.  **Candidate 10 (Silver):** It is the *only* candidate that correctly derived the \"Stopping\" rule from Example 3 AND executed it consistently in the grid. While it has an off-by-one error on the Yellow shape's gap coordinate (18 vs 17), its fundamental logic is superior to the \"Crossing\" and \"Bouncing\" candidates.\n2.  **Candidate 8 (Bronze):** Identified the Yellow gap correctly (17), but hallucinated the Red gap location (7,3 instead of 7,6) and used \"Crossing\" logic which fails Ex 3.\n3.  **Candidate 11 (Bronze):** Derived \"Stopping\" logic but failed to draw the Red diagonal ray.\n4.  **Candidate 6 (Invalid):** Derived \"Stopping\" logic but drew the grid as if Rays crossed (Internal Contradiction).\n5.  **Candidates 0, 4 (Invalid):** Hallucinated physics (Bouncing) not present in examples.\n6.  **Candidates 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9 (Invalid):** Observation errors (Gap 14) and Crossing logic.\n\n</AUDIT_LOG>\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 10,\n      \"score\": 8.5,\n      \"tier\": \"SILVER\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Correctly identifies that rays must STOP upon intersection (based on Ex 3), unlike most candidates that assume crossing or bouncing.

<CANDIDATE id=\"0\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_1_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**My Process for Solving the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm thinking about this ARC task. The goal is to figure out the rule that transforms an input grid into an output grid, and then apply that rule to a test input. I'm taking a very structured approach.\n\n**1. Pattern Recognition & Hypothesis Generation**\n\n*   **Analyze Input/Output Pairs:** My initial step is to carefully examine the sample input-output pairs. I'm focusing on identifying the relationship between the shapes, their colors, and how those colors are mapped in the output. I'm looking for consistent transformations.\n*   **Initial Hypothesis:** It looks like some kind of projection or \"ray casting\" is at play. The internal colors of shapes seem to be \"projected\" outwards, but the directions and what \"blocks\" them is a mystery.\n*   **Digging Deeper:** I'm starting to think about containers or \"walls\" around the colored shapes. The green (3) pixels seem to define the boundaries of something, and the colors *inside* those boundaries are the things that get projected.\n*   **Gap Hypothesis:** I'm seeing gaps within the \"walls\" (meaning where there isn't a continuous border) and that the gaps seem to determine the *direction* of projection.\n*   **Refining the Hypothesis:** Looking at Example 2, the idea solidifies. Gaps in the 3's wall around the 4-colored shape clearly indicate the direction to project the 4 color. The output follows the gaps. I'm working with the idea of inner pixels of a color emitting rays. If a neighbor in a specific direction is not wall-color *or* the same color, there's a gap for a ray to form.\n*   **Formalize the Rules** Let me be sure to state my rule explicitly. I'm starting to formalize the rule:\n    1.  I identify shapes by looking for regions of a single color enclosed by the wall color 3.\n    2.  For each inner pixel, I check its 8 neighbors. If a neighbor isn't wall color and isn't the inner pixel's color, there's a gap in that direction.\n    3.  If there's a gap, project the inner color in that direction until you hit the edge of the grid.\n\n**2. Testing and Refinement**\n\n*   **Testing Hypothesis:** I test the hypothesis with the sample examples. I'm working to confirm that it correctly predicts the output for all the given examples. I am also working to find counter-examples.\n*   **Example 4 Check** This checks my edge cases. My diagonal check seems correct.\n*   **Double-Check and Modify:** If the hypothesis doesn't fully explain the behavior, I modify it.\n    *   I realized the *absence* of wall pixels defines the gap where a ray should be projected.\n    *   Diagonal rays require both cardinals to be wall, to make sure the diagonal is a true gap.\n*   **Diagonal Refinement:** I worked on diagonal gaps.\n\n**3.  Handling Edge Cases & Intersections**\n\n*   **Intersection Logic:** Now I need to consider what happens when rays cross.  I suspect that rays might just pass through each other, or perhaps they block one another.  I need to add the correct rules for \"intersections.\" Ex 3 helped. They bounce off each other, forming a perpendicular with a diagonal ray from the original direction.\n*   **Priority Rules:** Given that, I look to see the correct rule for deflection. The bisector of the two rays is the direction the rays turn.\n\n**4.  Applying the Rules to the Test Input**\n\n*   **Test Input Analysis:** After working out the rules, I turn my attention to the test input. I'll need to go through the grid, identify all the shapes, gaps, and ray paths and trace the projected rays.\n*   **Building the Grid:** I start with a blank grid and mark the known walls and shapes and I'm ready to apply my raycasting logic.\n*   **Output Assembly:** Finally, I'll generate the output grid as a string of the output.\n\nI think I've got this. I am now proceeding to step 4!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to identify shapes containing a specific color, enclosed by a border of color 3 (Green). The transformation involves projecting the inner color outwards from the shape in specific directions. The directions are determined by \"gaps\" or openings in the enclosure.\n\n**Transformation Rules:**\n1.  **Identify Shapes:** Locate regions of a color $C$ ($C \\ne 8$) enclosed by walls of color 3.\n2.  **Determine Rays:** For each pixel of the inner color $C$:\n    *   **Cardinal Directions (Up, Down, Left, Right):** Check the immediate neighbor. If the neighbor is not a Wall (3) and not the inner color $C$, it is considered a \"Cardinal Gap\". Emit a ray of color $C$ in that direction.\n    *   **Diagonal Directions (NW, NE, SW, SE):** Check the diagonal neighbor. If the diagonal neighbor is \"Open\" (not Wall, not $C$) AND the two adjacent cardinal neighbors (e.g., for NE, the N and E neighbors) are BOTH Walls (3), then it is a \"Diagonal Gap\". Emit a ray of color $C$ in that direction.\n3.  **Ray Propagation:** Rays travel in a straight line, changing background pixels (8) to color $C$.\n4.  **Ray Interactions:**\n    *   **Collision:** If two rays intersect at a specific cell, the rays stop at the cell before the intersection. The intersection cell remains background (8).\n    *   **Deflection:** Upon collision, the rays deflect.\n        *   If the collision is perpendicular (e.g., Horizontal vs Vertical), the rays deflect by 45 degrees into the \"bisecting\" diagonal direction relative to their incoming paths. (e.g., East + North -> North-East).\n        *   If the collision is acute (e.g., Diagonal vs Vertical), the rays \"swap\" behaviors (e.g., Diagonal becomes Vertical, Vertical becomes Diagonal).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Shape 1 (Color 2, Red):**\n    *   Location: ~Row 5, Col 4.\n    *   **Up Ray:** From (5,4) through gap at (4,4).\n    *   **Left Ray:** From (5,4) through gap at (5,3).\n    *   **Diagonal DR Ray:** From (6,5) through gap at (7,6).\n*   **Shape 2 (Color 4, Yellow):**\n    *   Location: ~Row 5, Col 16.\n    *   **Right Ray:** From (5,16) through gap at (5,17).\n    *   **Down Ray:** From (6,15) through gap at (7,15).\n    *   **Diagonal UL Ray:** From (5,15) through gap at (4,14).\n*   **Shape 3 (Color 6, Magenta):**\n    *   Location: ~Row 14, Col 23.\n    *   **Up Ray:** From (14,23) through gap at (13,23).\n    *   **Diagonal UR Ray:** From (14,24) through gap at (13,25).\n    *   **Diagonal DR Ray:** From (15,24) through gap at (16,25).\n*   **Shape 4 (Color 7, Orange):**\n    *   Location: ~Row 20, Col 22.\n    *   **Right Ray:** From (20,23) through gap at (20,24).\n    *   **Diagonal DR Ray:** From (21,23) through gap at (22,24).\n*   **Shape 5 (Color 9, Maroon):**\n    *   Location: ~Row 25, Col 1.\n    *   **Up Ray:** From (25,2) through gap at (24,2).\n    *   **Diagonal DR Ray:** From (26,2) through gap at (27,3).\n\n**Intersections & Deflections:**\n1.  **Intersection at (5,2):** Ray 2 (Left) meets Ray 9 (Up).\n    *   (5,2) remains 8.\n    *   Ray 2 deflects North-West (from 4,2).\n    *   Ray 9 deflects North-West (from 5,1).\n2.  **Intersection at (5,23):** Ray 4 (Right) meets Ray 6 (Up).\n    *   (5,23) remains 8.\n    *   Ray 4 deflects North-East (from 4,23).\n    *   Ray 6 deflects North-East (from 5,24).\n3.  **Intersection at (16,15):** Ray 2 (Diagonal SE) meets Ray 4 (Vertical Down).\n    *   (16,15) remains 8.\n    *   Ray 2 (Diagonal) becomes Vertical Down (Color 2).\n    *   Ray 4 (Vertical) becomes Diagonal South-East (Color 4).\n4.  **Intersection at (20,29):** Ray 6 (Diagonal SE) meets Ray 7 (Right). Both end at edge. Cell (20,29) set to 7.\n\n**Final Grid Generation:** The grid is filled based on the calculated ray paths and deflections.\n\noutput:\n2,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8\n2,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8\n8,2,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8\n9,8,2,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8,8\n8,9,8,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      2,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8\n      2,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8\n      8,2,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8\n      9,8,2,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,9,8,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,7,8,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,7,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,7,8\n      3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,7\n      8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"1\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_1_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at this problem, I need to identify shapes with 3-colored borders containing a 2x2 colored center, find gaps in the borders, and extend lines from those gaps.\n\n**Identifying shapes and their gaps:**\n\n1. **Shape 1 (2s)** at rows 4-7, cols 3-6:\n   -

Analyzing the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task, and it seems I need to figure out the transformation rules applied to input grids to generate output grids. My initial thought process involves breaking down the examples and identifying patterns.\n\n**2. Breaking Down Example 1**\n\nFirst up, Example 1. It's got a big grid filled with teal (8s) except for a few distinct structures outlined in green (3s).  These green outlines surround what I'm calling \"gems.\" Each gem has a core of a specific color and a 2x2 shape. The first gem has a maroon core (9).  I notice these gems are sort of diamond or octagon-shaped. Let's trace their positions and the colors inside.\n\nOkay, so the output... the background remains teal.  Hmm, the gems seem to have *moved*? No, wait... they're still there, but changed! I see diagonal rays or beams coming from the *centers* of these shapes. The output has these colored lines pointing to/from locations. It's a projection problem! I examine the gems closely. The corners of the shapes are filled with the core color (9).\n\nSo, the first step is to fill in the missing corners to make the shape into 4x4 squares. The shape is now:\n\n```\nC B B C\nB C C B\nB C C B\nC B B C\n```\n\nwhere C is the central color and B is the border.  Then, from the corners of this 4x4 box, I need to project a ray of color out from the corners.  Tracing these rays, I realize the main rule is \"project diagonal rays outwards from the corners.\"\n\nOkay, let's verify.  The output shows diagonal lines extending outwards.  Let's look at colors. The outputs show a pattern with the colors. Okay, great, so the diagonal lines extend upwards and left, right.\n\nBut what if these rays intersect? I check the output at the crossing points. This is where it gets interesting... The colors look like they \"bounce\" or swap.\nThis helps explain what happens when the rays run into each other (S1 and S2)... the paths shift to vertical. Okay, so when rays cross or hit an object, they stop at the boundary, and otherwise change to run vertically.\n\n**3. Refining the Hypothesis**\n\nOkay, let's summarize:\n\n1.  We have 4x4 shapes composed of a core and border.\n2.  Fill in the corners to create a solid square with core color.\n3.  Project diagonal rays from the corners of the shape.\n4.  When rays intersect, they turn vertical.\n\nLet's test this with other examples. Example 2 seems simple. The shapes are \"broken\" - the shapes have noise in the output. The broken shape is \"repaired\".  It turns out this is because we need to *reconstruct* the shape based on the core positions.  Even if the original structure is jumbled, the core position is what tells us the positions for corner-filling.\n\n**4. Considering Collision Rules**\n\nNow, I look at Test Input, and the interaction of a lot of shapes. I trace the path and what to do when rays intersect:\n\n*   For example, if two horizontal neighbors (say, S1 and S2) have overlapping or adjacent paths that \"squeeze,\" they will turn vertical at that point.\n*   For two vertical neighbors, they move towards each other, and if the path squeezes, or if they collide at a point, they run parallel vertically.\n\n**5. Applying the Rules**\n\nLet's apply these rules to the Test Input and define the paths of these rays as they travel through the grid. Let's see how each shape works, and how the rays go.\n\nSo, now I create a plan. I'm going to find the shapes, fill them, create the rays, and then resolve any collisions.\n\n\nThe transformation involves identifying \"gem\" structures, repairing them, and projecting \"rays\" from their corners.\n\n**1. Structure Identification & Repair**\n*   **Pattern:** Each structure is a 4x4 block. The inner 2x2 \"core\" determines the structure's color. The surrounding border is color 3 (green), but the 4 corners of the 4x4 block are \"open\" (initially background 8).\n*   **Repair:** Locate the 2x2 cores in the input. Reconstruct the 4x4 box around them. Fill the border with 3s. Crucially, **fill the 4 corners** of the 4x4 box with the **core color**.\n*   **Structures in Test Input:**\n    1.  **S1 (Red 2):** Core at rows 5-6, cols 4-5. Box rows 4-7, cols 3-6.\n    2.  **S2 (Yellow 4):** Core at rows 5-6, cols 15-16. Box rows 4-7, cols 14-17.\n    3.  **S3 (Magenta 6):** Core at rows 14-15, cols 23-24. Box rows 13-16, cols 22-25.\n    4.  **S4 (Orange 7):** Core at rows 20-21, cols 22-23. Box rows 19-22, cols 21-24.\n    5.  **S5 (Maroon 9):** Core at rows 25-26, cols 1-2. Box rows 24-27, cols 0-3.\n\n**2. Ray Projection**\n*   **Source:** Rays emanate from the 4 newly filled corners of each structure.\n*   **Direction:** Diagonal outwards (Top-Left corner $\\to$ Up-Left, Top-Right $\\to$ Up-Right, etc.).\n*   **Color:** Same as the core color.\n*   **Interaction Rules:**\n    *   **Crossing/Collision:** If two rays are on a collision course (either head-on or side-swipe where they would cross or occupy the same cell):\n        *   If they are approaching horizontally and become adjacent (distance 1) or collide, they turn **Vertical** and continue parallel (Up or Down depending on original vertical direction).\n        *   If they are approaching vertically (head-on) or diagonally into the same cell, they **Stop** before the collision.\n    *   **Shearing:** If rays pass each other diagonally on adjacent cells without claiming the same cell, they continue.\n\n**3. Applying Logic to Test Input**\n*   **S1 (Red 2) & S2 (Yellow 4) - Top Interaction:**\n    *   S1 Top-Right ray (Up-Right) and S2 Top-Left ray (Up-Left) converge.\n    *   At Row 1, they are at cols 9 and 11. They turn vertical to avoid collision at Row 0.\n    *   Result: (0,9) is 2, (0,11) is 4.\n*   **S1 (Red 2) & S2 (Yellow 4) - Bottom Interaction:**\n    *   S1 Bottom-Right ray (Down-Right) and S2 Bottom-Left ray (Down-Left) converge.\n    *   At Row 10, they are at cols 9 and 11. They turn vertical to avoid collision at Row 11.\n    *   They continue vertically down at cols 9 and 11 respectively.\n*   **S1 (Red 2) & S5 (Maroon 9) - Vertical Collision:**\n    *   S1's vertical ray (col 9) going down meets S5's Top-Right ray (diagonal Up-Right) coming up.\n    *   S5 TR path: (23,4)...(19,8). Next would be (18,9).\n    *   S1 vertical ray is at (18,9). Head-on collision. Both stop.\n    *   S5 TR ends at (19,8). S1 vertical ends at (17,9).\n*   **S2 (Yellow 4) & S3 (Magenta 6) - Shearing Pass:**\n    *   S2 Bottom-Right ray (Down-Right) and S3 Top-Left ray (Up-Left) pass each other.\n    *   They occupy adjacent diagonal cells (e.g., Row 12: S2@22, S3@21) but never the same cell.

model_id=\"gemini-3-high_3_step_5_deep_thinking\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Initial Thoughts and Problem Decomposition:**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I need to transform input grids based on colored shapes. The goal is to figure out the underlying pattern, which, from what I can tell, involves extending lines or \"beams\" from those shapes. I'll need to meticulously examine the provided examples, starting with the first one, to deduce the transformation rules. My plan is to start by identifying all the unique shapes, map the colors, the way the pattern changes. I will then compare the input and output to work out what\u2019s being generated.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis: Shape Identification and Color Mapping:**\n\nI'm analyzing the 24x24 grid in the first example. The background is teal (8). I can see some distinct small shapes using non-teal colors. Starting to list the Shapes (Shape 1 - the shape at top-middle-ish, Shape 2 - to the right of Shape 1 and Shape 3 - to the right of Shape 2, Shape 4 - bottom-left).\n\n**Shape 1:** It's an \"Octagon,\" with the color pattern \"3,3; 3,9,9,3; 3,9,9,3; 3,3;\". I\u2019m using the color 9 (Maroon) inside and 3 (Green) for the border.\n\n**Shape 2:** This shape has the color 1 (Blue) inside and 3 (Green) for the border.\n\n**Shape 3:** This shape is tricky. The colors and structure are a bit mixed up or broken, maybe it\u2019s a diagonal.\n\n**Shape 4:** This one in the bottom left, is more straightforward. The pattern is \"3,3,3,3; 3,6,6,8; 3,6,6,3; 3,3,3,3;\u201d. The color 6 (Pink) for the interior and 3 (Green) for the border.\n\n**Output Pattern Discovery: Beams and Interactions:**\n\nNow I'll compare the inputs to the corresponding outputs. I notice that the 8s (background) are replaced with the colors related to those shapes, and that lines shoot out from the inside.\n\n**Shape 1 output is diagonal lines up-left and up-right.**\n\n**Shape 2 output shows vertical line in certain cols.**\n\nLet's look more carefully at the pattern to map the beams. I see a diagonal lines are extending, up and to the right from the upper-right corner. It seems the direction depends on the shape type, but for now I will try mapping it out.  I\u2019ll refer to it as \"beams.\"\n\nThe beams are diagonal going Top-Left (-1,-1) and Down-Left (+1,-1).\n\n**Deconstructing Beams: Detailed Analysis and Direction Determination:**\n\nFor the Maroon Shape, I'm observing and mapping out the beams. I'm taking the input and output values to try and see if I can figure out the beam direction.  I'm trying to figure out where those lines come from. I've narrowed it down to four corners, and now to which beam will be assigned a certain shape.\n\nMy analysis reveals:\n\n*   **Beams radiate from specific points**: It looks like beams emerge from corners of a frame around the colored core of the shape.\n*   **Collision Detection and Beam Interaction:** The more shapes that exist, the more likely a beam will interact with the shapes, the shapes are also beams. Beams seem to reflect or turn when close to one another! The rules I\u2019m defining will need to consider interactions between the various beams, and also the shapes themselves.\n*   **Beam Directions and Collision:** It is based on the orientation of the shape. I\u2019m starting to test and make sure everything is working the way I\u2019m imagining. If 2 beams are close, they change direction from diagonal to vertical? \n\nI am starting to organize the beams.\n\nI think the 2 beams will create a vertical line.\n\n**Generalizing the Rule:  Hole in Wall Theory (Algorithm Formulation):**\n\nLet\u2019s try to define the rules:\n\n*   **Shape Identification:** A shape consists of connected non-background pixels.\n*   **Core Identification:** Within each shape, the \"core\" is comprised of non-border color (I will ignore borders).\n*   **Emitter Determination:** A core cell is an \"emitter\" if it's adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to a background cell.\n*   **Beam Emission:** If an emitter exists, shoot a beam in the direction of the background cell (orthogonal or diagonal).\n*   **Beam Propagation:** Beam color is the core color.\n*   **Collision/Interaction:** If beams from different shapes\n\nThe transformation rule involves emitting \"beams\" of color from the \"core\" (interior color) of each object through \"holes\" (background color 8) in the object's border (color 3).\n\n**Step-by-Step Logic:**\n\n1.  **Identify Objects and Cores**:\n    *   **Shape A (Red 2)**: Located at top-left. Core cells are at `(5,4), (5,5), (6,4), (6,5)`.\n    *   **Shape B (Yellow 4)**: Located at top-middle. Core cells are at `(5,15), (5,16), (6,15), (6,16)`.\n    *   **Shape C (Magenta 6)**: Located at middle-right. Core cells are at `(14,23), (14,24), (15,23), (15,24)`.\n    *   **Shape D (Orange 7)**: Located at bottom-right. Core cells are at `(20,22), (20,23), (21,22), (21,23)` (based on Input R20/21). Note: Input R20 shows `3,7,7,8` at cols 21-24 implies core is `(20,22),(20,23)`.\n    *   **Shape E (Maroon 9)**: Located at bottom-left. Core cells are at `(25,1), (25,2), (26,1), (26,2)`.\n\n2.  **Identify Emitters (Holes)**:\n    For each core cell, check its immediate neighbors (orthogonal) for the background color (8). If found, a beam shoots out in that direction.\n    *   **Red (2)**:\n        *   Core `(5,4)` has Left neighbor `(5,3)` as 8. **Beam Left**.\n        *   Core `(5,4)` (or adjacent core/border gap) has Top neighbor `(4,4)` as 8. **Beam Up**.\n    *   **Yellow (4)**:\n        *   Core `(5,16)` has Right neighbor `(5,17)` as 8. **Beam Right**.\n        *   Core `(6,15)` has Bottom neighbor `(7,15)` as 8. **Beam Down**.\n    *   **Magenta (6)**:\n        *   Core `(14,23)` has Top neighbor `(13,23)` as 8. **Beam Up**.\n    *   **Orange (7)**:\n        *   Core `(20,23)` has Right neighbor `(20,24)` as 8. **Beam Right**.\n    *   **Maroon (9)**:\n        *   Core `(25,2)` has Top neighbor `(24,2)` as 8. **Beam Up**.\n\n3.  **Trace Beams and Handle Collisions**:\n    Beams travel in straight lines. If two beams moving roughly perpendicularly intersect, they deflect diagonally away from each other to avoid crossing.\n    *   **Collision 1 (Red Left vs Maroon Up)**:\n        *   Red Left beam travels on Row 5. Maroon Up beam travels on Col 2. Intersection at `(5,2)`.\n        *   They deflect diagonally toward the Top-Left.\n        *   **Red Path**: `(5,4) -> (5,3)`. At `(5,3)` it deflects UL to `(4,2) -> (3,1) -> (2,0)`.\n        *   **Maroon Path**: `(24,2) -> ... -> (6,2)`. At `(6,2)` it deflects UL to `(5,1) -> (4,0)`.\n    *   **Collision 2 (Yellow Right vs Magenta Up)**:\n        *   Yellow Right beam travels on Row 5. Magenta Up beam travels on Col 23. Intersection at `(5,23)`.\n        *   They deflect diagonally toward the Top-Right.\n        *   **Yellow Path**: `(5,17) -> ... -> (5,22)`.

Problem Breakdown and Initial Analysis:**\n\nThe user is asking me to solve an ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) problem, a task that seems to involve identifying patterns in visual data and generating a corresponding output. My initial focus is on understanding the rules through careful analysis of provided examples and a test input. I immediately notice some repeating visual themes: a teal (8) background, green (3) outlines forming box-like structures, and objects with a defined inner color. The problem seems to be about how these inner colors are extended or modified based on the surrounding green barriers, and I start to hypothesize about \"gaps\" and \"flow\" of color.\n\n**2. Example-Driven Hypothesis Formulation:**\n\nI examine the first example meticulously. I observe that the \"green boxes\" aren't always perfect squares, but have corners open and act as barriers to the inner colour that is surrounded. The color extends from the inside to the gaps (the holes or missing corners) in the form of rays. I refine my understanding to say, \"The 'green' pixels form a barrier, and the inner color 'flows' out through any gaps in the barrier,\". I notice that the directions for the rays seem to be orthogonal (horizontal or vertical) or diagonal.\n\n**3. Hypotheses Testing and Rule Refinement:**\n\nI test this hypothesis with the first example's multiple objects, carefully analyzing each output. It confirms that the color flows from the inner block through gaps in the \"bounding box\" (defined by adjacent pixels) of '3', and that it's the absence of '3' that allows color to expand. I note that lines continue until they hit the grid edge or another barrier. This leads me to create a refined rule: for each cell of the inner colored block, check its eight neighbors (cardinal and diagonal). If the neighbor is '8' (background/hole) and the path is not blocked by a '3' (green wall), extend a line in that direction. The \"path\" is crucial, and it becomes the key for the diagonal directions as I continue to examine more examples and refine the direction to be consistent.\n\n**4. Expanding Complexity and Interaction Rules:**\n\nAnalyzing the second example introduces a more complex interaction. I find that a ray can \"squeeze\" through a diagonal corner even if the cardinal neighbors are blocked, expanding the rule to: if the immediate next cell in that direction is NOT a wall (3), continue the ray from the pixel in the inner block. I start thinking about the ray behavior. What happens when these rays meet or interact? I begin to suspect that their behaviour might include \"stopping\", \"bouncing\", or \"reflecting\". Analyzing output and re-evaluating the grid leads me to suspect that the lines cross or interact with one another. I start to think about the order or position of colors and how they may influence each other.\n\n**5.  The Critical Breakthrough: Identifying Core Transformation:**\n\nI encounter another crucial observation: Sometimes, the inner color and the green \"wall\" swap positions! This forces me to revisit my rules. I start to carefully examine all of the examples again and I formulate a new hypothesis: \"If the wall is complete, the color permeates the wall and they swap.\" I discover that there are two core behaviours: *sealed* and *leaky*, with different associated ray behaviours. Sealed is \"complete\" walls, leading to a swap, and diagonal-only rays. Leaky is \"incomplete\" walls, with cardinal or diagonal rays emerging through the gaps.\n\n**6. Formalizing the Algorithm and Key Steps:**\n\nThe next example helps me to confirm my algorithm, and I formulate it into specific steps. I'm now able to explain:\n\n1.  Identify the inner colour and the wall\n2.  Check for \"sealed\" vs. \"leaky\".\n3.  If sealed, swap and shoot diagonal rays from the new walls.\n4.  If leaky, no swap and shoot cardinal or diagonal rays through gaps.\n\nI add that rays stop at wall (3) or the edge. I make a detailed analysis of all the specific ray behaviours.\n\n**7.  Addressing the Test Input and Intersection Behaviour:**\n\nFinally, I reach the actual test input. I meticulously apply the rules and ray propagation logic.  I start to run into more complex interactions between rays, specifically how those rays that are diagonal interact with those that are vertical. Through extensive tracing of the grid and ray direction, I come to another realization about ray behavior: when rays of different colours come into adjacency vertically, they merge and continue down in the grid.\n\n**8.  Finalizing the Algorithm and Construction of the Solution:**\n\nI have now distilled the process into a set of well-defined steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Connected components of non-8, non-3 colors (Inner), 3s as the wall.\n2.  **Type Check:** Sealed\n\nThe solution involves simulating the \"flow\" of colored liquids from containers defined by green (3) walls.\n\n**Analysis of the Rules:**\n\n1.  **Objects:** The grid contains objects consisting of an inner rectangular block of color (not 3 or 8) surrounded by a \"wall\" of green (3) pixels.\n2.  **Sealed vs. Leaky:**\n    *   **Sealed:** If the inner color block is completely enclosed by green walls in the four cardinal directions (Top, Bottom, Left, Right), it is \"Sealed\".\n    *   **Leaky:** If there is a gap (an '8' or grid edge) in the immediate cardinal neighbors of the inner block, it is \"Leaky\".\n3.  **Transformation:**\n    *   **Sealed Objects:**\n        *   **Swap:** The inner color and the green wall swap roles. The green pixels become the inner color, and the inner pixels become green (or empty '8' in some interpretations, but here walls effectively turn into the source color).\n        *   **Flow:** Diagonal rays of the object's color are emitted from the corners of the new bounding box outwards.\n    *   **Leaky Objects:**\n        *   **No Swap:** The object retains its shape.\n        *   **Flow:** Rays of the inner color are emitted through any **gaps** in the wall.\n            *   **Cardinal Gaps:** If a cardinal neighbor is open, a straight line extends in that direction.\n            *   **Diagonal Gaps:** If a diagonal neighbor is open (and not blocked by the source block itself), a diagonal line extends in that direction.\n4.  **Ray Interaction:**\n    *   Rays travel until they hit the grid edge or another object.\n    *   **Merge/Drop:** If two rays of different colors moving generally downwards or sideways meet and become **horizontally adjacent**, they merge and travel **vertically down** side-by-side.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\nThe test input contains 5 \"Leaky\" objects. None are fully sealed.\n*   **Red (2) [Top-Left]:** Leaks Up (Col 5), Left (Row 6), and Diagonal SE (from corner 8,7).\n*   **Yellow (4) [Top-Right]:** Leaks Right (Row 6) and Down (Col 16).\n*   **Pink (6) [Mid-Right]:** Leaks Up (Col 24), Diagonal NE (from 14,26), and Diagonal SE (from 17,26).\n*   **Orange (7) [Bot-Right]:** Leaks Right (Row 21) and Diagonal SE (from 23,26).\n*   **Maroon (9) [Bot-Left]:** Leaks Up (Col 3) and Diagonal SE (from 28,4).\n\n**Interaction:**\n*   **Red SE & Yellow Down:** The Red diagonal ray (moving SE) meets the Yellow vertical ray (moving Down at Col 16).\n    *   Red path: Starts (8,7)... reaches (16,15).\n    *   Yellow path: Vertical at Col 16.\n    *   At Row 16, Red is at Col 15 and Yellow is at Col 16. They are adjacent.\n    *   Result: The Red ray turns vertical. From Row 16 downwards, we have a stripe of `2` at Col 15 and `4` at Col 16.\n\n**Final Ray Paths:**\n1.  **Maroon (9):** Up at Col 3. Diagonal SE from (28,4) to (29,5).\n2.  **Red (2):** Up at Col 5. Left at Row 6. Diagonal SE from (8,7) to (16,15), then Vertical Down at Col 15 (merging with Yellow).\n3.  **Yellow (4):** Right at Row 6. Vertical Down at Col 16.\n4.  **Pink (6):** Up at Col 24. Diagonal NE from (14,26). Diagonal SE from (17,26).\n5.  **Orange (7):** Right at Row 21. Diagonal SE from (23,26).\n\n**Output Generation:**\nOverlay these lines onto the input grid.

Lines extend until they reach the grid boundary\n\nFor the test input, I identify these patterns and their gaps:\n- **Pattern 1 (color 2)**: rows 4-7, cols 3-6 - gaps create UP, LEFT, and DOWN-RIGHT lines\n- **Pattern 2 (color 4)**: rows 4-7, cols 14-17 - gaps create UP-LEFT diagonal, RIGHT, and DOWN lines\n- **Pattern 3 (color 6)**: rows 13-16, cols 22-25 - gaps create UP, UP-RIGHT diagonal, and DOWN-RIGHT diagonal\n- **Pattern 4 (color 7)**: rows 19-22, cols 21-24 - gaps create RIGHT and DOWN-RIGHT diagonal lines\n- **Pattern 5 (color 9)**: rows 24-27, cols 0-3 - gaps create UP and DOWN-RIGHT diagonal lines\n\n```\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      2,2,9,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n      3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n      8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"8\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_5_step_5_generate_hint\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**Alright, here's my breakdown of how I'm approaching this ARC task. The core idea is to understand how these green shapes in the input grid influence the output, which seems to involve drawing lines or paths.**\n\n**First**, I'm trying to figure out the connection between the green shapes (the \"containers\" with color 3) and the colored pixels inside them. These colors act as \"payloads\" that will be used to generate the output. Examining the examples, I see that the shapes have different colors within their borders, and these internal colors seem to determine the color of the output lines.\n\n**Next**, I need to understand the output pattern. Based on the \"Test Input\" prompts I got from the user, the goal is to create connecting lines that extend to borders and form staircase-like diagonals. Each shape appears to act like a source or hub, with lines emanating from it.\n\n**The Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Identify the \"Ports\" or \"Entry points\":** Gaps or openings in the green borders of the shapes seem to be the most obvious starting points. In my reasoning, I am referring to those as \"Openings\" in the summary. Straight lines in the color of each shape's interior fill those openings.\n2.  **Corners:** If there are corners/missing border pixels, then they originate diagonal lines. The diagonals have 45 degree angle with respect to the shape.\n\n**This is what I learned from reviewing the examples given, with an emphasis on my observations:**\n\n*   In Example 1, the output had lines extending towards the edges of the grid.\n*   In Example 2, the lines followed a more rectangular pattern, like connections.\n*   In Example 3, there was a connection between multiple shapes.\n*   The hint on the staircase pattern led me to find \"diagonals\" and vertical connections.\n\n**Based on this, I'm forming the hypothesis:**\n\nEach shape has one or more ports where it connects to the background, in a sort of \"ray\" or path. Lines are created from the shapes, extending from those ports to connect to boundaries.\n\n**Now I'm looking for a way to model this and make the process algorithmic:**\n\n1.  First, the location of shapes is detected in the input, by their green borders.\n2.  Next, identify \"openings\" within that border by looking for missing pixels. The key here will be correctly transcribing coordinates and comparing pixels.\n3.  Each \"opening\" creates a ray, path or line, in one or more directions depending on the shape, the type of the opening and neighboring shapes or existing paths.\n4.  In the final step, these lines are generated in the output.\n\n**What I'm expecting is:**\n\nThe final output will be a grid with single-pixel-wide lines that connect or trace from each shape to the edges of the image or other shapes.\nI will draw them one by one. I will use the internal color to create the appropriate color in the output. I will manage color intersections by assuming all lines exist.\n\n**To implement this, I will:**\n\n1.  Scan the input grid to locate the green shapes.\n2.  Within each shape, detect the internal color (payload) and the openings in the green border.\n3.  For each shape, determine the \"ports\" and their associated directions.\n4.  Trace the lines in the corresponding color from each port, extending to the edges of the grid or the intersection of other lines.\n\nThis strategy will get the result, and that's the approach.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation follows these rules:\n\n1.  **Identify Containers**: The input consists of green (3) border shapes enclosing \"payload\" pixels of various colors.\n2.  **Identify Openings**:\n    *   **Missing Side**: If a side of the green border has a gap (replaced by background 8), a straight line of the payload color extends from that gap outwards to the grid edge.\n    *   **Missing Corner**: If a corner of the rectangular bounding box of the shape is missing its green border pixel, a diagonal line (staircase pattern) of the payload color extends from that corner outwards.\n3.  **Draw Paths**:\n    *   Paths stop at the grid boundaries.\n    *   Vertical/Horizontal lines are 1 pixel wide.\n    *   Diagonal lines are 1 pixel wide steps.\n    *   Where paths cross, one color takes precedence (the specific precedence isn't strictly defined by examples but standard layering applies; generally vertical lines or lines from \"lower\" shapes might overlay, or simple crossing).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Shape 1 (Color 2)** [Rows 4-7, Cols ~3-6]:\n    *   **Top Opening** at (4,4): Extends **Vertical Up** (Color 2) at Column 4.\n    *   **Left Opening** at (5,3): Extends **Horizontal Left** (Color 2) at Row 5.\n    *   **Missing BL Corner** at (7,3): Extends **Diagonal Down-Left** (Color 2) starting from (8,2).\n\n*   **Shape 2 (Color 4)** [Rows 4-7, Cols ~14-17]:\n    *   **Right Opening** at (5,17): Extends **Horizontal Right** (Color 4) at Row 5.\n    *   **Missing TR Corner** at (4,17): Extends **Diagonal Up-Right** (Color 4) starting from (3,18).\n    *   **Bottom Opening** at (7,15): Extends **Vertical Down** (Color 4) at Column 15.\n\n*   **Shape 3 (Color 6)** [Rows 13-16, Cols ~22-25]:\n    *   **Top Opening** at (13,23): Extends **Vertical Up** (Color 6) at Column 23.\n\n*   **Shape 4 (Color 7)** [Rows 19-22, Cols ~21-24]:\n    *   **Right Opening** at (20,24): Extends **Horizontal Right** (Color 7) at Row 20.\n    *   **Missing BR Corner** at (22,24): Extends **Diagonal Down-Right** (Color 7) starting from (23,25).\n\n*   **Shape 5 (Color 9)** [Rows 24-27, Cols ~0-3]:\n    *   **Top Opening** at (24,2): Extends **Vertical Up** (Color 9) at Column 2.\n    *   **Missing BR Corner** at (27,3): Extends **Diagonal Down-Right** (Color 9) starting from

model_id=\"gemini-3-high_6_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nAlright, here's my plan. The user wants me to solve an ARC task by analyzing examples and transforming an input grid based on \"Objects\" and their transformations. I need to figure out the rules of this transformation.\n\n**Here's the Breakdown:**\n1.  **Input:** A grid of numbers from 0 to 9.\n2.  **Output:** A transformed grid, same format.\n3.  **Key Hints:** \"Objects Description\" and \"Transformation Description.\"\n    *   **Background:** The value 8 seems important, kind of like an \"empty\" space.\n    *   **Objects:**  \"3-framed objects\" with inner filled shapes (like 2,4,6,7,9, or 1).\n    *   **The Transformation:** It's about finding gaps or missing pieces in the frames and then \"casting rays\" from those gaps.\n\n**My Approach:**\n1.  **Understand the Example Logic:** Carefully examine each example. My goal is to extract the \"recipe\".\n2.  **Verify the Rules:** Make a hypothesis based on hints, and examples, and then prove it with examples\n3.  **Test the Rules:** Apply what I've learned to the test input.\n\n**Diving into the Examples:**\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   There are shapes with corners that are essentially missing. The \"missing corners\" seem critical, as the \"gaps\" get filled in.\n    *   **Rays:**  After filling the gaps, rays shoot out. They can be diagonal, or orthogonal based on the shape of the object.\n    *   **Ray Interactions:**  If rays meet or hit, it gets interesting. Seems like they can stop, continue, or turn.\n\n    *   **Key Observations**: Rays stop at grid edges. This \"gap\" rule is consistent for all objects in Example 1\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   We have a \"missing\" corner that's not a corner like a square. It's a \"notch\" in the rectangle's corner.\n    *   Again, the gap is filled.\n    *   Rays shoot out (like orthogonal rays - up or right).\n\n*   **Example 4:**\n    *   Kind of a diamond/cross shape.\n    *   The gap is at the top where the diamond ends.\n    *   A Vertical ray goes upwards.\n\n**Hypothesis Refining:**\n*   **Shape Identification:** I need to identify the \"ideal shape\" of the 3-framed object. Usually, it's a Rectangle.\n*   **Gap Location:**  The missing pixels are the key to the transformation. Fill gaps.\n*   **Ray Directions:**\n    *   **Orthogonal Rays:** gaps at a straight side or edge.\n    *   **Diagonal Rays:** gaps at an indented/corner location.\n\n**Interactions:**\n*   **Rays Meeting:** I need to determine what happens when rays of different colors meet or are close together. Do they cross? Stop? Turn? What's the rule? It seems like orthogonal rays stop, and the existing color, has priority to establish. And the diagonal can pass through (Ex 1).\n\n**Applying to the Test Input:**\n\nI will identify the objects in the test input, analyze their shapes, locate gaps, and draw the rays according to my rules.\n\nLet's start!\n\n\nTo solve this task, we need to apply the transformation rules inferred from the examples to the test input.\n\n### Method Explanation\n\nThe transformation involves identifying objects (frames of color 3 with specific interior colors) and extending \"rays\" from any gaps in their outlines.\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all 3-framed objects in the grid. Note their interior color.\n    *   Object 1 (Top-Left): Frame 3, Interior 2 (Red).\n    *   Object 2 (Top-Right): Frame 3, Interior 4 (Yellow).\n    *   Object 3 (Bottom-Middle): Frame 3, Interior 6 (Pink).\n    *   Object 4 (Bottom-Right): Frame 3, Interior 7 (Orange).\n    *   Object 5 (Bottom-Left): Frame 3, Interior 9 (Maroon).\n\n2.  **Locate Gaps:** Find cells on the perimeter of these frames that are currently background color (8) but represent a \"missing\" piece of the frame (corners or wall segments).\n    *   **Obj 1 (Red):** Gaps at (4,4) [Top], (5,3) [Left], (7,6) [Bottom-Right Corner].\n    *   **Obj 2 (Yellow):** Gaps at (4,18) [Top-Right Corner], (5,18) [Right], (7,16) [Bottom].\n    *   **Obj 3 (Pink):** Gap at (13,23) [Top].\n    *   **Obj 4 (Orange):** Gaps at (20,24) [Right], (22,24) [Bottom-Right Corner].\n    *   **Obj 5 (Maroon):** Gaps at (24,2) [Top], (27,3) [Bottom-Right Corner].\n\n3.  **Fill Gaps:** Recolor the gap cells with the object's interior color.\n\n4.  **Cast Rays:** Extend 1-cell-thick rays from the filled gaps in the direction implied by the gap (outward from the center or extending the line).\n    *   **Ray 2 (Up):** From (4,4) upwards.\n    *   **Ray 2 (Left):** From (5,3) leftwards.\n    *   **Ray 2 (Diag DR):** From (7,6) diagonally down-right.\n    *   **Ray 4 (Diag UR):** From (4,18) diagonally up-right.\n    *   **Ray 4 (Right):** From (5,18) rightwards.\n    *   **Ray 4 (Down):** From (7,16) downwards.\n    *   **Ray 6 (Up):** From (13,23) upwards.\n    *   **Ray 7 (Right):** From (20,24) rightwards.\n    *   **Ray 7 (Diag DR):** From (22,24) diagonally down-right.\n    *   **Ray 9 (Up):** From (24,2) upwards.\n    *   **Ray 9 (Diag DR):** From (27,3) diagonally down-right.\n\n5.  **Handle Interactions:**\n    *   **Ray 9 (Up) vs Ray 2 (Left):** Intersect at (5,2). Ray 2 travels a shorter distance (1 step) compared to Ray 9 (19 steps). Ray 2 claims the cell. Ray 9 stops at (6,2).\n    *   **Ray 6 (Up) vs Ray 4 (Right):** Intersect at (5,23). Ray 4 travels a shorter distance (5 steps) compared to Ray 6 (8 steps). Ray 4 claims the cell. Ray 6 stops at (6,23).\n    *   **Ray 2 (Diag) vs Ray 4 (Down):** Intersect at (17,16). Both continue (diagonal rays pass through).\n\n### Output Grid Generation\n\nThe final grid is constructed by applying these rays to the input grid.\n\n*   **Ray 2 Up:** (0,4) to (3,4) become 2.\n*   **Ray 2 Left:** (5,0) to (5,2) become 2. (Blocks Ray 9).\n*   **Ray 2 Diag:** (8,7), (9,8)... down to edge become 2.\n*   **Ray 4 Diag:** (3,19), (2,20)... up to edge become 4.\n*   **Ray 4 Right:** (5,19) to edge become 4. (Blocks Ray 6).\n*   **Ray 4 Down:** (8,16) to edge become 4.\n*   **Ray 6 Up:** (6,23) to (12,23) become 6. (Stops before row 5).\n*   **Ray 7 Right:** (20,25) to edge become 7.\n*   **Ray 7 Diag:** (23,25), (24,26)... to edge become 7.\n*   **Ray 9 Up:** (6,2) to (23,2) become 9. (Stops before row 5).\n*   **Ray 9 Diag:** (28,4), (29,5) become 9.\n\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      2,2,2,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,8,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n      8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,2,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,2,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n      3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8\n      3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8\n      3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n      8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"11\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"claude-opus-4.5-thinking-60000_6_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nLooking at this problem, I need to:\n1.

                "response": "**Comprehensive Analysis of ARC Problem Solution Candidates**\n\nMy task is to audit several candidates' proposed solutions for an ARC problem involving ray casting from structures within a grid. Each candidate interprets and implements the rules governing these \"rays\" \u2013 lines that project outwards from gaps in a structure's frame \u2013 differently. This is my comprehensive thought process as I systematically evaluate each candidate:\n\nFirst, I define the problem. The core concept is that a color 'C' surrounded by a frame ('3') with missing pixels (gaps) generates 'rays' of color 'C'. There are specific rules for how rays behave: they can be vertical, horizontal, or diagonal, and they stop at the edge of the grid or when they encounter another structure. The primary goal is to check for consistency between the candidate's stated rules, their explanations, and the output they generate.\n\nCandidate 0 (Gemini 3 High) is the first. Its approach involves identifying shapes, and gap positions. However, the rule for generating a diagonal ray seems overly complex, which is a major red flag given that I haven't seen anything in the examples showing anything that would require this. Then, there's the 'deflection' rule. After inspecting the input and output examples, I start by evaluating the input, paying close attention to the frame and core pixels. Candidate 0 fails in the first test case. It introduces a complex interaction logic (deflection at intersections) that seems completely unprompted by the provided training data. The candidate's output grid seems to partially match its logic, but I'm suspicious of the justification of the complex deflection rule. In the given training examples, the rays either 'pass through' or 'stop', but no 'deflection' happens. In the test input, Candidate 0 uses \"deflection\" to describe what happens at (5,2) in the output grid. In the training data, some intersection behavior is also seen. However, in those cases, the behavior is more basic -- either stopping or passing through. Therefore, I conclude that Candidate 0's implementation is invalid, and assign a penalty score for inventing unnecessary and complex physics that are not validated by the given training examples.\n\nCandidate 1 (Claude Opus 4.5) is next, and it takes a simpler approach, claiming that it simply has to identify gaps and extend the rays outward. After observing the generated output, I compare it to the given test grid. The generated test output demonstrates that ray collisions are resolved using an *overwrite* with precedence. Where two rays intersect (such as the red horizontal and maroon vertical rays at (5,2)), the incoming vertical ray overwrites the existing horizontal one. This is valid logic, and a consistent overwrite strategy is found. Its behaviour in the test grid is validated, so I move forward to the training examples. In a visual audit, Candidate 1 seems to identify the correct gaps and generate rays from them. The consistency of this layering (precedence-based overwrite) and its simplicity are encouraging.\n\nCandidate 2 (Gemini 3 High) presents an entirely different interpretation. It focuses on diagonal rays, claiming that when rays intersect, they become vertical. This clashes with the given examples where horizontal and vertical rays are directly implied by gaps on the sides of the structure's frame. Examining its output, it seems to not follow the examples and the given rules, suggesting a major conceptual misunderstanding of the problem.\n\nCandidate 3 (Claude Opus 4.5) is very similar to candidate 1. Candidate 3, like Candidate 1, says that it needs to identify the gaps and extend the rays outward. Upon inspecting the output test cases, the rays overwrite with a layering method. The intersection behavior is almost identical to that in Candidate 1; and so the results of these two models are extremely similar. It also identifies gaps correctly. Then, I inspect the test output grid for the test input given. Again, the candidates perform appropriately, though there is a subtle difference in which ray \"overwrites\" in case of intersection. The only difference between 1 and 3 seems to be the ray precedence. While both are logically valid, and both are capable of successfully modeling the examples, this small difference will matter when it comes to edge cases.\n\nCandidate 4 (Gemini 3 High) attempts to model the problem as though there are \"holes in walls,\" and rays shoot out. This creates a similar \"complex physics\" model. I note that this candidate's implementation is flawed. It misses the standard gap behavior of having gaps in corners. During examination of the test cases, the candidate misses at least one gap, which suggests that the given implementation is unlikely to model the training data correctly. I conclude that Candidate 4 is flawed, like Candidate 0.\n\nCandidate 5 (Claude Opus 4.5) is similar to Candidates 1 and 3, using a simple gap -> ray approach. This candidate exhibits some interesting behaviour.
