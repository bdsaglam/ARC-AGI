My mind's buzzing \u2013 I need to understand how the input grid, with its colored shapes and mysterious '5' markings, transforms into the output grid.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n\nI start by breaking down Example 1. It's a 30x30 grid. The '5' values seem particularly important. They\u2019re like corner markers, defining a specific region within the input. I map out the shapes formed by different colors (2, 4, 1, and 5) and relate their positions to the '5' box. The output grid, a much smaller 3x6 grid, raises questions. The output color is '2', but the shape doesn't correspond directly to any input shape.\n\nThe key is in the '5's. They seem to act as bounding boxes, selecting a specific region of the input. I look for repeating patterns to help clarify the role of the colors. I realize that the '5's don't just enclose a block, they *define* the output size and position. I hypothesize the output copies the same *relative* area as defined by the '5' box. However, the output color and shape are not a direct copy, so something else is going on. There's a rule connecting the 5s region, output size, and the values within. The '5' values may be a \"window\" used to *select* some content from the larger input space.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n\nExample 2 reinforces the \"bounding box\" hypothesis. The '5's also act as boundary makers. There are repeating patterns in Example 2 that the '5' brackets cut across and act on. The output shows a pattern too. The shape of the '5' region matches the dimensions of the output. I need to determine the rule that decides the content of the output. The '5' marks are likely placeholders or markers for a repeated pattern that stretches horizontally, or diagonally.\n\nI see that output colors (9, 8, 4) in Example 2 seem to be slices of the left side pattern if it was mirrored and repeated. If I just *extend* the pattern to the window area defined by the 5s, the output is generated from the extension.\n\n**Example 3 Analysis:**\n\nExample 3 solidifies the pattern \"extension\" idea. The '7', '2', '3' sequence repeats. The output matches the pattern if it were extended to the \"viewing window\". The '5's mark this viewing area. I now believe I've identified the rule: extend the pattern.\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\nI need to apply my rule to a new scenario. Analyzing the test input with multiple \"4\" and \"6\" objects arranged periodically vertically. The '5's here define a window area *above* the shapes, so it must extend the pattern upward. I'll need to figure out the shape. The 5s tell me I must generate the 2x22 window.\n\nThe shapes form \"diamonds\". I build the pattern: horizontal blocks of colors extending in 5-unit increments. The shape is the basic building block, starting with the 2-wide diamond shape and extending at a 4-unit \"radius\". I predict this pattern for all input colors to fill the target grid. It's really the \"extend\" and \"complete shape\" rules.\n\n**Final Output:**\n\nI\u2019ve mapped out the shapes, and the repeating pattern. With all of that logic, I write out the full 2x22 output using the defined, calculated, logic.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to perform a transformation on a grid based on learned patterns from examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification**: The grids contain background (0) and foreground objects of various colors.\n    -   In Example 1, there are shapes of colors 2, 4, 1. A region defined by color 5 (grey) acts as a target window. The output is a reconstruction of the \"next\" shape in the sequence (color 2 again) within that window.\n    -   In Example 2, there is a repeating wallpaper-like pattern. Color 5 defines a target window. The output is the continuation of the pattern into that window.\n    -   In Example 3, there is a repeating horizontal sequence of blocks (7, 2, 3). The 5s define a window. The output is the pattern block that logically falls in that position (color 7).\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule**:\n    -   Identify the \"Target Window\" defined by the grey pixels (5).\n    -   Analyze the repeating spatial and color pattern of the objects in the grid relative to the window.\n    -   Extrapolate or project the pattern into the coordinates of the target window.\n    -   The output grid is the content of this projected pattern within the window bounds.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Locate Target Window**:\n    -   The grey pixels (5) are found in Rows 12 and 13.\n    -   On the left, they are at columns 7 and 8 (`5,5`).\n    -   On the right, they are at columns 27 and 28 (`5,5` or similar configuration).\n    -   These distinct markers define the corners or brackets of a rectangular region spanning from **Column 7 to Column 28** and **Row 12 to Row 13**.\n    -   Output dimensions should be width $28 - 7 + 1 = 22$ and height $2$.\n\n2.  **Analyze Pattern**:\n    -   The objects below the window (Rows 15+) form an alternating sequence of colors and shapes moving upwards.\n    -   Row 27-29: Color 6 (Magenta).\n    -   Row 23-25: Color 4 (Yellow).\n    -   Row 19-21: Color 6 (Magenta).\n    -   Row 15-17: Color 4 (Yellow).\n    -   **Prediction**: The next block upwards (Rows 11-13) should be **Color 6**.\n    \n    -   **Shape Analysis**: The shapes are diamond-like blocks arranged horizontally with a period of 5 columns.\n        -   Centers appear to be at indices corresponding to 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30...\n        -   Structure of a Color 6 block (based on Rows 19-21):\n            -   Top (Row 1 of 3): Width 2 (e.g., `6,6`).\n            -   Middle (Row 2 of 3): Width 4 (e.g., `6,6,6,6`).\n            -   Bottom (Row 3 of 3): Width 2 or connected junctions.\n        -   The Target Window (Rows 12-13) corresponds to the **Middle** and **Bottom** rows of the predicted Color 6 block (which would span Rows 11-13).\n\n3.  **Construct Content**:\n    -   We need to generate the **Middle** and **Bottom** rows of the Color 6 pattern for columns 7 through 28.\n    \n    -   **Row 12 (Middle row of pattern)**:\n        -   Consists of width-4 blocks separated by 1-pixel gaps (0).\n        -   Centers at 10, 15, 20, 25.\n        -   Block 10 (cols 8-11): `6,6,6,6`. (Gap at 7, Gap at 12).\n        -   Block 15 (cols 13-16): `6,6,6,6`. (Gap at 17).\n        -   Block 20 (cols 18-21): `6,6,6,6`. (Gap at 22).\n        -   Block 25 (cols 23-26): `6,6,6,6`. (Gap at 27).\n        -   Block 30 (starts col 28): `6...`.\n        -   **Sequence**: `0, 6,6,6,6, 0, 6,6,6,6, 0, 6,6,6,6, 0, 6,6,6,6, 0, 6`\n\n    -   **Row 13 (Bottom row of pattern)**:\n        -   Consists of junctions connecting the blocks (width 3) and empty centers (width 2).\n        -   Junction 5-10 (cols 6-8): `6,6,6`.\n        -   Center 10 (cols 9-10): `0,0`.\n        -   Junction 10-15 (cols 11-13): `6,6,6`.\n        -   Center 15 (cols 14-15): `0,0`.\n        -   Junction 15-20 (cols 16-18): `6,6,6`.\n        -   Center 20 (cols 19-20): `0,0`.\n        -   Junction 20-25 (cols 21-23): `6,6,6`.\n        -   Center 25 (cols 24-25): `0,0`.\n        -   Junction 25-30 (cols 26-28): `6,6,6`.\n        -   **Sequence**: `6,6` (clipped), `0,0, 6,6,6, 0,0, 6,6,6, 0,0, 6,6,6, 0,0, 6,6,6`\n\n4.  **Final Grid**:\n    Construct the 22x2 grid using the sequences derived above.\n\n0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6,6,6,6,0,6\n6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6,0,0,6,6,6",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**The Big Picture**\n\nOkay, here's my understanding of this ARC task. The core is about extracting patterns from a larger grid, marked by some \"brackets\" (grey pixels that form L shapes), and then shaping it in some way.  It's like a code or a cipher that transforms the inputs to outputs.\n\nI see several steps here:\n\n1.  **Understand the Inputs:** These are large grids with mostly black (0) backgrounds, coloured shapes, and some stray grey pixels (5).\n2.  **Define the output dimension:** The output is a smaller grid, usually rectangular.\n3.  **Recognize The Code:** The output is dependent on the size of the box and which shapes appear in the inputs.\n\nLet me break down the logic I've followed:\n\n*   **Grey Pixels (5): The Keys:**  These are central. I think they're defining the *region* of interest within the grid. Their position creates the coordinates for the region in the source.\n*   **The Shapes:** There's a set of colored shapes in each input. These are like building blocks. I needed to figure out which shape or how they are arranged to be used to build the result.\n*   **Size Matters:** The input shapes, markers, and the resulting grid has a specific relationship. The goal is to build a result that has a size related to the bounding box. For example, a 3x3 shape could be expanded to a 3x6 shape.\n*   **Position and Copy:** Sometimes, I thought the grey pixel bounding box might be a code or location. The output had a relationship to the coordinates defined by the grey pixels. The problem here is that the copy may not be obvious as it could have a transformation or stretching involved.\n*   **The Problem is NOT an Intersection:** I realized it's not simply an intersection of the marked area and the shapes. This lead me to the key idea.\n\n*   **Test Input's Text:** The Text input's horizontal tracks are like a repeating pattern. The result should output those tracks in some form. The solution does not combine those different tracks in the example. The solution selects the first track found.\n\n**The Test Case - Putting it all together**\nHere's how I think it works for this specific test input:\nThe problem should be solved by:\n\n1.  **Grey Pixels as Boundaries (Marker Brackets):** The Test input includes the grey pixels forming an L shape, the region. (11,7) to (12,27).\n2.  **Width-1:** The markers' left-most coordinate defines the start, the right-most, defines the end. However, the right bound is *not* included.\n3.  **Track the Shapes:** The height of the window can match the objects if the resulting pattern is constructed on its own. If the objects have the same height as the window, then the topmost one will be the resulting one. In the Test Input, there are two, Yellow and Pink, that have matching height (2).\n4.  **Make the Crop:** The solution takes the region (Window) defined by the grey pixels, so from Col 7 to 27. The window width is 21.\n5.  **Output the Track:** The Test Input specifies the resulting output. The top 2 row from 7 to 27, of the grid, must be copied to build the result. The result is the window cropped to the dimensions specified.\n\nThis model makes the example easier: the markers define a sliding *window* to extract the pattern from the input. It's like a text display window into a longer \"tape\" of shapes.\n\n\nThe problem requires extracting a specific region from the input grid based on the position of grey markers (color 5) and filling it with the pattern found in the colored shapes that match the height of the marker region.\n\n**Logic:**\n1.  **Identify the Target Region:** Locate the top-left and bottom-right grey markers (color 5). These markers define a rectangular bounding box.\n    *   In the **Test Input**, the markers are at Row 11 (Top-Left corner at Col 7) and Row 12 (Bottom-Right corner at Col 27).\n    *   This defines a region of **Height 2** (Rows 11-12) and **Width 21** (Cols 7-27).\n\n2.  **Identify the Source Pattern:** Look for colored shapes in the grid that have the same height as the target region.\n    *   The region height is 2.\n    *   Scanning the grid, we find horizontal tracks of shapes with height 2:\n        *   Rows 15-16: Yellow (4) pattern.\n        *   Rows 19-20: Pink (6) pattern.\n        *   Rows 23-24: Yellow (4) pattern.\n        *   Rows 27-28: Pink (6) pattern.\n    *   Following the precedence observed in the examples (first matching object from top/left), we select the **first** matching pattern, which is the **Yellow (4)** track at Rows 15-16.\n\n3.  **Extract and Crop:** Copy the content of the source pattern (Rows 15-16) but crop it horizontally to match the columns defined by the target region (Cols 7-27).\n\n**Extraction Steps:**\n*   **Row 1 of Output (Source Row 15, Cols 7-27):**\n    *   Original Row 15 indices (0-based): `... 5:4, 6-8:0, 9-10:4,4, 11-13:0, 14-15:4,4, 16-18:0, 19-20:4,4, 21-23:0, 24:4 ...`\n    *   Crop 7-27: `0,0, 4,4, 0,0,0, 4,4, 0,0,0, 4,4, 0,0,0, 4, 0,0,0`\n*   **Row 2 of Output (Source Row 16, Cols 7-27):**\n    *   Original Row 16 indices: `... 5-6:4,4, 7:0, 8-11:4,4,4,4, 12:0, 13-16:4,4,4,4, 17:0, 18-21:4,4,4,4, 22:0, 23-24:4,4 ...`\n    *   Crop 7-27: `0, 4,4,4,4, 0, 4,4,4,4, 0, 4,4,4,4, 0, 4,4, 0,0,0`\n\n**Completed Output Grid:**\n0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0\n0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,0,0,0",

The L-shaped gray (5) markers indicate direction: horizontal markers \u2192 horizontal output, vertical markers \u2192 vertical output\n2. The output shows the basic repeating unit extended in that direction\n3. The output uses a specific color pattern based on the input structure\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n- Two L-shaped markers at rows 11-12: one at cols 7-8 (pointing right), one at cols 26-27 (pointing left)\n- These are horizontally positioned \u2192 horizontal output\n- Pattern has yellow (4) bands at rows 14-16, 22-24 and pink (6) bands at rows 18-20, 26-28\n- The yellow (4) pattern forms the primary horizontal band structure\n- The unit is approximately 3 rows tall\n\n**Applying the transformation:**\n- Direction: horizontal (based on L-marker positions)\n- Height: 3 rows (matching the band height)\n- Following Example 1's pattern: filled top and bottom rows, left edge + zeros in middle\n- Color: yellow (4) as it's the dominant/first pattern\n- Width: based on the pattern extent (approximately 10 columns, similar proportions to Example 1)\n\n```\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4\n```",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Gray fragments on the right appear consistently in inputs but are removed in outputs (likely distractors/markers, not part of the constructed result).\n* The output is a tightly cropped, single connected strip/frame-like object, even when the input contains many scattered pieces.\n* Black pixels act as intentional internal voids/windows inside the constructed object (not merely leftover background).\n* Some cases preserve a multi-color pattern; others collapse to one selected input color\u2014so identify the color-selection and ordering/linearization logic.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analyzing ARC Task and Test Input**\n\nOkay, so I'm given an ARC task with three examples and a test case. The goal is to figure out the pattern and generate the right output.  Let's break down Example 1 first. I'm seeing a big grid with shapes.  I'm looking for the connected components and trying to identify if they correspond to letters or symbols.  It seems like there are multiple \"columns\" of shapes with color variations, and there is a 5 shape (grey). Aha, this \"5\" is probably a distractor, as indicated in the hint.\n\nExample 1's output is a 3x6 grid. The main thing is that all pixels have the same color. But where does the output shape comes from? It looks like a \"C\" on its side. Now, looking again, there appear to be shapes that look like letters or symbols in the inputs. The colored parts might be part of the symbol, not just shapes. Let's trace how the shapes change their structure row by row. This is interesting, the different colors form a column of patterns, each a version of \"E\" or \"L\". Aha, the number of pixels per row also changes.\n\nNow looking at Example 2. I have different colors 4, 8, 9, a similar layout, and a 14x2 output. The shapes are also columns. It seems that they are not single letters, but composed of several interleaved pieces.  It looks like some input strips of patterns, not just one letter. Let's see if the grey markers play a role in this example.\n\nThe hint suggests that the grey pieces are removed. I see some multi-color patterns in the input are simplified.  This is interesting. The outputs look like they correspond to a connected shape. The output color in Example 1, \"2\", may correspond to one specific letter or fragment.\n\nExample 2 output has 14 rows, 2 columns. This must be a specific repeating structure. Let me see. I'm tracing patterns of the shapes in columns. I notice some vertical strips. The colored values have a pattern, not a random set of numbers.\n\nExample 3 has the colors 7, 2, 3 with a 17x3 output. This time it looks like a repeating 7-0-7 pattern, with specific dimensions. The structure here is straightforward, which helps. It looks like a ladder or chain shape.\n\nWith these examples, I'm forming a hypothesis: The inputs are \"film strips\" or repeated tiled frames. I need to figure out the \"color-selection and ordering/linearization logic\". So let's look at the arrangement of shapes and whether specific colors are related to specific shapes.\n\nFor Example 1, why the color \"2\"? Perhaps because this shape looks unique, or maybe its relative position.  The shape at the center has one color: Color 2. Then, the arrangement is growing, and 2 is an intermediate number for color. I want to check to see if the shapes have the same geometry. Ah, there are shapes. Width varies from 2 to 5 pixels, one after the other. I'm trying to see if there is a correspondence between the width and output. And what if the color 2, the one shown in the final result, indicates something like the \"selected\" shape?\n\nThe output has 3 rows with a width of 6. Maybe the sequence defines a shape parameterized by width. In Ex 1, the marker is 5 pixels. Is the output next in sequence? Well, maybe the sequence 2,3,4,5 has one with width 6. It's a \"U\" on its side. Hmm, but why the output is not the complete shape? This is where the hints are useful. Ah! The output has a 'U' shape, maybe some \"selected\" bottom part of a sequence of letters.\n\nSo the logic seems to be: 1) Find the sequence, 2) Look at target size from grey markers, 3) Generate the target shape, and 4) Crop and select. The goal is \"color selection and the geometry\". Example 1, Sequence shows shapes with increasing width. And the grey marker indicates width, the key part of the image, the geometry, not just color!\n\nIn Example 1, the generated width from the sequence is 6, which should be the final output, according to hint. I see how the height of marker 27-29. This shape has 3 rows. The sequence goes \"2-3-4-5-6\", next width is 6, and the output is just a \"C\" on its side, the bottom part of the 6 wide. Okay.\n\nLet's look at Example 2. I need to determine\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the logic inferred from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Example 1:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains a sequence of shapes of colors 1, 2, 4, 1. The shapes resemble 'E' or 'C' structures and increase in width (2, 3, 4, 5). Gray markers (color 5) appear at the bottom right, spanning 3 rows (height 3).\n    *   **Output:** A 3x6 grid of color 2. The shape corresponds to the *bottom 3 rows* of the *next shape* in the sequence (which would have width 6). The sequence of colors is 1, 2, 4, 1... predicting the next color as 2. The output crop (height 3, bottom-aligned) matches the position of the gray markers relative to the shape's vertical extent (markers at the bottom).\n\n2.  **Example 2:**\n    *   **Input:** Contains vertical strips of repeating patterns with colors 4, 8, 9. Gray markers span a height of 14 rows.\n    *   **Output:** A 14x2 grid. The content continues the cyclic pattern observed in the input strips. The markers define the height of the extraction window.\n\n3.  **Example 3:**\n    *   **Input:** Shapes of colors 7, 2, 3... varying in length. Gray markers are at the very top and very bottom of the block, defining a total height of 17.\n    *   **Output:** A 17-row high strip of color 7. This corresponds to extending the pattern of the first/next shape to the height defined by the markers.\n\n**Logic for Test Input:**\n1.  **Identify the Sequence:**\n    The input contains four \"groups\" of shapes arranged vertically:\n    *   Group 1 (Rows 15-17): Color 4 (Yellow). Multiple copies. Shape has specific \"house-like\" geometry.\n    *   Group 2 (Rows 19-21): Color 6 (Magenta). Fewer copies. Same geometry.\n    *   Group 3 (Rows 23-25): Color 4 (Yellow). Fewer copies. Same geometry.\n    *   Group 4 (Rows 27-29): Color 6 (Magenta). Single copy. Geometry slightly narrower (wingspan reduced).\n    \n    The color sequence is 4, 6, 4, 6. Following this alternating pattern, the **next color should be 4**.\n    The shapes are 3 rows high. The top two rows (the \"roof\") are constant across all groups: a centered width-2 block on top of a width-4 block. The bottom row changes width in the last step.\n\n2.  **Determine the Output Geometry:**\n    We need to construct the next shape in the sequence.\n    *   **Color:** 4 (Yellow).\n    *   **Shape:** The top part is stable.\n        Row 1: 2 pixels.\n        Row 2: 4 pixels.\n\n3.  **Apply Crop/Windowing:**\n    *   **Gray Markers:** Located at Rows 12 and 13. This is a height of 2 rows.\n    *   **Position:** The markers are located *above* the sequence of shapes (which starts at Row 15). In Example 1, markers at the bottom meant keeping the bottom rows. Here, markers at the top imply keeping the **top rows**.\n    *   **Target:** The top 2 rows of the generated Color 4 shape.\n\n4.  **Construction:**\n    *   Top row of shape: Center 2 pixels `4, 4`.\n    *   Second row of shape: Center 4 pixels `4, 4, 4, 4`.\n    *   The \"tightly cropped\" result is a 2-row by 4-column grid.\n\n    Row 1: `0, 4, 4, 0`\n    Row 2: `4, 4, 4, 4`\n\n0,4,4,0\n4,4,4,4",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n* Gray fragments on the right appear consistently in inputs but are removed in outputs (likely distractors/markers, not part of the constructed result).\n* The output is a tightly cropped, single connected strip/frame-like object, even when the input contains many scattered pieces.\n* Black pixels act as intentional internal voids/windows inside the constructed object (not merely leftover background).\n* Some cases preserve a multi-color pattern; others collapse to one selected input color\u2014so identify the color-selection and ordering/linearization logic.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand the transformation by analyzing the solved examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1. **Marker Identification**: Each input has two L-shaped markers made of color 5. These define the output dimensions:\n   - Distance between markers (row span) + 1 = output height\n   - Distance between markers (column span) + 1 = output width\n\n2. **Test Input Markers**:\n   - First L: rows 11-12, cols 7-8\n   - Second L: rows 11-12, cols 26-27\n   - Output dimensions: (12-11+1) \u00d7 (27-7+1) = 2 \u00d7 21\n\n3. **Content Determination**: The main pattern uses color 4 (rows 14-16, 22-24) and color 6 (rows 18-20, 26-28). The pattern shows diagonal stripes with a repeating tile structure.\n\n**Identifying the Base Tile:**\n\nLooking at the color 4 pattern at the widest point (rows 14-15):\n- Row 14 tile: `4,4,0,0,0` (repeating every 5 columns)\n- Row 15 tile: `4,4,4,4,0` (repeating every 5 columns)\n\nThis forms a diagonal stripe pattern that tiles horizontally in the input.\n\n**Extension Logic:**\n\nFrom the examples:\n- Example 1: Color 2 doesn't tile in input \u2192 extend by last value\n- Example 3: Color 7 tiles horizontally \u2192 extend vertically by repeating\n- Test input: Color 4 tiles horizontally \u2192 extend horizontally by tiling\n\nFor 21 columns with a 5-column tile: 21 = 4\u00d75 + 1 (4 complete tiles plus 1 column)\n\n**Constructing Output:**\n\nTaking the 2-row tile and repeating it 4.2 times:\n- Row 0: `4,4,0,0,0` repeated \u2192 `4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4`\n- Row 1: `4,4,4,4,0` repeated \u2192 `4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4`\n\n```\n4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4\n4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4\n```",

inside the constructed object (not merely leftover background).\n* Some cases preserve a multi-color pattern; others collapse to one selected input color\u2014so identify the color-selection and ordering/linearization logic.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "## 1. Describe the observable structures (literal)\n\n### Pair 1 (Input 1 \u2192 Output 1)\n- **Input 1**: A large grid with a **black background**. Near the **bottom-left** there are several small, similarly sized, blocky shapes in **blue**, **red**, and **yellow**. On the **right side** near the bottom are a couple of small **gray** components (corner/step-like fragments).\n- **Output 1**: A smaller grid containing a single large **red** rectilinear shape that forms a **thick rectangular band/frame-like region**, with a **black horizontal rectangular void** inside it. No blue/yellow/gray are visible.\n\n### Pair 2 (Input 2 \u2192 Output 2)\n- **Input 2**: A large **black** grid with a **dense diamond-like cluster** of many repeated small shapes in **maroon**, **light blue**, and **yellow** (appearing tessellated/packed). There are also small **gray** fragments on the **right side** (one mid-right, one near bottom-right).\n- **Output 2**: A **tall, narrow** grid that is mostly a single connected vertical \u201cstrip\u201d filled with **maroon**, **light blue**, and **yellow** in a stacked/interlocking pattern. A small **black** region is present at the bottom. No gray appears.\n\n### Pair 3 (Input 3 \u2192 Output 3)\n- **Input 3**: A large **black** grid with several **tall rectangular blocks** near the **top-left** in multiple colors (notably **orange**, plus other colors like **red** and **green**). These tall blocks contain **black square holes** (window-like cutouts). Small **gray** fragments appear on the **right side** (top-right and mid-right).\n- **Output 3**: A **tall, narrow** grid containing a single large **orange** vertical rectangle with a **vertical series of black square holes** inside. No gray (and none of the other input colors) appear.\n\n**Across all pairs**\n- Inputs: black background + multiple colored components + small gray fragments on the right.\n- Outputs: smaller, tightly focused results featuring one main rectilinear structure (strip/frame), **gray removed**, and **black used as internal voids**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Identify transformation categories\n\n- **Object movement**: maybe  \n- **Object recoloring**: present  \n- **Bordering / outlining**: maybe  \n- **Filling holes or cavities**: absent (holes/voids remain; not filled)  \n- **Removing noise / extracting main shape**: present (gray fragments vanish; outputs simplify)  \n- **Copying / pasting / repositioning**: maybe  \n- **Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center)**: maybe  \n- **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors**: maybe  \n- **Size-based filtering or selection**: maybe  \n- **Symmetry or reflection operations**: absent/maybe (no clear reflection in outputs)  \n- **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion**: maybe (outputs look like \u201cpacked/expanded\u201d canonical shapes)  \n- **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping**: present/maybe (dense clusters become a canonical strip/frame)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Key non-obvious insights (crucial)\n\n1. **Gray components behave like distractors or non-output markers**: they appear in every input (on the right) and never survive into the output.\n2. **Outputs are canonicalized into a single connected rectilinear container**: even when inputs have many separated pieces/colors, the output becomes one main strip/frame-like object (with holes).\n3. **Output grids look tightly cropped around the constructed result**, suggesting the task is not preserving the original canvas size but emitting just the constructed structure.\n4. **Black is used structurally as \u201cvoid/holes\u201d inside the main object** (a long cavity in Pair 1; repeated window holes in Pair 3), implying that emptiness/holes are part of the intended construction, not accidental background.\n5. **Some examples collapse many input colors down to one output foreground color** (Pairs 1 & 3), while another retains multiple colors (Pair 2). This suggests either (a) a color-selection step (dominant/primary/target color), or (b) the output encodes an ordered subset of the input rather than all colors.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)\n\nA plausible mechanism is: **ignore gray fragments**, extract the main structured cluster of colored pieces, and **collapse/linearize it into a single canonical rectangular strip or frame**, then **crop** the output to that shape\u2019s bounding box. The output\u2019s fill color(s) are drawn from the input\u2019s palette (sometimes reduced to a single chosen \u201cprimary\u201d color), while **black voids/windows** are preserved or generated to encode internal gaps/separators from the input structure.\n\nAlternative likely family: select a specific \u201crepresentative\u201d object/color (e.g., by frequency/size/position), then **build an elongated bar/frame** of that color whose **holes** encode counts/order/spacing of elements in the input.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Checks you would perform when solving\n\n1. **Confirm gray is always ignored**: remove gray pixels and see if anything else changes; check if gray positions correlate with output dimensions (possible markers) or are pure noise.\n2. **Relate output dimensions to input structure**: test whether output height/width equals number of objects, number of columns/rows in the cluster, or the cluster\u2019s bounding-box dimensions.\n3. **Determine the \u201cchosen foreground color\u201d rule** (when output is monochrome): most frequent non-black? color of largest object? leftmost/topmost object? color of a special shape type?\n4. **Check whether output is a linearization**: try ordering input pieces by x (left\u2192right), y (top\u2192bottom), or by diagonal \u201clayers,\u201d and see if output\u2019s stacked pattern matches that order.\n5. **Map holes/windows**: verify whether black holes in the output correspond to (a) holes in the selected input objects, (b) gaps between stacked units, or (c) periodic separators inserted between concatenated parts.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Summarize final insights\n\nHINT_START\n* Gray fragments on the right appear consistently in inputs but are removed in outputs (likely distractors/markers, not part of the constructed result).\n* The output is a tightly cropped, single connected strip/frame-like object, even when the input contains many scattered pieces.\n* Black pixels act as intentional internal voids/windows inside the constructed object (not merely leftover background).\n* Some cases preserve a multi-color pattern; others collapse to one selected input color\u2014so identify the color-selection and ordering/linearization logic.\nHINT_END",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nBackground is usually color 0. Foreground objects include monochrome bars/lines and border/frame pieces (often with color-0 holes), repeated hollow \u201cladder\u201d-style patterned blocks, glyph-like bar-and-stroke polyominoes, tiny isolated markers (single pixels/pairs/small clusters, often color 5), a dense interlocking multi-color cluster using colors such as 4/8/9, and a thin 2-column vertical strip containing stacked paired colors (e.g., 9/8/4 with occasional 0).\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Treat 0 as background.  \n- Find all 5-cells; output grid size = bounding box of 5 (height = maxRow5-minRow5+1, width = maxCol5-minCol5+1).  \n- 5 is not copied to the output (removed/replaced by 0; used as a marker only).  \n- Choose a non-5 source pattern (often a nearby/repeating motif such as a monochrome object like 2 or 7, or a multi-color cluster like 4/8/9).  \n- Crop/extract a template (e.g., a 2-column strip or a 3-wide hollow-square row motif).  \n- Fit to the 5-box size by padding/tiling (possible: pad rows by repeating the row\u2019s rightmost value; tile vertically by repeating the motif).  \n- Keep only the template\u2019s colors (e.g., {2,0} or {7,0} or {4,8,9,0}); all other colors \u2192 0.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Solution and Thought Process for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process on this ARC task. The user wants me to solve it based on examples and a provided description. I'll need to use these hints, but also verify the information against the examples.\n\n**Initial Analysis and Understanding**\nI need to first understand the problem, looking at the input, and then create the desired output.\n**Example 1**:\nI began by analyzing Example 1, noting the background (0), the markers (Color 5), and the patterns. I recognized a pattern of shapes repeating horizontally in the \"Source Pattern\" area. After closely examining the grid slice of the input and the provided text for Example 1, I noticed that the output was related to an element inside the source pattern. I found that the output appeared to use a rule to create each block. I then compared this object with the 5 marker's size to see how it might be adapted. I noted the size change and realized there must be some transformation, as described in the problem.\n\n**Example 2**:\nI also looked at Example 2. I determined the bounding box of the 5-markers. I determined the output size, in this case, a rectangle. The output was 14 rows, 2 columns. I compared this with the output. In the process, I found out the source of the shapes that build the output. In this example, I was able to observe the use of an adjacent source pattern.\n\n**Hypotheses and Verification**\nI made the following assumption:\n1.  Identify the bounding box of the 5s (H, W).\n2.  Identify the \"source object.\"\n3.  Extract the slice of the source object corresponding to the rows of the 5-box.\n4.  For each row in the extracted slice:\n    *   If the width of the slice is less than W, extend it.\n    *   Rule for extension: Repeat the last pixel value to fill the width.\nI tested the \"repeat last pixel\" rule to see if that works. I continued, and started to refine this idea.\n\n**Generalization and Refinement**\nFrom the examples, the user description became very important.\n*   Horizontal Padding: The rule for handling the width difference is to extend the pattern by repeating the rightmost value (padding with the rightmost value).\n*   Vertical Tiling: To deal with a height difference, the pattern should be tiled vertically (repeat the motif).\nI looked at the text to see if the horizontal or vertical padding or tiling applied.\nTo determine how to do horizontal padding. I looked at Ex 1:\nThe source object was padded with the rightmost.\n\n**Test Input Analysis**\n*   This input had a set of 5-markers.\n*   This also had a series of 4 and 6 objects.\n\n**Template Extraction and Mapping**\nI determined that the relevant template was the one adjacent to the 5-markers. This was the source of the patterned block.\nI extracted the grid slice and started working out how to adjust the grid. After extraction, I determined the number of columns to extend and the rightmost character to use for horizontal padding. I applied vertical and horizontal pattern repetition using the rules to determine the result.\n\n**Solution Verification and Final Thoughts**\nThe analysis pointed to a specific pattern, derived from the 4-blocks, with the correct output pattern.\nI made a few final checks of the output with my previous determinations.\nThe solution and process seemed consistent with the previous examples.\nI think I've arrived at the correct solution.\nI checked with the \"repeat motif\" idea and that gave an inconsistent pattern.\n\nFinal Output:\n4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,4\n4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we first analyze the solved examples to establish the transformation rules.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Identify the Marker (5-cells):**\n    -   In all examples, clusters of color 5 act as a bounding box definition for the output grid.\n    -   Example 1: The 5s form a 3x6 bounding box. Output is 3x6.\n    -   Example 2: The 5s form a 14x2 bounding box. Output is 14x2.\n    -   Example 3: The 5s form a 17x3 bounding box. Output is 17x3.\n    -   **Rule:** Calculate the bounding box of all 5-cells in the input (minRow to maxRow, minCol to maxCol). The output grid size is `(maxRow-minRow+1)` rows by `(maxCol-minCol+1)` columns.\n\n2.  **Identify the Source Pattern:**\n    -   The content of the output is derived from a \"source object\" in the input, which is a non-5 pattern usually located near the 5-markers (often immediately below or to the left).\n    -   The transformation keeps only the colors of this source template (and background 0).\n    -   Example 1: Source is a 3x3 object (Cyan 2).\n    -   Example 2: Source is a 2-wide vertical strip (Multi-color 9/8/4).\n    -   Example 3: Source is a 3-wide object (Orange 7).\n\n3.  **Transformation Logic (Cropping and Padding):**\n    -   **Vertical Fit:** If the source object's height is different from the output height, we tile the source rows vertically. (e.g., Ex 3 tiles the 5-row pattern to fill 17 rows). If the source is taller, we crop it (or use the top rows).\n    -   **Horizontal Fit:** If the source object's width is different from the output width, we pad the rows.\n    -   **Padding Rule:** Based on Example 1, horizontal extension is done by repeating the **rightmost value** of the row (padding), rather than repeating the pattern from the beginning. In Ex 1, the row `2,0,0` (width 3) became `2,0,0,0,0,0` (width 6), which implies padding with the last value `0`.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n1.  **Bounding Box:**\n    -   Find 5s in Test Input.\n    -   Row 11: 5s at Cols 7, 8, 27.\n    -   Row 12: 5s at Cols 7, 27, 28.\n    -   Min Row: 11, Max Row: 12 -> Height = 2.\n    -   Min Col: 7, Max Col: 28 -> Width = 22.\n    -   **Output Size:** 2 rows, 22 columns.\n\n2.  **Source Pattern:**\n    -   The nearest non-5 object is the yellow (4) \"ladder\" pattern starting at Row 14.\n    -   The object spans Rows 14-16.\n    -   We need 2 rows for the output, so we take the top 2 rows of the source object (Rows 14 and 15).\n    -   The object spans Cols 5-24. Width = 20.\n\n3.  **Constructing Output:**\n    -   **Row 0:** Corresponds to Source Row 14 (Cols 5-24).\n        -   Sequence: `4,0,0,0,4` repeated 4 times.

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nBackground is usually color 0. Foreground objects include monochrome bars/lines and border/frame pieces (often with color-0 holes), repeated hollow \u201cladder\u201d-style patterned blocks, glyph-like bar-and-stroke polyominoes, tiny isolated markers (single pixels/pairs/small clusters, often color 5), a dense interlocking multi-color cluster using colors such as 4/8/9, and a thin 2-column vertical strip containing stacked paired colors (e.g., 9/8/4 with occasional 0).\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Treat 0 as background.  \n- Find all 5-cells; output grid size = bounding box of 5 (height = maxRow5-minRow5+1, width = maxCol5-minCol5+1).  \n- 5 is not copied to the output (removed/replaced by 0; used as a marker only).  \n- Choose a non-5 source pattern (often a nearby/repeating motif such as a monochrome object like 2 or 7, or a multi-color cluster like 4/8/9).  \n- Crop/extract a template (e.g., a 2-column strip or a 3-wide hollow-square row motif).  \n- Fit to the 5-box size by padding/tiling (possible: pad rows by repeating the row\u2019s rightmost value; tile vertically by repeating the motif).  \n- Keep only the template\u2019s colors (e.g., {2,0} or {7,0} or {4,8,9,0}); all other colors \u2192 0.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to:\n1. Find the bounding box defined by the 5-colored cells (markers)\n2. Identify the source pattern to use\n3. Tile/crop that pattern to fit the bounding box dimensions\n\n**Finding the 5-markers:**\n- Row 11: 5s at columns 7, 8, and 27\n- Row 12: 5s at columns 7, 26, and 27\n\nBounding box: rows 11-12 (2 rows), columns 7-27 (21 columns)\n**Output dimensions: 2 rows \u00d7 21 columns**\n\n**Identifying the source pattern:**\nThe nearest non-5 pattern is the 4-colored pattern at rows 14-16. Since I need only 2 rows, I'll use rows 14-15 (closest to the 5-markers).\n\n**Analyzing the 4-pattern structure:**\nLooking at rows 14-15 of the input:\n- Row 14: Has 4s at positions forming pattern `4,0,0,0,4` with period 5\n- Row 15: Has 4s at positions forming pattern `4,4,0,4,4` with period 5\n\n**Tiling to fit 21 columns starting at column 7:**\nSince column 7 corresponds to position 2 in the repeating 5-column cycle (starting from column 5):\n\nFor row 14 (base: 4,0,0,0,4), starting at position 2:\n- Positions cycle: 0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0\n\nFor row 15 (base: 4,4,0,4,4), starting at position 2:\n- Positions cycle: 0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0\n\n**Output:**\n```\n0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0\n0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0\n```",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nBackground is usually color 0. Foreground objects include monochrome bars/lines and border/frame pieces (often with color-0 holes), repeated hollow \u201cladder\u201d-style patterned blocks, glyph-like bar-and-stroke polyominoes, tiny isolated markers (single pixels/pairs/small clusters, often color 5), a dense interlocking multi-color cluster using colors such as 4/8/9, and a thin 2-column vertical strip containing stacked paired colors (e.g., 9/8/4 with occasional 0).\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Treat 0 as background.  \n- Find all 5-cells; output grid size = bounding box of 5 (height = maxRow5-minRow5+1, width = maxCol5-minCol5+1).  \n- 5 is not copied to the output (removed/replaced by 0; used as a marker only).  \n- Choose a non-5 source pattern (often a nearby/repeating motif such as a monochrome object like 2 or 7, or a multi-color cluster like 4/8/9).  \n- Crop/extract a template (e.g., a 2-column strip or a 3-wide hollow-square row motif).  \n- Fit to the 5-box size by padding/tiling (possible: pad rows by repeating the row\u2019s rightmost value; tile vertically by repeating the motif).  \n- Keep only the template\u2019s colors (e.g., {2,0} or {7,0} or {4,8,9,0}); all other colors \u2192 0.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "### How the transformation works\n\n1. **Use color 5 only as a marker.**  \n   Find all cells with value **5** and compute their **bounding box**.  \n   The **output grid size** is exactly this bounding box size.\n\n2. **Do not copy any 5s into the output.**  \n   The 5s only define the output dimensions.\n\n3. **Choose the source pattern to place into the output.**  \n   In the test input, the first substantial repeating foreground motif (ignoring 5s) is the large **color\u20114 patterned block** (the 3-row structure starting at row 14).  \n   Since the output height is **2**, we take the **top 2 rows** of that block\u2019s bounding box as the template.\n\n4. **Fit the template to the marker-box width by padding to the right.**  \n   The color\u20114 block\u2019s bounding box is **20 columns** wide, but the 5\u2011box is **21 columns** wide, so we **pad one extra column** by repeating each row\u2019s **rightmost value** (which is 4 in both rows).\n\n5. **Keep only the template\u2019s colors (4 and 0).**  \n   Other colors (like 6) are not part of the chosen template, so they do not appear in the output.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4\n4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4,4,0,4,4,4",

The foreground objects are typically **orthogonally connected, blocky pixel shapes** aligned to the grid.\n\nCommon object types and attributes seen across the grids:\n\n- **Solid bars / line segments**: 1-cell-thick horizontal or vertical runs of a single color (sometimes spanning most/all of a row), and thicker bar-like pieces forming borders.\n- **Border/frame-like shapes**: rectangular outlines or partial outlines (e.g., \u201cU\u201d-like or \u201cL\u201d-like borders) made of a single color, enclosing **interior holes of color 0**.\n- **Hollow patterned blocks (\u201cladder\u201d/striped motifs)**: small repeated motifs built from a single color where rows/columns alternate between filled segments and gaps (color 0), producing shapes with **internal voids** and a **regular, gridlike structure**.\n- **Glyph-like polyominoes made of bars**: compact shapes consisting of a **vertical spine plus horizontal strokes**, producing letter/digit-like silhouettes; often repeated with different colors and positioned with spacing between them.\n- **Tiny markers**: isolated **single pixels** and **small clusters** (pairs, short segments, small corner shapes, and occasional 2\u00d72-like blocks), frequently appearing apart from larger structures.\n- **Dense multi-color composite clusters**: areas where multiple colors (notably combinations including **4, 8, 9**) appear in a tightly packed, often symmetric arrangement, built from many small sub-blocks (single cells, 1\u00d72/2\u00d71 pieces, 2\u00d72 chunks) that interlock spatially.\n- **Narrow strip / path-like arrangement**: a very thin (2-column) layout where colors (notably **9, 8, 4**, with occasional **0**) form a stacked sequence of adjacent pairs, creating a stepwise, segmented vertical pattern.\n\n<objects_summary>Background is usually color 0.

Foreground objects include monochrome bars/lines and border/frame pieces (often with color-0 holes), repeated hollow \u201cladder\u201d-style patterned blocks, glyph-like bar-and-stroke polyominoes, tiny isolated markers (single pixels/pairs/small clusters, often color 5), a dense interlocking multi-color cluster using colors such as 4/8/9, and a thin 2-column vertical strip containing stacked paired colors (e.g., 9/8/4 with occasional 0).",
                "response": "### Transformations that appear to be used (all examples)\n\n1. **Identify background**\n   - Treat **0** as the background / empty space.\n\n2. **Use the pixels of value `5` as \u201cmarkers\u201d (not as content)**\n   - Find all cells with value **5**.\n   - Compute the **bounding box of all 5-cells**:\n     - `top = min(row of 5)`, `bottom = max(row of 5)`\n     - `left = min(col of 5)`, `right = max(col of 5)`\n   - **Output grid size** is exactly:\n     - `height = bottom - top + 1`\n     - `width  = right - left + 1`\n   - The value **5 does not appear in the output** (it is effectively discarded / replaced by **0** / only used for sizing & indexing).\n\n3. **Select a \u201csource\u201d pattern from non-`5` foreground objects**\n   - All other nonzero objects besides **5** are candidates (monochrome objects like **2** or **7**, or a multi-color cluster like **4/8/9**).\n   - Observed plausible selection strategies (could be one or a combination):\n     - Choose the **nearest** major foreground pattern to the 5-bounding-box (often immediately left of it).\n     - Choose a pattern whose **natural width equals** the output width (or a divisor/multiple relation exists).\n     - Choose a **repeating motif** (e.g., hollow-square/ladder motif) and use it as a template.\n\n4. **Extract/crop a template from the chosen source**\n   - Common extraction operations:\n     - Crop the source object to its **own bounding box**.\n     - Take a **vertical strip** of fixed width (e.g., 2 columns) from a larger patterned cluster.\n     - Take a **minimal repeating unit** (e.g., a 3-wide hollow-square row motif).\n\n5. **Fit the template into the output-size rectangle**\n   - If the template is smaller than the marker-box size, observed possible ways to fill:\n     - **Horizontal padding/extension** to reach the required width:\n       - In at least one case, padding can be done by **repeating the last (rightmost) cell value of each row** until the row reaches the output width (so rows ending in **2** extend with **2**, rows ending in **0** extend with **0**).\n     - **Vertical repetition/tiling** of a row-motif to reach the required height (e.g., alternating `7,7,7` and `7,0,7` rows).\n     - **Pattern completion**: when a copied strip would run into missing/0 area, fill remaining rows by **continuing the observed periodic sequence** rather than leaving pure 0s.\n\n6. **Color filtering / remapping**\n   - Only keep the colors that belong to the selected source pattern plus **0**.\n   - All unrelated colors are removed (set to **0**).\n   - **5 is removed** (never kept as output content).\n\n---\n\n### Example-specific observed transformations\n\n#### Example 1\n- **Output size** = bounding box of all **5** pixels \u2192 `3\u00d76`.\n- **Output colors** only `{0,2}`:\n  - All colors **1/4/5** are discarded (\u2192 **0**) or ignored.\n- The produced `3\u00d76` pattern can plausibly come from the **2-colored object** by:\n  - Extracting a `3\u00d73` template from the **rows aligned with the marker-box height** (the rows where the 2-object shows the \u201cbar / bar-with-hole / bar\u201d structure).\n  - **Extending each row to width 6** by padding to the right; a consistent method that matches the output is:\n    - pad each row by **repeating its rightmost cell** until reaching width 6 (rows ending with **2** become all **2**; rows ending with **0** stay padded with **0**).\n\n#### Example 2\n- **Output size** = bounding box of all **5** pixels \u2192 `14\u00d72`.\n- **Output colors** are `{0,4,8,9}`; all **5** are removed.\n- Output looks like a **2-column vertical strip** derived from the large repeating multi-color cluster:\n  - Likely extraction of a **2-column slice** (often the rightmost usable 2 columns adjacent to the marker region) across the marker-defined row span.\n  - If the slice would hit background in some rows, the strip may be **completed by continuing the repeating pair sequence** (instead of outputting only **0,0**), yielding a full `14\u00d72` list of pairs.\n\n#### Example 3\n- **Output size** = bounding box of all **5** pixels \u2192 `17\u00d73`.\n- **Output colors** only `{0,7}`; all other colors (**2/3/5**) removed.\n- Output is a vertical \u201cladder\u201d/hollow-square-row motif:\n  - Repeats alternating rows `7,7,7` and `7,0,7` to reach height 17.\n  - Can be produced by extracting a `3`-wide template from an existing **7** hollow-square motif and **tiling it vertically** to match the marker-box height.\n\n---\n\n<transformation_summary>\n- Treat 0 as background.  \n- Find all 5-cells; output grid size = bounding box of 5 (height = maxRow5-minRow5+1, width = maxCol5-minCol5+1).  \n- 5 is not copied to the output (removed/replaced by 0; used as a marker only).  \n- Choose a non-5 source pattern (often a nearby/repeating motif such as a monochrome object like 2 or 7, or a multi-color cluster like 4/8/9).  \n- Crop/extract a template (e.g., a 2-column strip or a 3-wide hollow-square row motif).  \n- Fit to the 5-box size by padding/tiling (possible: pad rows by repeating the row\u2019s rightmost value; tile vertically by repeating the motif).  \n- Keep only the template\u2019s colors (e.g., {2,0} or {7,0} or {4,8,9,0}); all other colors \u2192 0.\n</transformation_summary>",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nBackground is usually color 0. Foreground objects include monochrome bars/lines and border/frame pieces (often with color-0 holes), repeated hollow \u201cladder\u201d-style patterned blocks, glyph-like bar-and-stroke polyominoes, tiny isolated markers (single pixels/pairs/small clusters, often color 5), a dense interlocking multi-color cluster using colors such as 4/8/9, and a thin 2-column vertical strip containing stacked paired colors (e.g., 9/8/4 with occasional 0).\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n- Treat 0 as background.  \n- Find all 5-cells; output grid size = bounding box of 5 (height = maxRow5-minRow5+1, width = maxCol5-minCol5+1).  \n- 5 is not copied to the output (removed/replaced by 0; used as a marker only).  \n- Choose a non-5 source pattern (often a nearby/repeating motif such as a monochrome object like 2 or 7, or a multi-color cluster like 4/8/9).  \n- Crop/extract a template (e.g., a 2-column strip or a 3-wide hollow-square row motif).  \n- Fit to the 5-box size by padding/tiling (possible: pad rows by repeating the row\u2019s rightmost value; tile vertically by repeating the motif).  \n- Keep only the template\u2019s colors (e.g., {2,0} or {7,0} or {4,8,9,0}); all other colors \u2192 0.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
