The output keeps the same size and uses 8 everywhere except for a reconstructed figure.\n2. In each example there is a distinctive **\u201chub\u201d**: a **2\u00d72 block of background (8)** with **four 2-cell colored markers** around it:\n   - top: a **horizontal** 2-cell segment  \n   - bottom: a **horizontal** 2-cell segment  \n   - left: a **vertical** 2-cell segment  \n   - right: a **vertical** 2-cell segment\n3. Only the **four hub colors** matter. All other colors in the input are discarded (set to background).\n4. For each hub color, there is one additional \u201cpiece\u201d of that color elsewhere in the grid.  \n   The task is to **move each piece to the hub**, attaching it on the side indicated by the marker:\n   - top color\u2019s piece goes **above** the top marker\n   - bottom color\u2019s piece goes **below** the bottom marker\n   - left color\u2019s piece goes **left** of the left marker\n   - right color\u2019s piece goes **right** of the right marker\n5.

What *actually* happened?\"\n  3. **Verdict:** \"Do they match?\"\n- **Fatal Contradictions to Watch For:**\n  * **Scope Error:** Rule applies to specific colors (e.g., \"Blue\"), but the example changes \"Red\" pixels.\n  * **Geometry Error:** Rule says \"rotate 90,\" but example shows a flip.\n  * **Object Error:** Rule treats pixels individually, but example shows objects moving as blocks.\n- *Constraint:* Record exactly how many Solved Examples the candidate PASSED vs FAILED. **Do not stop at the first failure**; check all examples to determine the severity of the failure (e.g., \"Passed 2/3 Examples\").\n\n### PHASE 3: EXECUTION CONSISTENCY\n- For Candidates that survived Phase 2 (or passed at least one example):\n- Look at the {{TEST_INPUT}} and the Candidate's <PROPOSED_SOLUTION> grid.\n- Does the proposed output actually follow the Crystallized Rule?\n- *Common Hallucination:* The text says \"Move Blue,\" but the grid shows Blue staying still. Mark this as **INTERNAL_CONTRADICTION**.\n\n### PHASE 4: STACK RANKING & TIE-BREAKING\n- Rank ALL candidates from Best to Worst based on this hierarchy:\n  1. **GOLD (Tier 1):** Passed ALL Solved Examples + Consistent Execution on Test Input.\n  2. **SILVER (Tier 2):** Passed ALL Solved Examples + Minor Execution Error on Test Input.\n  3. **BRONZE (Tier 3):** Passed MOST Solved Examples (Partial Logic).\n  4. **INVALID (Tier 4):** Failed ALL/MOST Solved Examples, Vague Reasoning, or Severe Internal Contradictions.\n\n- **Tie-Breaking:** If two candidates are in the same Tier, rank the one with the **Simplest Rule** (Occam's Razor) higher.\n</AUDIT_PROTOCOL>\n\n<OUTPUT_FORMAT>\nReturn a single JSON object with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 8.7,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Partial\"\n          /* add more keys if there are more training examples */\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Rule matches main behaviors across examples; minor ambiguity in example 3.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Short, 1-3 sentence description of this candidate's representative rule.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 1,\n      \"score\": 6.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Partial\",\n          \"2\": \"Fail\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Contradiction in example 2; seems overfit\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</OUTPUT_FORMAT>",
                "response": "**Here's my thought process after auditing the two candidate solutions for the ARC puzzle.**\n\nI'm analyzing two proposed solutions, and it's clear I need to understand the underlying transformation rule. I began by meticulously examining the provided examples, especially focusing on the \"Ground Truth\" to identify the pattern used to convert the inputs to the outputs. I'm focusing on the colors and the shapes. I noticed each \"example\" has an identifiable frame and some other shapes scattered around.\n\nI went through example 1 first. I paid close attention to where shapes are. I was able to locate the central frame's characteristics in all three examples provided. I'm trying to identify a concrete rule for each example. I started by looking for similarities. The output shape attached to each frame is transformed from the scattered input shapes. The numbers/colors play a key role.\n\nI carefully checked the alignment of the shapes with their corresponding colors in both the input and output. I'm searching for the hidden operation that dictates these transformations. I started forming my first tentative hypotheses regarding what is happening. The shape outside the frame is somehow moved to the frame. The colors in the frame correspond to the other shape.\n\nI continued working on the other examples. This is giving me better data for comparison. I was able to recognize how shapes are moved to the central frame. The rules seem consistent across the examples. I now have a solid guess at what the pattern is. I then looked at the two candidate solutions and started thinking about where they make mistakes.\n\nI realized that the \"Ground Truth\" is the key. I reviewed my notes to build a framework for the problem. I need to identify what the pattern is. I then looked at the proposed patterns and began working on the input from the problem statement to test whether I correctly understood what was happening. This involved going back and forth between the statements of the pattern and how it applies to the test input.\n\nI then tested each of the candidates to see if they fit the pattern. One of them failed because it produced a very wrong pattern. The second one looked like it was correct. So I reviewed the candidates to work on my selection. I need to select the winning candidate.\n\nI went back and forth, thinking about the specific transformation steps in each example to develop and understand my mental model of the process. I had to compare the \"rotate bounding box\" to the shape of an input. I had to look at each case to see what the shape was in both states, input and output. I went back and fourth on the examples to verify what was going on. I had to do multiple comparisons and I had to verify each one with the candidates.\n\nI realized I should try both of the candidate solutions and see if I understood what was happening. One solution did not work, and the second one worked. The second one's implementation was consistent with its logic. One of them worked, and the other did not.\n\nI then reviewed how the candidate was doing its analysis and thought about how to describe the rule. The rule is basically that a shape is rotated until it attaches to the central frame. The second one looked like it rotated the shapes.\n\nMy overall impression is that candidate 2 will be more accurate than candidate 1. I had to check all the test cases and had to test out what was happening in each case and where candidate 1 made mistakes. I had to examine many specific test cases.\n\nI will formulate my conclusions and provide feedback.\n\n\n<AUDIT_LOG>\n1.  **GROUND TRUTH ANALYSIS**:\n    *   **The System**: A central \"Frame\" (2x2 empty center surrounded by four 2-cell colored bars) dictates the puzzle. Scattered shapes match these bar colors.\n    *   **The Task**: Move each scattered shape to attach to its corresponding color bar on the Frame.\n    *   **The Transformation**: The key is *how* they attach.\n        *   **Example 1**: The '2' shape (4x2 bounding box) transforms into a 3x2 shape attached to the vertical '2' bar. This implies rotation. The '3' shape (U-shape) attaches to the vertical '3' bar and matches a 90\u00b0 CW rotation.\n        *   **Example 2**: The '3' shape (trapezoid) attaches to the horizontal '3' bar but is *flipped/rotated 180\u00b0* to present its flat 2-cell edge to the frame. The '1' shape attaches to the vertical '1' bar and rotates 90\u00b0 to present a 2-cell edge (Input 4x3 -> Output 2x4).\n        *   **Example 3**: Confirms the pattern. Shapes are rotated/flipped specifically to align a **matching 2-cell edge** with the Frame's connector.\n    *   **Rule Crystallization**: \"Identify the Frame. For each matching colored shape, find its 2-cell flat edge. Rotate/Flip the shape so this edge connects to the Frame. Discard unused colors.\"\n\n2.  **CANDIDATE 1 AUDIT**:\n    *   **Logic**: \"Rotate each shape 90 degrees clockwise.\"\n    *   **Falsification**:\n        *   **Example 1**: Fails. The '2' shape input is 4x2. If rotated 90\u00b0 CW, it becomes 2x4. The official output '2' shape is 3x2. Simple 90\u00b0 rotation does not account for this geometry.\n        *   **Example 2**: Fails. The '3' shape requires a 180\u00b0 flip (or vertical flip), not 90\u00b0 rotation, to align the connector.\n    *   **Verdict**: **INVALID**. The rule is too rigid and contradicted by the evidence.\n\n3.  **CANDIDATE 2 AUDIT**:\n    *   **Logic**: \"Rotate/flip this source pattern so that its 2-cell 'connector' lies on the side that will touch the marker.\"\n    *   **Verification**:\n        *   **Example 1 & 2**: This logic perfectly explains why Ex 2's '3' shape flips (to put the 2-cell edge on the bottom) and why Ex 2's '1' shape rotates (to put the 2-cell edge on the right). It handles the adaptive nature of the transformation.\n    *   **Test Execution**:\n        *   **1-shape (Diamond)**: Needs bottom connector for Top Frame. Candidate rotates it 90\u00b0 to create a 2-cell flat bottom. Correct.\n        *   **2-shape**: Needs Left connector for Right Frame. Candidate rotates/flips to align the 2-cell top edge to the left. Correct.\n        *   **4-shape**: Needs Right connector for Left Frame. Input has a valid connector, but Candidate rotates it to use the \"bottom\" connector (making the shape 2-wide). This is consistent with Ex 2's behavior of minimizing width/aligning the main axis. Plausible.\n        *   **6-shape**: Needs Top connector for Bottom Frame. Candidate rotates the shape to align a 2-cell edge. Correct.\n    *   **Verdict**: **GOLD**. The logic captures the subtle \"alignment\" constraint missed by Candidate 1.\n\n4.  **RANKING**:\n    *   **Candidate 2** (Tier 1 - Gold): Correct logic, consistent execution.\n    *   **Candidate 1** (Tier 4 - Invalid): Disproven by Example 1.\n</AUDIT_LOG>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 2,\n      \"score\": 9.5,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Correctly identifies that rotation is conditional on aligning a 2-cell 'connector' edge to the frame, explaining all rigid body transformations in the examples.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"High\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Identify the central frame and surrounding shapes.

- a cross-like pattern with 4 different colored markers indicating top, bottom, left, and right edges\n2. **Find shapes elsewhere** that match each marker color\n3. **Rotate each shape 90 degrees clockwise**\n4. **Place the rotated shapes** adjacent to their corresponding frame markers, extending outward\n5. **Remove the original scattered shapes**, keeping only the frame with placed shapes\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\n\nCentral frame at rows 10-13, cols 13-16:\n- TOP (1): row 10, cols 14-15\n- BOTTOM (6): row 13, cols 14-15  \n- LEFT (4): rows 11-12, col 13\n- RIGHT (2): rows 11-12, col 16\n\nShapes to transform:\n- **1-shape** (rows 1-4, cols 17-19): rotates to 3\u00d74\n- **2-shape** (rows 3-6, cols 2-5): rotates to 4\u00d74\n- **4-shape** (rows 14-16, cols 20-23): rotates to 4\u00d73\n- **6-shape** (rows 17-22, cols 9-12): rotates to 4\u00d76\n\nAfter rotating 90\u00b0 clockwise and placing:\n- 1-shape extends upward from the frame (rows 7-9)\n- 4-shape extends

<EXPLANATION>\nLooking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Central Cross Structure**: Each input has a \"cross\" made of 4 colored edges (top, bottom, left, right) surrounding a 2x2 center.\n\n2. **Scattered Shapes**: There are shapes scattered around the grid matching the colors of the cross edges.\n\n3. **Transformation**: \n   - Each scattered shape whose color matches a cross edge gets rotated 90\u00b0 clockwise\n   - The rotated shape is placed adjacent to its corresponding edge, extending outward\n   - Scattered shapes with colors NOT in the cross are removed\n   - The entire result is centered on the original cross position\n\n**For the test input:**\n\n- **Cross structure** (rows 10-13, cols 13-16):\n  - Top (row 10): 1,1 at cols 14-15\n  - Left (rows 11-12): 4 at col 13\n  - Right (rows 11-12): 2 at col 16\n  - Bottom (row 13): 6,6 at cols 14-15\n\n- **Matching scattered shapes to rotate and attach:**\n  - Color 1 (rows 1-4): rotates and extends upward from top edge\n  - Color 4 (rows 14-16): rotates and extends leftward from left edge\n  - Color 2 (rows 3-6): rotates and extends rightward from right edge\n  - Color 6 (rows 17-22): rotates and extends downward from bottom edge\n  - Color 3 (rows 13-15): NOT in cross, gets removed\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,1,1,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,4,8,8,2,8,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,4,8,8,2,8,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,6,6,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```\n

The output keeps the same grid size and is mostly background.\n\n2. In each input there is a special **\u201ccross frame\u201d**:\n   - a **2\u00d72 background (8) empty center**, and\n   - four **2-cell markers** around it:\n     - **north**: a horizontal 2-cell segment,\n     - **south**: a horizontal 2-cell segment,\n     - **west**: a vertical 2-cell segment,\n     - **east**: a vertical 2-cell segment.  \n   These four markers have four different colors.\n\n3. For each marker color, there is another group of pixels of the **same color elsewhere** in the grid (the \u201csource piece\u201d).\n   - Take **all pixels of that color excluding the 2-cell marker**, and take their **bounding-box pattern** (it may be disconnected).\n   - **Rotate/flip** this source pattern so that its **2-cell \u201cconnector\u201d** lies on the side that will touch the marker:\n     - north arm: connector on the **bottom** edge,\n     - south arm: connector on the **top** edge,\n     - west arm: connector on the **right** edge,\n     - east arm: connector on the **left** edge.\n   - **Attach** the transformed source pattern **adjacent** to the marker **away from the center** (do not overlap the marker), aligning the connector with the marker\u2019s two cells.\n\n4. **Erase everything else** (all original source pieces disappear from their original positions). The output contains only the rebuilt enlarged cross.\n\n---\n\n### Applied to the test input\nThe 2\u00d72 empty center is at rows 11\u201312 and cols 14\u201315 (0-based), with markers:\n- North marker: color `1`\n- West marker: color `4`\n- East marker: color `2`\n- South marker: color `6`\n\nEach corresponding source piece is rotated to present a matching 2-cell connector on the correct side, then attached outward from its marker.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"B\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_2_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n### How to infer the rule\n\n1. **Background** is color **8** (almost the whole grid). The output keeps the same size and uses 8 everywhere except for a reconstructed figure.\n2. In each example there is a distinctive **\u201chub\u201d**: a **2\u00d72 block of background (8)** with **four 2-cell colored markers** around it:\n   - top: a **horizontal** 2-cell segment  \n   - bottom: a **horizontal** 2-cell segment  \n   - left: a **vertical** 2-cell segment  \n   - right: a **vertical** 2-cell segment\n3. Only the **four hub colors** matter. All other colors in the input are discarded (set to background).\n4. For each hub color, there is one additional \u201cpiece\u201d of that color elsewhere in the grid.  \n   The task is to **move each piece to the hub**, attaching it on the side indicated by the marker:\n   - top color\u2019s piece goes **above** the top marker\n   - bottom color\u2019s piece goes **below** the bottom marker\n   - left color\u2019s piece goes **left** of the left marker\n   - right color\u2019s piece goes **right** of the right marker\n5. Before attaching, each piece is **rotated (and if needed flipped)** so that the edge touching the hub is \u201cnarrow\u201d:\n   - for left/right attachments: in the piece column closest to the hub, the **top and bottom** rows are empty (so it only connects through the middle, matching the 2-cell marker)\n   - for top/bottom attachments: in the piece row closest to the hub, only the **two central cells** (aligned with the marker) are filled\n\n### Applying to the test\nThe hub is at rows **12\u201313**, cols **15\u201316** (all 8), with markers:\n- top = **1** at row 11, cols 15\u201316\n- bottom = **6** at row 14, cols 15\u201316\n- left = **4** at col 14, rows 12\u201313\n- right = **2** at col 17, rows 12\u201313\n\nWe move and rotate the other 1/2/4/6 pieces to attach to these markers and erase everything else.\n\n---\n\n## Output

one bar above (top),\n   - one below (bottom),\n   - one to the left (left),\n   - one to the right (right).\n\n2. **Only keep those four colors** (the colors of the four bars).  \n   Every other non\u20118 color in the grid is turned into 8.\n\n3. For each of the four kept colors:\n   - Keep the **bar** that is part of the frame in its original place.\n   - Take **all other pixels** of that color elsewhere in the grid, and **move them** to the corresponding side of the frame:\n     - the top-color object attaches **above** the top bar,\n     - the bottom-color object attaches **below** the bottom bar,\n     - the left-color object attaches **left** of the left bar,\n     - the right-color object attaches **right** of the right bar.\n   - You may **rotate/reflect** the moved shape so that the side that touches the bar matches a **length\u20112 attaching segment**, then translate it so it **touches** the bar while the central 2\u00d72 hole stays 8.\n\n---\n\n### Applying this to the test input\n\n- The unique 2\u00d72 hole of 8 is at **rows 11\u201312, cols 14\u201315** (0\u2011indexed).\n- The surrounding bars are:\n  - **Top bar**: color **1** at row 10, cols 14\u201315\n  - **Left bar**: color **4** at rows 11\u201312, col 13\n  - **Right bar**: color **2** at rows 11\u201312, col 16\n  - **Bottom bar**: color **6** at row 13, cols 14\u201315\n\nSo we remove all **3s**, and relocate the other objects of colors **1,2,4,6** to attach to their respective sides (with rotations as needed).\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,4,8,8,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,4,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n</CANDIDATES>\n\n<INSTRUCTIONS>\nYou must behave as an AUDITOR, not a solver.\n\nYour overall goal:\n- For each candidate, choose a representative explanation and treat it as that\n  candidate's proposed rule.\n- Audit that rule against all training examples.\n- Check whether the candidate's predicted test OUTPUT_GRID actually follows\n  that rule.\n- Assign each candidate a score from 0 to 10 and rank all candidates.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\nSTEP 1 -- CHOOSE A REPRESENTATIVE RULE PER CANDIDATE\nFor each CANDIDATE:\n\n  1. It may have multiple ANSWER blocks, all with the same OUTPUT_GRID.\n  2. Among its ANSWERs, choose a \"representative explanation\":\n     - Prefer the explanation that is:\n       - most complete,\n       - least self-contradictory,\n       - easiest to understand.\n  3. Treat that explanation as the candidate's rule. \n  4. Treat the OUTPUT_GRID from any ANSWER as the candidate's predicted\n     test output (they are guaranteed identical within that candidate).\n\nSTEP 2 -- EXAMPLE CONSISTENCY AUDIT (DO NOT USE THE TEST INPUT HERE)\nFor each candidate's representative rule:\n\n  1. Using only the training examples:\n     For each TRAIN_EXAMPLE (in index order: 1, 2, 3, ...):\n\n       - Check whether the described rule correctly explains the transformation\n         from that example's INPUT_GRID to OUTPUT_GRID.\n\n       - Be strict:\n         * If the explanation states a universal rule that is clearly violated\n           by any training example, mark that as a serious contradiction.\n         * If the explanation fails to mention an obvious systematic behavior\n           visible in multiple examples, note that as a weakness.\n\n     For each training example, assign:\n       - \"Pass\": fits the example with no obvious contradictions.\n       - \"Partial\": roughly fits but has ambiguities or minor mismatches.\n       - \"Fail\": clear contradiction with that example.\n\n  2. Summarize, across all training examples:\n     - How well does this rule fit the *set* of training examples taken together?\n     - Does the rule feel overfitted, overcomplicated, or ad hoc?\n\nSTEP 3 -- RULE-TO-TEST-GRID CONSISTENCY\nFor each candidate:\n\n  1.

                "response": "**Audit: Two ARC Task Solutions**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to review two potential solutions for an ARC problem. It's a \"Connect to Hub\" task, where we've got a central hub, and we need to figure out how to attach scattered shapes to it based on their color and position. Let's dig in.\n\nThe first thing I'm doing is going through the example training data. I'm carefully examining the inputs and outputs, trying to identify any patterns or rules that seem to govern the transformations. I'm focusing on the color relationships, the shape positions, and how they map to the final output. The main goal here is to grasp the core principle of the problem.\n\nFor example, I'm analyzing the frame colors, the scattered shapes, and how they relate to the output hub's frame. It looks like the goal is to shift shapes of the same color to the edge markers. A key aspect is the shape rotation. The problem is, sometimes there is no corresponding shape (like the color 1 on example 1) and a simple shift isn't enough - rotation seems to be a part of the rule.\n\nI'm now diving into the Test Input. Based on this analysis of train data and rule extraction, the key is to move the shapes and possibly perform an operation (rotation?). I am looking for the operation needed to be performed on the shapes so they connect to the markers.\n\nNow, I'm checking the candidates, going through their solutions step-by-step. I'm critically evaluating their explanations, particularly their proposed rules. I'm comparing those rules against the training data to see if they hold up. The crucial thing here is to look at each candidate's proposed rule and see how it works on the shapes in the test input to find issues.\n\nCandidate 1's rule is to rotate each shape 90 degrees clockwise. This sounds like an easy answer to find and easy to check. Let's see if this always works, though. I am checking if rotating the shapes results in the same position on the test set. Does every shape *need* to be rotated in that direction? If so, why? I need to know why and under what situations.\n\nThen, there's Candidate 2, who's got a more nuanced rule. They say to rotate to *fit* and to find the \"connector\" edge and rotate it to face the hub. Their strategy feels more correct. So I'm now examining this Candidate's solution more carefully. For each scattered shape in the test input, I'm checking if Candidate 2's logic gives the same result as the output. To perform a strong test, I am checking against the same scenarios from the training set. If Candidate 2's solution can't be explained via this connector-based rule, it's a critical error.\n\nHere's the problem. The core question is about rotation. Candidate 1 is saying all shapes should be rotated 90 degrees clockwise. This might work for some cases, but not all. Sometimes, you need to rotate counter-clockwise or flip the shape to make the pieces fit. This feels brittle. Sometimes a 90 clockwise is perfect, other times not. It seems to depend on the starting orientation.\n\nAnd I am seeing the same rotation (or no rotation) on the top/bottom markers. So, maybe it's \"rotate to fit\", not \"rotate 90 CW always\". Candidate 1 is making a mistake by over-simplifying and making this a \"must\", not a \"suggestion\".\n\nCandidate 2's logic, on the other hand, is much more adaptable. The focus is to find the \"connector\" and make it align with the hub - which means rotating any direction. The rotation is what makes Candidate 2's more robust and versatile. However, this is more complicated and depends on specific geometric properties of the shapes in question. The \"connector\" concept is an assumption, so I need to check the validity for all scenarios.\n\nI now need to see how the rule applies to specific Test Input shapes. Do both candidates work on all pieces? I will use this to confirm each candidate's consistency or inconsistency. So I am now examining how each shape has been rotated and attached.\n\nThen, I'm also now looking at the output grid of the candidates. I'm checking if any gaps or errors appear in their layouts. For instance, I am now checking how each of the Candidate's grids look - how the various shapes are arranged and connected. Candidate 1 has a major flaw in terms of explaining why one specific rotation is used, though the pixel layout and connections in the output grid might look OK.\n\nI am re-checking all these shapes on the examples from the Train set to check for validity of the conclusions.\n\nI now see Candidate 2's explanation is more logically\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 2,\n      \"score\": 9.5,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"The rule correctly identifies the 'connector' logic seen in all examples: shapes are not just rotated by a fixed angle, but rotated specifically to present a matching 2-cell edge to the central frame's markers.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Identify the central frame and its 4 colored markers.
