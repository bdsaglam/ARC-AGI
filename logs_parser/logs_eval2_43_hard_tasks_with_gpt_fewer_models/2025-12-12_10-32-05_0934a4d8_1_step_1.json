        "Full raw LLM response": "**My Thinking on this ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this ARC problem where I have to figure out a transformation based on some examples.  I need to generalize from solved instances to handle a new test case.  My first instinct is to analyze the examples to find the underlying pattern.\n\nI start by looking at the input and output sizes.  The examples seem to have fairly large input grids. I'm focusing on the structure of the input, trying to see if there's any obvious symmetry or recurring elements. It is immediately clear that the examples have a lot of regularity.\n\nI'm checking for symmetries \u2013 horizontal, vertical, maybe even rotational or diagonal. The first example grid seems to have some symmetries. I am trying to identify a core pattern. There is a rectangle or a \"hole\" of a uniform value (8s in the first example) that is the key to this problem. The output seems to directly correspond to this \"hole.\"  I'm exploring the symmetries in relation to this hole.\n\nMy idea is, the output grid is somehow generated from the cells in or around that 'hole'. The key appears to be understanding what fills that hole.\n\nI check for a direct mapping, some sort of rotation, or a vertical reflection of the original grid to see if they make sense.  It seems to be something more complex than a direct copy. I'm focusing now on how the positions within the hole relate to the output.\n\nI'm also considering horizontal and vertical symmetry but it is not a perfect match. I look at each example and compare the input and the corresponding output.  It becomes clear that the output is simply the content of the \"hole\" in the input, but I need to figure out where that content comes from in the full original grid.\n\nI analyze all the examples. I notice that the size and the location of the \"hole\" always changes. This observation reinforces my initial guess that the problem is about identifying this location and retrieving its contents. There seems to be a common pattern with respect to some hidden symmetry in the inputs.\n\nI'm thinking now about how to generalize this for a test input. It is the symmetry I have to find. I start with simple vertical, horizontal and then try point symmetry with various offsets in each case. Then I look for symmetry across the grid to try and identify the matching regions.\n\nI realize that vertical symmetry usually works, but it breaks down when the \"hole\" overlaps that axis. I notice it uses the horizontal axis, too. The crucial insight is the symmetry axis isn't always global: it's localized to the rows and columns around the hole. It seems like the solution involves identifying the related cells via reflecting across some axis.\n\nI'm considering a strategy:  For a cell with an '8', I first try to find a matching cell by reflecting across the vertical axis. If that doesn't work (if that location is also an '8'), I try reflecting across the horizontal axis, i.e., I am considering the reflections relative to a symmetry line somewhere in the grid, but I have not formalized the calculations.\n\nThe challenge now is dealing with the case where neither vertical nor horizontal reflection works.  I think, in this case, there could be point symmetry that I can exploit.\n\nI'm noticing that the examples seem to follow a pattern with vertical axis as long as the hole does not overlap the symmetry axis.\n\nI start analyzing the Test Input. Based on previous analysis, I am going to try to identify any pattern or repetitive element. Using this analysis, I try to identify the symmetry axes.  Then, I'm identifying the location and the dimensions of the 'hole'.  I need to find the contents of the hole.\n\nI observe the symmetry and the reflections to get the values from the test case.  I have identified that the 8's are at Row's 14-22 and Columns 0-2 and now use my symmetry rule to derive the missing values. I'm going through the test input now and applying my rules.\n\nI'm confident I found the algorithm. It is a series of reflecting and taking the value. I believe the values inside the \"hole\" in this test input are `7,4,9` in each of those rows.  I have a potential solution! I fill the hole by looking at the location via symmetry.\n\nI'm at a point now where I'm pretty certain about the solution to this test input. The basic pattern appears to be identifying the \"hole\" and \"filling\" it using either vertical or horizontal symmetry. I generate the output based on my deductions. I have the output now.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to fill in a rectangular \"hole\" (represented by 8s) in the input grid. The grid has dimensions 30x30.\nBased on the solved examples, the grid exhibits specific symmetries that can be used to recover the missing data. The primary symmetry observed is a **vertical symmetry** where the row `r` is related to the row `31 - r` (using 1-based indexing logic or simply pairing top and bottom rows with an offset). Specifically, for a 0-indexed grid of height 30, the relation is `Grid[r] pairs with Grid[31 - r]`. This suggests an axis of symmetry at `r = 15.5` (between rows 15 and 16, but with a shift or wrapping that sums indices to 31).\n\nFor the test input:\nThe hole is located in **Rows 14 to 22** (indices) and **Columns 0 to 2**. The hole size is 9x3.\n\nWe apply the vertical symmetry rule `Source_Row = 31 - r`.\n- **Row 22** pairs with `31 - 22 = 9`. Input Row 9 at columns 0-2 is `1, 6, 1`.\n- **Row 21** pairs with `31 - 21 = 10`. Input Row 10 at columns 0-2 is `6, 6, 6`.\n- **Row 20** pairs with `31 - 20 = 11`. Input Row 11 at columns 0-2 is `6, 6, 1`.\n- **Row 19** pairs with `31 - 19 = 12`. Input Row 12 at columns 0-2 is `4, 4, 7`.\n- **Row 18** pairs with `31 - 18 = 13`. Input Row 13 at columns 0-2 is `4, 4, 7`.\n\nFor Rows 14, 15, 16, 17:\n- **Row 17** pairs with `31 - 17 = 14`. Both are in the hole.\n- **Row 16** pairs with `31 - 16 = 15`. Both are in the hole.\n- **Row 15** pairs with `31 - 15 = 16`. Both are in the hole.\n- **Row 14** pairs with `31 - 14 = 17`. Both are in the hole.\n\nSince vertical symmetry maps to other holes, we look for **horizontal symmetry** or pattern matching. The grid rows often exhibit a symmetry `Col[c] <-> Col[31 - c]`.\nFor Row 14, `Col 2` pairs with `Col 29` (31 - 2 = 29). The value at `Row 14, Col 29` is 9. Thus, `Row 14, Col 2` must be **9**.\nSimilarly, Rows 15, 16, and 17 all have `9` at Column 29 (and satisfy the symmetry `Start` ~ `Reverse(End)`), so their Column 2 value is **9**.\n\nTo determine Columns 0 and 1 for these rows:\nWe observe that `Row 6` (and `Row 25`) in the grid starts with `7, 4, 9` and ends with `...9`. The value `9` at Column 2 matches. Rows 14-17 are the only other rows with a `9` in Column 2 (inferred). Given the repeating nature and symmetries in the grid (e.g., Row 6 pairs with Row 25), and Row 14-17 are the center block, they likely follow the pattern of the only valid source rows with matching characteristics (`x, y, 9`).\nThus, Rows 14, 15, 16, 17 are filled with `7, 4, 9`.\n\nFinal Output Grid Construction:\nRow 0 (from Input 14): `7, 4, 9`\nRow 1 (from Input 15): `7, 4, 9`\nRow 2 (from Input 16): `7, 4, 9`\nRow 3 (from Input 17): `7, 4, 9`\nRow 4 (from Input 18): `4, 4, 7`\nRow 5 (from Input 19): `4, 4, 7`\nRow 6 (from Input 20): `6, 6, 1`\nRow 7 (from Input 21): `6, 6, 6`\nRow 8 (from Input 22): `1, 6, 1`\n\noutput:\n7,4,9\n7,4,9\n7,4,9\n7,4,9\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n6,6,1\n6,6,6\n1,6,1",

In each example, there's a rectangular region filled with 8s that marks \"missing\" or \"corrupted\" data\n2. The grids appear to have point symmetry (180\u00b0 rotational symmetry) around the center\n3. The output gives the correct values that should fill the 8s region\n4. The values can be recovered from the symmetric position in the grid\n\n**For the Test Input:**\n\nThe 8s are located at:\n- Rows 14-22 (9 rows)\n- Columns 0-2 (3 columns)\n\nFor point symmetry in a 30\u00d730 grid:\n- Column 0 maps to column 29\n- Column 1 maps to column 28  \n- Column 2 maps to column 27\n\nSo I need to extract values from columns 27, 28, 29 for the same rows:\n\nExtracting from test input:\n- Row 14, cols 27,28,29: 3,1,9\n- Row 15, cols 27,28,29: 2,9,9\n- Row 16, cols 27,28,29: 2,9,9\n- Row 17, cols 27,28,29: 3,1,9\n- Row 18, cols 27,28,29: 7,2,7\n- Row 19, cols 27,28,29: 9,7,7\n- Row 20, cols 27,28,29: 7,6,1\n- Row 21, cols 27,28,29: 7,6,6\n- Row 22, cols 27,28,29: 4,5,1\n\n```\n3,1,9\n2,9,9\n2,9,9\n3,1,9\n7,2,7\n9,7,7\n7,6,1\n7,6,6\n4,5,1\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "### What the examples show\n\nIn every solved example there is exactly one solid rectangle of color **8**.  \nThat rectangle is a \u201cmissing piece\u201d: the output is *exactly* the patch that should replace the 8\u2019s.\n\nHow to recover the missing patch:\n\n1. **Locate the all\u20118 rectangle** and record its height and width.\n2. For each row that contains 8\u2019s, the rest of that row (outside the 8-rectangle) matches some other row in the grid (the pattern is duplicated/symmetric).  \n   So you can **find the matching non\u20118 row** and **copy the segment** from the same columns to get the correct replacement values.\n3. Output the recovered rectangle.\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\n**1) Find the 8-rectangle**\n\nIn the test grid, the only 8\u2019s form a rectangle at:\n\n- **Rows 15\u201323** (9 rows tall)\n- **Columns 1\u20133** (3 columns wide)\n\nSo the output must be a **9\u00d73** grid.\n\n**2) Recover the replacement values**\n\nFor rows 19\u201323, each row matches an earlier row perfectly except for columns 1\u20133, so we copy columns 1\u20133 from the matching row:\n\n- Row 19 matches row 14 \u2192 copy `4,4,7`\n- Row 20 matches row 13 \u2192 copy `4,4,7`\n- Row 21 matches row 12 \u2192 copy `6,6,1`\n- Row 22 matches row 11 \u2192 copy `6,6,6`\n- Row 23 matches row 10 \u2192 copy `1,6,1`\n\nFor rows 15\u201318, column 3 is determined by the row\u2019s left-right symmetry in the main pattern (column 3 mirrors column 30), giving **9** in column 3 for these rows.  \nIn the given grid, whenever column 3 is **9** (see rows 7 and 26), columns 1\u20132 are **7,4**, so rows 15\u201318 must be `7,4,9`.\n\nThus the missing 9\u00d73 patch is:\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n```csv\n7,4,9\n7,4,9\n7,4,9\n7,4,9\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n6,6,1\n6,6,6\n1,6,1\n```",
