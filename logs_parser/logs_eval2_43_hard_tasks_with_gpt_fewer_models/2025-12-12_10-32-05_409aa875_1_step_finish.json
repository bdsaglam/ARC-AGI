The user's provided me with examples and a test case, and I'm tasked with generating the output grid based on these.\n\nFirst, I quickly identify the basic elements: Grids of integer-colored cells. Orange (7) is typically the background. There are shapes/objects made of different colors sprinkled across the grids. The goal is to figure out the transformation applied to these shapes.\n\nI start by thoroughly analyzing the first example. I recognize the background as orange. I notice specific, repeating shapes. I carefully trace the shape, noting its pixels and co-ordinates. In the example, there's a smaller \"shape\" on top of three identical bottom ones. These bottom shapes form a pattern I call a \"cup\" or \"V\" shape.\n\nIn the first output, I note that one of these shapes has been altered. This leads me to focus on symmetry and position. I figure that the *middle* \"cup\" shape is the one changed.\n\nNext, I delve into the second example. Here, I'm dealing with shapes, again. But this time, it's a grid made up of a specific \"inverted pyramid\" shape, but it's made up of the same colour. I go through a painstaking process to locate all instances of this \"inverted pyramid\" shape, and again the focus is on the co-ordinates.\n\nIn the second output, I notice that the shape itself stays, but some pixels turn from orange (7) to a new colour (9). These new pixels seem to be directly above the heads of my \"inverted pyramids\". My hypothesis forms: there's some sort of projectile shooting upwards from the shapes.\n\nNow, I revisit the first example. The shapes there are a different color. Here, I come up with a theory that color is important. Maybe shapes of one color have one behavior, and shapes of another color have a different behavior.\n\nI then move to the third example. This time, there are some shapes again and new interactions. They are a different shape and colour, and the output is again different. In this case, two of these shapes have been altered from one colour to another. This output makes it apparent to me that I'm dealing with projectiles of some kind.\n\nGoing back to the second example, I try to come up with a single set of rules. I start to think that each color is some kind of projectile, and that the position determines the trajectory. Each of these shapes has a certain direction of firing - upwards, downwards, leftwards, and rightwards.\n\nIn the first and third examples, I try to understand the rules of the shape, and the position in relation to the bullet, but I quickly get stuck. Then I have an insight: the direction could be determined by the shape's vertex (or tip, or head), combined with the shape itself. I realize that the bullet landing on a shape could turn all the pixels in that shape the same colour as the bullet.\n\nI create the rule - Shapes \"shoot\" projectiles and their \"main pixel\" determines the direction. This main pixel is the shape's vertex. Upright pyramid shoots up, Corner shapes shoot opposite the direction of missing corner, and inverted pyramid shoots down.\n\nI double-check this for consistency across the examples. In the third example, I can use the new rule to understand the bullet, and determine why pixels change colour.\n\nI then focus my attention on the test input. It's a new grid of coloured pixels. Using my rules, I systematically locate shapes in the grid. I use the bullet and shooting rules to predict where bullets will land, and whether a collision will cause pixels to change. I note any collision, and what happens to pixels in collision.\n\nFinally, I generate the output. I start with a blank grid and apply all transformations, keeping track of any pixel changes. My output seems consistent with the derived rules. I also note that some projectiles become bullets (color 9).\n\nI've carefully considered any ambiguities, edge cases, and collisions. This should represent a complete, logically sound solution to this ARC problem!\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation rules are as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Shapes and Roles**: The grid contains objects (connected components of non-background colors). Each object acts as a \"shooter\" that projects a \"bullet\" (a single pixel) to a specific target location based on the shape's type and orientation.\n    *   **Upright Pyramid** (Head at top, base 3 pixels wide below): Shoots from the Head, direction **Up 5 rows** (`row - 5`, `col`).\n    *   **Inverted Pyramid** (Base 3 pixels wide at top, Head below): Shoots from the Head, direction **Down 5 rows** (`row + 5`, `col`).\n    *   **Sideways Pyramid**: Shoots in the direction it points (Left or Right) by **5 columns**.\n    *   **L-Shape (2x2 block with one corner missing)**: Shoots from the \"vertex\" (the pixel with two neighbors in the shape) in the direction **opposite to the missing corner** by **5 steps diagonally** (dx = +/- 5, dy = +/- 5).\n        *   Missing Top-Left -> Shoots Bottom-Right (`row + 5`, `col + 5`).\n        *   Missing Top-Right -> Shoots Bottom-Left (`row + 5`, `col - 5`).\n        *   Missing Bottom-Left -> Shoots Top-Right (`row - 5`, `col + 5`).\n        *   Missing Bottom-Right -> Shoots Top-Left (`row - 5`, `col - 5`).\n\n2.  **Determine Interaction Results**:\n    *   **Empty Space (7)**: If a bullet lands on the background, that pixel becomes **9** (Maroon).\n    *   **Collision (Bullet vs Bullet)**: If two shooters target the same pixel, that pixel becomes **1** (Blue).\n    *   **Hit (Bullet vs Shape)**: If a bullet lands on an existing shape, the *entire* shape changes color to **9** (Maroon). The hit shape still fires its own bullet.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Shapes**:\n    *   **Shape 1 (Top Left)**: L-Shape at `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)`. Missing Top-Left. Vertex at `(3,2)`. Target: `(3+5, 2+5) = (8,7)`.\n    *   **Shape 2 (Top Center)**: Inverted Pyramid at `(2,8), (2,10), (3,9)`. Head at `(3,9)`. Target: `(3+5, 9) = (8,9)`.\n    *   **Shape 3 (Top Right)**: Left-Pointing Pyramid at `(3,14), (4,13), (5,14)`. Head at `(4,13)`. Target: `(4, 13-5) = (4,8)`.\n    *   **Shape 4 (Middle Center)**: Upright Pyramid at `(5,9), (6,8), (6,10)`. Head at `(5,9)`. Target: `(5-5, 9) = (0,9)`.\n    *   **Shape 5 (Middle Left)**: Upright Pyramid at `(7,2), (8,1), (8,3)`. Head at `(7,2)`. Target: `(7-5, 2) = (2,2)`.\n    *   **Shape 6 (Middle Right/Bottom)**: Upright Pyramid at `(13,4), (14,3), (14,5)`. Head at `(13,4)`. Target: `(13-5, 4) = (8,4)`.\n    *   **Shape 7 (Bottom Center)**: L-Shape at `(14,8), (14,9), (15,9)`. Missing Bottom-Left. Vertex at `(14,9)`. Target: `(14-5, 9+5) = (9,14)`.\n    *   **Shape 8 (Bottom Right)**: Upright Pyramid at `(14,14), (15,13), (15,15)`. Head at `(14,14)`. Target: `(14-5, 14) = (9,14)`.\n\n2.  **Resolve Targets and Conflicts**:\n    *   `(8,7)`: Empty -> **9**.\n    *   `(8,9)`: Empty -> **9**.\n    *   `(4,8)`: Empty -> **9**.\n    *   `(0,9)`: Empty -> **9**.\n    *   `(2,2)`: Hit on Shape 1. Shape 1 (`(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)`) becomes **9**.\n    *   `(8,4)`: Empty -> **9**.\n    *   `(9,14)`: Targeted by Shape 7 and Shape 8 (Collision) -> **1**.\n\n**Final Grid Changes**:\n*   `(0,9)` becomes `9`.\n*   Shape 1 pixels `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)` become `9`.\n*   `(4,8)` becomes `9`.\n*   `(8,4)` becomes `9`.\n*   `(8,7)` becomes `9`.\n*   `(8,9)` becomes `9`.\n*   `(9,14)` becomes `1`.\n\nAll other pixels remain their original color (Background 7 or Object 6).\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n<REASONING_MODEL_B model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_2_step_3\">\nAll three examples use the same idea: every non-background cell belongs to a **3\u2011pixel \u201carrowhead\u201d** (size\u20113 component).

For each corner-object:\n   - Let the vertex be `V`.\n   - Let the two step-vectors from `V` to the other two cells be `v1` and `v2`.\n   - The **opening direction** is `v1 + v2` (then reduced to a unit direction by taking the sign of each component).\n   - Place a **marker 5 cells away from the vertex in the opposite direction**.\n4. Markers are normally colored **`9`**.\n   - If **two markers land on the same cell**, that cell becomes **`1`** (overlap marker).\n   - If a marker lands on an existing 3-cell corner-object, the **entire object is recolored to `9`**.\n\n---\n\n### Applying to the test input\n\nThe `6` pixels form eight 3-cell corner-objects.

The goal is to transform a 16x16 grid based on a set of rules I'm going to figure out. I've got examples to guide me, and my task is to apply the learned rules to a new test case. The underlying assumption is that there are specific geometric shapes and that their positions and relationships trigger certain transformations - basically, a sort of pattern-recognition and rule-following system.\n\n**Initial Observations**\n\nThe background is orange (color 7), and there are scattered objects in the grid. My first impression is that the objects are relatively small, and their arrangement is key. I'm looking for consistent patterns that will define the transformation logic.\n\n**Example 1: Getting My Bearings**\n\nThis example is crucial. I spot two primary shapes: a \"chevron\" (an up-pointing triangle) made of '9's and an \"L-shape\" (a 2x2 square with one corner missing). My main aim is to understand what happens to these shapes in the transformation. I observe that each chevron spawns a new '9' pixel that's offset vertically from the apex, while the L shape also spawns new pixels. However, the exact offset for the L-shape puzzled me.\n\nI noticed a key detail: when a new pixel lands on a filled space, it can turn into the color 1. I need to figure out what controls the offset for the L-shape (in this case, it was a bottom-left corner). Also, since this example doesn't have multiple markers hitting the same pixel, I need to check the remaining examples to find out what controls those intersections.\n\n**Example 2: Deepening the Understanding**\n\nExample 2 confirms the chevron rule: the new dot appears directly above the apex (r-5). All shapes in the example are chevrons (color 0). No L-shapes here, which is a key point to notice. Also, the shapes (chevrons) are not changed/recored.\n\n**Example 3: Adding the Third Piece**\n\nThe third example introduces the L-shape again, this time with a 2 (red) background. Now I see that the orientation matters: I noticed a \"corner\" of the L-shape, where two sides meet and form a corner. It also introduced a twist: if an L-shape marker \"hits\" (lands on) an existing L-shape, it recolors the entire L-shape to the marker's color. I found a formula to calculate offsets for L-shapes. It has a vertical and horizontal component and is dependent on the orientation of the L-shape corner. I also verified the 5-row offset.\n\n**Forming the Rules**\n\nBy analyzing the examples, I can extract the transformation rules:\n*   **Chevrons**: Based on the apex, add a 9, five rows up\n*   **L-shapes**: Use an algorithm to find the corner to determine where a 9 gets added (row \u00b1 5, and column always -5).\n*   **Interactions**: If marker at an empty place -> 9. If two overlap, change to 1. If an L-shape gets hit, recolor it to 9.\n\n**Applying the Rules to the Test Input**\n\nI need to apply what I learned to a new grid. I have a new color and new shapes to identify, plus the same rules to apply. I'm going to start by scanning row by row and locate the geometric figures (chevrons and L-shapes). I need to be careful with the chevron's apex coordinates and also determine the correct L-shapes, with an emphasis on their orientation, to generate offsets. The rule \"if an L-marker hits an existing L-shape recolor the whole hit L-shape to 9\" is of concern here. I also need to calculate the target positions from the offsets, taking the edge of the grid into account to keep everything inside the 16x16 grid. Any pixel overlap (marker-to-marker or markers on existing shapes) must be solved.\n\nOnce I've identified all shapes, I need to follow the rules (shape-marker, collision rules) and place those markers accordingly. I will start by identifying the shapes (chevrons) and applying the chevron rules (shift vertically), then finding L-shapes with their respective marker locations (determined from L-shape orientation), and then handling any overlaps.\n\nI'm making a key assumption here. Since the descriptions use the term chevron specifically in a particular shape (an Up-pointing triangle), I'm assuming that \"chevron\" means exactly that, and not a general rotated shape. I'm also assuming the marker creation rule should apply to other geometric shapes of interest, like a down-\n\nThe transformation follows these rules derived from the examples:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:**\n    *   **Chevrons:** A pattern of three dots consisting of an apex at `(r, c)` and a base at `(r+1, c-1)` and `(r+1, c+1)`. We also identify rotated variations (Down: apex at bottom, base above; Left: apex left, base right).\n    *   **L-shapes:** A cluster of 3 dots forming a $2 \\times 2$ square with one corner missing. The \"corner\" is the vertex with two neighbors in the cluster.\n\n2.  **Generate Markers:**\n    *   **From Chevrons:** A new dot is created at a position offset by 5 from the apex in the direction the chevron points.\n        *   Up-pointing (apex `r,c`): Target `(r-5, c)`.\n        *   Down-pointing (apex `r,c`): Target `(r+5, c)`.\n        *   Left-pointing (apex `r,c`): Target `(r, c-5)`.\n        *   Right-pointing: Target `(r, c+5)`.\n    *   **From L-shapes:** Calculate the target based on the orientation. The logic inferred is: Find the vector from the L-corner to the missing (open) corner of the $2 \\times 2$ box, let's call it `(dr, dc)`. The offset is `(-dr*5, -dc*5)`.\n        *   Example: Top-Left corner (Open is Down-Right, `+1, +1`) $\\to$ Offset `(-5, -5)`.\n        *   Example: Bottom-Left corner (Open is Up-Right, `-1, +1`) $\\to$ Offset `(+5, -5)`.\n        *   This rule generalizes to: Row offset is $\\pm 5$ opposite to the vertical opening, Column offset is $\\pm 5$ opposite to the horizontal opening.\n\n3.  **Apply Transformations & Handle Collisions:**\n    *   **Standard Marker:** Place a dot of color **9** at the target location.\n    *   **Collision (Marker on Marker):** If two generated markers land on the same cell, place a dot of color **1**.\n    *   **Interaction (Marker on L-shape):** If a marker lands on any cell belonging to an existing L-shape, recolor the **entire** L-shape to color **9**.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Chevron 1 (Up):** Apex at `(5,9)`. Target: `(0,9)`. Color 9.\n*   **Chevron 2 (Up):** Apex at `(7,2)`. Target: `(2,2)`. This hits **L-shape 1**.\n*   **Chevron 3 (Up):** Apex at `(13,4)`. Target: `(8,4)`. Color 9.\n*   **Chevron 4 (Up):** Apex at `(14,14)`. Target: `(9,14)`. Hits same spot as L-shape 2 marker.\n*   **Chevron 5 (Down):** Apex at `(3,9)` (Base `2,8`, `2,10`). Target: `(3+5, 9) = (8,9)`. Color 9.\n*   **Chevron 6 (Left):** Apex at `(4,13)` (Base `3,14`, `5,14`). Target: `(4, 13-5) = (4,8)`. Color 9.\n*   **L-shape 1:** Pixels `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)`. Corner `(3,2)`. Open `(2,1)` (Up-Left).\n    *   Target: Offset Down-Right `(+5, +5)`. Corner `(3,2)` $\\to$ Target `(8,7)`. Color 9.\n    *   **Interaction:** The marker from Chevron 2 lands at `(2,2)`, which is part of this L-shape. The whole L-shape `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)` changes color from 6 to **9**.\n*   **L-shape 2:** Pixels `(14,8), (14,9), (15,9)`. Corner `(14,9)`. Open `(15,8)` (Down-Left).\n    *   Target: Offset Up-Right `(-5, +5)`. Corner `(14,9)` $\\to$ Target `(9,14)`.\n*   **Collision at (9,14):** Marker from Chevron 4 and Marker from L-shape 2 meet. Result is color **1**.\n\n**Final Grid Construction:**\n*   Start with Input (Background 7, Objects 6).\n*   Recolor L-shape 1 at `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)` to **9**.\n*   Add markers:\n    *   `(0,9)`: 9\n    *   `(4,8)`: 9\n    *   `(8,4)`: 9\n    *   `(8,7)`: 9\n    *   `(8,9)`: 9\n    *   `(9,14)`: 1 (Collision)\n\noutput:\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n</REASONING_MODEL_D>\n</CANDIDATE 0>\n<CANDIDATE 2>\n<PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\nSize: 16x16\n7777777779777777\n7777777777777777\n7797777767677777\n7997777776777767\n7777777777777677\n7777777776777767\n7777777767677777\n7767777777777777\n7676977977777777\n7777777777777717\n7777777777777777\n7777777777777777\n7777777777777777\n7777677777777777\n7776767766777767\n7777777776777676\n</PROPOSED_SOLUTION>\n<REASONING_MODEL_A model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_1_step_1\">\nThe background is color **7**.

                "response": "**Audit Summary for ARC Puzzle Candidates**\n\nOkay, I'm diving into this ARC puzzle evaluation.  My job is to act as the ARC Logic Auditor and determine which candidate (0 and 2) best understands the underlying logic of these puzzles. This involves analyzing their reasoning, especially their handling of a \"test\" input.\n\nFirst, the puzzle's structure: 16x16 grids with an orange background and colored \"objects.\" The goal is to produce a new output grid by introducing new pixels or modifying existing ones.  The core mechanics involve \"shooters\" (shapes, chevrons, L-shapes) that \"fire\" and potentially \"collide\" with other objects.\n\nMy initial analysis focused on understanding the rules through solved examples (\"Ground Truth\"). I quickly realized there are two key shapes: chevrons (triangles) and L-shapes. Chevrons, I determined, shoot in the direction they *point*,  5 units away. L-shapes shoot diagonally *opposite* to the direction of their \"missing\" corner. These distances are very important!\n\n\"Collisions\" are another important aspect of the puzzle logic: If a \"bullet\" (a new pixel) lands on an empty space, that space gets a new color (9), but if it collides with another \"shape\", that whole shape becomes colored 9.\n\nI worked through each solved example, painstakingly identifying shapes, calculating their \"shoot\" directions and targets, and confirming the observed changes in the output. During the process, I also had to re-read the grids carefully as the numbers were confusing.\n\n*Example 1* shows chevrons \"shooting\" down 5 rows and a collision with an L-shape at the top right.  The collision caused a new point (1) to show up.  *Example 2* only featured triangles shooting UP, confirming my understanding of Chevron directionality. *Example 3* showed L-shapes and how they collided, causing an existing shape to change from color 2 to color 9.\n\nThen, the moment of truth: the \"Test Input\". This is where things get interesting. I analyzed the objects in the Test Input and determined their shoot locations based on the rules.\n\nObject 1 has a shoot target at (8,7).\nObject 2 has a shoot target at (8,9).\nObject 3 shoots left to a target (4,8).\nObject 4 shoots up to target (0,9).\nObject 5 shoots up to target (2,2) causing the L to change to 9.\nObject 6 has a target at (8,4).\nObject 7 and 8 has a target at (9,14).\n\nFinally, I got to evaluate the candidate's solutions: Candidate 0 nailed it. It correctly identified all the shooters, their directions, and the collisions, producing an output that precisely matched my calculations.  It also recolored a shape with a `9` which collided with another shape.  Candidate 2, however, stumbled. It missed some of the \"rotated\" shooters in the test input, specifically the *left* and *downward* pointing triangles.\nWhen comparing both, Candidate 0 understood that direction mattered for all shapes and correctly shot in the rotation.  Candidate 2 only accounted for the upright triangles which were found in the training data, but missed the other shapes.\n\nMy evaluation led to a ranking:\n- **Candidate 0**:  Gold. Generalization to new inputs is superior.\n- **Candidate 2**: Bronze (Invalid). Failed to apply rule rotations.\n\nCandidate 0 got everything correct, and 2 missed 2, which is a major red flag on generalization.\n\nUltimately, Candidate 0 demonstrated a strong grasp of the puzzle's underlying logic.  Candidate 2, while showing competence in many areas, failed to generalize the rule of shooting direction to all forms of shapes (specifically the downward and left pointing triangles) making Candidate 0 the superior choice, as it correctly recognized and predicted this.\n\n\n<AUDIT_LOG>\n\n### PHASE 1: LOGIC SELECTION & CRYSTALLIZATION\n\n**Candidate 0:**\n- **Selected Logic:** Reasoning Model A.\n- **Crystallization:**\n    1.  **Object Identification:** Identify connected components of non-background colors.\n    2.  **Classification & Firing:**\n        *   **Triangles (Chevrons):** Defined by an Apex and a Base. Shoot a projectile 5 steps from the Apex in the direction the Apex points (Up, Down, Left, or Right).\n        *   **L-Shapes (Corners):** Defined by a Corner pixel with two orthogonal neighbors. Identify the \"missing corner\" direction. Shoot a projectile 5 steps in the *opposite* diagonal direction.\n    3.  **Action Rules:**\n        *   **Empty Cell:** Projectile lands on background -> Paint cell **9**.\n        *   **Collision (Projectile-Projectile):** Two projectiles land on the same cell -> Paint cell **1**.\n        *   **Hit (Projectile-Object):** Projectile lands on an existing object -> Recolor the *entire* existing object to **9**.\n\n**Candidate 2:**\n- **Selected Logic:** Reasoning Model C.\n- **Crystallization:**\n    1.  **Object Identification:** Identify 3-dot patterns.\n    2.  **Classification & Firing:**\n        *   **Chevrons:** Defined strictly as Apex at `(r,c)` with legs at `(r+1, c-1)` and `(r+1, c+1)`. (This defines only **UP-pointing** triangles). Shoot 5 steps UP.\n        *   **L-Shapes:** Identify corner and missing corner. Shoot 5 steps in the opposite diagonal direction.\n    3.  **Action Rules:**\n        *   Same as Candidate 0 (Empty->9, Collision->1, Hit->Recolor).\n\n---\n\n### PHASE 2: THE GROUND TRUTH AUDIT\n\n**Example 1:**\n- **Input:** Up-pointing triangles (Color 9) and one L-shape.\n- **Candidate 0:** Rule correctly identifies Up-triangles shooting Up and L-shape shooting Down-Left. Matches output where bullets land. Identifies collision at `(9,7)` where an Up-shot and L-shot meet (Outcome 1).\n- **Candidate 2:** Rule correctly identifies Up-triangles and L-shape. Matches output.\n- **Verdict:** Both Pass.\n\n**Example 2:**\n- **Input:** Multiple Up-pointing triangles (Color 0). (Note: Detailed inspection of Ex 2 input shows *only* Up-pointing triangles, despite some visual complexity).\n- **Candidate 0:** Rule applies Up-shooting. Matches output.\n- **Candidate 2:** Rule applies Up-shooting. Matches output.\n- **Verdict:** Both Pass.\n\n**Example 3:**\n- **Input:** Rotated L-shapes (Color 2).\n- **Candidate 0:** Rule handles rotated L-shapes via the \"Opposite to missing corner\" logic. Identifies that one L-shape shoots the top-left L-shape, causing a \"Hit\" and recoloring it to 9. Matches output.\n- **Candidate 2:** Rule handles rotated L-shapes correctly. Matches output.\n- **Verdict:** Both Pass.\n\n**Summary:** Both candidates perform perfectly on the training data because the training data *only* contains Up-pointing triangles. It does *not* contain Down/Left/Right triangles, but it *does* contain rotated L-shapes. The critical test is whether the logic generalizes rotation to triangles in the Test Input.\n\n---\n\n### PHASE 3: EXECUTION CONSISTENCY\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n- The Test Input contains:\n    1.  **Up-pointing triangles** (Standard).\n    2.  **Down-pointing triangle** at `(2,8)-(3,9)`.\n    3.  **Left-pointing triangle** at `(3,14)-(5,14)`.\n    4.  **L-shapes** (Standard).\n\n**Candidate 0 Evaluation:**\n- **Rule:** Generalizes rotation to triangles.\n- **Prediction:**\n    - Down-pointing triangle at `(3,9)` should shoot Down to `(8,9)`.\n    - Left-pointing triangle at `(4,13)` should shoot Left to `(4,8)`.\n- **Grid Check:**\n    - Cell `(8,9)` is **9**. (Consistent).\n    - Cell `(4,8)` is **9**. (Consistent).\n- **Result:** Excellent consistency. The candidate correctly inferred that if L-shapes can rotate (seen in Ex 3), triangles likely can too.\n\n**Candidate 2 Evaluation:**\n- **Rule:** Strictly defined chevrons as Up-pointing only.\n- **Prediction:**\n    - Should ignore the Down-pointing and Left-pointing triangles, or treat them as noise.\n    - No markers at `(8,9)` or `(4,8)`.\n- **Grid Check:**\n    - Cell `(8,9)` is **7** (Background). (Consistent with its flawed rule, but flawed logic).\n    - Cell `(4,8)` is **7** (Background).\n- **Result:** The candidate failed to generalize rotation to the triangles, missing two valid shapes present in the test input. This is a failure of **inductive reasoning** (fitting the rule too tightly to specific training examples rather than the underlying principle of \"directional shooters\").\n\n---\n\n### PHASE 4: STACK RANKING & TIE-BREAKING\n\n1.  **Candidate 0 (GOLD):** Correctly identified the generalized rule of \"Directional Shooters\" for both shape types. Correctly predicted the behavior of new, rotated triangle shapes in the test input. Executed all collisions and recoloring interactions perfectly.\n2.  **Candidate 2 (BRONZE):** Failed to generalize. It successfully reverse-engineered the L-shape rotation but hard-coded the Triangle orientation. This led to missing outputs in the Test Grid. It is ranked lower due to this failure of abstraction.\n\n</AUDIT_LOG>\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 9.5,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Perfectly deduced the physics of the grid (Shooters, Projectiles, Collisions). crucially, it correctly generalized that Triangles, like L-shapes, follow rotational logic, allowing it to solve the novel orientations in the Test Input.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Consistent\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Objects shoot projectiles 5 steps in their facing direction.

and Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown of my thinking as I approach this ARC problem. The user's provided me with examples and a test case, and I'm tasked with generating the output grid based on these.\n\nFirst, I quickly identify the basic elements: Grids of integer-colored cells. Orange (7) is typically the background. There are shapes/objects made of different colors sprinkled across the grids. The goal is to figure out the transformation applied to these shapes.\n\nI start by thoroughly analyzing the first example. I recognize the background as orange. I notice specific, repeating shapes. I carefully trace the shape, noting its pixels and co-ordinates. In the example, there's a smaller \"shape\" on top of three identical bottom ones. These bottom shapes form a pattern I call a \"cup\" or \"V\" shape.\n\nIn the first output, I note that one of these shapes has been altered. This leads me to focus on symmetry and position. I figure that the *middle* \"cup\" shape is the one changed.\n\nNext, I delve into the second example. Here, I'm dealing with shapes, again. But this time, it's a grid made up of a specific \"inverted pyramid\" shape, but it's made up of the same colour. I go through a painstaking process to locate all instances of this \"inverted pyramid\" shape, and again the focus is on the co-ordinates.\n\nIn the second output, I notice that the shape itself stays, but some pixels turn from orange (7) to a new colour (9). These new pixels seem to be directly above the heads of my \"inverted pyramids\". My hypothesis forms: there's some sort of projectile shooting upwards from the shapes.\n\nNow, I revisit the first example. The shapes there are a different color. Here, I come up with a theory that color is important. Maybe shapes of one color have one behavior, and shapes of another color have a different behavior.\n\nI then move to the third example. This time, there are some shapes again and new interactions. They are a different shape and colour, and the output is again different. In this case, two of these shapes have been altered from one colour to another. This output makes it apparent to me that I'm dealing with projectiles of some kind.\n\nGoing back to the second example, I try to come up with a single set of rules. I start to think that each color is some kind of projectile, and that the position determines the trajectory. Each of these shapes has a certain direction of firing - upwards, downwards, leftwards, and rightwards.\n\nIn the first and third examples, I try to understand the rules of the shape, and the position in relation to the bullet, but I quickly get stuck. Then I have an insight: the direction could be determined by the shape's vertex (or tip, or head), combined with the shape itself. I realize that the bullet landing on a shape could turn all the pixels in that shape the same colour as the bullet.\n\nI create the rule - Shapes \"shoot\" projectiles and their \"main pixel\" determines the direction. This main pixel is the shape's vertex. Upright pyramid shoots up, Corner shapes shoot opposite the direction of missing corner, and inverted pyramid shoots down.\n\nI double-check this for consistency across the examples. In the third example, I can use the new rule to understand the bullet, and determine why pixels change colour.\n\nI then focus my attention on the test input. It's a new grid of coloured pixels. Using my rules, I systematically locate shapes in the grid. I use the bullet and shooting rules to predict where bullets will land, and whether a collision will cause pixels to change. I note any collision, and what happens to pixels in collision.\n\nFinally, I generate the output. I start with a blank grid and apply all transformations, keeping track of any pixel changes. My output seems consistent with the derived rules. I also note that some projectiles become bullets (color 9).\n\nI've carefully considered any ambiguities, edge cases, and collisions. This should represent a complete, logically sound solution to this ARC problem!\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation rules are as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Shapes and Roles**: The grid contains objects (connected components of non-background colors). Each object acts as a \"shooter\" that projects a \"bullet\" (a single pixel) to a specific target location based on the shape's type and orientation.\n    *   **Upright Pyramid** (Head at top, base 3 pixels wide below): Shoots from the Head, direction **Up 5 rows** (`row - 5`, `col`).\n    *   **Inverted Pyramid** (Base 3 pixels wide at top, Head below): Shoots from the Head, direction **Down 5 rows** (`row + 5`, `col`).\n    *   **Sideways Pyramid**: Shoots in the direction it points (Left or Right) by **5 columns**.\n    *   **L-Shape (2x2 block with one corner missing)**: Shoots from the \"vertex\" (the pixel with two neighbors in the shape) in the direction **opposite to the missing corner** by **5 steps diagonally** (dx = +/- 5, dy = +/- 5).\n        *   Missing Top-Left -> Shoots Bottom-Right (`row + 5`, `col + 5`).\n        *   Missing Top-Right -> Shoots Bottom-Left (`row + 5`, `col - 5`).\n        *   Missing Bottom-Left -> Shoots Top-Right (`row - 5`, `col + 5`).\n        *   Missing Bottom-Right -> Shoots Top-Left (`row - 5`, `col - 5`).\n\n2.  **Determine Interaction Results**:\n    *   **Empty Space (7)**: If a bullet lands on the background, that pixel becomes **9** (Maroon).\n    *   **Collision (Bullet vs Bullet)**: If two shooters target the same pixel, that pixel becomes **1** (Blue).\n    *   **Hit (Bullet vs Shape)**: If a bullet lands on an existing shape, the *entire* shape changes color to **9** (Maroon). The hit shape still fires its own bullet.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Shapes**:\n    *   **Shape 1 (Top Left)**: L-Shape at `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)`. Missing Top-Left. Vertex at `(3,2)`. Target: `(3+5, 2+5) = (8,7)`.\n    *   **Shape 2 (Top Center)**: Inverted Pyramid at `(2,8), (2,10), (3,9)`. Head at `(3,9)`. Target: `(3+5, 9) = (8,9)`.\n    *   **Shape 3 (Top Right)**: Left-Pointing Pyramid at `(3,14), (4,13), (5,14)`. Head at `(4,13)`. Target: `(4, 13-5) = (4,8)`.\n    *   **Shape 4 (Middle Center)**: Upright Pyramid at `(5,9), (6,8), (6,10)`. Head at `(5,9)`. Target: `(5-5, 9) = (0,9)`.\n    *   **Shape 5 (Middle Left)**: Upright Pyramid at `(7,2), (8,1), (8,3)`. Head at `(7,2)`. Target: `(7-5, 2) = (2,2)`.\n    *   **Shape 6 (Middle Right/Bottom)**: Upright Pyramid at `(13,4), (14,3), (14,5)`. Head at `(13,4)`. Target: `(13-5, 4) = (8,4)`.\n    *   **Shape 7 (Bottom Center)**: L-Shape at `(14,8), (14,9), (15,9)`. Missing Bottom-Left. Vertex at `(14,9)`. Target: `(14-5, 9+5) = (9,14)`.\n    *   **Shape 8 (Bottom Right)**: Upright Pyramid at `(14,14), (15,13), (15,15)`. Head at `(14,14)`. Target: `(14-5, 14) = (9,14)`.\n\n2.  **Resolve Targets and Conflicts**:\n    *   `(8,7)`: Empty -> **9**.\n    *   `(8,9)`: Empty -> **9**.\n    *   `(4,8)`: Empty -> **9**.\n    *   `(0,9)`: Empty -> **9**.\n    *   `(2,2)`: Hit on Shape 1. Shape 1 (`(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)`) becomes **9**.\n    *   `(8,4)`: Empty -> **9**.\n    *   `(9,14)`: Targeted by Shape 7 and Shape 8 (Collision) -> **1**.\n\n**Final Grid Changes**:\n*   `(0,9)` becomes `9`.\n*   Shape 1 pixels `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)` become `9`.\n*   `(4,8)` becomes `9`.\n*   `(8,4)` becomes `9`.\n*   `(8,7)` becomes `9`.\n*   `(8,9)` becomes `9`.\n*   `(9,14)` becomes `1`.\n\nAll other pixels remain their original color (Background 7 or Object 6).\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,6,7,6,9,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"B\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_2_step_3\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nAll three examples use the same idea: every non-background cell belongs to a **3\u2011pixel \u201carrowhead\u201d** (size\u20113 component).

Their projections (5 steps opposite the corner opening) produce markers at:\n\n- `(0,9) = 9`\n- `(4,8) = 9`\n- `(8,4) = 9`\n- `(8,7) = 9`\n- `(8,9) = 9`\n- Two projections land on `(9,14)` \u2192 overlap \u2192 `(9,14) = 1`\n- One projection lands on an existing corner-object cell at `(2,2)`, so that whole 3-cell object is recolored from `6` to `9`.\n\n---\n\n### Output grid\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,6,7,6,9,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"D\" model_id=\"gemini-3-high_6_step_5_gpt_gen_sol\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\n**The Big Picture**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a visual puzzle. The goal is to transform a 16x16 grid based on a set of rules I'm going to figure out. I've got examples to guide me, and my task is to apply the learned rules to a new test case. The underlying assumption is that there are specific geometric shapes and that their positions and relationships trigger certain transformations - basically, a sort of pattern-recognition and rule-following system.\n\n**Initial Observations**\n\nThe background is orange (color 7), and there are scattered objects in the grid. My first impression is that the objects are relatively small, and their arrangement is key. I'm looking for consistent patterns that will define the transformation logic.\n\n**Example 1: Getting My Bearings**\n\nThis example is crucial. I spot two primary shapes: a \"chevron\" (an up-pointing triangle) made of '9's and an \"L-shape\" (a 2x2 square with one corner missing). My main aim is to understand what happens to these shapes in the transformation. I observe that each chevron spawns a new '9' pixel that's offset vertically from the apex, while the L shape also spawns new pixels. However, the exact offset for the L-shape puzzled me.\n\nI noticed a key detail: when a new pixel lands on a filled space, it can turn into the color 1. I need to figure out what controls the offset for the L-shape (in this case, it was a bottom-left corner). Also, since this example doesn't have multiple markers hitting the same pixel, I need to check the remaining examples to find out what controls those intersections.\n\n**Example 2: Deepening the Understanding**\n\nExample 2 confirms the chevron rule: the new dot appears directly above the apex (r-5). All shapes in the example are chevrons (color 0). No L-shapes here, which is a key point to notice. Also, the shapes (chevrons) are not changed/recored.\n\n**Example 3: Adding the Third Piece**\n\nThe third example introduces the L-shape again, this time with a 2 (red) background. Now I see that the orientation matters: I noticed a \"corner\" of the L-shape, where two sides meet and form a corner. It also introduced a twist: if an L-shape marker \"hits\" (lands on) an existing L-shape, it recolors the entire L-shape to the marker's color. I found a formula to calculate offsets for L-shapes. It has a vertical and horizontal component and is dependent on the orientation of the L-shape corner. I also verified the 5-row offset.\n\n**Forming the Rules**\n\nBy analyzing the examples, I can extract the transformation rules:\n*   **Chevrons**: Based on the apex, add a 9, five rows up\n*   **L-shapes**: Use an algorithm to find the corner to determine where a 9 gets added (row \u00b1 5, and column always -5).\n*   **Interactions**: If marker at an empty place -> 9. If two overlap, change to 1. If an L-shape gets hit, recolor it to 9.\n\n**Applying the Rules to the Test Input**\n\nI need to apply what I learned to a new grid. I have a new color and new shapes to identify, plus the same rules to apply. I'm going to start by scanning row by row and locate the geometric figures (chevrons and L-shapes). I need to be careful with the chevron's apex coordinates and also determine the correct L-shapes, with an emphasis on their orientation, to generate offsets. The rule \"if an L-marker hits an existing L-shape recolor the whole hit L-shape to 9\" is of concern here. I also need to calculate the target positions from the offsets, taking the edge of the grid into account to keep everything inside the 16x16 grid. Any pixel overlap (marker-to-marker or markers on existing shapes) must be solved.\n\nOnce I've identified all shapes, I need to follow the rules (shape-marker, collision rules) and place those markers accordingly. I will start by identifying the shapes (chevrons) and applying the chevron rules (shift vertically), then finding L-shapes with their respective marker locations (determined from L-shape orientation), and then handling any overlaps.\n\nI'm making a key assumption here. Since the descriptions use the term chevron specifically in a particular shape (an Up-pointing triangle), I'm assuming that \"chevron\" means exactly that, and not a general rotated shape. I'm also assuming the marker creation rule should apply to other geometric shapes of interest, like a down-\n\nThe transformation follows these rules derived from the examples:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:**\n    *   **Chevrons:** A pattern of three dots consisting of an apex at `(r, c)` and a base at `(r+1, c-1)` and `(r+1, c+1)`. We also identify rotated variations (Down: apex at bottom, base above; Left: apex left, base right).\n    *   **L-shapes:** A cluster of 3 dots forming a $2 \\times 2$ square with one corner missing. The \"corner\" is the vertex with two neighbors in the cluster.\n\n2.  **Generate Markers:**\n    *   **From Chevrons:** A new dot is created at a position offset by 5 from the apex in the direction the chevron points.\n        *   Up-pointing (apex `r,c`): Target `(r-5, c)`.\n        *   Down-pointing (apex `r,c`): Target `(r+5, c)`.\n        *   Left-pointing (apex `r,c`): Target `(r, c-5)`.\n        *   Right-pointing: Target `(r, c+5)`.\n    *   **From L-shapes:** Calculate the target based on the orientation. The logic inferred is: Find the vector from the L-corner to the missing (open) corner of the $2 \\times 2$ box, let's call it `(dr, dc)`. The offset is `(-dr*5, -dc*5)`.\n        *   Example: Top-Left corner (Open is Down-Right, `+1, +1`) $\\to$ Offset `(-5, -5)`.\n        *   Example: Bottom-Left corner (Open is Up-Right, `-1, +1`) $\\to$ Offset `(+5, -5)`.\n        *   This rule generalizes to: Row offset is $\\pm 5$ opposite to the vertical opening, Column offset is $\\pm 5$ opposite to the horizontal opening.\n\n3.  **Apply Transformations & Handle Collisions:**\n    *   **Standard Marker:** Place a dot of color **9** at the target location.\n    *   **Collision (Marker on Marker):** If two generated markers land on the same cell, place a dot of color **1**.\n    *   **Interaction (Marker on L-shape):** If a marker lands on any cell belonging to an existing L-shape, recolor the **entire** L-shape to color **9**.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Chevron 1 (Up):** Apex at `(5,9)`. Target: `(0,9)`. Color 9.\n*   **Chevron 2 (Up):** Apex at `(7,2)`. Target: `(2,2)`. This hits **L-shape 1**.\n*   **Chevron 3 (Up):** Apex at `(13,4)`. Target: `(8,4)`. Color 9.\n*   **Chevron 4 (Up):** Apex at `(14,14)`. Target: `(9,14)`. Hits same spot as L-shape 2 marker.\n*   **Chevron 5 (Down):** Apex at `(3,9)` (Base `2,8`, `2,10`). Target: `(3+5, 9) = (8,9)`. Color 9.\n*   **Chevron 6 (Left):** Apex at `(4,13)` (Base `3,14`, `5,14`). Target: `(4, 13-5) = (4,8)`. Color 9.\n*   **L-shape 1:** Pixels `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)`. Corner `(3,2)`. Open `(2,1)` (Up-Left).\n    *   Target: Offset Down-Right `(+5, +5)`. Corner `(3,2)` $\\to$ Target `(8,7)`. Color 9.\n    *   **Interaction:** The marker from Chevron 2 lands at `(2,2)`, which is part of this L-shape. The whole L-shape `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)` changes color from 6 to **9**.\n*   **L-shape 2:** Pixels `(14,8), (14,9), (15,9)`. Corner `(14,9)`. Open `(15,8)` (Down-Left).\n    *   Target: Offset Up-Right `(-5, +5)`. Corner `(14,9)` $\\to$ Target `(9,14)`.\n*   **Collision at (9,14):** Marker from Chevron 4 and Marker from L-shape 2 meet. Result is color **1**.\n\n**Final Grid Construction:**\n*   Start with Input (Background 7, Objects 6).\n*   Recolor L-shape 1 at `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)` to **9**.\n*   Add markers:\n    *   `(0,9)`: 9\n    *   `(4,8)`: 9\n    *   `(8,4)`: 9\n    *   `(8,7)`: 9\n    *   `(8,9)`: 9\n    *   `(9,14)`: 1 (Collision)\n\noutput:\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,6,7,6,9,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n  <CANDIDATE id=\"2\">\n    <ANSWER id=\"A\" model_id=\"gpt-5.2-xhigh_1_step_1\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nThe background is color **7**.

                "response": "**Audit of ARC Candidate Solutions**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got. The user wants me to go over three possible solutions for an ARC problem. First things first: I gotta understand the problem myself.  I need to dig into these training examples to figure out the ground truth behind the logic before I can even *think* about evaluating anyone else.\n\n**Example 1**: Let's break it down. There's a 16x16 grid, and I need to figure out what's going on with the shapes and colors.  The input has orange backgrounds and these maroon \"V\" shapes.  Careful now, gotta count the coordinates right. Seems like these V-shapes shoot upwards.  The output keeps the original shapes, but also adds new ones, which makes me think there's some kind of rule at play here. The one that stands out immediately: the L-shape. The L-shape is a 2x2 square with one corner missing. It's shooting to the opposite direction of the missing corner \u2013 so the direction of the vector would be diagonal.  And then there's a collision on top of that, where two shots land on the same pixel, turning it a different color. Okay, so from what I can see, we've got Up-Chevrons with an offset, and L-shapes with opposite-diagonal offsets.\n\n**Example 2**: This time, it's gray shapes on a different background. Shapes are Up-chevrons again. I can deduce the logic is the same: the chevrons shoot upwards. It's the same pattern as before, but the shapes are different. It's not clear what this all *means*, but at least the same logic applies to both examples, just with different colors and shapes. I found that this second example is a bit tricky, the grid text seems very confusing. There is a Down-Chevron somewhere which is off the grid (and is probably an accidental diamond).\n\n**Example 3**: Red shapes this time. There are a few 2x2 cluster shapes, with one missing pixel each (Like the L-shapes, but missing in a few different places.) It looks like these shapes \"shoot\" in a way that relates to which corner is missing. I'm seeing patterns now: Up, Down, Left, and Diagonal. The output seems to show that when these shapes \"shoot\" and collide, the output changes. I can see these L-shape clusters shooting diagonally, and if the shoot lands on another shape (like the one that I found in example 2), it changes to the output.\n\n**Candidate Audit**: Okay, I've got my own logic down, now it's time to see what these candidate solutions came up with. I'm going to look at Candidate 0.\n\n*   **Candidate 0**:  This model, they have it broken down really well. Upright Pyramids (Up-chevrons) shoot up, Inverted Pyramids shoot down, Sideways shoot sideways. The L-shapes are the clever bit: they shoot diagonally opposite to the missing corner. It sounds right, and when I check it against Example 3, it *is* right. I am liking the L-shape logic as it applies to everything I found above. It explains *everything* I am seeing perfectly! The model is very solid, and even explained why shape-hits (collision with shape) turn a shape into the output color. I am finding just one small issue with hallucinated coordinates.\n*   The Candidate 0 solution correctly identifies the basic rules, the arrow directions, and the shooting direction. Even a couple of times, it got the *right idea*, even when the coordinates are *slightly off* due to a hallucinated pixel.\n\n*   **Candidate 2**: Looks like this one uses \"Arrowheads\" as the template. It handles Up-Chevrons and L-shapes, but misses the Inverted chevron, and gets the \"sideways\" chevron (Shape 3) coordinates off. It also seems like a small error or \"hallucination\" in logic with a target at (3,3) that missed the mark. This is an all-or-nothing model, where it can easily miss a shape.\n\n**Ranking**:\n\n1.  Candidate 0\n2.  Candidate 2\n\n**Detailed Audit on Candidate 0**\nSo, now that I have the summary, here is a detailed audit.\n\n*   **Example 1**: The L-shape shooting and the collisions all make perfect sense.\n*   **Example 2**: The shooting of the Up and Down-Chevrons work perfectly, but the down-chevron one, I did not know about this (the diamond).\n*   **Example 3**:  It got every aspect correct, including the tricky L-shapes and collisions\n\nThe following is an audit of the proposed candidate solutions.\n\n### **Candidate 0**\n*   **Representative Rule:** Objects (Chevrons and L-shapes) \"shoot\" a bullet 5 pixels away. The direction depends on the shape's orientation:\n    *   **Pyramids/Chevrons:** Shoot from the apex in the direction they point (Up, Down, Left, Right).\n    *   **L-Shapes:** Shoot diagonally from the corner vertex, in the direction opposite to the missing corner of the $2\\times2$ bounding box.\n    *   **Interactions:** Hitting background $\\to$ 9. Hitting another object $\\to$ Recolor that object to 9. Two bullets colliding $\\to$ 1.\n*   **Example Consistency:**\n    *   **Example 1:** **Pass**. Correctly explains the upward shooting Chevrons and the L-shape logic. The collision at `(9,7)` (resulting in color 1) is correctly predicted by the rule (an Up-Chevron and an L-shape both targeting that cell).\n    *   **Example 2:** **Pass**. Correctly identifies Up-pointing Chevrons (and implicitly handles the absence of off-grid shots if any).\n    *   **Example 3:** **Pass**. Correctly explains L-shapes shooting diagonally. Crucially, it explains why an entire shape turns to color 9: a bullet from one L-shape lands on the corner of another existing L-shape.\n*   **Test Grid Consistency:** **Plausible**.\n    *   The candidate identifies multiple shapes including **Down-pointing** and **Left-pointing** Chevrons, applying the rotation logic correctly.\n    *   The explanation contains some coordinate hallucinations (e.g., shifting shapes by 1 row), but the logical application (shoot in the pointing direction) is consistent with the output grid provided.\n    *   It correctly identifies a collision at `(9,14)` and a shape-hit at `(2,2)`.\n\n### **Candidate 2**\n*   **Representative Rule:** Objects are \"arrowheads\" (Chevrons or L-corners). Chevrons shoot 5 pixels from the tip. L-corners shoot 5 pixels diagonally.\n*   **Example Consistency:**\n    *   **Example 1 & 2:** **Pass**. Fits the upward-shooting examples.\n    *   **Example 3:** **Pass**. Fits the L-shape logic.\n*   **Test Grid Consistency:** **Contradictory/Incomplete**.\n    *   The candidate completely **misses** the Down-pointing Chevron and the Left-pointing Chevron present in the test grid.\n    *   Consequently, its output grid is missing the bullets generated by these shapes (at `(8,9)` and around row 5).\n    *   It fails to generalize the rule to rotated shapes, which is a standard expectation in ARC tasks given the rotated shapes in the input.\n\n### **Comparison & Ranking**\nCandidate 0 provides a much more robust solution. It correctly deduces that the shooting direction is relative to the shape's orientation (Up/Down/Left/Right), whereas Candidate 2 seems overfitted to \"Upward\" triangles only. Candidate 0 also correctly handles the \"Inverted Pyramid\" in the test input, which Candidate 2 ignores. Both candidates struggle slightly with exact coordinates on the test grid (likely shifting some shapes by 1 row), but Candidate 0's logic is structurally correct and complete.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 9.5,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Excellent deduction of rotational rules (Up/Down/Left/Right) and interaction types (Collision=1, Hit=Recolor).\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Shapes shoot bullets 5 pixels away based on their orientation (Chevrons shoot forward, L-shapes shoot diagonally opposite the missing corner).
