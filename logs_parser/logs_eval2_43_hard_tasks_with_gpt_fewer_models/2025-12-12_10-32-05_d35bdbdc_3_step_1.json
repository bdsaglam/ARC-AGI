        "Full raw LLM response": "**Okay, here's what I've figured out.** I'm looking at these image grids and trying to understand how they transform. It looks like the main action revolves around these \"frames\" \u2013 they're 3x3 grids of a single color with a different-colored center pixel. There are also larger shapes and background elements, which seem to play a supporting role.\n\nI see that some frames \"eat\" or transfer their center color to other frames, and disappear in the process. This is the main part. It's not just about any two frames. It seems like it's based on the center color of one matching the border color of another frame.\n\nThere's a directed graph logic at play here. When a frame's center color matches the border color of another frame, there's a predator-prey relationship. A \"predator\" (the frame doing the \"eating\") will take on the original center color of its prey, and the prey is then gone. If there is a \"chain\" of targets, the process will play out according to the graph structure. Frames at the end of a chain get removed if they don't have any current targets, even if they aren't explicitly eaten.\n\nThe \"eating\" part seems to be an all-at-once process. All the targets are determined from the original state of the grid. It's not a cascading thing where an eaten frame enables its predator to eat in turn. Instead, there's a big \"sweep\" through all the frames, and each frame that's targeted will be taken out (as long as it wasn't the head of a chain).\n\nAnd it's not all just frames. The shapes outside the frames (gray boxes, scattered pixels, etc.) are usually kept. However, some objects near the area of removed frame may disappear. It seems that there are two criteria that must be satisfied for a frame to survive: It must not be \"eaten,\" and it must target another existing frame.\n\nI\u2019m now convinced the Test Input is solvable. I'll translate the rules into code!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform a grid containing several 3x3 colored frames and some static structures (gray 5s). Based on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation rules are as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Frames:** Identify all 3x3 square frames. A frame consists of a border of a single color and a center pixel of a different color.\n    *   In the test input, we find:\n        *   **Frame A:** Blue (1) border, Green (3) center. (Rows 0-2, Cols 3-5).\n        *   **Frame B:** Magenta (6) border, Blue (1) center. (Rows 0-2, Cols 7-9).\n        *   **Frame C:** Red (2) border, Yellow (4) center. (Rows 4-6, Cols 1-3).\n        *   **Frame D:** Green (3) border, Maroon (9) center. (Rows 5-7, Cols 5-7).\n        *   **Frame E:** Orange (7) border, Red (2) center. (Rows 8-9, Cols 1-3). Note: This frame is at the bottom edge and is \"cut off\", but we treat it as a valid frame structure based on its center and border.\n\n2.  **Determine Relationships (Predator-Prey):** Establish a relationship where Frame X \"targets\" or \"eats\" Frame Y if the **Center Color** of Frame X matches the **Border Color** of Frame Y.\n    *   **A (Center 3) targets D (Border 3).**\n    *   **B (Center 1) targets A (Border 1).**\n    *   **C (Center 4) targets Yellow.** No Yellow frame exists. Target is Null.\n    *   **D (Center 9) targets Maroon.** No Maroon frame exists. Target is Null.\n    *   **E (Center 2) targets C (Border 2).**\n\n3.  **Determine Survival:** A frame survives if and only if:\n    *   It is **not eaten** by another surviving frame. (We trace chains of eating: B eats A; E eats C. B and E are not eaten by anyone).\n    *   **AND** it targets an **existing frame**. (Frames that target nothing, i.e., \"dead ends\" in the color chain, are removed).\n\n    Let's apply this:\n    *   **Chain 1:** B -> A -> D -> Null.\n        *   **B** targets A (exists) and is not eaten. **B Survives.**\n        *   **A** is eaten by B. **A is Removed.**\n        *   **D** is not eaten (because A was removed). However, D targets Null (Maroon). **D is Removed.**\n    *   **Chain 2:** E -> C -> Null.\n        *   **E** targets C (exists) and is not eaten. **E Survives.**\n        *   **C** is eaten by E. **C is Removed.** (Also C targets Null, so it would be removed anyway).\n\n    **Result:**\n    *   **Survivors:** Frame B and Frame E.\n    *   **Removed:** Frame A, Frame C, Frame D.\n\n4.  **Update Centers:** Surviving frames update their center color to the *original* center color of the frame they targeted.\n    *   **Frame B** targeted A. A's original center was 3 (Green). **B's new center is 3.**\n    *   **Frame E** targeted C. C's original center was 4 (Yellow). **E's new center is 4.**\n\n5.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   Draw the surviving frames with updated centers.\n    *   Clear the areas of removed frames (set pixels to 0).\n    *   Preserve static background elements (the gray 5s) unless they were part of a cleared frame (which they are not).\n\n**Detailed Grid Construction:**\n\n*   **Row 0-2:**\n    *   Frame A (Blue) at cols 3-5 is removed -> 0,0,0.\n    *   Frame B (Magenta) at cols 7-9 stays. Center at (1,8) changes from 1 to 3.\n    *   Resulting top right: `0,6,6,6` / `0,6,3,6` / `0,6,6,6`.\n*   **Row 3:** Static 5s remain. `5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0`.\n*   **Row 4-6 (Left):** Frame C (Red) at cols 1-3 is removed. The surrounding 5s remain.\n*   **Row 5-7 (Right):** Frame D (Green) at cols 5-7 is removed.\n*   **Row 8-9 (Left):** Frame E (Orange) at cols 1-3 stays. Center at (9,2) changes from 2 to 4.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,7,7,7,0,5,5,0,0,5\n0,7,4,7,0,0,0,5,5,0",

Pattern 3 has no inheritance relationship, so it's also removed.\n\nPattern 2's center updates: 1 \u2192 3 (from pattern 1's center)\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3,6\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6\n5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0\n5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5\n0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,0\n```",
