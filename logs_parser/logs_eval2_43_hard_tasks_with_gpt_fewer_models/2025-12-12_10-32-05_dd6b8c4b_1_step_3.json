        "Full raw LLM response": "**Final Strategy and Predicted Test Input Output**\n\nOkay, here's what I've figured out after a deep dive into these ARC tasks. I've been wrestling with this one for a while, but I think I've cracked the code!\n\nHere's the plan. First, I'm going to take the test input grid. I'll replace all the \"9\" values (maroon) in the grid with \"7\" (the background color). I'm guessing \"7\" since this is what has been observed in similar transforms. This gets me the initial grid.\n\nThen, I'm going to determine the 3x3 sensor state. After much effort, this is my final strategy:\n\n1.  **Look for Wall vs Gap.** Walls (represented by the 6) around a sensor lead to activations, while Gaps (7) allow for the value to \"pass through.\"\n\n    *   Top: Is a Gap, as are the Bottom\n    *   Left and Right are Walls.\n2.  **Locate threats:** Identify if there are \"9\"s that may affect the cells of the sensor.\n\n    *   Check for direct threats. A direct threat refers to a \"9\" pixel that is positioned in the column or row closest to the wall or gap. If a direct threat is present in the gap, the value of the sensor cell becomes \"9\". If a direct threat is present in the wall, the value of the sensor cell becomes \"3\" (blocked).\n\n        *   If there are no direct threats, then indirect threats are to be accounted. Indirect threats refer to the \"9\" pixels, which are present but are not direct. If the sensor sees no direct threats, or indirect threats, then it shows the background color: 3.\n    *  Apply the observations to the 3x3 sensor.\n        *   TL (4,4): Has an indirect threat (2,2) and is near a corner wall. The logic tells me it is safe to assign this cell to 9.\n        *   T (4,5): Contains the Top. Contains both a Gap and an indirect threat (0,2), so this remains 3.\n        *   TR (4,6): Indirect threat present at the location (0,8), thus, 3.\n        *   L (5,4): Contains a wall, no threat, thus, 3.\n        *   C (5,5): Unchanged (2) because the input has the original colors.\n        *   R (5,6): Contains a wall and has a threat (5,10), it is safe to assume this is 3.\n        *   BL (6,4): No threat. Wall present. Thus, the value becomes 3.\n        *   B (6,5): Threat at (8,5), and is next to the gap. In this case, 9.\n        *   BR (6,6): No direct threats are present, and this cell is blocked by the wall. The cell takes the value 3.\n\nI am now ready to present the sensor values: 9 3 3 / 3 2 3 / 3 9 3. These 9 values reflect that \"maroon\" values were detected within certain locations, thus activating the corresponding pixels.\n\nFinal Predicted Output:\n9 3 3\n3 2 3\n3 9 3\n\n\nThe transformation rule involves transferring the location of Maroon (9) \"threats\" from the surrounding grid onto the central 3x3 Green/Red sensor, while clearing the threats from the field.\n\n**Logic for Sensor Activation:**\nThe 3x3 sensor corresponds to directions (TL, T, TR, L, C, R, BL, B, BR) relative to the center (5,5).\nThe activation of a sensor cell (changing from 3 to 9) depends on the presence of Maroon (9) pixels in that direction and the status of the \"walls\" (Magenta 6s) surrounding the sensor.\n\n1.  **Top (T) and Bottom (B):**\n    *   **Wall present:** If there is a wall (6s) and *indirect* threats (diagonal), the sensor activates (becomes 9). Example: Ex 1 Top.\n    *   **Gap present:** If there is a gap (7s) in the wall:\n        *   **Direct Threat:** If there is a 9 directly in the column (cols 4-6) aligned with the gap, the sensor activates (becomes 9). Example: Ex 2 Bottom (threat at 8,5).\n        *   **Indirect Threat Only:** If there are only diagonal threats and no direct threat, the sensor remains inactive (3). The threats \"pass through\" safely. Example: Ex 1 Bottom.\n\n2.  **Left (L) and Right (R):**\n    *   **Wall present:** Walls appear to block detection of direct threats from the sides, or side threats are ignored if walled. Example: Ex 1 Left (threat at 6,1, wall present) -> Inactive.\n    *   **No Wall:** In Ex 3, side threats activate the sensor.\n\n3.  **Corners (TL, TR, BL, BR):**\n    *   There is an observed asymmetry in Ex 1. Threats in TL (2,2) activate the TL sensor. Threats in TR, BL, BR do not activate their sensors (or are blocked/too far).\n    *   Rule: TL activates if threats are near. Others default to inactive in the presence of the standard frame.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Grid Cleaning:** All Maroon (9) pixels in the input grid are changed to the background color (7).\n*   **Sensor Update:**\n    *   **Top (4,5):** There is a **Gap** in the top wall (Row 3, Col 5 is 7). There are **No Direct Threats** in columns 4-6 above the sensor. The threats are at (0,2), (0,8), etc. (Indirect). Following the \"Gap + Indirect\" rule (like Ex 1 Bottom), the sensor remains **3** (Green).\n    *   **Bottom (6,5):** There is a **Gap** in the bottom wall (Row 7, Col 5 is 7). There is a **Direct Threat** at (8,5). Following the \"Gap + Direct\" rule (like Ex 2 Bottom), the sensor becomes **9** (Maroon).\n    *   **Left (5,4):** There is a **Wall**. No direct threat. Stays **3**.\n    *   **Right (5,6):** There is a **Wall**. Direct threat at (5,10). Following the \"Wall Blocks Side\" rule (like Ex 1 Left/Right), the sensor stays **3**.\n    *   **Top-Left (4,4):** There are threats at (2,2) and (0,2). Matches Ex 1 TL case. Becomes **9**.\n    *   **Top-Right (4,6):** Threats at (0,8). Matches Ex 1 TR case (Inactive). Stays **3**.\n    *   **Bottom-Left (6,4):** Stays **3**.\n    *   **Bottom-Right (6,6):** Stays **3**.\n    *   **Center (5,5):** Remains **2**.\n\n**Constructing the Output Grid:**\n1.  Copy the background and structure (6s and 7s) from the test input.\n2.  Replace all original 9s with 7s.\n    *   Row 0: `6,6,9,7...` -> `6,6,7,7...`\n    *   Row 2: `9,6,9...` -> `7,6,7...`\n    *   Row 3: `...9` -> `...7`\n    *   Row 5: `...9...` -> `...7...`\n    *   Row 7: `...9` -> `...7`\n    *   Row 8: `7,6,9,7,7,9,7,7,9,6,7` -> `7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7`\n3.  Update the 3x3 center at rows 4-6, cols 4-6 with the calculated pattern:\n    Row 4: `9, 3, 3`\n    Row 5: `3, 2, 3`\n    Row 6: `3, 9, 3`\n\n**Final Output Grid:**\n6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,9,3,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,3,2,3,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,3,9,3,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand the transformation rule by analyzing the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1. Each grid has a 3x3 pattern of 3s with a 2 in the center\n2. There are 6s forming frames/boundaries and scattered 9s\n3. The transformation involves moving 9s into the center pattern\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n1. **Flood-fill from center**: Starting from the 3x3 center (where 2 is), I can reach certain 9s without crossing 6s (which act as walls). These are \"internal 9s\".\n\n2. **Fill mode determination**: \n   - If any internal 9 is in the same row OR column as the center cell (where 2 is), \u2192 **Full fill mode** (entire 3x3 becomes 9)\n   - Otherwise \u2192 **Partial fill mode** (only N cells become 9, where N = count of internal 9s)\n\n3. **Which 9s are removed**:\n   - In partial mode: only internal 9s are removed\n   - In full mode: internal 9s plus external 9s within the frame's row range\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1. The center 3x3 is at rows 4-6, cols 4-6, with 2 at position (5,5)\n\n2. Flood-filling from center (avoiding 6s), I find internal 9s:\n   - (2,2), (2,8), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8)\n\n3. **(8,5) is in column 5** - same column as center \u2192 **Full fill mode**\n\n4. The inner frame spans rows 3-7\n\n5. **Removed 9s**: \n   - Internal: (2,2), (2,8), (8,2), (8,5), (8,8)\n   - External in frame rows: (3,10), (5,10), (7,10)\n\n6. **Kept 9s**: (0,2), (0,8), (2,0) - outside frame range or not in interior columns\n\n**Transformation:**\n- Fill center 3x3 entirely with 9\n- Replace the specified 9s with 7\n\n```\n6,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,6,6\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n9,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,9,9,9,7,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,9,9,9,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,6,6,7,6,6,7,6,7\n7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,6\n```",
