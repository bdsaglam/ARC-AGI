        "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task: Shape Interior Filling**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to crack this ARC puzzle with these examples and test input. Seems like it's about filling the inside of closed shapes with specific colors. Alright, first things first, let's analyze the examples.\n\n**Example 1**: I'm seeing a pattern here. There are shapes with holes, and these holes are getting filled with a color. I need to figure out the connection between the shape, the fill color, and the rest of the grid.  I need to figure out what's the key element that's driving these color transformations.\n\n**Analyzing the Key**: This \"key\" block of pixels seems important. It's usually a small cluster with a few different colors.  In Example 1, it's those pixels in the top right. My hunch is, this key holds the mapping between a shape color and its corresponding fill color. I am now looking at the Example 1 key to see a relationship between the shape color and the fill color.\n\n**Mapping Hypothesis**: Let's check a theory: Maybe adjacent pixel pairs in this key define the mapping. Like, if you have a color A next to color B, it means any shape with color A gets its interior filled with color B. It looks like it.\n\n**Orientation matters**: In Example 2, the pairs seem horizontal, but in Example 1, they are vertical. The direction seems to depend on the layout of the key block itself. If it's tall, use horizontal pairs. If it's wide, use vertical pairs. This might need checking. \n\n**Back to Test Input**: Let's try to apply this. The test input has shapes of Blue(1), Green(3), Red(2), Grey(5), and a key block at the bottom-left. It looks a bit rectangular. I have to read the direction of the pairs from the height/width of this block. It's wider than it is tall, so I am going to try vertical pairs first.\n\n**Vertical Pairs**: These pairs suggest the following: \n*   Grey (5) fills with Maroon (9)\n*   Blue (1), Green (3) and Red (2) don't have pairs, so they stay the same.\n\n**Checking against test inputs**  If vertical pairs work, then, only the Grey shape should get filled, and the rest stay untouched.\n\n**Final Test**: I am applying the Vertical rule on the test input, and checking the mapping. Let's see if this creates the expected output.\n\n**Final Thoughts**: It appears only the interior of the Grey shape needs to be colored with Maroon. So the output grid gets built by copying the input and only changing those pixels. The algorithm is complete!\n\nThe task involves identifying shapes (closed loops of color) and filling their interiors based on a mapping provided by a \"key\" block located elsewhere in the grid.\n\n**1. Analyzing the Examples:**\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   **Shapes:** A Yellow (4) loop, a Green (3) loop, and an Orange (7) loop.\n    *   **Key:** A 5x2 block of pixels in the top-right.\n    *   **Transformation:** The Yellow shape is filled with Magenta (6). The Green shape is filled with Green (3). The Orange shape remains unfilled.\n    *   **Logic:** The key block acts as a map. Since the block is wider than it is tall (5x2), we read the pairs **vertically** (top pixel $\\to$ bottom pixel).\n        *   Column 1: 3 $\\to$ 3 (Green maps to Green).\n        *   Column 2: 4 $\\to$ 6 (Yellow maps to Magenta).\n        *   Other columns map colors not present as shapes (6$\\to$7, 9$\\to$2, 5$\\to$9).\n        *   The Orange (7) shape has no corresponding key starting with 7, so it is not filled.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   **Shapes:** Cyan (8), Grey (5), Yellow (4).\n    *   **Key:** A 2x4 block (taller than wide).\n    *   **Transformation:** Cyan (8) fills with Blue (1). Yellow (4) fills with Grey (5). Grey (5) does not fill.\n    *   **Logic:** Since the block is taller than wide, we read pairs **horizontally**.\n        *   Row 1: 2 $\\to$ 6.\n        *   Row 2: 4 $\\to$ 5 (Yellow maps to Grey).\n        *   Row 3: 6 $\\to$ 8.\n        *   Row 4: 8 $\\to$ 1 (Cyan maps to Blue).\n        *   Grey (5) has no mapping starting with 5, so it remains empty.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   **Shapes:** Red (2), Yellow (4).\n    *   **Key:** A 2x2 block.\n    *   **Transformation:** Red (2) fills with Orange (7). Yellow (4) does not fill.\n    *   **Logic:** The dimensions are equal, but following the rule \"Width $\\ge$ Height implies Vertical\", we check vertical pairs:\n        *   Column 1: 2 $\\to$ 7 (Red maps to Orange).\n        *   Column 2: 6 $\\to$ 1.\n        *   This matches the output.\n\n**2. Solving the Test Input:**\n*   **Shapes identified:**\n    1.  **Blue (1):** Top-left loop.\n    2.  **Green (3):** Top-right loop.\n    3.  **Grey (5):** Middle-right loop.\n    4.  **Red (2):** Bottom-left and bottom-right diamond shapes.\n*   **Key Identification:** There is a distinct block of pixels in the bottom-left corner (Rows 11-12, Cols 0-4).\n    *   Top row: `5, 4, 6, 7, 8`\n    *   Bottom row: `9, 8, 3, 1, 2`\n*   **Determine Orientation:** The key is 5 pixels wide and 2 pixels high. Since Width (5) $\\ge$ Height (2), we interpret the pairs **vertically** (Top $\\to$ Bottom).\n*   **Extract Mapping:**\n    *   5 $\\to$ 9\n    *   4 $\\to$ 8\n    *   6 $\\to$ 3\n    *   7 $\\to$ 1\n    *   8 $\\to$ 2\n*   **Apply Mapping:**\n    *   **Grey (5):** Found in the mapping (5 $\\to$ 9). The interior of the Grey shape must be filled with Maroon (9).\n    *   **Blue (1):** Color 1 is not in the source list (top row of key). No fill.\n    *   **Green (3):** Color 3 is not in the source list. No fill.\n    *   **Red (2):** Color 2 is not in the source list. No fill.\n\n**3. Execution:**\nThe interior of the Grey shape corresponds to the zeros enclosed by the 5s in rows 6 and 7.\n*   Row 6: `... 5, 0, 0, 0, 5 ...` (Cols 7-11) $\\to$ The 0s at cols 8, 9, 10 become 9.\n*   Row 7: `... 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5` (Cols 7-12) $\\to$ The 0s at cols 8, 9, 10, 11 become 9.\n\nAll other pixels remain unchanged.\n\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,5,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,9,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to identify the transformation pattern from the examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1. **Reference Grid:** Each example has a small color mapping grid (either 2\u00d7N or N\u00d72):\n   - Example 1: rows 0-1, cols 7-11 \u2192 column-wise mapping: 3\u21923, 4\u21926, 6\u21927, 9\u21922, 5\u21929\n   - Example 2: rows 0-3, cols 0-1 \u2192 row-wise mapping: 2\u21926, 4\u21925, 6\u21928, 8\u21921\n   - Example 3: rows 0-1, cols 1-2 \u2192 column-wise mapping: 2\u21927, 6\u21921\n\n2. **Transformation Rule:** For shapes whose color appears as a KEY (top row for 2\u00d7N, or left column for N\u00d72):\n   - Find all 0s that are \"interior\" (enclosed by the shape, not connected to exterior via 0s)\n   - Fill those interior 0s with the corresponding mapped value\n\n3. **Shapes with colors NOT in the keys remain unchanged**\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n**Reference Grid** (rows 11-12, cols 0-4):\n```\n5,4,6,7,8\n9,8,3,1,2\n```\nMapping: 5\u21929, 4\u21928, 6\u21923, 7\u21921, 8\u21922\n\n**Shapes in the grid:**\n- **1-shape** (rows 0-3): 1 is NOT a key \u2192 no change\n- **3-shape** (rows 0-3): 3 is NOT a key \u2192 no change  \n- **2-shapes** (small crosses): 2 is NOT a key \u2192 no change\n- **5-shape** (rows 5-9): 5 IS a key \u2192 fill interior with 9\n\n**Finding interior 0s of the 5-shape:**\nThe 5s form a boundary around cells (6,8), (6,9), (6,10), (7,8), (7,9), (7,10), (7,11). Flood-fill analysis confirms these 0s are enclosed (not connected to exterior). They get filled with 9.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n\n```\n0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,0,3,0\n0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,0\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,5,0\n0,2,0,2,0,0,0,5,9,9,9,9,5\n0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n5,4,6,7,8,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0\n9,8,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n```",
