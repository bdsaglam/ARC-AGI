        "Full raw LLM response": "**My Process for Solving this ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm thinking about this ARC puzzle. The goal is to figure out the pattern and fill in the missing parts (the 8s).  I'm given examples and a test input, and I'm treating this like a detective problem, looking for clues.\n\nFirst, I look at the examples: what are the grid sizes? Is there symmetry?  I noticed the output sizes correlate with the masked regions' dimensions.  The 8s act like a \"window\" hiding a part of the original image, and my job is to \"see\" through that window.\n\nI try to find symmetries: horizontal, vertical, rotational. The most obvious symmetry is the horizontal one. I tried simple reflection along the middle. Sometimes it works, but there are always \"defects\", the 8's, which are key.  Also, sometimes the symmetry is not perfect and has \"errors\" (aka the 8s!).  I started thinking maybe there is some kind of local symmetry instead.\n\nThen, I looked at the 8s. Where are they? What is the corresponding output? I realized that the 8-block itself seems to hold the key. Maybe if I can somehow \"decode\" what's behind them, I'll solve the whole problem. The question became: how does the output relate to the input around the 8s?\n\nI realized that the output usually had some relation to parts of the input where the 8s are missing. I tried all sorts of things!  Mirroring,  Rotation...  The tricky part is that the input has 30 columns, and the 8s are on the side, and then my output only has size 9. How do they match?\n\nThe key insight? The number 31 kept popping up! I realized that for all the solved examples, the rule to fill the missing values can be written as `Val(x) = Val(31-x)`. Meaning the grid effectively has some virtual extra columns. \n\nHowever, this did not directly apply to all columns. When the numbers were in the 'middle' area of each row, it had to get the other number from the boundary! I assumed the boundary was outside and \"reflected\". I spent a long time trying different boundary conditions and discovered that I had the key after reviewing how the boundary had to be reflected to create a sequence that had symmetry! The numbers next to the masked area get copied! So `Val(0) = Val(27)`, `Val(1)=Val(28) and  `Val(2)=Val(29)`. This pattern worked in every example. \n\nBy applying this logic and the 31-rule, I created the output.\n\n\nThe task is to fill in the missing parts of the grid, which are obscured by the digit '8' (representing a light blue color). In all provided examples, the grid exhibits a specific horizontal symmetry property. Specifically, for any row containing the masked region, the values satisfy the palindrome-like condition `Val(c) = Val(31 - c)` where `c` is the column index (0-indexed). This implies a symmetry axis between column 15 and 16.\n\nFor the test input:\n1.  **Identify the masked region**: The digit '8' appears in rows 14 through 22 (9 rows total) and columns 0, 1, and 2 (3 columns total). The output grid should therefore be 9x3.\n2.  **Apply the symmetry rule**: The rule `Val(c) = Val(31 - c)` allows us to determine the values at columns 0, 1, and 2 based on values at the end of the row.\n    *   For column 2: `Val(2) = Val(31 - 2) = Val(29)`. This is the last column of the grid.\n    *   For column 1: `Val(1) = Val(31 - 1) = Val(30)`. Index 30 is out of bounds.\n    *   For column 0: `Val(0) = Val(31 - 0) = Val(31)`. Index 31 is out of bounds.\n3.  **Resolve out-of-bounds indices**: In the solved examples and consistent with the palindrome structure, the values \"wrap around\" or reflect such that `Val(30)` corresponds to `Val(28)` and `Val(31)` corresponds to `Val(27)`. This is equivalent to copying the last three values of the row `Val(27), Val(28), Val(29)` into the first three positions `Val(0), Val(1), Val(2)`.\n    *   `Val(0) = Val(27)`\n    *   `Val(1) = Val(28)`\n    *   `Val(2) = Val(29)`\n\n**Applying this to each row:**\n\n*   **Row 14**: Ends with `...3, 1, 9` (indices 27, 28, 29). Result: `3, 1, 9`.\n*   **Row 15**: Ends with `...2, 9, 9`. Result: `2, 9, 9`.\n*   **Row 16**: Ends with `...2, 9, 9`. Result: `2, 9, 9`.\n*   **Row 17**: Ends with `...3, 1, 9`. Result: `3, 1, 9`.\n*   **Row 18**: Ends with `...7, 2, 7`. Result: `7, 2, 7`.\n*   **Row 19**: Ends with `...9, 7, 7`. Result: `9, 7, 7`.\n*   **Row 20**: Ends with `...7, 6, 1`. Result: `7, 6, 1`.\n*   **Row 21**: Ends with `...7, 6, 6`. Result: `7, 6, 6`.\n*   **Row 22**: Ends with `...4, 5, 1`. Result: `4, 5, 1`.\n\n3,1,9\n2,9,9\n2,9,9\n3,1,9\n7,2,7\n9,7,7\n7,6,1\n7,6,6\n4,5,1",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand the transformation pattern from the solved examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\n1. **Finding the 8s region**: In each example, there's a rectangular block of 8s that masks part of the grid. The output dimensions match this 8s block.\n\n2. **Grid Symmetry**: The grids have symmetry properties:\n   - **Row symmetry**: Row r mirrors row (31-r) - e.g., row 14 = row 17, row 15 = row 16\n   - **Column symmetry**: Column c mirrors column (29-c) for direct mirroring, or (31-c) for the full axis symmetry\n\n3. **Recovery Strategy**:\n   - For rows where the row-mirror has valid (non-8) values, use those values\n   - For rows where both original and mirror have 8s, use column symmetry to recover values\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\nThe 8s are at **rows 14-22, columns 0-2** (9 rows \u00d7 3 columns).\n\n**For rows 18-22** (mirror rows 13-9 have no 8s at these columns):\n- Row 18 uses Row 13 columns 0-2: 4,4,7\n- Row 19 uses Row 12 columns 0-2: 4,4,7  \n- Row 20 uses Row 11 columns 0-2: 6,6,1\n- Row 21 uses Row 10 columns 0-2: 6,6,6\n- Row 22 uses Row 9 columns 0-2: 1,6,1\n\n**For rows 14-17** (mirrors also have 8s, so use column symmetry):\nUsing formula c \u2192 (29-c):\n- Row 14: cols 0,1,2 \u2192 cols 29,28,27 = 9,1,3\n- Row 15: cols 0,1,2 \u2192 cols 29,28,27 = 9,9,2\n- Row 16 = Row 15: 9,9,2\n- Row 17 = Row 14: 9,1,3\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n9,1,3\n9,9,2\n9,9,2\n9,1,3\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n6,6,1\n6,6,6\n1,6,1\n```",
