        "Full raw LLM response": "**Detailed Analysis of an ARC Task and Solution Strategy**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown of my thinking as I approach this ARC problem. The user's provided me with examples and a test case, and I'm tasked with generating the output grid based on these.\n\nFirst, I quickly identify the basic elements: Grids of integer-colored cells. Orange (7) is typically the background. There are shapes/objects made of different colors sprinkled across the grids. The goal is to figure out the transformation applied to these shapes.\n\nI start by thoroughly analyzing the first example. I recognize the background as orange. I notice specific, repeating shapes. I carefully trace the shape, noting its pixels and co-ordinates. In the example, there's a smaller \"shape\" on top of three identical bottom ones. These bottom shapes form a pattern I call a \"cup\" or \"V\" shape.\n\nIn the first output, I note that one of these shapes has been altered. This leads me to focus on symmetry and position. I figure that the *middle* \"cup\" shape is the one changed.\n\nNext, I delve into the second example. Here, I'm dealing with shapes, again. But this time, it's a grid made up of a specific \"inverted pyramid\" shape, but it's made up of the same colour. I go through a painstaking process to locate all instances of this \"inverted pyramid\" shape, and again the focus is on the co-ordinates.\n\nIn the second output, I notice that the shape itself stays, but some pixels turn from orange (7) to a new colour (9). These new pixels seem to be directly above the heads of my \"inverted pyramids\". My hypothesis forms: there's some sort of projectile shooting upwards from the shapes.\n\nNow, I revisit the first example. The shapes there are a different color. Here, I come up with a theory that color is important. Maybe shapes of one color have one behavior, and shapes of another color have a different behavior.\n\nI then move to the third example. This time, there are some shapes again and new interactions. They are a different shape and colour, and the output is again different. In this case, two of these shapes have been altered from one colour to another. This output makes it apparent to me that I'm dealing with projectiles of some kind.\n\nGoing back to the second example, I try to come up with a single set of rules. I start to think that each color is some kind of projectile, and that the position determines the trajectory. Each of these shapes has a certain direction of firing - upwards, downwards, leftwards, and rightwards.\n\nIn the first and third examples, I try to understand the rules of the shape, and the position in relation to the bullet, but I quickly get stuck. Then I have an insight: the direction could be determined by the shape's vertex (or tip, or head), combined with the shape itself. I realize that the bullet landing on a shape could turn all the pixels in that shape the same colour as the bullet.\n\nI create the rule - Shapes \"shoot\" projectiles and their \"main pixel\" determines the direction. This main pixel is the shape's vertex. Upright pyramid shoots up, Corner shapes shoot opposite the direction of missing corner, and inverted pyramid shoots down.\n\nI double-check this for consistency across the examples. In the third example, I can use the new rule to understand the bullet, and determine why pixels change colour.\n\nI then focus my attention on the test input. It's a new grid of coloured pixels. Using my rules, I systematically locate shapes in the grid. I use the bullet and shooting rules to predict where bullets will land, and whether a collision will cause pixels to change. I note any collision, and what happens to pixels in collision.\n\nFinally, I generate the output. I start with a blank grid and apply all transformations, keeping track of any pixel changes. My output seems consistent with the derived rules. I also note that some projectiles become bullets (color 9).\n\nI've carefully considered any ambiguities, edge cases, and collisions. This should represent a complete, logically sound solution to this ARC problem!\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples, the transformation rules are as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Shapes and Roles**: The grid contains objects (connected components of non-background colors). Each object acts as a \"shooter\" that projects a \"bullet\" (a single pixel) to a specific target location based on the shape's type and orientation.\n    *   **Upright Pyramid** (Head at top, base 3 pixels wide below): Shoots from the Head, direction **Up 5 rows** (`row - 5`, `col`).\n    *   **Inverted Pyramid** (Base 3 pixels wide at top, Head below): Shoots from the Head, direction **Down 5 rows** (`row + 5`, `col`).\n    *   **Sideways Pyramid**: Shoots in the direction it points (Left or Right) by **5 columns**.\n    *   **L-Shape (2x2 block with one corner missing)**: Shoots from the \"vertex\" (the pixel with two neighbors in the shape) in the direction **opposite to the missing corner** by **5 steps diagonally** (dx = +/- 5, dy = +/- 5).\n        *   Missing Top-Left -> Shoots Bottom-Right (`row + 5`, `col + 5`).\n        *   Missing Top-Right -> Shoots Bottom-Left (`row + 5`, `col - 5`).\n        *   Missing Bottom-Left -> Shoots Top-Right (`row - 5`, `col + 5`).\n        *   Missing Bottom-Right -> Shoots Top-Left (`row - 5`, `col - 5`).\n\n2.  **Determine Interaction Results**:\n    *   **Empty Space (7)**: If a bullet lands on the background, that pixel becomes **9** (Maroon).\n    *   **Collision (Bullet vs Bullet)**: If two shooters target the same pixel, that pixel becomes **1** (Blue).\n    *   **Hit (Bullet vs Shape)**: If a bullet lands on an existing shape, the *entire* shape changes color to **9** (Maroon). The hit shape still fires its own bullet.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Shapes**:\n    *   **Shape 1 (Top Left)**: L-Shape at `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)`. Missing Top-Left. Vertex at `(3,2)`. Target: `(3+5, 2+5) = (8,7)`.\n    *   **Shape 2 (Top Center)**: Inverted Pyramid at `(2,8), (2,10), (3,9)`. Head at `(3,9)`. Target: `(3+5, 9) = (8,9)`.\n    *   **Shape 3 (Top Right)**: Left-Pointing Pyramid at `(3,14), (4,13), (5,14)`. Head at `(4,13)`. Target: `(4, 13-5) = (4,8)`.\n    *   **Shape 4 (Middle Center)**: Upright Pyramid at `(5,9), (6,8), (6,10)`. Head at `(5,9)`. Target: `(5-5, 9) = (0,9)`.\n    *   **Shape 5 (Middle Left)**: Upright Pyramid at `(7,2), (8,1), (8,3)`. Head at `(7,2)`. Target: `(7-5, 2) = (2,2)`.\n    *   **Shape 6 (Middle Right/Bottom)**: Upright Pyramid at `(13,4), (14,3), (14,5)`. Head at `(13,4)`. Target: `(13-5, 4) = (8,4)`.\n    *   **Shape 7 (Bottom Center)**: L-Shape at `(14,8), (14,9), (15,9)`. Missing Bottom-Left. Vertex at `(14,9)`. Target: `(14-5, 9+5) = (9,14)`.\n    *   **Shape 8 (Bottom Right)**: Upright Pyramid at `(14,14), (15,13), (15,15)`. Head at `(14,14)`. Target: `(14-5, 14) = (9,14)`.\n\n2.  **Resolve Targets and Conflicts**:\n    *   `(8,7)`: Empty -> **9**.\n    *   `(8,9)`: Empty -> **9**.\n    *   `(4,8)`: Empty -> **9**.\n    *   `(0,9)`: Empty -> **9**.\n    *   `(2,2)`: Hit on Shape 1.

The L-shape at rows 14-15, cols 8-9 is the \"different\" pattern among the bottom patterns - it should be changed from 6 to 9 (like Example 3)\n2. Add marks 5 rows above the V-shape apexes:\n   - Shape at rows 13-14 (apex row 13, col 4): mark at row 8, col 4\n   - Shape at rows 14-15 (apex row 14, col 14): mark at row 9, col 14\n\n```\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,6,7,6\n```",
