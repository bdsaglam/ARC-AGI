Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**My Solution for this ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to crack this ARC puzzle based on two examples and a test input. It looks like a grid transformation, going from a larger grid to a smaller one. My initial instinct is to analyze the structures and patterns within the input to understand how they get mapped to the output.\n\n**Example 1 Breakdown:**\n\nI started with Example 1. I quickly counted the rows and columns \u2013 a 30x30 grid to a 5x5 output. My first observation: repetitive sequences like \"1,2,3,4\". I also noticed rectangular \"boxes\" within the grid. These boxes seemed to be the key. I began to track what was inside and what got \"mapped\".\n\nA crucial step was realizing the output wasn't a direct subgrid. Dividing the 30x30 into 6x6 tiles didn't immediately explain things. The output values (0, 2, 6) were also a guide. \"0\" was clearly a background or empty state, \"2\" was linked to noise or the secondary color, and \"6\" seems special \u2013 linked to certain interior characteristics.\n\nIt seemed that these \"boxes\" defined a horizontal structure, with a grid of sorts that the output represents in the horizontal dimension. There's a 30-wide \"Horizontal Band\", which might map to the 5x5 width of the output, but I'm unsure of the row mapping.\n\n**Unraveling the Mapping:**\n\nI kept focusing on the borders and what they encloses. The output's value seemed very linked to these horizontal structures. The key was in the borders. I noticed lines of a single digit, like \"1\" in Example 1 and then `4` in Ex 2. These separated parts of the data. I realized that the boundaries, the color lines that stretched across the full extent of the input, divided the input into \"bands\" or \"levels\" and the 5x5 output maps a row for each.\n\nI hypothesized that \"0\", \"2\", and \"6\" were special in their own way, and that a \"6\" in one part meant output \"6\".\n\nIn Ex 1, a `1` Border made a \"2\". `0`'s were not a color. I saw the borders were crucial to building the mapping, and that I needed to look for a horizontal arrangement, with potentially a Vertical one.\n\n**Test and refinement: Decoding the rule**\n\nI took a good look at the test input. It again had the band structure. The bands here were lines with repeated digits. I then took a long look at the grid structure.\n\nA crucial finding: When a single-color line spans the whole width of the grid, it makes a filled or a partial filled row.\n\nIf the boundary makes a full solid line, it maps the contents and creates a row.\n\nI kept finding vertical alignment to create output columns.\n\n**Applying the Theory:**\n\nFor the test input, I applied the logic. First, two bands, so two rows. The top band (bordered by 1) I had to determine if it was a row for Output or just an active state.\n\nThen the key was to find if a border caused the fill. I decided that, and the interior color value. The color inside the band, the \"feature color\" determined the value. The boundary itself made an output. Then it was a fill rule.\n\nThe value depended on the contents of the cells within the bands. If a cell has a special value, map that value.\n\nFor the bottom, I saw that the pattern has another border, but it seemed more broken, more sparse. The value depended on the feature. The fill was less aggressive. I also noticed that the border of 4 seems to map sparsely. I also saw there was a vertical alignment to be made.\n\nI then did a detailed evaluation to find what the value was inside and the column in output:\n\nWith an 8 in the top left, and no other feature (except the border 1 fill), I got 2, 8, 2, 2, 2\n\nThen with an active band (border 4), I assumed a sparse rule. I saw `0` was the feature color. I saw there was an alignment, and the sparse 2, 0, 2 pattern.\n\nI had 5 rows, each with 5 slots to fill. I saw the fill rule and was satisfied the 5x5 mapping, after a series of checks, and seeing the mapping, was the right rule to follow, given the patterns present in Ex 1 and Ex 2.\n\nIn the end, I predict the output is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n2 8 2 8 2\n0 2 0 2 0\n\nThe ARC task involves mapping a large 30x30 input grid to a smaller 5x5 output grid. The input grid is structured into horizontal and vertical bands defined by specific border lines, creating a layout of \"cells\". The content of these cells determines the values in the output grid.\n\n**Analysis of the Rules:**\n\n1.  **Grid Structure and Bands:**\n    *   **Top Horizontal Band:** Defined by continuous rows of a specific border color. In Example 1 and the Test Input, this color is `1`. This band maps to **Row 1** of the output. Because the border is continuous and of the primary grid color (`1`), the entire row in the output is \"filled\" with a default active color (which is `2`). Specific features override this default.\n    *   **Bottom Horizontal Band:** Defined by rows of a secondary border color. In Example 1, this is `2`; in the Test Input, it is `4`. This band maps to **Row 3** of the output. In Example 1, this band was not \"filled\" (noise mapped to `0`), only specific features were active (`2`). This suggests secondary bands are \"sparse\" unless they contain a feature.\n    *   **Vertical Bands:** Defined by the vertical alignment of features. In Example 1, a feature at the far left created a vertical band in **Column 0**, resulting in `2`s in the gap rows (Row 2, 4) and bottom row. In the Test Input, features are aligned in **Column 1** and **Column 3**.\n\n2.  **Feature Mapping:**\n    *   **Empty/Noise:** Regions containing only the background noise pattern (`1,2,3,4...`) map to `0` if in a sparse band, or `2` if in a filled band.\n    *   **Active Features:** Defined by enclosed regions of specific colors.\n        *   **Black (0) Regions:** Represent \"active holes\". These map to `2` (as seen in Example 1's bottom band).\n        *   **Specific Color Regions:** If a region contains a distinct, non-noise color (like `6` in Example 1), it maps to that color. In the Test Input, the top band features contain the color `8`, so they map to `8`.\n\n3.  **Application to Test Input:**\n    *   **Output Size:** 5x5.\n    *   **Row 0:** Always `0,0,0,0,0` (Header/Margin).\n    *   **Row 1 (Top Band):** Border color is `1` (Continuous/Primary). The row is filled with `2`.\n        *   There is a feature on the left (Cols ~6-11) containing `8`s. Maps to Col 1 -> `8`.\n        *   There is a feature on the right (Cols ~20-25) containing `8`s (and `0`s). Maps to Col 3 -> `8`.\n        *   Result: `2, 8, 2, 8, 2`.\n    *   **Row 3 (Bottom Band):** Border color is `4` (Secondary). The row is sparse.\n        *   Feature on left (Cols ~4-9) containing `0`s. Maps to Col 1 -> `2` (since `0` maps to `2`).\n        *   Feature on right (Cols ~17-21) containing `0`s.

        "Full raw LLM response": "### What to look for\nIn both solved examples the important structures are **hollow square frames** (1-cell-thick borders). All frames have the **same outer size**, so their **interiors** all have the same size too.  \nThe output size matches that **interior size**.\n\n### How the output is computed\n1. **Find all 1-thick square frames** in the input.\n2. **Extract each frame\u2019s interior** (remove the border).\n3. **Overlay the interiors with XOR-on-occupancy** (parity):\n   - A cell is \u201coccupied\u201d in an interior if it is **not 0**.\n   - For each interior position \\((r,c)\\), count how many interiors are occupied there.\n   - If the count is **odd**, the output cell is occupied; if **even**, it is empty.\n4. **Coloring the result**:\n   - occupied \u2192 color **2**\n   - empty \u2192 color **0**\n   - (In one training example there is also a special overlapping marker color that can be preserved, but in this test case no such odd-overlap marker survives, so the output is purely 0/2.)\n\n### Applying to the test input\nThe test grid contains four clear **8\u00d78** framed squares:\n- Two with border color **3** near the top,\n- Two with border color **6** in the lower half.\n\nSo each interior is **6\u00d76**, hence the output is **6\u00d76**.\n\nPerforming the parity overlay of \u201cnonzero vs 0\u201d across the four 6\u00d76 interiors gives the following mask, converted to colors (odd\u21922, even\u21920):\n\n### Output grid\n0,0,2,2,0,0  \n0,0,2,2,0,0  \n2,2,2,2,2,2  \n2,2,2,2,2,2  \n2,2,2,2,2,2  \n0,2,2,2,2,0",
