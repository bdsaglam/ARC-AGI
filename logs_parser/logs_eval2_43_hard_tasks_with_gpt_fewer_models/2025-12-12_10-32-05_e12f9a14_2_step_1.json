Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**My Process for Solving the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm thinking about this ARC task. The goal is to figure out the rule that transforms an input grid into an output grid, and then apply that rule to a test input. I'm taking a very structured approach.\n\n**1. Pattern Recognition & Hypothesis Generation**\n\n*   **Analyze Input/Output Pairs:** My initial step is to carefully examine the sample input-output pairs. I'm focusing on identifying the relationship between the shapes, their colors, and how those colors are mapped in the output. I'm looking for consistent transformations.\n*   **Initial Hypothesis:** It looks like some kind of projection or \"ray casting\" is at play. The internal colors of shapes seem to be \"projected\" outwards, but the directions and what \"blocks\" them is a mystery.\n*   **Digging Deeper:** I'm starting to think about containers or \"walls\" around the colored shapes. The green (3) pixels seem to define the boundaries of something, and the colors *inside* those boundaries are the things that get projected.\n*   **Gap Hypothesis:** I'm seeing gaps within the \"walls\" (meaning where there isn't a continuous border) and that the gaps seem to determine the *direction* of projection.\n*   **Refining the Hypothesis:** Looking at Example 2, the idea solidifies. Gaps in the 3's wall around the 4-colored shape clearly indicate the direction to project the 4 color. The output follows the gaps. I'm working with the idea of inner pixels of a color emitting rays. If a neighbor in a specific direction is not wall-color *or* the same color, there's a gap for a ray to form.\n*   **Formalize the Rules** Let me be sure to state my rule explicitly. I'm starting to formalize the rule:\n    1.  I identify shapes by looking for regions of a single color enclosed by the wall color 3.\n    2.  For each inner pixel, I check its 8 neighbors. If a neighbor isn't wall color and isn't the inner pixel's color, there's a gap in that direction.\n    3.  If there's a gap, project the inner color in that direction until you hit the edge of the grid.\n\n**2. Testing and Refinement**\n\n*   **Testing Hypothesis:** I test the hypothesis with the sample examples. I'm working to confirm that it correctly predicts the output for all the given examples. I am also working to find counter-examples.\n*   **Example 4 Check** This checks my edge cases. My diagonal check seems correct.\n*   **Double-Check and Modify:** If the hypothesis doesn't fully explain the behavior, I modify it.\n    *   I realized the *absence* of wall pixels defines the gap where a ray should be projected.\n    *   Diagonal rays require both cardinals to be wall, to make sure the diagonal is a true gap.\n*   **Diagonal Refinement:** I worked on diagonal gaps.\n\n**3.  Handling Edge Cases & Intersections**\n\n*   **Intersection Logic:** Now I need to consider what happens when rays cross.  I suspect that rays might just pass through each other, or perhaps they block one another.  I need to add the correct rules for \"intersections.\" Ex 3 helped. They bounce off each other, forming a perpendicular with a diagonal ray from the original direction.\n*   **Priority Rules:** Given that, I look to see the correct rule for deflection. The bisector of the two rays is the direction the rays turn.\n\n**4.  Applying the Rules to the Test Input**\n\n*   **Test Input Analysis:** After working out the rules, I turn my attention to the test input. I'll need to go through the grid, identify all the shapes, gaps, and ray paths and trace the projected rays.\n*   **Building the Grid:** I start with a blank grid and mark the known walls and shapes and I'm ready to apply my raycasting logic.\n*   **Output Assembly:** Finally, I'll generate the output grid as a string of the output.\n\nI think I've got this. I am now proceeding to step 4!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to identify shapes containing a specific color, enclosed by a border of color 3 (Green). The transformation involves projecting the inner color outwards from the shape in specific directions. The directions are determined by \"gaps\" or openings in the enclosure.\n\n**Transformation Rules:**\n1.  **Identify Shapes:** Locate regions of a color $C$ ($C \\ne 8$) enclosed by walls of color 3.\n2.  **Determine Rays:** For each pixel of the inner color $C$:\n    *   **Cardinal Directions (Up, Down, Left, Right):** Check the immediate neighbor. If the neighbor is not a Wall (3) and not the inner color $C$, it is considered a \"Cardinal Gap\". Emit a ray of color $C$ in that direction.\n    *   **Diagonal Directions (NW, NE, SW, SE):** Check the diagonal neighbor. If the diagonal neighbor is \"Open\" (not Wall, not $C$) AND the two adjacent cardinal neighbors (e.g., for NE, the N and E neighbors) are BOTH Walls (3), then it is a \"Diagonal Gap\". Emit a ray of color $C$ in that direction.\n3.  **Ray Propagation:** Rays travel in a straight line, changing background pixels (8) to color $C$.\n4.  **Ray Interactions:**\n    *   **Collision:** If two rays intersect at a specific cell, the rays stop at the cell before the intersection. The intersection cell remains background (8).\n    *   **Deflection:** Upon collision, the rays deflect.\n        *   If the collision is perpendicular (e.g., Horizontal vs Vertical), the rays deflect by 45 degrees into the \"bisecting\" diagonal direction relative to their incoming paths. (e.g., East + North -> North-East).\n        *   If the collision is acute (e.g., Diagonal vs Vertical), the rays \"swap\" behaviors (e.g., Diagonal becomes Vertical, Vertical becomes Diagonal).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Shape 1 (Color 2, Red):**\n    *   Location: ~Row 5, Col 4.\n    *   **Up Ray:** From (5,4) through gap at (4,4).\n    *   **Left Ray:** From (5,4) through gap at (5,3).\n    *   **Diagonal DR Ray:** From (6,5) through gap at (7,6).\n*   **Shape 2 (Color 4, Yellow):**\n    *   Location: ~Row 5, Col 16.\n    *   **Right Ray:** From (5,16) through gap at (5,17).\n    *   **Down Ray:** From (6,15) through gap at (7,15).\n    *   **Diagonal UL Ray:** From (5,15) through gap at (4,14).\n*   **Shape 3 (Color 6, Magenta):**\n    *   Location: ~Row 14, Col 23.\n    *   **Up Ray:** From (14,23) through gap at (13,23).\n    *   **Diagonal UR Ray:** From (14,24) through gap at (13,25).\n    *   **Diagonal DR Ray:** From (15,24) through gap at (16,25).\n*   **Shape 4 (Color 7, Orange):**\n    *   Location: ~Row 20, Col 22.\n    *   **Right Ray:** From (20,23) through gap at (20,24).\n    *   **Diagonal DR Ray:** From (21,23) through gap at (22,24).\n*   **Shape 5 (Color 9, Maroon):**\n    *   Location: ~Row 25, Col 1.\n    *   **Up Ray:** From (25,2) through gap at (24,2).\n    *   **Diagonal DR Ray:** From (26,2) through gap at (27,3).\n\n**Intersections & Deflections:**\n1.  **Intersection at (5,2):** Ray 2 (Left) meets Ray 9 (Up).\n    *   (5,2) remains 8.\n    *   Ray 2 deflects North-West (from 4,2).\n    *   Ray 9 deflects North-West (from 5,1).\n2.  **Intersection at (5,23):** Ray 4 (Right) meets Ray 6 (Up).\n    *   (5,23) remains 8.\n    *   Ray 4 deflects North-East (from 4,23).\n    *   Ray 6 deflects North-East (from 5,24).\n3.  **Intersection at (16,15):** Ray 2 (Diagonal SE) meets Ray 4 (Vertical Down).\n    *   (16,15) remains 8.\n    *   Ray 2 (Diagonal) becomes Vertical Down (Color 2).\n    *   Ray 4 (Vertical) becomes Diagonal South-East (Color 4).\n4.  **Intersection at (20,29):** Ray 6 (Diagonal SE) meets Ray 7 (Right). Both end at edge. Cell (20,29) set to 7.\n\n**Final Grid Generation:** The grid is filled based on the calculated ray paths and deflections.\n\noutput:\n2,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6\n8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8\n2,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8\n8,2,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8\n9,8,2,3,2,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,6,8,8,8,8\n8,9,8,2,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,2,2,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,3,3,3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,6\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,6,6,3,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,6,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,4,8,8,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,6,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,4,8,3,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,4,3,7,7,3,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,4,3,3,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n3,3,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,7,8,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,7,8,8\n3,9,9,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,7,8\n3,3,3,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,8",
