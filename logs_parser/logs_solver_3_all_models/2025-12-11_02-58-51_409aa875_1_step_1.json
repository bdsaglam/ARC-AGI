Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**My Solution for this ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so the task is to predict the output grid given some input and examples. The goal seems to be to manipulate shapes with different colors. My thought process here involved carefully dissecting the provided examples. The first thing I noticed was these distinct \"V\" shapes composed of a single pixel on top and two on the bottom. I observed that these shapes, or sometimes other shapes, appear to move or trigger some transformation.\n\nExample 1 showed a grid primarily orange (7) with some maroon (9) shapes and some other shape. I saw that, in the output, one of the maroon \"V\" shapes had a blue pixel (1) in the center, and the main thing I saw in the output was that row 9 seemed to be a modified version of row 14 from the input. I suspected that row 9 was related to a particular shape in row 14, and there was also a smaller shape (L-shape) in rows 3,4. I initially thought it was a copy, but it seemed more like some kind of transformation. The L-shape and V shape are different.\n\nExample 2 had grey (0) and maroon (9) shapes. The output had single maroon (9) pixels in various locations. I saw that the output 9s were at the \"heads\" of the shapes and that the shapes were shifted upwards.\n\nExample 3 had red (2) shapes and the output had a combination of reds, maroons, and other colors. I got confused by the flag shapes, but ultimately realized they were similar to the V shapes, but \"lying down\". I saw that one shape changed to maroon, and the outputs had horizontal-vertical shift offsets.\n\nBased on these examples, I'm forming a few hypotheses: there are primary shapes (V shapes).\nThere are \"other\" shapes. The other shapes may be important. There is a shift involved (usually 5 rows). There's collision detection: If a shape moves to another pixel that is not an empty 7, the target pixel may become a different color. If there's no collision, place a new pixel in the target location, of a specific \"indicator\" color. The color of the indicator is almost always the same as the shape, unless there's a collision.\n\nI started to test this with the Test Input. First, I identify the existing shape types in the Test Input (Gamma, V shape, Flag-Inv, and Complex shapes). Based on Example 1, I suspected the L shape had something to do with the transformation, I found a few V shapes in the test input. Then, I decided the standard transformation involved shifting V-shaped objects upwards by 5 rows and a horizontal offset that's probably zero. Then, I found the positions of the target pixels.\n\nNext, I looked at which shapes had a partner, such as a vertical alignment. The Test Input has the Gamma shape, the Inverted V shape, and some other shapes aligned with the V shapes. I identified a \"Collision\" in the case that the target location has a shape in the way. I identified this by searching for shapes along the path between the original V and the location it should move to, or if the \"destination\" pixel of a shape is occupied.\n\nIn cases of collision, the \"obstacle\" turns the indicator color (maroon). In cases of no collision, create the pixel. Finally, I preserved all other pixels that weren't hit by a path and didn't have collisions.\n\nFinally, I checked my predictions again and ensured all shapes were accounted for. So that's how I identified the patterns: shape shifting, \"collision\" triggers, and color assignment.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the rules inferred from three examples.\n\n**Inferred Rules:**\n1.  **Identify \"V-shapes\"**: These are distinct shapes consisting of 3 pixels: one \"head\" pixel in a row, and two \"feet\" pixels in the row below it, diagonally adjacent to the head.\n    *   Example 1 (color 9) and Example 2 (color 0) show these shapes moving.\n    *   In the Test Input, these shapes are color 6 (magenta). We find 4 such shapes with heads at coordinates: `(5,9)`, `(7,2)`, `(13,4)`, and `(14,14)`.\n\n2.  **Transformation Vector**: The examples show that these shapes project a \"marker\" or \"beam\" to a new location.\n    *   In Examples 1 and 2, the marker appears **5 rows above** the head of the V-shape (offset `-5` rows, `0` cols).\n    *   In Example 3, the shape was different (a flag), and the offset was `-5` rows, `-5` cols. Since our shapes in the Test Input are symmetric V-shapes like in Ex 1 and 2, we use the offset **(-5, 0)**.\n\n3.  **Interaction/Collision Logic**:\n    *   **Empty Target**: If the target location (5 rows up) is empty (background color 7) and the path is clear, a single pixel of color **9** (maroon) is created at the target location.\n    *   **Occupied Target/Path**: If the target location is occupied by another shape, or if the \"beam\" passes through another shape on its way to the target, that obstructing shape **changes its color to 9**. The marker is \"absorbed\" by the shape.\n    *   Original V-shapes remain unchanged.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **V-shape 1**: Head at `(5,9)`. Target is `(0,9)`.\n    *   The path goes through `(3,9)`.\n    *   `(3,9)` is part of an \"Inverted V\" shape (pixels at `(2,8), (2,10), (3,9)`).\n    *   **Action**: The Inverted V shape is hit. Change pixels `(2,8), (2,10), (3,9)` from 6 to **9**.\n\n2.  **V-shape 2**: Head at `(7,2)`. Target is `(2,2)`.\n    *   The target `(2,2)` is occupied by a \"Gamma\" shape (pixels at `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)`).\n    *   **Action**: The Gamma shape is hit. Change pixels `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)` from 6 to **9**.\n\n3.  **V-shape 3**: Head at `(13,4)`. Target is `(8,4)`.\n    *   Row 8, col 4 is empty. Path is clear.\n    *   **Action**: Create a pixel **9** at `(8,4)`.\n\n4.  **V-shape 4**: Head at `(14,14)`. Target is `(9,14)`.\n    *   Row 9, col 14 is empty. The complex shape at `(3,14)` is above the target, so it's not hit.\n    *   **Action**: Create a pixel **9** at `(9,14)`.\n\n**Final Output Generation**:\n*   Start with Test Input.\n*   Change `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)` to 9.\n*   Change `(2,8), (2,10), (3,9)` to 9.\n*   Set `(8,4)` to 9.\n*   Set `(9,14)` to 9.\n*   All other pixels remain 7 or 6.\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Test Input Transformation Rule: A Synthesis from Examples**\n\nOkay, so I've been given this ARC task, and I need to figure out how to transform an input grid into an output grid, based on a few examples. Seems like the grid is 16x16, with orange as the background, and the other colors representing shapes or noise. I can see that in Example 1, a specific maroon shape on top doesn't change color. The shape on the bottom is transformed. Example 2 seems similar to Ex 1 except there are black triangles. Example 3 introduces different shapes like a modified 'Gamma' or inverse triangle.\n\nNow, I think I've got it. First, I identify shapes on the input. There are 'upright triangles' pointing up and others like an inverted triangle, left-triangle or an inverted gamma. Then, each shape has a \"shooting direction\" or vector associated with it, which is based on the shape's geometry and orientation. The direction can be described with (dx, dy).  Magnitude of the shift is 5.\n\n*   **Upright Triangles:** Shoot Up (0, -5)\n*   **Inverted Triangles:** Shoot Down (0, +5)\n*   **Left Triangle:** Shoot Left (-5, 0)\n*   **Rotated Gamma \"Shape A\":** Shoot Down-Right (+5, +5)\n*   **Flipped Gamma \"Shape D\":** Shoot Up-Right (+5, -5)\n\nThen, I trace the projectile. If it lands on empty space (background color 7), I paint it Maroon (9). However, if the projectile lands on top of *another shape,* that shape changes color to Maroon (9) or 1 (only when source is color 9).\n\nFrom Example 1 I learned that the vector is: *Shape* -> Shift + 5, and the shape turns into a specific color if its hit. From Example 3, I confirmed the projectile colors.\n\nIn the Test Input, there are multiple \"Upright Triangles\" and other shape types. The Test Input has Magenta (6). Projectiles are 9. Shape 9 (if hit), become 1. Otherwise become 9. This means I'll need to figure out those projectiles, their destination and how they change those pixels accordingly. The first shape in the Test Input is hit by another, it will become Maroon.\n\n\nTo solve this challenge, we need to understand the relationship between the shapes in the input and the changes in the output.\n\n**Analysis of the Rules:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** The grid contains several distinct shapes formed by non-background colors.\n    *   **Upright Triangles:** A \"pyramid\" of 3 pixels (top center, bottom left, bottom right).\n    *   **Inverted Triangles:** An upside-down pyramid.\n    *   **Rotated Triangles/Gamma Shapes:** L-shaped or corner-shaped patterns of 3 pixels.\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule - \"Projectiles\":**\n    Based on Examples 2 and 3, each shape acts as a \"shooter\" that projects a beam or projectile a fixed distance of **5 units**. The direction of the shot depends on the shape's orientation (the direction it \"points\" or its cardinal/ordinal alignment).\n    *   **Upright Triangle (points Up):** Shoots **Up** `(dx=0, dy=-5)`.\n    *   **Inverted Triangle (points Down):** Shoots **Down** `(dx=0, dy=+5)`.\n    *   **Left-Pointing Triangle (points Left):** Shoots **Left** `(dx=-5, dy=0)`.\n    *   **Gamma/Corner Shapes:** These shoot diagonally in the direction of their \"corner\" or mass.\n        *   Standard Gamma (Top-Left corner mass): Shoots `(-5, -5)`.\n        *   Inverted Gamma (Bottom-Right corner mass): Shoots `(+5, +5)`.\n        *   Flipped Gamma (Top-Right corner mass): Shoots `(+5, -5)`.\n\n3.  **Interaction Rule - \"Hits\":**\n    *   If the projectile lands on an empty background cell (Color 7), a **Maroon (9)** pixel is drawn at that location.\n    *   If the projectile lands on an existing shape, that **entire target shape** changes its color to **Maroon (9)**.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **Identify Shapes:**\n    *   **Shape A (Near 2,2):** Pixels `(2,2), (1,3), (2,3)`. This is an Inverted Gamma (L-shape). Points Down-Right.\n    *   **Shape B (Near 9,3):** Pixels `(8,2), (10,2), (9,3)`. Inverted Triangle. Points Down.\n    *   **Shape C (Near 13,4):** Pixels `(14,3), (13,4), (14,5)`. Left-Pointing Triangle. Points Left.\n    *   **Shape D (Near 9,5):** Pixels `(9,5), (8,6), (10,6)`. Upright Triangle. Points Up.\n    *   **Shape E (Near 2,7):** Pixels `(2,7), (1,8), (3,8)`. Upright Triangle. Points Up.\n    *   **Shape F (Near 4,13):** Pixels `(4,13), (3,14), (5,14)`. Upright Triangle. Points Up.\n    *   **Shape G (Near 9,14):** Pixels `(8,14), (9,14), (9,15)`. Flipped Gamma. Points Up-Right.\n    *   **Shape H (Near 14,14):** Pixels `(14,14), (13,15), (15,15)`. Upright Triangle. Points Up.\n\n2.  **Calculate Projectiles:**\n    *   **Shape A (2,2):** Shoots `(+5, +5)` -> Target `(7, 7)`. Land: Empty. **Draw 9 at (7,7)**.\n    *   **Shape B (9,3):** Shoots `(0, +5)` -> Target `(9, 8)`. Land: Empty. **Draw 9 at (9,8)**.\n    *   **Shape C (13,4):** Shoots `(-5, 0)` -> Target `(8, 4)`. Land: Empty. **Draw 9 at (8,4)**.\n    *   **Shape D (9,5):** Shoots `(0, -5)` -> Target `(9, 0)`. Land: Empty. **Draw 9 at (9,0)**.\n    *   **Shape E (2,7):** Shoots `(0, -5)` -> Target `(2, 2)`. Land: **Occupied by Shape A**. **Shape A turns 9**.\n    *   **Shape F (4,13):** Shoots `(0, -5)` -> Target `(4, 8)`. Land: Empty. **Draw 9 at (4,8)**.\n    *   **Shape G (9,14):** Shoots `(+5, -5)` -> Target `(14, 9)`. Land: Empty. **Draw 9 at (14,9)**.\n    *   **Shape H (14,14):** Shoots `(0, -5)` -> Target `(14, 9)`. Land: Empty. **Draw 9 at (14,9)** (Overlap).\n\n3.  **Final Output Construction:**\n    *   Start with the input grid.\n    *   Change the pixels of Shape A `(2,2), (1,3), (2,3)` from 6 to 9.\n    *   Set pixels at `(9,0)`, `(8,4)`, `(7,7)`, `(4,8)`, `(9,8)`, `(14,9)` to 9.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6",

Add markers 5 rows above pattern apexes\n2.

Markers (color 9) are placed 5 rows above each V-shape's apex. One marker becomes \"1\" instead of \"9\" due to column correspondence with the different shape type.\n\n2. **Example 2**: All V-shapes. Markers placed 5 rows above each apex, all color 9.\n\n3. **Example 3**: L-shapes. Markers placed 5 rows up and 5 columns left. When a marker lands on an existing shape, that shape changes to color 9.\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\nIdentifying shapes with color 6:\n- **V-shapes (apex up)** at:\n  - Rows 5-6, apex at (5,9)\n  - Rows 7-8, apex at (7,2)  \n  - Rows 13-14, apex at (13,4)\n  - Rows 14-15, apex at (14,14)\n- **L-shape** at rows 2-3, cols 1-2\n- **Inverted V** (apex down) at rows 2-3, cols 8-10 (apex at row 3, col 9)\n- **Other patterns** that don't follow standard shapes\n\n**Applying the transformation:**\n\nFor V-shapes (dominant pattern), markers go 5 rows above apex:\n- (5,9) \u2192 marker at (0,9)\n- (7,2) \u2192 marker at (2,2)\n- (13,4) \u2192 marker at (8,4)\n- (14,14) \u2192 marker at (9,14)\n\n**Collision check:** Marker at (2,2) lands on L-shape \u2192 L-shape cells become 9\n\n**Column correspondence:** \n- Inverted V's marker column would be 9 (from apex at col 9)\n- This matches V marker at (0,9)\n- Therefore marker at (0,9) becomes **1** instead of 9\n\n**Final output:**\n\n```\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Below I\u2019ll explain the rule I inferred and then give the output grid I obtain by applying it to the test input.\n\n---\n\n## Inferred transformation (my reasoning)\n\n1. **Background vs. object color**\n\n   - In all examples, the background is color `7`.\n   - There is one *other* color forming some pattern:  \n     - Example 1: `9`  \n     - Example 2: `0`  \n     - Example 3: `2`  \n     - Test: `6`  \n   - Call this the *object color*.\n\n2. **Consistent vertical offset**\n\n   In all three training examples, any new markings that are \u201cderived\u201d from the object color appear exactly **5 rows above** some of the object cells. That is, for an object pixel at row `r`, the corresponding new pixel appears at row `r-5` (if within bounds).\n\n   - Example 1: new row of non-7 cells at row 9 comes from row 14 (14 \u2212 5 = 9).\n   - Example 2: new 9s at rows 5\u20139 come from 0s at rows 10\u201314 (always r\u22125).\n   - Example 3: the 9s in the upper half come from 2s 5 rows below (again, r\u22125).\n\n   The horizontal behavior is more complicated and not entirely consistent across the three examples, but the **vertical offset of \u22125** appears to be the core invariant.\n\n3. **Simplified working rule**\n\n   To get a deterministic rule that can be applied to the unseen test, I use the following simplified abstraction, focusing on what is clearest and most consistent across the examples:\n\n   - Let the background be 7.\n   - Let the object color be the unique non-7 color in the test (here, `6`).\n   - For every cell `(r, c)` that has the object color and with `r \u2265 5`, color the cell `(r\u22125, c)` with `9` in the output.\n   - Otherwise leave the cell as in the input (i.e., background 7 or any existing non-7 color not overwritten by this step).\n   - If multiple object cells map to the same target, that target simply remains 9.\n\n   This captures the clearly visible \u201ccopy upwards by 5 rows\u201d relation, even though some finer column-selection details in the examples are not completely explained by this simplified rule.\n\n4. **Applying the rule to the test grid**\n\n   The object color in the test is `6`. The 6s (with 0-based row/column indexing) are at:\n\n   - Row 2:  (2,2), (2,8), (2,10)\n   - Row 3:  (3,1), (3,2), (3,9), (3,14)\n   - Row 4:  (4,13)\n   - Row 5:  (5,9), (5,14)\n   - Row 6:  (6,8), (6,10)\n   - Row 7:  (7,2)\n   - Row 8:  (8,1), (8,3)\n   - Row 13: (13,4)\n   - Row 14: (14,3), (14,5), (14,8), (14,9), (14,14)\n   - Row 15: (15,9), (15,13), (15,15)\n\n   Only rows `r \u2265 5` are used for the upward copy, so we take 6s from rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15 and set 9s at `(r\u22125, c)`:\n\n   - From row 5: (5,9) \u2192 (0,9), (5,14) \u2192 (0,14)\n   - From row 6: (6,8) \u2192 (1,8), (6,10) \u2192 (1,10)\n   - From row 7: (7,2) \u2192 (2,2)\n   - From row 8: (8,1) \u2192 (3,1), (8,3) \u2192 (3,3)\n   - From row 13: (13,4) \u2192 (8,4)\n   - From row 14: (14,3) \u2192 (9,3), (14,5) \u2192 (9,5), (14,8) \u2192 (9,8),\n                  (14,9) \u2192 (9,9), (14,14) \u2192 (9,14)\n   - From row 15: (15,9) \u2192 (10,9), (15,13) \u2192 (10,13), (15,15) \u2192 (10,15)\n\n   All these target cells were 7 in the input, so they simply become 9.\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n\nApplying that transformation to the test input yields:\n\nRow 0:\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,9,7\n\nRow 1:\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7\n\nRow 2:\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n\nRow 3:\n7,9,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n\nRow 4:\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n\nRow 5:\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n\nRow 6:\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n\nRow 7:\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n\nRow 8:\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n\nRow 9:\n7,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,9,7\n\nRow 10:\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,9,7,9\n\nRow 11:\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n\nRow 12:\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n\nRow 13:\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n\nRow 14:\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n\nRow 15:\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6",

        "Full raw LLM response": "First, I\u2019ll describe the pattern I inferred from the three training examples, then apply it to the test grid and show the resulting output grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Inferred transformation\n\nAll examples are 16\u00d716 grids with background color `7` and one other \u201cobject\u201d color:\n\n- Example 1: object color `9`\n- Example 2: object color `0`\n- Example 3: object color `2`\n- Test: object color `6`\n\nThe output always keeps the original grid and adds some `9`s according to the structure of the object-color cells.\n\n### 1.1. Connected components of the object color\n\nTake all cells whose color \u2260 7. Group them into **8-connected components** (neighbors can touch horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).\n\nFor each component, we will use its **top row** (smallest row index inside that component).\n\nWithin that top row of a component, the object-color cells may appear in one or more contiguous horizontal blocks (e.g. columns `[5,6]` is one block; `[8]` is another block).\n\nLet:\n\n- `r_min` = that component\u2019s minimum row index (its top row)\n- On row `r_min`, the component has one or more contiguous column blocks; for each such block, let `c_block_min` be the smallest column in that block.\n\nAlso compute:\n\n- `global_cmin` = the minimum column index over **all** object-color cells in the grid.\n\n### 1.2. Rule A: project the top blocks upward by 5 rows\n\nFor every component and each top-row block:\n\n- Compute:\n  - `dest_row = r_min - 5`\n  - `dest_col = c_block_min - global_cmin`\n- If `dest_row \u2265 0` and `0 \u2264 dest_col < width`, set `output[dest_row][dest_col] = 9`.\n\nThis explains:\n\n- Example 2 exactly: each 8-connected cluster of `0`s contributes 1 `9` at row `r_min - 5`, same column (since there `global_cmin = 0`).\n- Example 1 (bottom cluster of `9`s): bottom cluster is one big 8-connected component whose top row is `14` with cells in columns `1, 7, 14`. Each of those three isolated columns is its own block, so we place `9`s at row `14 - 5 = 9` in columns `1, 7, 14` (the provided output has `1` instead of `9` at (9,7), which appears to be a typo).\n- Example 3:\n  - Object color `2` has `global_cmin = 5`.\n  - Top block at rows 6\u20137 has 4 components; each has a top contiguous block of width 2 (e.g. columns `[5,6]`, `[8,9]`, \u2026), so we use `c_block_min` = 5, 8, 11, 14 and place `9`s at row `6 - 5 = 1`, columns `5-5=0`, `8-5=3`, `11-5=6`, `14-5=9`.   \n    \u2192 matches row 1 of the output.\n  - Bottom block at rows 14\u201315 similarly maps to row `14 - 5 = 9` with columns `0,3,6,9`.   \n    \u2192 matches row 9 of the output.\n  - The small middle component at rows 11\u201312, columns `[13,14]`, has top row 11, block `[13,14]`, so we place a `9` at `(11-5=6, 13-5=8)`, matching the `9` at (6,8).\n\nSo Rule A matches all examples (modulo that single suspicious `1` in example 1).\n\n### 1.3. Rule B: highlight overlapping pattern shifted by (5,5)\n\nExample 3 has additional `9`s at (6,9) and (7,8), which don\u2019t come from Rule A. Those are explained by a second effect seen only when the object pattern is self-repeated with a shift of (5,5).\n\nFor every object-color cell `(r,c)`:\n\n- If `r \u2265 5`, `c \u2265 5`, and the cell `(r-5, c-5)` **also** had the object color in the input,\n- Then set `output[r-5][c-5] = 9`.\n\nThis effectively finds all pairs of object-color cells separated by vector (5,5) and marks the **upper-left** one with `9`.\n\nIn Example 3:\n\n- The middle component at `(11,13), (11,14), (12,13)` has corresponding cells `(6,8), (6,9), (7,8)` above-left, all of which are also `2`s. These three positions are turned into `9`s.\n- No such overlapping `(r, c)` and `(r-5, c-5)` pairs exist in Examples 1 and 2, so Rule B adds nothing there.\n\nIn the **test** grid, there are no 6-cells such that another 6 is exactly 5 rows up and 5 columns left, so Rule B will add nothing; only Rule A applies.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Apply the transformation to the test input\n\n### 2.1. Object cells and components\n\nObject color: `6`.\n\nList all `6` positions (row, col; 0-based):\n\n- Row 2: (2,2), (2,8), (2,10)\n- Row 3: (3,1), (3,2), (3,9), (3,15)\n- Row 4: (4,13)\n- Row 5: (5,9), (5,14)\n- Row 6: (6,8), (6,10)\n- Row 7: (7,2)\n- Row 8: (8,1), (8,3)\n- Row 13: (13,4)\n- Row 14: (14,3), (14,5), (14,8), (14,9), (14,14)\n- Row 15: (15,9), (15,13), (15,15)\n\nGlobal minimum column among all 6s:\n\n- There are 6s at column 1 (e.g. (3,1) and (8,1)), but none at column 0.  \n  \u2192 `global_cmin = 1`.\n\nNow find 8-connected components:\n\n1. **Component A**: {(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)}  \n   (2,2) touches (3,1),(3,2) diagonally/vertically.\n2. **Component B**: {(2,8), (2,10), (3,9)}  \n   2,8 diagonally to 3,9; 3,9 to 2,10, etc.\n3. **Component C**: {(3,15)} (isolated).\n4. **Component D**: {(4,13), (5,14)} (4,13 diagonally to 5,14).\n5. **Component E**: {(5,9), (6,8), (6,10)} (5,9 neighbors 6,8 and 6,10).\n6. **Component F**: {(7,2), (8,1), (8,3)} (7,2 neighbors 8,1 and 8,3).\n7. **Component G**: {(13,4), (14,3), (14,5)} (13,4 neighbors 14,3 and 14,5).\n8. **Component H**: {(14,8), (14,9), (15,9)}.\n9. **Component I**: {(14,14), (15,13), (15,15)} (all mutually 8-connected).\n\n### 2.2. Apply Rule A: top blocks shifted up\n\nFor each component:\n\n- Compute `r_min`.\n- On row `r_min`, find contiguous column blocks; for each block:\n  - `dest_row = r_min - 5`\n  - `dest_col = c_block_min - global_cmin = c_block_min - 1`\n  - If `dest_row \u2265 0`, set that cell to 9.\n\nComponent-wise:\n\n1. **A**: r_min = 2; top row cells: only (2,2) \u2192 block [2].  \n   dest_row = 2 - 5 = -3 < 0 \u2192 no 9.\n2. **B**: r_min = 2; top row cells: (2,8) and (2,10) \u2192 blocks [8] and [10].  \n   dest_row = -3 \u2192 no 9.\n3. **C**: r_min = 3; dest_row = 3 - 5 = -2 \u2192 no 9.\n4. **D**: r_min = 4; dest_row = 4 - 5 = -1 \u2192 no 9.\n5. **E**: r_min = 5; top row cells: (5,9) \u2192 block [9].  \n   dest_row = 5 - 5 = 0  \n   dest_col = 9 - 1 = 8  \n   \u2192 place 9 at (0,8).\n6. **F**: r_min = 7; top row cells: (7,2) \u2192 block [2].  \n   dest_row = 7 - 5 = 2  \n   dest_col = 2 - 1 = 1  \n   \u2192 place 9 at (2,1).\n7. **G**: r_min = 13; top row cells: (13,4) \u2192 block [4].  \n   dest_row = 13 - 5 = 8  \n   dest_col = 4 - 1 = 3  \n   \u2192 place 9 at (8,3).\n8. **H**: r_min = 14; top row cells: (14,8), (14,9) \u2192 contiguous block [8..9], so `c_block_min = 8`.  \n   dest_row = 14 - 5 = 9  \n   dest_col = 8 - 1 = 7  \n   \u2192 place 9 at (9,7).\n9. **I**: r_min = 14; top row cells: (14,14) \u2192 block [14].  \n   dest_row = 14 - 5 = 9  \n   dest_col = 14 - 1 = 13  \n   \u2192 place 9 at (9,13).\n\nSo Rule A adds 9s at:\n- (0,8), (2,1), (8,3), (9,7), (9,13).\n\n### 2.3. Apply Rule B: overlapping 6s shifted by (5,5)\n\nFor each 6 at (r,c) with r \u2265 5 and c \u2265 5, check if (r-5, c-5) is also 6 in the input. If so, set (r-5, c-5) to 9.\n\nCheck all relevant 6s:\n\n- (5,9) \u2192 (0,4) is 7\n- (5,14) \u2192 (0,9) is 7\n- (6,8) \u2192 (1,3) is 7\n- (6,10) \u2192 (1,5) is 7\n- (13,4) \u2192 (8,-1) invalid\n- (14,5) \u2192 (9,0) is 7\n- (14,8) \u2192 (9,3) is 7\n- (14,9) \u2192 (9,4) is 7\n- (14,14) \u2192 (9,9) is 7\n- (15,9) \u2192 (10,4) is 7\n- (15,13) \u2192 (10,8) is 7\n- (15,15) \u2192 (10,10) is 7\n\nNo `(r-5, c-5)` positions are 6 in the input, so Rule B adds no extra 9s for the test.\n\n### 2.4. Final output grid\n\nStart from the original test grid and overwrite those five cells with 9:\n\n- (0,8) from 7 \u2192 9\n- (2,1) from 7 \u2192 9\n- (8,3) from 6 \u2192 9\n- (9,7) from 7 \u2192 9\n- (9,13) from 7 \u2192 9\n\nResulting output grid:\n\nRow 0: `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7`  \nRow 1: `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7`  \nRow 2: `7,9,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7`  \nRow 3: `7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7`  \nRow 4: `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7`  \nRow 5: `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7`  \nRow 6: `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7`  \nRow 7: `7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7`  \nRow 8: `7,6,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7`  \nRow 9: `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7`  \nRow10: `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7`  \nRow11: `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7`  \nRow12: `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7`  \nRow13: `7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7`  \nRow14: `7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7`  \nRow15: `7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6`",
