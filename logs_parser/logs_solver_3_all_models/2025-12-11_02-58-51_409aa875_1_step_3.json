        "Full raw LLM response": "**Problem-Solving Journey for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got to do: solve this ARC problem. The user's given me three examples and a test case.  I need to figure out the underlying logic. Let's see...\n\nI start by looking at *Example 1*. The grid is orange, mostly. Non-orange pixels form some interesting shapes.  There's a cluster at the top-right and three identical shapes at the bottom. The output shows changes in the middle of the grid.  I immediately focus on the non-orange pixels, the '9's.  I try to visually match the patterns and find potential symmetries or relationships between the top and bottom sets of '9's. The output reveals some '1's.\n\nNext, I dig into the coordinates. I write down everything: pixel locations, colors, changes between input and output. I'm looking for a pattern, a rule.  I start to see a link: the *x* coordinates of the modified pixels in the output match the *x* coordinates of the \"centers\" of the bottom shapes. Could it be mapping?\n\nI try to explain this pattern: Why row 9 of the output is modified to include two 9s, one 1, and two 9s, these appear to occur at the x-coordinates which correspond to the center of each pattern on the bottom and some cluster on the top. I try to explain *why* that row and the *1* specifically.\n\nI move onto *Example 2*. There is a clear pattern. There are no shapes at the top this time. But there are now clear-cut Pyramid shapes at the bottom, marked by black pixels (0s in the input). The shapes show up at various heights and x-coordinates. The output features many 9s, too. I list out these pixels in *output* format.\n\nI then connect the pixels, the pyramid shapes, and their coordinates.  I try to deduce the core rule by cross-referencing x and y coordinates.  I figure out the pyramids' structures, top, and bottom, and identify a clear link.  These pyramids *all* contribute to the output pattern.  I think, could each Pyramid be connected to each marker pixel? I notice that the y-coordinate of the output pixels is always a certain distance from the top of the Pyramids. I test this, measuring the vertical shift between input and output. I test more y coordinates and notice that the y coordinate of all of the output pixels in Example 2 is always five rows below the starting shapes (7 to 2, 10 to 5, 11 to 6).\n\nI find a simple formula: the new y-coordinate is the old y-coordinate minus 5. I think, okay, I think I have it: The top rows of the pyramid shapes get mapped to a set of locations, with a vertical shift of 5 rows down.\n\nI re-examine *Example 1*, now armed with a possible solution. I realize that the bottom shapes act as the source.\n\nNow I move onto *Example 3*. Here, the shapes aren't pyramids. The top has several L shapes and one lone L shape in the center. The key here is to find the relationship.  When I look at the output, the single shape that is separated from the others ends up becoming 9.  I know it *has* to relate. The patterns on row 6 change color, and the output has 9s in a specific pattern. I try to figure out what's different about it from the previous examples, especially as it relates to the lone shape. The X coordinates have a specific pattern, they are 5 places away from each other: I can relate the shapes in the *input* and what changed in the output, what is the connection? The shift is (-5, -5).\n\nThis example is the hardest to understand. It takes a little more effort to see the shape that overlaps and changes to 9.\n\nI need a generalized rule. I can't look at the answers and find out how it works, I need to come up with it on my own. I try different ideas: Reflection? Intersection? But I don't give up.\n\nSo I think, what happens in all the examples? I define a concept: *projection*. I define a vector (dx, dy).  A shape \"projects\" to a new location. If the location is empty, I plot a new pixel (color 9, \"the marker\"). If the location is already occupied, I modify that shape (turn it to 9, maybe \"collision\"). This also helps me determine the horizontal (x) direction to shift. I realize that L shapes need a *x* shift, but Pyramids do not. This makes the logic more consistent. I\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the logic inferred from the three examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Grid Scanning & Shape Identification:** The grids contain background pixels (color 7) and various shapes made of other colors.\n    *   **Pyramids:** A 3-pixel triangle pointing up (e.g., center pixel at `(r, c)`, base at `(r+1, c-1)` and `(r+1, c+1)`). In Examples 1 and 2, these are the primary \"source\" shapes.\n    *   **L-shapes:** In Example 3, we see 3-pixel L-shapes.\n    *   **Orientation & Projection:**\n        *   In Example 1, pyramids at the bottom project markers to a row higher up. The vertical shift is -5 rows (e.g., top of pyramid at row 14 projects to row 9). The horizontal shift is 0.\n        *   In Example 2, pyramids at various heights project markers upwards by 5 rows.\n        *   In Example 3, L-shapes (oriented with the corner at top-left) project markers upwards by 5 rows and leftwards by 5 columns (`shift = (-5, -5)`).\n\n2.  **Transformation Rules:**\n    *   **Source Identification:** Any compatible shape (Pyramid, L-shape) whose projected target falls within the grid boundaries acts as a source. The critical condition seems to be `y_top >= 5`, enabling a projection of `y - 5`.\n    *   **Projection Vectors:**\n        *   **Upward-pointing Pyramid:** Shift is `(-5, 0)`.\n        *   **L-shape (Corner Top-Left):** Shift is `(-5, -5)`.\n        *   **L-shape (Corner Top-Right):** Shift is `(-5, +5)`.\n    *   **Interactions (Collisions):**\n        *   **Empty Space:** If a projection lands on a background pixel (7), it creates a maroon pixel (9).\n        *   **Shape Collision:** If a projection lands on an existing shape, that shape changes color to maroon (9).\n        *   **Marker Collision:** If two projections land on the same empty pixel, they create a blue pixel (1). (Inferred from Ex 1 and applied to Test Input).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Identify Shapes:**\n    1.  **Pyramid** at top `(5, 9)`.\n    2.  **Pyramid** at top `(7, 2)`.\n    3.  **Pyramid** at top `(13, 4)`.\n    4.  **Pyramid** at top `(14, 14)`.\n    5.  **L-shape (Shape 7)** at top `(2, 2)` (pixels `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)`). This shape points Top-Left (corner at Top-Left of the bounding box `(2,1)`... wait, pixels are `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)`. The \"corner\" pixel is `(2,2)`? No, `(3,2)` is the corner of the 'L' structure. It occupies `(2,2)` and `(3,1)` adjacent? No. `(2,2)` is top-right of the 2x2 box. `(3,1)` is bottom-left. `(3,2)` is bottom-right. It's a triangle at the bottom-right of the 2x2. It \"points\" Top-Left. It is located at `y < 5`, so it does not project. It acts as a target.\n    6.  **L-shape (Shape 8)** at top `(14, 8)` (pixels `(14,8), (14,9), (15,9)`). Corner is at `(14,9)`. It occupies the Top-Right of the 2x2 box. It \"points\" Bottom-Left? No, the mass is on the right. The shift vector for a Top-Right corner shape (inverse of Ex 3's Top-Left) is `(-5, +5)`.\n    7.  Other shapes (Inverted Pyramid, Left Arrow) are at `y < 5` or do not match the projection criteria.\n\n*   **Calculate Projections:**\n    1.  **Pyramid (5, 9):** Shifts `(-5, 0)` to `(0, 9)`. Target is empty. **Result: Pixel (0, 9) becomes 9.**\n    2.  **Pyramid (7, 2):** Shifts `(-5, 0)` to `(2, 2)`. Target is occupied by Shape 7. **Result: Shape 7 (pixels 2,2; 3,1; 3,2) turns 9.**\n    3.  **Pyramid (13, 4):** Shifts `(-5, 0)` to `(8, 4)`. Target is empty. **Result: Pixel (8, 4) becomes 9.**\n    4.  **Pyramid (14, 14):** Shifts `(-5, 0)` to `(9, 14)`. Target is empty.\n    5.  **L-shape (14, 8):** Corner at `(14, 9)`. Shifts `(-5, +5)` to `(9, 14)`.\n    *   **Double Collision at (9, 14):** Both the Pyramid and the L-shape project to `(9, 14)`. Based on Example 1 (where the special pixel was 1), a multi-marker collision results in color 1. **Result: Pixel (9, 14) becomes 1.**\n\n**Final Grid Construction:**\nStart with input.\n- Set `(0, 9)` to `9`.\n- Set `(2, 2)`, `(3, 1)`, `(3, 2)` to `9`.\n- Set `(8, 4)` to `9`.\n- Set `(9, 14)` to `1`.\n- Keep all other existing `6`s (magenta) as they are.\n\nOutput Grid:\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Problem Decomposition and Pattern Recognition**\n\nOkay, so I'm diving into this ARC task, and it seems like it boils down to identifying and manipulating patterns within 16x16 grids. My initial thought is to analyze the examples to see what rules are being applied. First, I notice that the background color is always orange (7), and the other colors form distinct shapes or patterns. Crucially, some pixels change in the output, while others stay the same, which suggests a targeted transformation.\n\n**Unraveling Example 1**\n\nLooking closely at Example 1, there's a specific shape (inverted \"V\") in the bottom left, consisting of 9s. I break it down row-by-row, col-by-col to capture its properties. I observe that this shape is duplicated in the output, but also, a version appears at row 9 with the center pixel is blue (1), not maroon (9), which is the input shape color. It's becoming clear that there's a copy-move or duplication operation in play, and row 9 looks to have something special going on.\n\nTracing the output, the row 9 value of 1 looks related to the input shape. It's placed vertically by 5 row numbers above the input shape. From looking at the text from the output text line by line, it is at location 9 in the grid (0-indexed). Examining the output, I discover the pixel at the middle point (index 7) turned 1. The implication of this is a copy to row 9 and modifying the color.\n\n**Discovering the Inverted 'V' Transformation**\n\nWith Example 2, this is where it clicks: there are '0's (grey) making an arrangement (pattern). Reading this one carefully, I realize that the output replaces certain parts with 9's (maroon). I find inverted \"V\" shapes in Example 2 (top pixel followed by diagonal bottom pixels). There are new \"9's\" generated from the \"0's\".\n\nComparing their coordinates, I notice they are vertically offset and are copies or markers. There is a predictable pattern or transformation. It is always an offset by -5 rows. This confirms my hypothesis of markers to the tops of these V patterns.\n\n**Testing the Transformation**\n\nGoing back to Example 1, with this in mind, the transformation is clear. We have a set of inverted \"Vs,\" these get transformed into the new row. I have confirmed there is a shift by five rows. The outputs show the same, and an exception. This indicates a general marker principle at play.\n\nNow, I dig into the \"blue\" pixel exception. It appears as though some kind of collision is occurring. With three occurrences in a row, the output is something different than the general \"9\" rule. I need to figure out why this occurred and if this is a general rule.\n\nReading carefully, I realize there are *two* shapes. So, the new row 9, with the inverted \"V\" markers, is created based on the transformation and a potential intersection (collision). I notice this pattern of *collision* in Example 3, where shapes can \"collide.\"\n\n**Generalizing the Collision Rule**\n\nWith Example 3, there's another shape (2x2 \"L\" shape) appearing. This introduces additional detail: two new shapes (rows 6, 7). This time, the collision happens again (marker and new shape).\n\nAnalyzing the intersection further, the \"blue\" pixel is now understood: when a marker lands where there's already some shape, some change may happen. I deduce a \"collision\" rule - if a marker meets, or intersects an old shape pixel, then change.\n\n**Analyzing the Test Input**\n\nI now approach the test input. It uses magenta (6) and contains different shapes. But I am convinced the strategy is to identify \"Inverted Vs,\" copy to an offset and check for collisions. I list all coordinates and find 4 \"Inverted Vs\" and one other shape type.\n\nThe core rule is clear: *Identify inverted \"V\" shapes.* *Mark a single pixel at a specific vertical offset, with the marker color as maroon (9).*\n\nWhen the offset marker touches some new shape, then apply the intersection rules of color changes.\n\n**Formulating the Solution**\n\nThe solution strategy is:\n1.  Parse the input grid\n2.  Scan the grid for 'Inverted V' shapes (3 pixels).\n3.  For each 'Inverted V', calculate the target location (r - 5, c) and create a marker there, with the new color 9.\n4.  If the marker collides with an existing pixel, a '1' is written.\n5.  Else the marker value (9) is written.\n6.  The new\n\nThe problem asks us to identify a transformation rule based on the examples and apply it to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Shape Identification:**\n    *   **Inverted V:** The primary active shapes are \"Inverted V\" structures (or \"Lambda\" shapes). They consist of a top pixel at `(r, c)` and two leg pixels at `(r+1, c-1)` and `(r+1, c+1)`.\n    *   **Upright V (Ghost):** There is a secondary shape that acts as a modifier. In Example 1, it's a corner shape, but in the Test Input, it appears as an \"Upright V\" (Bottom at `(r, c)`, Tops at `(r-1, c-1)` and `(r-1, c+1)`).\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule:**\n    *   **Primary Projection:** For every \"Inverted V\" shape, a marker is created at a position shifted by **-5 rows** from the top pixel of the shape.\n        *   Source: `(r, c)` (Top of Inverted V)\n        *   Target: `(r-5, c)`\n        *   Default Marker Color: **9** (Maroon).\n    *   **Collision/Interaction:**\n        *   If the target cell `(r-5, c)` aligns with a \"Ghost Projection\" from a top shape, the marker color becomes **1** (Blue).\n        *   The \"Ghost Projection\" vector is determined by the relative position of the top shape to the bottom shape in Example 1. Specifically, if an \"Upright V\" (or equivalent anchor) exists at `(r_up, c_up)`, it projects a ghost to `(r_up + 5, c_up - 5)`.\n        *   If the Primary Projection `(r-5, c)` equals the Ghost Projection `(r_up+5, c_up-5)`, the intersection creates a Blue (**1**) pixel.\n        *   In Example 1, the vertical distance between the top shape and bottom shape was 10 rows, and horizontal offset was 5 columns. This specific alignment triggers the blue color.\n    *   **Overwrite:** If a marker lands on an existing non-background pixel (as seen in Example 3), it overwrites it with the marker color (9).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n1.  **Identify Shapes:**\n    *   **Inverted Vs** (Top pixel coordinates):\n        1.  `(5, 9)` (Legs at `(6, 8), (6, 10)`).\n        2.  `(7, 2)` (Legs at `(8, 1), (8, 3)`).\n        3.  `(13, 4)` (Legs at `(14, 3), (14, 5)`).\n        4.  `(14, 14)` (Legs at `(15, 13), (15, 15)`).\n    *   **Upright V** (Bottom pixel coordinate):\n        1.  `(3, 9)` (Tops at `(2, 8), (2, 10)`).\n\n2.  **Calculate Projections:**\n    *   **Marker 1:** From `(5, 9)` -> Shift `(-5, 0)` -> Target **`(0, 9)`**. Color: 9.\n    *   **Marker 2:** From `(7, 2)` -> Shift `(-5, 0)` -> Target **`(2, 2)`**. Color: 9.\n        *   Note: `(2, 2)` is occupied by color 6. It gets overwritten by 9.\n    *   **Marker 3:** From `(13, 4)` -> Shift `(-5, 0)` -> Target **`(8, 4)`**.\n        *   **Interaction Check:** Calculate relative position to Upright V at `(3, 9)`.\n        *   Difference: Row `13 - 3 = 10`, Col `4 - 9 = -5`.\n        *   This matches the \"Ghost\" alignment vector (Ghost target: `3 + 5 = 8`, `9 - 5 = 4` -> `(8, 4)`).\n        *   Intersection detected! Color: **1**.\n    *   **Marker 4:** From `(14, 14)` -> Shift `(-5, 0)` -> Target **`(9, 14)`**. Color: 9.\n\n3.  **Construct Output:**\n    *   Copy input grid.\n    *   Set `(0, 9)` to **9**.\n    *   Set `(2, 2)` to **9** (overwriting 6).\n    *   Set `(8, 4)` to **1** (overwriting 7).\n    *   Set `(9, 14)` to **9**.\n\noutput:\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6",

The transformation adds marks 5 rows above each V-pattern's apex. One mark is color 1 (special), others are 9.\n\n2. **Example 2**: Contains multiple V-patterns scattered across rows. Marks (all 9s) are added 5 rows above each V apex.\n\n3. **Example 3**: Has repeating patterns with an isolated misaligned pattern. One pattern is changed to 9s, and new marks extend the pattern.\n\n**Key Rule**: For each V-pattern (apex at row R, column C), add a mark at (R-5, C). If there's an isolated pattern of a different shape at the same column, that mark becomes color 1.\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\nV-patterns identified:\n- V at (7, 2): apex row 7, col 2 \u2192 mark at row 2\n- V at (5, 9): apex row 5, col 9 \u2192 mark at row 0\n- V at (13, 4): apex row 13, col 4 \u2192 mark at row 8\n- V at (14, 14): apex row 14, col 14 \u2192 mark at row 9\n\nIsolated patterns:\n- **Inverted V** at rows 2-3, col 9 (same column as V at col 9)\n- **L-shape** at rows 2-3, cols 1-2 (mark location (2,2) overlaps with this)\n\n**Transformation applied:**\n- Mark at (0, 9): Color **1** (V at col 9 paired with inverted V at col 9)\n- Mark at (2, 2): **Skipped** (overlaps with existing L pattern)\n- Mark at (8, 4): Color **9**\n- Mark at (9, 14): Color **9**\n\n```\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1. **Example 1**: Has 3 V-shaped patterns at the bottom (rows 14-15) and an isolated L-shape at rows 3-4. The output adds markers 5 rows above the V-apexes (row 9). The middle V-shape (closest to grid center) gets marked with '1' while others get '9' - this happens because the isolated shape is DIFFERENT from the repeated shapes.\n\n2. **Example 2**: Has multiple V-shapes at various positions, no isolated different shape. All markers are '9'.\n\n3. **Example 3**: Has L-shapes repeated at rows 6-7 and 14-15, with an isolated L-shape at rows 11-12. Since the isolated shape MATCHES the repeated shapes, one L-shape (the one corresponding to translation offset) is changed to '9'. Additional markers at 5 rows above are all '9'.\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\n- V-shapes at: (7,2), (5,9), (13,4), (14,14)\n- L-shapes at: (2-3, 1-2) - isolated, and (14-15, 8-9)\n- The isolated L-shape matches the L-shape at bottom\n\n**Transformation to Apply:**\n\n1. Since isolated L-shape at (2-3, 1-2) corresponds to L-shape at (14-15, 8-9), change the bottom L-shape to 9s\n2. Add markers 5 rows above each V-apex:\n   - V at (5,9): marker at (0,9)\n   - V at (7,2): marker at (2,2) - occupied by L-shape, skip\n   - V at (13,4): marker at (8,4)\n   - V at (14,14): marker at (9,14)\n3. Since L-shapes \u2260 V-shapes (different shapes exist), the V closest to center gets '1'\n   - Col 9 is closest to grid center \u2192 marker at (0,9) = 1\n   - Other markers = 9\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,6,7,6\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Explanation of the transformation and application to the test case\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### 1. What the training examples have in common\n\nIn all three training examples:\n\n- The background color is 7.\n- There is exactly one *other* color \\(P\\) in the input:\n  - Example 1: \\(P = 9\\)\n  - Example 2: \\(P = 0\\)\n  - Example 3: \\(P = 2\\)\n- The non\u20117 pixels form **disjoint connected components of size 3**.\n- Each component is 8\u2011connected and occupies either:\n  - exactly 2 rows (with 1 pixel in one row and 2 in the other), or  \n  - in the test input, we\u2019ll also see a 3\u2011row \u201czigzag\u201d, but that had no training analogue.\n\nFrom the training, two main shapes appear for the 3\u2011pixel components:\n\n1. **V\u2011shapes (triangle\u2011like)**:  \n   2 pixels in one row, 1 pixel in the neighboring row, such that the single pixel is centered between the two.\n   - Example 2 zeros: patterns like  \n     Row r:     `.,0,.`  \n     Row r+1:   `0,.,0`\n   - Example 1 bottom 9\u2019s: similarly `{(14,1),(15,0),(15,2)}`, etc.\n2. **L\u2011shapes**:  \n   2 horizontally adjacent pixels in one row and one pixel in the neighboring row aligned with one of them, e.g.  \n   Row r:     `2,2`  \n   Row r+1:   `2,.`  \n   (and rotations/reflections of this).\n\n### 2. Rule inferred from training\n\nFor each 3\u2011cell component of the non\u20117 color \\(P\\):\n\n1. **Classify its shape** (using just its 3 pixels):\n   - Let the rows that contain pixels be \\(r_1 < r_2\\).  \n   - Count pixels per row: either \\((1,2)\\) or \\((2,1)\\).\n   - If the row with 2 pixels has columns \\((c_{\\min}, c_{\\max})\\) and  \n     the row with 1 pixel has a pixel at column \\(c_A\\) such that  \n     \\(c_A = \\frac{c_{\\min} + c_{\\max}}{2}\\) (i.e., the single pixel is centered between the two), **treat this as a V\u2011type**.\n   - Otherwise (still two rows, counts 1 and 2, but not centered), **treat as an L\u2011type**.\n\n2. **For V\u2011type components**:\n   - Let the **apex** be the row that has only 1 pixel, at \\((r_A, c_A)\\).\n   - In the output, place a 9 at \\((r_A - 5, c_A)\\) if that row index is \u2265 0.\n   - (This matches Example 2 perfectly and matches the bottom triangles of Example 1, apart from the special color 1 in the middle, which I treat as a special case not relevant to new colors.)\n\n3. **For L\u2011type components**:\n   - Let the **pivot** be the \u201cnorth\u2011west\u2011most\u201d pixel of the component:\n     - The pixel with minimal row, and among those, minimal column.\n   - In the output, place a 9 at \\((r_{\\text{pivot}} - 5, c_{\\text{pivot}} - 5)\\) if both row and column indices are \u2265 0.\n   - This exactly reproduces the main pattern of 9\u2019s in Example 3 (those on rows 1, 6 and 9). Extra 9\u2019s in the middle L in Example 3 appear to be additional decoration; the core, consistent behavior across examples is this pivot shift.\n\n4. **All other pixels are left unchanged** (same as input), and if a new 9 lands on a non\u20117 pixel (e.g. overlaps the original foreground color), we simply overwrite it with 9. This happens in Example 3 and is allowed.\n\nWe ignore the special single \u20181\u2019 in Example 1 as a quirk specific to using 9 as both original and \u201cmarker\u201d color; in the test the foreground color is 6, so such an ambiguity does not arise.\n\n### 3. Apply the rule to the test input\n\nForeground color here is \\(P = 6\\). Find all connected components (8\u2011connected) of 6\u2019s and classify them.\n\nList of 6\u2011components (row, col are 0\u2011indexed):\n\n1. **Component A**: `{(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)}`  \n   Layout rows 2\u20133, cols 1\u20132:\n   ```\n   row2:  . 6\n   row3:  6 6\n   ```\n   - Two rows, counts: row2:1, row3:2 \u21d2 1/2 pattern.\n   - Base row3 has cols 1 & 2 (adjacent), apex row2 has col 2; not centered (`(1+2)/2 = 1.5 \u2260 2`) \u21d2 **L\u2011type**.\n   - Pivot = NW\u2011most = (2,2).  \n   - Shift: (2\u22125, 2\u22125) = (\u22123, \u22123) \u21d2 out of bounds \u21d2 **no 9** from this component.\n\n2. **Component B**: `{(2,8), (2,10), (3,9)}`  \n   Layout rows 2\u20133, cols 8\u201310:\n   ```\n   row2:  6 . 6\n   row3:    6\n   ```\n   - Two rows: row2:2, row3:1 \u21d2 2/1 pattern.\n   - Base row2 has cols 8 &10, apex row3 has col 9.  \n     Center check: (8+10)/2 = 9 \u21d2 matches apex col \u21d2 **V\u2011type**.\n   - Apex = (3,9).

        "Full raw LLM response": "After examining the three training pairs, a consistent behaviour emerges for non\u2011background colours other than 0:\n\n- Work row by row from index\u202f5 downwards; a source in row\u202fr writes to row\u202fr\u20135.\n- If all non\u2011background cells in the input start at column\u202f5 or beyond, the copy is also shifted 5 columns to the left; otherwise columns are unchanged. In the test the minimum non\u2011background column is 1, so no horizontal shift is applied.\n- Treat horizontal runs of the same colour. For a destination row with an odd index, take the first cell of each run; for an even destination row copy whole runs only if they are length\u202f\u2265\u202f2. Single\u2011cell runs on even destination rows are ignored. The copied cells are written as colour\u202f9, overwriting whatever was there.\n\nApplying this to the test grid (only colour\u202f6 is present, and all runs are of length\u202f1 except one length\u202f2 in row\u202f14):\n\n- Row\u202f6\u21921 (odd): copy cells at 8 and\u202f10 to row\u202f1.\n- Row\u202f8\u21923 (odd): copy cells at 1 and\u202f3 to row\u202f3.\n- Row\u202f14\u21929 (odd): copy the cells at 3,\u202f5, the start of the run at 8,\u202f9, and the cell at 14 to row\u202f9.\n- Other runs either land on even destination rows with length\u202f1 or are above row\u202f5 and are ignored.\n\nEverything else stays as in the input.

If there is more than one group in the row, reduce each group to its leftmost cell; if there is only one group, keep it as is.\n* Each selected cell at \\((r,c)\\) produces a marker 5 rows above at \\((r-5,\\;c-\\text{min\\_col})\\), where \\(\\text{min\\_col}\\) is the smallest column index of any non\u2011background cell in the input. The marker colour is 9. The rest of the grid stays as it was.\n\nOn the test input the smallest non\u2011background column is 1. Processing the rows as above selects cells at \\((5,9),\\ (7,2),\\ (13,4),\\ (14,8)\\) and \\((14,14)\\), which map to output positions \\((0,8),\\ (2,1),\\ (8,3),\\ (9,7)\\) and \\((9,13)\\).\n\nApplying this to the test grid gives:\n\n```\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n```",
