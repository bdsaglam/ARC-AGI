            "Full raw LLM response": "**Alright, let's break down this ARC problem. Here's how I see it:**\n\nMy main goal is to figure out the rules of this abstract puzzle. It looks like a system of interconnected \"pipes\" or \"tubes\" that transmit colors or \"signals\" based on certain input conditions.\n\nHere's my thought process:\n\n*   **Initial Observation:** I see a grid with various colored shapes, but the primary focus is these recurring vertical and horizontal structures. They remind me of \"pipes.\"\n*   **Structure Identification:** I need to identify these structures and understand their internal structure. Their dimensions, positions, and any distinctive patterns are key.\n*   **\"Port\" and \"Back\" Sides:** I'm guessing that each pipe has a \"port\" side where the signal enters or leaves, and a \"back\" side that defines the structure or wall. The crucial is to determine which color or symbol represents the \"port.\"\n*   **Input Analysis:** I need to understand where the input comes from. In example 1 and 2, I saw isolated pixels. The input pixel emits the signal that is propagated. I need to figure out where that input gets mapped to. I found the input pixel's position relative to a port, that information is key to map the pixel to the port.\n*   **Propagation Logic:** If a signal hits a \"port\" within the tube, it must be propagated in a predictable fashion to other tubes.\n*   **Color Correspondence:** The signals have unique colors. I need to see how the input pixels, structures, and outputs relate to each other in terms of these colors. The color mapping might be based on the shape.\n*   **Hypothesis Formulation:** To test my hypothesis, I try to identify structures by examining isolated pixels that might represent emitters. Then I try to build how the \"placeholders\" that make up the structure should be mapped by the inputs. I have a hypothesis that it must be related to the port that they go. Then, the input to these ports determines what the beam will be. I try to make this hypothesis as simple as possible. So I built one with an inverse relation of the port and the pixel value.\n*   **Algorithm Construction:** Based on my hypothesis, I now know how to build an algorithm that can solve any ARC problem.\n\nLet's test this in other examples, and create a robust solution.\n\n\nThe logic for the transformation is based on identifying \"Port Structures\" and projecting colored beams from them.\n\n1.  **Object Identification**: The grid contains rectangular structures characterized by a specific internal sequence of colors along one edge, acting as a \"Port Strip\".\n    *   **Structure 1 (Top Left Vertical)**: Located at Columns 4-5, Rows 0-6. The \"Port Strip\" is on the right side (Column 5) with the sequence (top-to-bottom): `1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3`.\n    *   **Structure 2 (Middle Right Vertical)**: Located at Columns 24-25, Rows 10-16. The \"Port Strip\" is on the left side (Column 24) with the sequence (top-to-bottom): `3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1`.\n    *   **Structure 3 (Bottom Left Vertical)**: Located at Columns 9-10, Rows 22-28. The \"Port Strip\" is on the right side (Column 10) with the sequence (top-to-bottom): `1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3`.\n    *   **Structure 4 (Top Middle Horizontal)**: Located at Rows 2-3, Columns 18-24. The \"Port Strip\" is on the top side (Row 2) with the sequence (left-to-right): `3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1`.\n\n2.  **Input Mapping**: Isolated pixels (\"Inputs\") adjacent to the \"Back\" (non-port) side of a structure determine the color value for the placeholders `1` and `2` found in the Port Strips.\n    *   **Input 1**: A `9` at (Row 1, Col 0) hits the back of Structure 1. The corresponding port index (Row 1) has the value `1`. Thus, **`1` maps to Color `9`**.\n    *   **Input 2**: A `7` at (Row 11, Col 28) hits the back of Structure 2. The corresponding port index (Row 11) has the value `2` (since the sequence starts at Row 10 with `3, 2...`). Thus, **`2` maps to Color `7`**.\n\n3.  **Beam Projection Rules**:\n    *   Beams are emitted from the \"Port Side\" of each structure, perpendicular to the strip.\n    *   The beam color is determined by the value in the Port Strip sequence (`1` -> 9, `2` -> 7).\n    *   The placeholder `3` acts as a cap and emits no beam.\n    *   Horizontal beams (from Vertical structures) overwrite Vertical beams (from Horizontal structures) in case of overlap.\n    *   Beams are blocked by other structures but overwrite the background.\n\n4.  **Applying to Test Input**:\n    *   **Structure 1 (Emits Right)**:\n        *   Rows 0-1 (`1`): Beam Color 9. Fills Columns 6 to 28.\n        *   Rows 2-5 (`2`): Beam Color 7.\n            *   Rows 2-3 are blocked by Structure 4 at Column 18, so they fill Columns 6-17.\n            *   Rows 4-5 are clear, so they fill Columns 6-28.\n    *   **Structure 2 (Emits Left)**:\n        *   Rows 11-14 (`2`): Beam Color 7. Fills Columns 0 to 23.\n        *   Rows 15-16 (`1`): Beam Color 9. Fills Columns 0 to 23.\n    *   **Structure 3 (Emits Right)**:\n        *   Rows 22-23 (`1`): Beam Color 9. Fills Columns 11 to 28.\n        *   Rows 24-27 (`2`): Beam Color 7. Fills Columns 11 to 28.\n    *   **Structure 4 (Emits Up)**:\n        *   Its beams (Columns 19-24) go Up into Rows 0-1. However, Structure 1 emits Horizontal beams across this area in Rows 0-1. Following the precedence (Horizontal > Vertical), Structure 1's beams (Color 9) overwrite Structure 4's beams.\n\n5.  **Final Grid Generation**:\n    *   Start with Input Grid.\n    *   Apply S1 Beams:\n        *   `R0-1, C6-28` = 9\n        *   `R2-3, C6-17` = 7\n        *   `R4-5, C6-28` = 7\n    *   Apply S2 Beams:\n        *   `R11-14, C0-23` = 7\n        *   `R15-16, C0-23` = 9\n    *   Apply S3 Beams:\n        *   `R22-23, C11-28` = 9\n        *   `R24-27, C11-28` = 7\n\noutput:\n8,8,8,8,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n9,8,8,8,4,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,4,8,8,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,4,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,4,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,4,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,4,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's how I think about solving this ARC task:**\n\nI'm given examples and a test input. I see a teal background and various colored objects. In the output, some background areas get filled with specific colors, linked to isolated pixels (markers) in the input.\n\n*   **Example 1 Analysis:**\n    *   I start by analyzing Example 1, noting the structures (vertical bars, horizontal bars) and the background.\n    *   I see single-pixel markers like `5` (grey), `1` (blue), and `6` (magenta) scattered in the input, and try to understand their role.\n    *   I notice certain regions in the output are filled (horizontal stripes, like magenta, grey and blue).\n    *   My initial hypothesis is that these markers act like \"emitters\", projecting colored lines until they hit a structure. But I see that the projection rows don't always match the marker's row.\n    *   I switch gears: maybe the markers are \"keys\" and the structures are \"locks\", with the keys filling in specific rows aligned to the structures, somehow.\n    *   I then shift to \"shelves\", with different structures/containers.\n    *   I see a relationship between marker *color* and the filled area. For example, marker `6` corresponds to a filled row.\n    *   I identify some \"walls\" (vertical and horizontal structures) and try to connect them to the markers.\n    *   By looking at the \"walls\", I develop a sense of two types: vertical walls acting as backstops for horizontal rays, and horizontal walls that \"receive\" vertical rays.\n    *   The location and color of stripes appear to depend on the set of markers.\n    *   My main insight comes when analyzing the pattern: isolated pixels create a sequence that aligns with walls. I look at it, and there's a pattern, 6, 5, 1, and so on.\n\n*   **Example 2 Analysis:**\n    *   I then move to Example 2 and identify new marker colors and patterns to check if they match Example 1.\n    *   Again, I look at the structures, the markers and the output, trying to find relationships.\n    *   I map all the pixels on the edges.\n    *   The focus is now on the offsets, and I see vertical lines emerging.\n    *   Now, I try to identify a common mechanism, like a general projection.\n    *   Markers are mapped to a specific output, given a number.\n    *   The offset between marker and the output stripe, helps create the algorithm.\n    *   I examine the markers\u2019 positions in the grid as a key factor.\n    *   With the test input, I try to confirm my previous theory with a new set of data.\n\n*   **Refining the Logic:**\n    *   I begin to question my original theory: Is it the markers that make the offsets, or the relationship between the grid edges and the markers.\n    *   I look at how the walls act to change the markers.\n    *   I decide to build a set of rules for the specific markers.\n    *   I consider alignment and see the main points: the walls are the targets, and the marker alignment shows the position.\n    *   I try to create a prediction given all the data.\n    *   The rule boils down to: \"Project from all markers to all walls, then broadcast patterns to all walls of a type\".\n    *   I then focus on the relationship: Inside (marker is within wall's x/y), Outside (marker is beyond wall's x/y). Distance counts.\n\n*   **Test Input and Conclusion:**\n    *   I apply the \"new logic\" to Test Input to see if it makes sense.\n    *   For the horizontal stripes, the colors depend on the y.\n    *   For the vertical stripes, the color depend on the x.\n    *   I confirm my hypothesis with the test data, testing on all values and elements.\n    *   I then construct the results step-by-step to be sure.\n\nThe transformation rule involves projecting \"beams\" or stripes of color from specific \"marker\" pixels (isolated single-color pixels) aligned with the grid's structural \"walls\". The walls are the rectangular blocks of multicolored pixels (colors 2, 3, 4, 1).\n\n**Logical Steps:**\n\n1.  **Identify Walls:** Locate the rectangular structures formed by non-background pixels (excluding isolated single pixels). Note their position (x, y) and orientation (Vertical or Horizontal).\n    *   **Vertical Walls** have a defined top Y coordinate and face Left/Right.\n    *   **Horizontal Walls** have a defined left X coordinate and face Up/Down.\n\n2.  **Identify Markers:** Locate all isolated single pixels in the grid.\n    *   In the Test Input, the markers are:\n        *   `9` at `(1, 0)` (Row 1, Col 0).\n        *   `7` at `(11, 28)` (Row 11, Col 28).\n        *   `6` at `(28, 21)` (Row 28, Col 21).\n\n3.  **Derive Stripe Patterns:**\n    *   Each marker creates a stripe on *all* walls of the compatible orientation based on its relative offset from the wall it is \"aligned\" with (nearest or sharing a coordinate).\n    *   **Horizontal Stripes (on Vertical Walls):** Determine the Row Offset relative to the Top of the aligned Vertical Wall.\n        *   Marker `9` (Row 1) is aligned with Wall 1 (Top Row 1). Offset = `1 - 1 = 0`. **Rule:** Add horizontal stripe of color `9` at `Top + 0`.\n        *   Marker `7` (Row 11) is aligned with Wall 4 (Top Row 10). Offset = `11 - 10 = 1`. **Rule:** Add horizontal stripe of color `7` at `Top + 1`.\n        *   Marker `6` (Row 28) is aligned with Wall 5 (Top Row 22). Offset = `28 - 22 = 6`. **Rule:** Add horizontal stripe of color `6` at `Top + 6`.\n    *   **Vertical Stripes (on Horizontal Walls):** Determine the Column Offset relative to the Left of the aligned Horizontal Wall.\n        *   Marker `6` (Col 21) is inside Wall 3 (Left Col 18). Offset = `21 - 18 = 3`. **Rule:** Add vertical stripe of color `6` at `Left + 3`.\n        *   Marker `9` (Col 0) is distance 4 from Wall 1 (Left Col 4). Following the pattern from Example 1 (distance maps to offset), this implies an Offset of 4. **Rule:** Add vertical stripe of color `9` at `Left + 4`.\n\n4.  **Apply Stripes:**\n    *   **Vertical Walls:** Fill the empty space adjacent to the wall (Left or Right, whichever is the \"outside\" or empty 8-space) with the Horizontal Stripe pattern.\n        *   **Wall 1** (x=4,5, Top=1): Fill Left (cols 0-3). Rows 1 (`9`), 2 (`7`), 7 (`6`).\n        *   **Wall 2** (x=18,19, Top=2): Fill Left (cols 6-17, bounded by W1). Rows 2 (`9`), 3 (`7`), 8 (`6`).\n        *   **Wall 4** (x=24,25, Top=10): Fill Right (cols 26-28). Rows 10 (`9`), 11 (`7`), 16 (`6`).\n        *   **Wall 5** (x=9,10, Top=22): Fill Left (cols 0-8). Rows 22 (`9`), 23 (`7`), 28 (`6`).\n    *   **Horizontal Walls:** Fill the empty space below the wall with the Vertical Stripe pattern.\n        *   **Wall 3** (x=18-24, y=2,3): Fill Down (rows 4-28).\n            *   `Left + 3` (Col 21): Fill with `6`.\n            *   `Left + 4` (Col 22): Fill with `9`.\n\n5.  **Final Output Generation:** Superimpose these stripes onto the original grid (preserving original walls and markers).\n\n8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,4,2,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,9,8,9,9,9,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,9,8,2,4,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,9,8,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,9,8,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,9,8,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,9,8,1,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,9,8,1,1,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Structures**: There are L-shaped or pipe-like structures composed of colors 1, 2, 3, and 4 on a background of 8.\n\n2. **Markers**: Single colored pixels (like 5, 6, 1, 3, 9, 7) positioned at grid edges indicate colors for lines.\n\n3. **Line Extension**: Lines extend perpendicular from the structures:\n   - Vertical structures emit horizontal lines (left or right depending on orientation)\n   - Horizontal structures emit vertical lines (up or down)\n\n4. **Color Assignment**: Three marker colors are assigned to three specific positions in each structure. The marker position determines which row/column gets that color.\n\nFor the test input:\n- **Structure 1** (cols 4-5, rows 0-6): Lines extend LEFT at rows 1, 3, 5\n- **Structure 2** (rows 2-3, cols 18-24): Lines extend DOWN at cols 19, 21, 23  \n- **Structure 3** (cols 24-25, rows 10-16): Lines extend RIGHT at rows 11, 13, 15\n- **Structure 4** (cols 9-10, rows 22-28): Lines extend LEFT at rows 23, 25, 27\n\nMarkers: 9 at (1,0), 7 at (11,28), 6 at (28,21)\n\nColor assignments based on marker alignments:\n- Structure 1: row 1\u21929, row 3\u21927, row 5\u21926\n- Structure 2: col 19\u21929, col 21\u21926, col 23\u21927\n- Structure 3: row 11\u21927, row 13\u21929, row 15\u21926\n- Structure 4: row 23\u21929, row 25\u21927, row 27\u21926\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,7,3,3,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,7,2,4,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,7,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,7,2,4,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,7,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,7,1,4,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,7,1,1,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I can identify the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **L-shaped structures** are identified in the grid, made of combinations of edge markers (1, 3, 4) and internal markers (2).\n\n2. **Standalone markers** (like 5, 6, 9, 7) are placed near these structures and define which \"slots\" get filled.\n\n3. **Lines extend** from each structure in the direction it \"opens\" (toward the side with 2s):\n   - Vertical structures extend horizontally (left or right depending on orientation)\n   - Horizontal structures extend vertically downward\n\n4. **Slot mapping**: Each marker fills specific row/column slots based on its position relative to a structure. The slots are determined by the internal structure (body vs transition positions).\n\nFor the test input:\n- **Structure 1** (cols 4-5, rows 0-6): Opens right, fills rows 1, 2, 3\n- **Structure 3** (cols 24-25, rows 10-16): Opens left, fills rows 11, 12, 15  \n- **Structure 4** (cols 9-10, rows 22-28): Opens right, fills rows 23, 24, 25\n- **Horizontal structure** (rows 2-3, cols 18-24): Opens down, fills cols 21, 22, 23\n\nMarkers: 9 at (1,0) \u2192 transition slots, 7 at (11,28) \u2192 body slot 1, 6 at (28,21) \u2192 body slot 2/3\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,8,8,8,4,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,3,3,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,4,8,8,7\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,2,4,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,1,1,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this task:**\n\nI'm being asked to figure out a pattern in these grids. The core idea seems to be about extending \"beams\" from objects based on the colors of some isolated \"dots\". I'm trying to identify where the colors of these beams are coming from and how to predict their location.\n\nHere's my thought process:\n*   **Initial Analysis**: The grids have a consistent background color and rectangles that I'm calling \"objects\". Some isolated pixels of different colors, the \"dots\", are present.\n*   **Object Properties**: The objects have a red side and a non-red side.  The beams always seem to be perpendicular to and originating from the red side.\n*   **Color Mapping**: I notice that the colors of the beams seem to match the colors of the dots. This is my central clue.\n*   **Coordinate mapping for object beams**: I'm trying to figure out which dot defines a beam's color and if there's any relationship with where it sits on the grid.\n*   **Sorting**: I'm trying to see if there's any logic to determine which dot is associated with which beam from an object. I noticed that the sorted values of the dots sometimes match the value of the beams and the direction is reverse, or the same.\n*   **Dot Influence**: Horizontal and Vertical beams use the closest dot, however, the dot's direction, has to be defined with a new sorting method.  The vertical direction (rows) has to be sorted from top-bottom. The horizontal direction (columns) has to be sorted from left-right.\n*   **Test Input**: Finally, I have a Test Input, I'll need to figure out these steps and apply it to my hypothesis. Based on what I'm seeing from test input, the rule seems to be as follows:\n    *   Find the objects with their red sides, then draw beams perpendicular.\n    *   Find the three dots.\n    *   Sort the dots top-to-bottom on the grid. This also translates to a reverse value from the colours.\n    *   Map the dot values to each beam, which determines its color.\n    *   Horizontal beams, find the x positions. Sort the dots in the horizontal order from left to right, then reverse the dot order.\n*   **Final Hypothesis**: All objects have a red face, which emits beams. The sequence of beams can either be a simple sort of the dot values or a reverse sort. In the test input, it's a reading order that can be either forward or reverse, by the face orientation.\n*   **Apply the rules**: For the Test Input, here are the objects.\n    *   Obj 1 (Vertical) - Beams: 2, 3, 4, Colours: 9, 7, 6.\n    *   Obj 2 (Horizontal) - Beams: 19, 20, 21. Colours: 9, 7, 6.\n    *   Obj 3 (Vertical) - Beams: 12, 13, 14. Colours: 9, 7, 6.\n    *   Obj 4 (Vertical) - Beams: 24, 25, 26. Colours: 9, 7, 6.\n\nThis is my current line of thinking. I hope this gets me close to the solution!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to extend \"beams\" from specific objects in the grid.\nHere is the logic derived from the examples:\n1.  **Identify Objects and \"Red Faces\":** The grids contain rectangular structures made of specific colors (Yellow 4, Green 3, Blue 1, etc.). Each object has one side (a row or a column) that consists mainly of Red (2) pixels. This is the \"Red Face\".\n    *   **Direction:** The beams project outwards from the Red Face, perpendicular to it.\n        *   If Red Face is on the Left, beams project Left.\n        *   If on the Right, beams project Right.\n        *   If on the Top, beams project Up.\n        *   If on the Bottom, beams project Down.\n2.  **Identify \"Dots\":** There are isolated single pixels of distinct colors in the grid (excluding the main objects).\n    *   Example 1 Dots: Magenta (6), Grey (5), Blue (1).\n    *   Example 2 Dots: Maroon (9), Magenta (6), Green (3).\n    *   Test Input Dots: Maroon (9) at `(1, 0)`, Orange (7) at `(11, 28)`, Magenta (6) at `(28, 21)`.\n3.  **Determine Beam Colors and Order:**\n    *   Each object emits exactly 3 parallel beams.\n    *   The colors of the beams correspond to the colors of the 3 Dots.\n    *   The **order** of the colors follows the **vertical (Y-axis) reading order** of the dots (Top to Bottom).\n        *   Test Input Dots sorted by Row (Y):\n            1.  Row 1: Maroon (9).\n            2.  Row 11: Orange (7).\n            3.  Row 28: Magenta (6).\n        *   Therefore, the beam sequence for all objects is **Maroon (9), Orange (7), Magenta (6)**.\n        *   For Vertical objects (beams projecting sideways), the sequence applies Top-to-Bottom.\n        *   For Horizontal objects (beams projecting vertically), the sequence applies Left-to-Right.\n4.  **Beam Positions:**\n    *   Beams originate from the Red pixels of the object.\n    *   Since there are typically 3 beams and 4-6 red pixels, the beams tend to be aligned with the top/left pixels or centered. Given the pattern in examples (often compact or gaps of 1), and Test Input objects having mostly 4 red pixels, we will place beams on the **first three available indices** (e.g., top 3 rows or left 3 columns of the red face).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Object 1 (Top Left, Vertical):**\n    *   Red Face on Right (Col 5). Rows 2, 3, 4, 5.\n    *   Project Right.\n    *   Beams at Rows 2, 3, 4.\n    *   Colors: 9, 7, 6.\n*   **Object 2 (Top Middle, Horizontal):**\n    *   Red Face on Top (Row 2). Cols 19, 20, 21, 22.\n    *   Project Up.\n    *   Beams at Cols 19, 20, 21.\n    *   Colors: 9, 7, 6.\n*   **Object 3 (Middle Right, Vertical):**\n    *   Red Face on Left (Col 24). Rows 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.\n    *   Project Left.\n    *   Beams at Rows 12, 13, 14 (Centered on the 5 pixels, similar to Ex 1 middle alignment).\n    *   Colors: 9, 7, 6.\n*   **Object 4 (Bottom Left, Vertical):**\n    *   Red Face on Right (Col 10). Rows 24, 25, 26, 27.\n    *   Project Right.\n    *   Beams at Rows 24, 25, 26.\n    *   Colors: 9, 7, 6.\n\noutput:\n8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,8,8,8,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,7,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,7\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,4,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,4,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Problem Breakdown & Rule Discovery:**\n\nOkay, so I'm diving into this ARC task. The goal seems to be transforming a grid based on some visual patterns and input examples. The first thing I notice is the grid size - these are big, typically around 25x25 or 30x30, with a light blue background, color '8'. There are these rectangular \"objects\" made of different colors and a scattering of individual pixels or small colored groups. The common transformation seems to be extending colored lines from these rectangular objects, almost like projections.\n\nI've been analyzing the first example. The \"objects\" have these neat, almost bracket-like shapes or bars, usually red on one side. The red side is key. There are also these isolated pixels that seem to determine what color the line will be. Example 1 has a vertical bar (with some colored caps) that produces lines extending horizontally, and it seems the *red* face of the object dictates which direction the line goes.\n\nMy initial thought was that the \"isolated\" pixels somehow drive the line colors and positions, but the actual images made it clear that those pixels weren't directly dictating line location, just color. In the example, I saw these horizontal and vertical objects that seemed to be the key, and the line extends from the side opposite the red face. The trickier part is figuring out *where* the line goes and what color it is.\n\nI've looked at the relationship between the markers and the lines. The output values showed a pattern. I figured out that if the Marker color is known, the object colors can be figured out.\n\n**Formulating the Line Generation Rule:**\n\nSo, the rule for line generation is becoming clearer.\n1.  **Identify Objects:** These are the rectangular, color-blocked sections, often with a consistent color (usually red) on one side.\n2.  **Identify Markers:** These are single pixels or small groups of pixels that aren't background color or part of the objects. They hold the color info.\n3.  **Transformation:**\n    *   For an object with an adjacent color, if no blue, use the red face of the object, else use the Blue face to determine.\n    *   Draw the line, with the Marker color.\n    *   Horizontal or vertical, depends on if the object is vertical/horizontal. The lines are perpendicular to the \"active\" colored face.\n\nIt took a while, but it appears to be: for any marker, project its coordinate. The line will extend until it reaches the edge of the grid or meets the object.\n\nI realized the column or row modulo 11, and that these periodic sectors of 11 are not consistent.\nThe *active face* of the object determines the direction.\nIf Red side = Right, then Left side is Active.\n\nAfter struggling with the line locations, I did figure it out:\n\n1.  Identify all vertical objects.\n2.  If any row contains a color, a line is drawn horizontally in the row, starting at the edge of the object, toward the marker.\n3.  Same for columns/horizontal objects.\n\n**Applying the Rule to the Test Input:**\n\nNow, I'm using that rule for this new test input, which has Maroon and Pink markers. I identified three vertical \"objects\". I found where the line would start.\nNow I'll generate the output, using the logic of: Find the marker, project in the appropriate directions, and get the color.\n\nSo, in the test input, I need to copy the base, identify the objects, identify and apply the lines according to my new rules:\n1.  **Maroon**: Start by drawing Maroon color from the edges.\n2.  **Pink**: Start at 21, and project in the grid, stop at the object.\nThe logic will produce a new grid with these lines.\n\nIt looks like the key is the modulo rule. I'll make sure to get the color and direction correct.\n\nDone.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to extend colored lines from the rectangular \"bracket\" objects based on the position and color of isolated \"marker\" pixels.\n\n**1. Identification of Objects and Markers**\n*   **Objects:** Rectangular structures composed of a vertical or horizontal bar of one color (often Red '2') and a parallel bar of other colors (Yellow '4', Green '3', Blue '1').\n*   **Markers:** Single isolated pixels of colors that are not part of the objects or background '8'. In the test input, we have:\n    *   **Maroon (9)** at Row 1, Column 0.\n    *   **Pink (6)** at Row 28, Column 21.\n\n**2. Transformation Rules**\n*   **Line Generation:** For each Object and each Marker, a line may be generated.\n    *   **Line Orientation:** If the Object is Vertical, it produces Horizontal lines. If Horizontal, Vertical lines. (Test objects are all Vertical).\n    *   **Line Position (Row/Col):** The position is determined by the Marker's coordinate corresponding to the line's orientation (Row for horizontal lines). The mapping follows a modulo 11 rule:\n        *   `Line_Row = Marker_Row % 11`.\n        *   If the calculated row index falls within the vertical span of an Object (adjusted by adding multiples of 11), a line is drawn at that row on that object.\n    *   **Line Color:** The line takes the color of the Marker.\n    *   **Line Direction:** Lines extend horizontally from the \"Active Face\" of the object into the empty space. The \"Active Face\" is determined by color hierarchy: **Blue ('1') > Red ('2') > Others**. The side containing the highest priority color determines the direction of extension (away from that side).\n\n**3. Application to Test Input**\n\n*   **Object 1 (Top Left):** Vertical, Columns 4-5, Rows 1-6.\n    *   **Face:** Right side (Col 5) has Blue ('1'). **Direction: Right.**\n    *   **Maroon Marker (Row 1):** `1 % 11 = 1`. This matches Row 1 of the object. **Draw Maroon line at Row 1, extending Right (Cols 6-28).**\n    *   **Pink Marker (Row 28):** `28 % 11 = 6`. This matches Row 6 of the object. **Draw Pink line at Row 6, extending Right (Cols 6-28).**\n\n*   **Object 2 (Middle Left):** Vertical, Columns 24-25, Rows 11-16.\n    *   **Face:** Left side (Col 24) has Red ('2') and Blue ('1'). Right side is Yellow. Blue > Yellow. **Direction: Left.**\n    *   **Maroon Marker (Row 1):** `1 % 11 = 1`. In range [11, 16], `1 + 11 = 12`. Matches Row 12. **Draw Maroon line at Row 12, extending Left (Cols 0-23).**\n    *   **Pink Marker (Row 28):** `28 % 11 = 6`. In range [11, 16], `6 + 11 = 17`. 17 is outside span. No line.\n\n*   **Object 3 (Bottom Left):** Vertical, Columns 9-10, Rows 23-28.\n    *   **Face:** Right side (Col 10) has Red ('2'). Left is Yellow. Red > Yellow. **Direction: Right.**\n    *   **Maroon Marker (Row 1):** `1 % 11 = 1`. In range [23, 28], `1 + 22 = 23`. Matches Row 23. **Draw Maroon line at Row 23, extending Right (Cols 11-28).**\n    *   **Pink Marker (Row 28):** `28 % 11 = 6`. In range [23, 28], `6 + 22 = 28`. Matches Row 28. **Draw Pink line at Row 28, extending Right (Cols 11-28).**\n\n**Summary of Changes:**\n*   Row 1: Fill 9s from Col 6 to 28.\n*   Row 6: Fill 6s from Col 6 to 28.\n*   Row 12: Fill 9s from Col 0 to 23.\n*   Row 23: Fill 9s from Col 11 to 28.\n*   Row 28: Fill 6s from Col 11 to 28.\n\n8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,8,8,8,4,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,7\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6",

            "Full raw LLM response": "I began by looking at the solved example pairs and the accompanying sketch to work out what the coloured objects represent. In both examples the \u201cobjects\u201d are 2\u00d7n or n\u00d72 bars made up of three colours: a constant \u201ccap\u201d colour 4, a constant \u201cfront\u2011face\u201d colour 2, and a variable \u201ctop\u2011face\u201d colour (3 in the first example, 1 in the second). The other colours in the inputs are single isolated squares which are not part of the bars; these are the \u201ccargo\u201d colours. The transformation adds new coloured beams to the scene: for each vertical bar beams of each cargo colour are drawn horizontally outwards from the bar, on several rows down the bar, stopping before any existing non\u2011background cell; for each horizontal bar beams of each cargo colour are drawn vertically outwards from the bar\u2019s front\u2011face side, at several columns across the bar, of a short length. In the outputs the original bars are preserved and the beams are simply overlaid on the background, taking care not to overwrite non\u2011background cells.\n\nFor the test case I identified three vertical bars, one horizontal bar, and three cargo colours (6,\u202f7,\u202f9). The front\u2011face side of each bar was determined by the column containing colour\u202f2 for vertical bars and the row containing colour\u202f2 for the horizontal bar. Beams were placed every other row down each vertical bar starting from the second row, using the cargo colours in ascending order, extending to the edge unless blocked, and every other column across the horizontal bar starting from the second column, extending two cells upwards with cargo colours assigned from left to right. Applying this to the test grid and overlaying the beams on the original gives the following output:\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,7,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n9,8,8,8,4,1,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,6,7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,4,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,1,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "### Reasoning\n\nFrom the examples we can distinguish two types of non\u2011background cells:\n\n* **Bars** \u2013 2\u2011cell thick horizontal or vertical rectangles made of the \u201cbar colors\u201d (in the examples these are combinations of 1\u20134). These objects are never changed between input and output.\n* **Single border cells (\u201cseeds\u201d)** \u2013 isolated non\u2011background cells that lie on the outer border of the grid and whose colors are **not** used in any bar. In the solved examples those seed colors are 1,5,6 in example 1 and 3,6,9 in example 2.\n\nThe transformation only affects the background color (8). Bars and the seed cells themselves are preserved.\n\nThe effect of each seed is:\n\n1. Look at which side of the frame the seed is on:\n   * left edge  \u2192 extend **right**\n   * right edge \u2192 extend **left**\n   * top edge   \u2192 extend **down**\n   * bottom edge\u2192 extend **up**\n2. Starting from the seed, move in that direction, overwriting 8s with the seed\u2019s color, until just before the first non\u20118 cell (a bar or another colored cell).  \n   The ray stops one cell before that obstacle.\n3. Do this independently for each seed. If rays overlap, they would just write the same color, but in the given tasks there\u2019s no conflicting overlap.\n\nChecking the training examples:\n\n* In example 1 the isolated bottom and right edge cells (colors 1,5,6) produce straight rays towards the interior until they hit the nearest bar \u2013 matching the new 1/5/6 runs on the background.\n* In example 2:\n  * The seed 3 at the left border row 2 extends horizontally to the right until the vertical bar at column 6, filling columns 2\u20135 with 3.\n  * The seed 9 at left border row 6 similarly fills columns 2\u20135 with 9.\n  * The seed 6 at the top border column 20 extends straight down to row 2, stopping before the horizontal bar at row 3.\n  Bars themselves stay unchanged.\n\nApplying the same rule to the **test input**:\n\n**Seeds in the test grid**\n\n* Color 9 at (row 2, col 1) \u2013 left edge.\n* Color 7 at (row 12, col 29) \u2013 right edge.\n* Color 6 at (row 29, col 22) \u2013 bottom edge.\n\n#### Seed 9 at (2,1), left border\n\nExtend right along row 2 until just before the first non\u20118.\n\nRow 2: `9,8,8,8,4,1,...`  \nFirst non\u20118 after the seed is the 4 at column 5.  \nSo columns 2\u20134 become 9.\n\nRow 2 becomes:\n`9,9,9,9,4,1,8,...`\n\n#### Seed 7 at (12,29), right border\n\nExtend left along row 12 until just before the first non\u20118.\n\nRow 12: `...,2,4,8,8,7` (columns 25\u201329)  \nScanning left from col 29:  \n* col 28 = 8 \u2192 7  \n* col 27 = 8 \u2192 7  \n* col 26 = 4 (bar) \u2192 stop\n\nSo columns 27 and 28 become 7. Column 29 remains 7.\n\nRow 12 becomes:\n`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,7,7,7`\n\n#### Seed 6 at (29,22), bottom border\n\nExtend upward along column 22 until just before first non\u20118.\n\nColumn 22 values from bottom upward:\n* row 29: 6 (seed)\n* rows 28\u20265: all 8\n* row 4: 4 (part of the top horizontal bar)\n\nSo rows 5\u201328 in column 22 become 6; rows 1\u20134 unchanged.\n\n---\n\nPutting all this together, the full **output grid** is:\n\n1. `8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n2. `9,9,9,9,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n3. `8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,8,8,8,8`\n4. `8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,8,8,8`\n5. `8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n6. `8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n7. `8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n8. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n9. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n10. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n11. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3,3,8,8,8`\n12. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,2,4,7,7,7`\n13. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,2,4,8,8,8`\n14. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,2,4,8,8,8`\n15. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,2,4,8,8,8`\n16. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,1,4,8,8,8`\n17. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,1,1,8,8,8`\n18. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n19. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n20. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n21. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n22. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n23. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n24. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n25. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n26. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n27. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n28. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n29. `8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`",

            "Full raw LLM response": "### Reasoning (conceptual reconstruction)\n\n1. **Background vs. objects**\n\n   - In all examples the background is a single color (8).\n   - Non\u20118 pixels form a few composite \u201cbrick\u201d objects that use only three colors from {1,2,3,4}.  \n     - Example\u202f1 bricks use {2,3,4}.  \n     - Example\u202f2 bricks use {1,2,4}.  \n   - Additionally, there are exactly three single\u2011cell \u201cseed\u201d colors that do **not** belong to the brick palette:\n     - Example\u202f1 seeds: {1,5,6}.  \n     - Example\u202f2 seeds: {3,6,9}.  \n     - Test input seeds: {6,7,9} (9 at (2,1), 7 at (12,29), 6 at (29,22)).\n\n2. **What changes from input to output**\n\n   - Brick cells keep their original values and shapes.\n   - Only background cells (8) turn into one of the seed colors.\n   - New pixels appear in long straight horizontal or vertical runs, forming \u201cbeams\u201d attached to the sides of the larger brick structures.\n   - Beams never overwrite existing non\u20118 pixels.\n\n3. **Where beams are drawn**\n\n   From the two examples, the following regularities can be inferred:\n\n   - **Vertical bricks** (tall 2\u2011wide stacks):\n     - For each such brick, beams are drawn horizontally from the side of the brick that is **closer to the nearest outer border** (left or right).\n     - Exactly **three** horizontal beams are produced, at rows spaced two cells apart starting just below the top of the brick:\n       - If the brick spans rows `r0 \u2026 r0+H-1` (H\u22657), beams go on rows  \n         `r0+1`, `r0+3`, `r0+5`.\n     - Along each such row, all background cells between the brick and the border on that side are recolored.\n\n   - **Horizontal bricks** (long 2\u2011high bars):\n     - For each such brick, beams are drawn vertically from the side closer to the nearest outer border (top or bottom).\n     - Exactly **three** vertical beams are produced, at columns spaced two cells apart starting a little in from the left end:\n       - If the brick spans columns `c0 \u2026 c0+L-1` (L\u22657), beams go on columns  \n         `c0+1`, `c0+3`, `c0+5`.\n     - Along each such column, all background cells between the brick and that border are recolored.\n\n   - These rules describe exactly what happens around the bricks in the two given examples: each tall vertical brick gets three horizontal beams, and each long horizontal brick gets three vertical beams.\n\n4. **Beam colors**\n\n   - Collect the three seed colors for the grid and sort them ascending:  \n     - Example\u202f2 seeds {3,6,9} \u2192 [3,6,9];  \n       beams from vertical bricks, top\u2192bottom: 3,6,9;  \n       from horizontal bricks, left\u2192right: 9,6,3.  \n   - Apply the same pattern to the test:\n     - Seeds {6,7,9} \u2192 sorted list [6,7,9].\n     - Horizontal beams from vertical bricks (top\u2192bottom) take colors 6,7,9.\n     - Vertical beams from horizontal bricks (left\u2192right) take colors 9,7,6.\n   - Seeds themselves are never overwritten; beams recolor only background cells.\n\n5. **Identify bricks in the test input**\n\n   - **Brick A (vertical)** at columns 5\u20136, rows 1\u20137.\n   - **Brick B (horizontal)** at rows 3\u20134, columns 19\u201325.\n   - **Brick C (vertical)** at columns 25\u201326, rows 11\u201317.\n   - **Brick D (vertical)** at columns 10\u201311, rows 23\u201329.\n\n   Distances to borders choose beam directions:\n   - Brick A is nearer the left edge \u21d2 beams go left.\n   - Brick C nearer the right edge \u21d2 beams go right.\n   - Brick D nearer the left edge \u21d2 beams go left.\n   - Brick B nearer the top \u21d2 beams go up.\n\n6. **Apply the beam rules**\n\n   **From Brick A (rows 1\u20137, cols 5\u20136; beams left):**\n   - Beam rows: 2, 4, 6.\n   - Color order top\u2192bottom: 6, 7, 9.\n   - Recolor background cells from col 4 down to col 1 on those rows:\n     - Row 2, cols 2\u20134 \u2192 6.\n     - Row 4, cols 1\u20134 \u2192 7.\n     - Row 6, cols 1\u20134 \u2192 9.\n\n   **From Brick C (rows 11\u201317, cols 25\u201326; beams right):**\n   - Beam rows: 12, 14, 16.\n   - Colors: 6, 7, 9.\n   - Recolor background cells from col 27 to the right edge:\n     - Row 12, cols 27\u201328 \u2192 6.\n     - Row 14, cols 27\u201328 \u2192 7.\n     - Row 16, cols 27\u201328 \u2192 9.\n\n   **From Brick D (rows 23\u201329, cols 10\u201311; beams left):**\n   - Beam rows: 24, 26, 28.\n   - Colors: 6, 7, 9.\n   - Recolor background cells from col 9 left to col 1:\n     - Row 24, cols 1\u20139 \u2192 6.\n     - Row 26, cols 1\u20139 \u2192 7.\n     - Row 28, cols 1\u20139 \u2192 9.\n\n   **From Brick B (rows 3\u20134, cols 19\u201325; beams up):**\n   - Beam columns: 20, 22, 24.\n   - Color order left\u2192right: 9, 7, 6.\n   - Recolor background cells above the brick, rows 1\u20132:\n     - Column 20, rows 1\u20132 \u2192 9.\n     - Column 22, rows 1\u20132 \u2192 7.\n     - Column 24, rows 1\u20132 \u2192 6.\n\n   All recolorings are only applied where the cell was 8; original brick colors and seeds remain.\n\n---\n\n### Final output grid\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,7,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n9,6,6,6,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,7,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,6,6,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,7,7,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,4,9,9,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "To solve the puzzle you need to detect two kinds of objects in the input:\n\n* Single\u2011cell components; their colours form the palette to be used for the new bars (three colours in each example).\n* \u201cBricks\u201d, which are 2\u00d7N or N\u00d72 coloured blocks on the background. Bricks oriented horizontally generate vertical bars, bricks oriented vertically generate horizontal bars.\n\nFor horizontal bricks you choose the side to extend towards based on the palette cluster along the vertical axis; in the test case the palette lies below the brick, so bars are extended downward. For a width\u20117 brick you place bars in the columns offset +1, +2 and +5 from the brick\u2019s left edge; the bar colours are the palette in ascending order left to right when extending downward. Bars start immediately after the brick and run to the border, colouring background cells only.\n\nFor vertical bricks order them from top to bottom and alternate extension directions starting with left for the topmost. All three bricks here have height 7, so bars are placed in rows at offsets +1, +4 and +5 from the brick\u2019s top. The bar colours are the palette in the order opposite to the horizontal bars (descending here) from top to bottom. Bars run from the brick outwards to the border, painting only background cells.\n\nApplying these rules to the test grid with palette colours {6,\u202f7,\u202f9} gives the following output:\n\n8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,3,3,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,2,4,9,9,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,2,4,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,1,4,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,1,1,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,6,8,9,8,8,8,8,8",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The transformation treats large structures as **projectors** and isolated pixels as a **color palette**.\n*   The direction of projection is controlled by the secondary color bar on the structure: **Blue** projects *forward* (towards the blue), while **Green** projects *backward* (away from the green).\n*   The beams created are stripes that span to the grid edge, composed of the specific colors found in the isolated 'palette' pixels.\n*   Vertical and horizontal beams may overlap; observe the intersection to determine a fixed layering rule (e.g., vertical stripes occlude horizontal ones).\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's my thought process to solve this ARC task:**\n\nI'm being asked to figure out a transformation rule based on a few examples, and then apply it to a new input. My first step is to carefully analyze the input and output grids of the solved examples to figure out the logic behind them.\n\nI notice the grids are pretty big, with a lot of a single color in the background, making it easier to see the important structures. The \"hints\" are key - they talk about \"projectors\", \"color palettes\", and \"direction\". I see these \"projectors\" as the large, rectangular shapes, and \"palette\" as the small, isolated pixels.\n\nI\u2019ll begin by carefully analyzing Example 1, checking each structure and its corresponding output. I am looking for the relationship between the structure's colors and position and how it transforms to the output.\n\nI'm focused on the relationship between these 'projectors' and their corresponding colors and the smaller, isolated pixel colors. I\u2019m thinking they might be related and is what is changing during the transform.\n\nIt seems I have multiple structures, with varying color configurations. I'm trying to identify a \"secondary color bar\" on the structures, as the hints mention they control the projection direction. I\u2019m starting to think that the large structures are \u2018projectors\u2019, and the small pixels serve as a palette that will change the color of the output, based on their position.\n\nI see that the color of these \"bars\" might be important for defining the \"direction\" of the transform. Looking at the examples, there's a connection between colors and the isolated pixels, and I\u2019m making a hypothesis that these pixels are the 'Palette'.\n\nI'm carefully re-reading the hint on beams, as I notice they are lines composed of colors from the palette. I'm focusing on \"direction\" and how the colors of the beams and pixels seem to be related. I see now that each structure has a \u201csecondary color bar\u201d and I\u2019m re-reading what that may mean.\n\nI think the important thing is that these color beams are being projected across the grid, and I need to figure out how the palette and structure details are related to the beam attributes.\n\nI continue analyzing Example 1. I'm noting specific patterns such as colors within the generated beams and where they appear on the palette. It\u2019s becoming clear that the isolated pixels are the color palette, and the structures project beams in a specific direction. I see that the color sequence matters, and the beams pick up colors from these isolated pixels. I think the structure color, combined with palette information determines what the output looks like.\n\nI'm also paying attention to how each structure is positioned relative to the isolated pixels, looking for some pattern.\n\nI try to connect colors in the projected beam with the color on the palette. My hunch is the position of the isolated pixel determines something. I'm looking at the color values and try to find a formula, and I think it may be relative to the position of the projector.\n\nI\u2019m looking for a way the palette pixels are being mapped to these beam colors. I notice a relationship between the pixel\u2019s column and the beam\u2019s color.\n\nI am now focusing on determining the logic to figure out where the beam is created. I think it is projected towards the structure, using an isolated color from the palette. I\u2019m noticing patterns with these pixels.\n\nI am starting to believe there is something about the position of the pixel column. I will need to refine it.\n\nI'm building a hypothesis - palette pixels project beams toward structures and will refine where this projection begins. I am looking at how to map the palette colors to these output beams.\n\nI think I\u2019m seeing patterns now: the palette color corresponds with the position of these beams. I have to go through multiple examples to ensure this is correct.\n\nI need to test this theory: that the structures are \"mirrors\" for the palette pixels and project colors, and confirm how these are being projected across the grid.\n\nI think there may be relationships between beam attributes, and now I'm building a logic based on multiple factors. I\u2019m looking at different horizontal structures to determine what these structures are doing.\n\nI'm thinking about how the beams might intersect and which one would take priority.\n\nI\u2019m noticing that there is an order and mapping from palette color to beam position.\n\nI think that there's an internal sequence and a mapping between these palette pixels. I'm building this pattern in my mind, but I need to figure out the rules.\n\nBased on the horizontal and vertical analysis, I'm forming a clearer rule of how these structures work.\n\nI think the order of colors in the palette may be important, and so I\u2019m looking at how I should be reading the grid for this order. I notice an order to the palette color\n\nBased on the solved examples, the transformation follows these rules:\n\n1.  **Palette Identification:**\n    *   Identify all isolated single pixels in the grid that are not part of any large structure.\n    *   Sort these pixels in reading order (top-to-bottom, then left-to-right) to form a color sequence.\n    *   In the Test Input, the isolated pixels are:\n        *   **9** (Maroon) at (1, 0)\n        *   **7** (Orange) at (11, 28)\n        *   **6** (Magenta) at (30, 21)\n    *   The Palette Sequence is **9, 7, 6**.\n\n2.  **Structure Projection:**\n    *   Large structures act as projectors.\n    *   **Vertical Structures** (Height > Width) project **Horizontal Beams**.\n        *   They use the Palette Sequence in **Normal Order (9, 7, 6)**.\n        *   The beams appear at relative vertical offsets **+1, +4, +5** from the top of the structure's body.\n    *   **Horizontal Structures** (Width > Height) project **Vertical Beams**.\n        *   They use the Palette Sequence in **Reversed Order (6, 7, 9)**.\n        *   The beams appear at relative horizontal offsets **+1, +2, +5** from the left of the structure's body.\n\n3.  **Applying to Test Input:**\n\n    *   **Structure 1 (Top Left, Vertical):**\n        *   Located at Cols 4-5. The body (between the Blue top bar and Green bottom bar) starts at **Row 1**.\n        *   Projects Horizontal Beams to the Right (into empty space).\n        *   Offsets: +1, +4, +5.\n        *   Target Rows: 1+1=**2**, 1+4=**5**, 1+5=**6**.\n        *   Colors: **9** (Row 2), **7** (Row 5), **6** (Row 6).\n\n    *   **Structure 4 (Top Right, Horizontal):**\n        *   Located at Rows 2-3. The body (between Green left bar and Blue right bar) starts at **Col 19** (pixel value 2).\n        *   Projects Vertical Beams Downwards.\n        *   Offsets: +1, +2, +5.\n        *   Target Cols: 19+1=**20**, 19+2=**21**, 19+5=**24**.\n        *   Colors (Reversed): **6** (Col 20), **7** (Col 21), **9** (Col 24).\n        *   *Note: Vertical beams occlude horizontal ones.*\n\n    *   **Structure 2 (Middle Right, Vertical):**\n        *   Located at Cols 24-25. The body starts at **Row 11**.\n        *   Projects Horizontal Beams to the Left.\n        *   Offsets: +1, +4, +5.\n        *   Target Rows: 11+1=**12**, 11+4=**15**, 11+5=**16**.\n        *   Colors: **9** (Row 12), **7** (Row 15), **6** (Row 16).\n\n    *   **Structure 3 (Bottom Left, Vertical):**\n        *   Located at Cols 9-10. The body starts at **Row 24**.\n        *   Projects Horizontal Beams to the Right.\n        *   Offsets: +1, +4, +5.\n        *   Target Rows: 24+1=**25**, 24+4=**28**, 24+5=**29**.\n        *   Colors: **9** (Row 25), **7** (Row 28), **6** (Row 29).\n\n4.  **Final Output Construction:**\n    *   Fill the grid with background '8'.\n    *   Draw the beams based on the calculations above. Vertical beams (Cols 20, 21, 24) overwrite Horizontal beams where they intersect.\n    *   Retain the original structures and isolated palette pixels.\n\n8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,8,8,8,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,2,6,7,2,2,9,1,1,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,6,7,4,4,9,1,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6,9,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,3,3,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,4,8,8,7\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,7,9,9,9,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,4,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,9,4,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6,9,1,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The transformation treats large structures as **projectors** and isolated pixels as a **color palette**.\n*   The direction of projection is controlled by the secondary color bar on the structure: **Blue** projects *forward* (towards the blue), while **Green** projects *backward* (away from the green).\n*   The beams created are stripes that span to the grid edge, composed of the specific colors found in the isolated 'palette' pixels.\n*   Vertical and horizontal beams may overlap; observe the intersection to determine a fixed layering rule (e.g., vertical stripes occlude horizontal ones).\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Solution Plan: ARC Task Analysis**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task, and it seems I need to figure out how to generate new grids based on provided examples. The grids are made of numbers representing colors, and the task seems to revolve around \"projectors\" and \"color palettes.\"  I need to decode how the \"large structures\" in the examples (the projectors) influence the placement of \"beams\" with colors from \"isolated pixels\" (the color palette).\n\nFirst, I identified the background color (8), and the general structure of the grids.  The task description hints that specific colors act as \"controls\" for projection directions.  A key insight is that the \"secondary color bar\" within a projector dictates how the \"beams\" are projected.  I have to determine what the control color does. \"Blue (1) projects forward, Green (3) projects backward.\" This feels like the direction of the beam.\n\nAnalyzing the examples revealed some geometric patterns. The vertical or horizontal \"structures\" project, and isolated \"color palette\" pixels provide the colors for the \"beams.\"  I broke down how individual colors within the examples correlated to the outputs. I had to clarify what kind of structures are projecting and identify the \"Control bar\" of each projector.\n\nIn Example 1, a vertical \"object\" at the top right has a side with both red and green.  There are isolated pixels like \"5\" and \"1\", and the output beams use these colors. The location of the \"5\" and \"1\" in the output grid helped me understand that a specific color in the projector is the *control*.\n\nI went back and analyzed the geometry.  I'm trying to find how pixels are placed in the output. The pixels in the examples are ordered, and the order matters.\n\nIn Example 2, there were a pair of vertical projectors. The \"object\" has a \"blue bar\" on one side, and isolated pixels are on the top and left of the structure. I saw the horizontal output beams in certain columns, and I determined that having blue on the left side, meant projection to the left. The color \"6\" (Pink) on the top-right causes problems with its position.\n\nThe projection direction is \"controlled by the secondary color bar,\" but how is this applied to place the beams? The \"palette\" pixels always seem to be drawn as beams, but how they are positioned is the key.\n\nI started looking for patterns across the examples.  The direction rule seems to be: If a vertical object has a color to the right side (say, green), it projects left. If a vertical object has a color to the left (say, blue), it projects right.  The example with horizontal projection is similar, just 90 degrees rotated.\n\nHowever, things got complicated when I needed to explain why the \"palette\" colors weren't always aligned with expected rows or columns. It's not a direct one-to-one mapping.  \"Green projects backward\" and \"Blue projects forward\" are hints. I tried a lot of things.  The hint \"layered rule\" led to more complex logic of collisions. I had to understand the direction rule to determine projection.\n\nI found the solution:  Projecting the beams is actually consistent. I used a two-step process: First, I work out the beam's slot (its row or column) by applying a rule (coordinate % height of the projector); Second, if there are any conflicts, or it lands on a bad slot, then there is a corrective shift (this depends on the direction - Blue is Forward/Left, Green is Backwards/Right).\n\nI figured out the \"Layering Logic\". Then I got a firm handle on the \"test input.\" I determined how to use the direction, which also helped with the new \"control color\". It helped when I found the \"control bars.\"\n\nMy final process:\n1.  Copy input (to draw the frame).\n2.  Find palette.\n3.  Draw beam's.\n4. If there are collisions - shift the location.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the solved examples and the hints provided, here is the step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n1.  **Identify Roles**: The grid contains **Projectors** (large multi-color structures) and a **Color Palette** (isolated pixels). The background is color `8`.\n    *   **Projectors**: emit beams of color corresponding to the palette pixels.\n    *   **Palette**: The set of distinct colors found in isolated single pixels. In the test input, the palette pixels are `3` (Green), `6` (Pink), and `7` (Orange).\n\n2.  **Determine Projection Rules**:\n    *   **Mapping**: The \"slots\" (rows or columns) of a projector emit beams based on the coordinates of the palette pixels.\n        *   **Formula**: `Slot_Index = Coordinate % Projector_Size`.\n        *   **Collision Handling**: If a slot is occupied or invalid, the target shifts to the nearest valid slot (preferring slots that match the palette color or empty body slots).\n        *   **Direction**:\n            *   **Blue (`1`)** control bar: Projects **Forward** (Towards the Blue side). Mapping is direct (`Coord % Size`).\n            *   **Green (`3`)** control bar: Projects **Backward** (Away from the Green side). Mapping is inverted/shifted.\n    *   **Layering**: Vertical beams occlude horizontal beams where they intersect. Beams do not overwrite the projectors themselves.\n\n3.  **Analyze Test Input Projectors**:\n    *   **Left Projector** (Vertical, Cols 4-5, Rows 2-6):\n        *   Control Bar at Col 5. Top is Blue (`1`), Bottom is Green (`3`).\n        *   **Blue (Top/Right) -> Projects Right**. **Green (Bottom/Left) -> Projects Left**.\n        *   Palette Y-coords: `3` (10), `7` (11), `6` (28). Height = 5.\n        *   Mapping:\n            *   `3` (10 % 5 = 0) -> Row 2 (Blue). Projects **Right**.\n            *   `7` (11 % 5 = 1) -> Row 3 (Red). Near Blue -> Projects **Right**.\n            *   `6` (28 % 5 = 3) -> Row 5 (Red). Near Green -> Projects **Left**.\n    *   **Right Projector** (Vertical, Cols 24-25, Rows 11-16):\n        *   Control Bar at Col 24 (Left). Contains Blue (`1`).\n        *   **Blue (Left) -> Projects Forward -> Left**.\n        *   Palette Y-coords: `3` (10), `7` (11), `6` (28). Height = 6.\n        *   Mapping:\n            *   `3` (10 % 6 = 4) -> Row 15 (Blue). Projects **Left**.\n            *   `7` (11 % 6 = 5) -> Row 16 (Blue). Projects **Left**.\n            *   `6` (28 % 6 = 4) -> Collision with `3`. Shift to Row 14 (Red). Projects **Left**.\n    *   **Horizontal Projector** (Horizontal, Rows 2-3, Cols 18-24):\n        *   Control Ends: Left is Green (`3`), Right is Blue (`1`).\n        *   **Green (Left) -> Backward -> Up**. **Blue (Right) -> Forward -> Down**.\n        *   Palette X-coords: `6` (21), `3` (25), `7` (28). Width = 7.\n        *   Mapping:\n            *   `6` (21 % 7 = 0) -> Col 18 (Green). Projects **Up**.\n            *   `3` (25 % 7 = 4) -> Col 22 (Red). Near Blue -> Projects **Down**.\n            *   `7` (28 % 7 = 0) -> Collision. Shift to Col 19 (Red). Near Green -> Projects **Up**.\n\n4.  **Construct Output**:\n    *   **Horizontal Beams**:\n        *   Row 2: Color `3`, Right (C6-28, skip Proj).\n        *   Row 3: Color `7`, Right (C6-28, skip Proj).\n        *   Row 5: Color `6`, Left (C0-3).\n        *   Row 14: Color `6`, Left (C0-23).\n        *   Row 15: Color `3`, Left (C0-23).\n        *   Row 16: Color `7`, Left (C0-23).\n    *   **Vertical Beams** (Occlude Horizontal):\n        *   Col 18: Color `6`, Up (R0-1).\n        *   Col 19: Color `7`, Up (R0-1).\n        *   Col 22: Color `3`, Down (R4-28).\n\n5.  **Final Grid**: Apply beams to the background, preserving original pixels.\n\n8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,8,8,8,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,3,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,3,3,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,2,4,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,2,4,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,2,4,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,2,4,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,6,8,2,4,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,1,4,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,7,8,1,1,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The transformation treats large structures as **projectors** and isolated pixels as a **color palette**.\n*   The direction of projection is controlled by the secondary color bar on the structure: **Blue** projects *forward* (towards the blue), while **Green** projects *backward* (away from the green).\n*   The beams created are stripes that span to the grid edge, composed of the specific colors found in the isolated 'palette' pixels.\n*   Vertical and horizontal beams may overlap; observe the intersection to determine a fixed

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The transformation treats large structures as **projectors** and isolated pixels as a **color palette**.\n*   The direction of projection is controlled by the secondary color bar on the structure: **Blue** projects *forward* (towards the blue), while **Green** projects *backward* (away from the green).\n*   The beams created are stripes that span to the grid edge, composed of the specific colors found in the isolated 'palette' pixels.\n*   Vertical and horizontal beams may overlap; observe the intersection to determine a fixed layering rule (e.g., vertical stripes occlude horizontal ones).\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify:\n1. **Structures** (projectors) - L-shaped or bar patterns with colors 1-4\n2. **Isolated pixels** (color palette) - single colored pixels not part of structures  \n3. **Projection direction** - Blue (1) projects toward blue, Green (3) projects away from green\n\n**Test input structures:**\n1.

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The transformation treats large structures as **projectors** and isolated pixels as a **color palette**.\n*   The direction of projection is controlled by the secondary color bar on the structure: **Blue** projects *forward* (towards the blue), while **Green** projects *backward* (away from the green).\n*   The beams created are stripes that span to the grid edge, composed of the specific colors found in the isolated 'palette' pixels.\n*   Vertical and horizontal beams may overlap; observe the intersection to determine a fixed layering rule (e.g., vertical stripes occlude horizontal ones).\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "I couldn\u2019t infer a consistent, reliable rule from the two training pairs that I could then apply with confidence to the test grid.\n\nI went through the following (summarized) reasoning:\n\n- I identified **background** as color 8 in all three grids.\n- I grouped the non\u20118 cells into connected components. In each example:\n  - There are relatively large, multi\u2011cell components built from a small set of colors (e.g. {2,3,4} in Example 1; {1,2,4} in Example 2; {1,2,3,4} in the test).\n  - There are exactly **three isolated single pixels** of other colors (e.g. {1,5,6} in Example 1; {3,6,9} in Example 2; {9,7,6} in the test).\n  - These isolated pixels behave like a **palette**; their colors get \u201cprojected\u201d into long stripes in the output.\n- The large components look like **2\u00d7k or k\u00d72 bars** with cap colors at the ends and one or two interior colors forming \u201cbars\u201d. These correspond to the \u201cprojectors\u201d mentioned in the hint.\n- In both training examples, the output keeps the projector structures intact, and overlays them with **long stripes of only the palette colors** (3 colors in each case) radiating out to the grid edge, either horizontally or vertically.\n- In Example 1, the projector components are built from {2,3,4}; palette is {1,5,6}. In Example 2, projectors are {1,2,4}; palette is {3,6,9}.  \n  In the test, projectors are {1,2,3,4}; palette is {9,7,6}.\n- The hint about \u201cblue projects forward, green backward\u201d strongly suggests that one of the projector colors encodes direction (forward = beams go towards that side; backward = away). In Example 1 this seems to be 3; in Example 2 it might be 1. But when I tried to reconcile that with **where** the stripes actually appear (which side of each projector, at which rows/columns), I ran into contradictions:\n  - For one vertical projector in Example 2, the apparent beams only appear on the side *without* its \u201cblue\u201d column, contradicting the simple \u201ctowards blue\u201d rule.\n  - Horizontal and vertical projectors overlap in complex ways so that trying to deduce a consistent mapping of palette colors to stripe positions (rows/columns) across both examples ran into inconsistencies.\n- I also tried several alternative models:\n  - beams emanating from palette pixels towards the nearest projector and then continuing.\n  - beams positioned at fixed offsets within a projector\u2019s span (e.g. at certain rows relative to its top).\n  - ordering the palette colors by numeric value or by spatial order and mapping them to stripe positions consistently.\n  \n  None of these led to a rule that explained **all** stripe placements in both training examples without contradictions.\n\nWhen I tried to transfer any of the partially\u2011working hypotheses to the test grid, different plausible interpretations led to **different** predicted output patterns, with no way (from the two examples) to choose among them. In other words, given only the information in the prompt, I can\u2019t determine a unique transformation that I\u2019m confident is correct.\n\nBecause of that, any concrete output grid I would produce would be a guess rather than a reasoned application of a clearly inferred rule. Returning a guessed pattern would be misleading.\n\nSo, to remain honest:\n\n- I **cannot reliably reconstruct the transformation** from the given examples.\n- Consequently, I cannot generate a test output grid that I can defend as the correct application of that transformation.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can instead:\n\n- Walk through very specific local hypotheses (e.g. \u201cassume these top\u2011left projectors in the test behave exactly like these specific ones in Example 1\u201d) and show what the resulting beams would look like under that assumption; or\n- Help you code up a small search over possible \u201cbeam rules\u201d and test which ones fit both training input/output pairs exactly, then apply the discovered rule to the test.",

controlled by the secondary color bar on the structure: **Blue** projects *forward* (towards the blue), while **Green** projects *backward* (away from the green).\n*   The beams created are stripes that span to the grid edge, composed of the specific colors found in the isolated 'palette' pixels.\n*   Vertical and horizontal beams may overlap; observe the intersection to determine a fixed layering rule (e.g., vertical stripes occlude horizontal ones).\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Given the two worked examples, I looked for the same basic ingredients in the test: a small set of isolated palette colours, and a few larger multicoloured rectangles to act as projectors.\n\nHere the only isolated single\u2013cell colours are 9 at (row\u202f2,col\u202f1), 7 at (row\u202f12,col\u202f29) and 6 at (row\u202f29,col\u202f22), giving a three\u2013colour palette. The larger structures all have a band of green at one end and blue at the other, with a red/yellow body in between. Interpreting the banding as indicating direction from green towards blue, I treated the two tall blocks at the left as vertical projectors pointing up, the block at columns\u202f25\u201326 as a vertical projector pointing down, and the 2\u00d77 block at the top as a horizontal projector pointing right. Following the ordering patterns seen in the examples, blue\u2011type vertical beams take the palette in ascending order at rows top+1,\u202ftop+3,\u202ftop+5; green\u2011type vertical beams take the palette in descending order at rows top+1,\u202ftop+4,\u202ftop+5. Beams fill the background in the projection region, leaving other coloured structure alone.\n\nApplying these rules to the test grid gives the following output:\n\n8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,8,8,8,4,1,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,4,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,4,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,1,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,1,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The transformation treats large structures as **projectors** and isolated pixels as a **color palette**.\n*   The direction of projection is controlled by the secondary color bar on the structure: **Blue** projects *forward* (towards the blue), while **Green** projects *backward* (away from the green).\n*   The beams created are stripes that span to the grid edge, composed of the specific colors found in the isolated 'palette' pixels.\n*   Vertical and horizontal beams may overlap; observe the intersection to determine a fixed layering rule (e.g., vertical stripes occlude horizontal ones).\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The transformation treats large structures as **projectors** and isolated pixels as a **color palette**.\n*   The direction of projection is controlled by the secondary color bar on the structure: **Blue** projects *forward* (towards the blue), while **Green** projects *backward* (away from the green).\n*   The beams created are stripes that span to the grid edge, composed of the specific colors found in the isolated 'palette' pixels.\n*   Vertical and horizontal beams may overlap; observe the intersection to determine a fixed layering rule (e.g., vertical stripes occlude horizontal ones).\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Based on the examples, I looked for the \u201cprojector\u2019\u2019 structures \u2013 the larger, two\u2011bar shapes \u2013 and the isolated single pixels forming the palette. The three palette colours in the test are 9 at (2,1), 7 at (12,29) and 6 at (28,22).\n\nUsing the same style as in the given outputs, I projected three stripes from each projector. For the vertical projectors I emitted horizontal stripes on three rows, colouring them with the palette in input order, and for the horizontal projector I emitted three vertical stripes on three columns, coloured with the palette in input order. Horizontal stripes run away from the projector bar, vertical stripes run from the right edge of the projector to the grid edge. Where a vertical stripe met a horizontal stripe I let the vertical stripe take priority.\n\nThe resulting grid is:\n\n8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,7,8,9,8,8,8,8\n9,8,8,8,4,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,7,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,4,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,4,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,1,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's my analysis of these ARC-AGI examples, broken down into what I'm thinking:**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at these ARC-AGI grids, and my initial impression is that there are two main types of objects: these multi-colored, rectangular blocks, and single, scattered pixels. The blue background is constant, which makes me think it's not relevant to the core logic. \n\n**Deconstructing the Grids**\n\nThe rectangular blocks are key - they seem to be the \"active\" elements.  They're composed of a main \"red\" bar with usually some \"accessory\" colors attached, like green or blue.  The single pixels look more like \"seeds\" of colors, they are on the edges.  My first guess is that the blocks are \"generators\" or \"emitters,\" and the pixels somehow \"define\" their output.\n\n**Observing the Transformations**\n\nWhen I look at the input-output pairs, I see that these rectangular structures are somehow \"casting\" stripes of color. The colors always match the single pixels!  For instance, if I see grey, blue and magenta pixels, I see stripes with those colors.  I then started thinking about where they are, and noticed they seem to always come from the edges of the rectangular structure.  The colors are \"pulled\" from these single pixels, but how are they arranged?  It is not by location; the pixels are scattered, but the stripe ordering is fixed for the grid.\n\n**Uncovering the Control Mechanism**\n\nThe direction of the stripes depends on the color of the \"accessory\" part of the generator. If it's *green*, the stripes go in the *opposite* direction of that green part. If it's *blue*, the stripes go in the *direction* of the blue part. It looks like the Green is the back, the Blue is the front. This is the crucial part. So, there's a kind of built-in control for how these blocks emit. This makes me think of these as \"laser\" or \"force field\" generators.\n\n**Extracting the Ordering Logic**\n\nWhat I'm trying to figure out is the exact rule for stripe coloring. Are the stripe colors ordered by spatial sorting? By reading order? The single pixels set the palette - grey, blue, magenta - but how are they arranged on the stripe?\n\nI went through several hypotheses about how the pixels' positions are used, and it seems the stripe color order depends on a \"global\" order. The order seems reversed depending on the orientation (vertical vs horizontal) of the stripe. \n\n**My Hypotheses and Refinement**\n\nFrom there, I'm thinking the \"Global Palette\" - the colors from the single pixels, are collected and ordered.  This is used to fill the stripes. Based on which pixel is \"first\", determines the first color. The stripes from a vertical generator have a particular ordering, but if it is horizontal, it is reversed. And then that pattern is repeated.\n\nSo, in general, it goes like this: identify \"generators\" and \"palette\" (pixels). Use the palette colors in stripe generation, where which side the green/blue bar is on determines which way the stripes go. The number of colors always seems the same as the number of single pixels.\n\nI also noticed that the beams can overlap. There's some z-ordering which can affect the final output. Vertical stripes are shown on top, so I need to check for that consistency too. I wonder if the width of the beam is determined by the size of the central, red bar. That will be one of my checks.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided training example, here are the insights:\n\n**1. Describe the observable structures**\n*   **Background:** Uniform light blue field.\n*   **Objects:**\n    *   **Generators:** Complex rectangular structures composed of a central red bar, yellow end-caps, and a parallel accessory bar which is either green or blue.\n    *   **Palette Pixels:** Isolated single pixels of various colors (grey, magenta, maroon, etc.) scattered near the grid boundaries.\n*   **Transformation:** The Generators emit long, multi-colored striped beams across the grid. The colors of these beams correspond exactly to the set of colors found in the scattered single pixels.\n\n**2. Identify transformation categories**\n*   **Object movement:** Absent.\n*   **Object recoloring:** Absent (original structures persist).\n*   **Bordering / outlining:** Absent.\n*   **Filling holes or cavities:** Absent.\n*   **Copying / pasting / repositioning:** Present (Palette colors are copied into stripes).\n*   **Growth / Projection:** **Present.** This is the primary mechanic. Structures \"project\" beams.\n*   **Logic-based direction:** **Present.** The direction depends on the internal composition of the structure.\n\n**3. Extract the key non-obvious insights**\n*   **The \"Control\" Component:** The direction of the projected beam depends on the color of the accessory bar adjacent to the red core.\n    *   **Blue Accessory:** The beam projects **towards** the blue bar (it acts as a lens or emitter).\n    *   **Green Accessory:** The beam projects **away** from the green bar (it acts as a backstop or pusher).\n*   **Global Color Palette:** The colors of the stripes are not inherent to the generator itself but are pulled from the scattered single pixels present in the input. Every generator in a grid uses the same set of colors.\n*   **Stripe Ordering:** The sequence of colors in the stripes is consistent (or strictly reversed) between horizontal and vertical projections, derived from the reading order or spatial sorting of the palette pixels.\n*   **Layering:** When beams intersect, there is a consistent Z-ordering (e.g., vertical beams overlay horizontal beams).\n\n**4. Hypothesize a general rule**\nThe task is a \"laser projection\" simulation.\n1.  Identify the set of unique colors from all isolated single pixels (the \"Palette\").\n2.  For each structured block (\"Generator\"), determine its projection direction based on its side-bar: if **Blue**, project in the direction of the blue bar; if **Green**, project in the opposite direction.\n3.  Fill the projection area (a rect extending from the Generator to the grid edge) with parallel stripes using the colors from the Palette. The width of the stripe cluster matches the length of the Generator's core red bar.\n\n**5. List checks you would perform when solving**\n*   **Directionality Check:** Verify if *every* Green-bar generator projects away and *every* Blue-bar generator projects towards the bar.\n*   **Palette Consistency:** Ensure the stripe colors exactly match the set of single-pixel colors in the input.\n*   **Color Sequencing:** Determine the sort order of the palette (e.g., top-to-bottom, left-to-right) and how it maps to the stripes (e.g., does the top-most pixel color become the left-most stripe?).\n*   **Occlusion Logic:** Check the intersection of vertical and horizontal beams in the output to confirm which orientation takes precedence (Vertical on top vs. Horizontal on top).\n\n**6. Summarize final insights**\n\nHINT_START\n*   The transformation treats large structures as **projectors** and isolated pixels as a **color palette**.\n*   The direction of projection is controlled by the secondary color bar on the structure: **Blue** projects *forward* (towards the blue), while **Green** projects *backward* (away from the green).\n*   The beams created are stripes that span to the grid edge, composed of the specific colors found in the isolated 'palette' pixels.\n*   Vertical and horizontal beams may overlap; observe the intersection to determine a fixed layering rule (e.g., vertical stripes occlude horizontal ones).\nHINT_END",

line segments** - single-color horizontal or vertical stripes of variable length using colors 3, 6, 9, 5, or 1; (3) **Single-pixel markers** - isolated cells of colors 3, 6, 7, 9, 5, or 1; (4) **Background** of uniform color 8. Key attributes include position, orientation (horizontal/vertical), length, and color composition.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n**Transformation Rules:**\n\n1. **Identify** bracket structures (composite shapes using colors 1, 2, 3, 4) and single-pixel markers (colors 5, 1, 6 or 3, 6, 9)\n\n2. **For each bracket**, draw 3 lines extending in its opening direction:\n   - Lines extend from the bracket edge to the grid boundary\n   - One line at a cap position (inner cap near the opening)\n   - Two lines at body positions\n\n3. **Position mapping**:\n   - If a marker's perpendicular coordinate falls within the bracket's range, that position gets the marker's color\n   - Otherwise, use defaults: inner cap for one color, last two body rows (vertical) or first two body columns (horizontal) for other colors\n\n4. **Color assignment**: The 3 marker colors fill the 3 line positions per bracket, with the \"outlier\" marker (different position context) typically assigned to the cap line\n\n5. **All brackets** of the same orientation receive the same relative pattern of positions and colors\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Thoughts and Problem Decomposition:**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task. My job is to transform grids of numbers (0-9). The task gives me two examples and a test case. I need to extend lines from \u201cbracket structures\u201d based on single-pixel markers. This means I'm looking at input grids of integers (0-9) and the output is a modified version. Let's dig in. I see \"composite bracket/ruler structures,\" \"extended line segments,\" and \"single-pixel markers\" as critical elements. I need to figure out how these structures dictate line placement and color.\n\n**Breaking Down the Example and Establishing Rules:**\n\nI start by looking at example 1. I'm noting the background color (8), and the \"bracket\" structure. Each \"bracket\" seems to be made of parallel lines (colors 1,2,3,4). Color 1 seems like the edge, 4 like the cap/corner and 2 the body. I identify structure 1 as vertical. Rows 0-6. Color 4,4 at 0th row, color 2,4 at 1st row and the others show a \"ruler\" body. The single pixel markers are (25, 3), (25, 13), and (19, 28) with colors 5, 1, 6 respectively.\n\nI then examine the \"lines\" in the output. Structure 1 is vertical and the lines are horizontal. This makes sense. Lines 1, 4, 5. They're at rows 1, 4, 5. These lines are at different relative positions (from top and bottom). I note that the colors of these lines are the same as the \"single-pixel markers\". So the markers are tied to the line color. Next, I begin to decode the \"Brackets/Rulers.\" I decide to think of these as 2 columns wide. I determine that the line extends from the column with mostly 2s (back) to the column with mostly 3s and 4s.\n\nNow, I look at the example's horizontal structure and notice that it behaves similarly, with the exception that the lines expand vertically. I decide that there must be a common rule for \"drawing\" lines for both vertical and horizontal layouts. I also note that the horizontal lines are drawn on columns that correspond to the marker's coordinate.\nOkay, I think I'm starting to get it.\n\n**Developing a Solid Mapping Strategy:**\n\nI decide I need a systematic approach: markers, bracket analysis and a mapping step. From Ex 1, Marker 6 is at (19, 28) which does not correspond to the structure. This suggests \"outliers\" will play a special role. Now, I look at the structure pattern and consider \"Inner cap\". The marker's coordinates dictate the line positions (horizontal in Ex1). So I must identify the line positions by marker coordinate. Markers are 5, 1, 6. The output colors are 6, 5, 1 for example 1. I look at each line to try to see why it exists. It looks like one line extends from the cap (\"inner\" or 4 value), and the other two from body.\n\nI look closer at the bodies.  One line is at the edge. One is at a middle body. One line is an edge near an \"inner\" value 4.\nThis gives me an idea that the lines have a pattern!\n\nThe horizontal structure is at rows 7-8 and columns 1-7. The pattern is row 7: 4,3,3,3,3,4,4. Row 8: 2,2,2,2,2,2,4. The lines extend down in Cols 2, 3, 6. The line's column is relative to the start (col 1), and end (col 7). The lines are in col 2, col 3, and col 6 relative to the beginning and the end of the bracket. One line is at 2, one at 3 and one at 6.\n\nLet's test this in example 1. Line is at 6. Corresponds to marker 6 which lies on (19, 28). This marker's y position is within the bracket bounds. Here the mapping appears to be working.\n\nI try a similar analysis for Structure 1 (Vert) and find I can express lines positions relative to the start and end and relative to each marker color. The key seems to be the marker's relationship to the bracket. Where is it? In or outside? The line color matches marker color.\n\nI formulate the concept that the lines are set by certain markers: an \"inner\" marker and\n\nTo solve this challenge, I identified the transformation rules based on the provided examples and applied them to the test input.\n\n### Method Explanation\n\n1.  **Identify Objects:**\n    *   **Markers:** I found three single-pixel markers in the test input that are not part of any structure:\n        *   `9` at (Row 1, Column 0)\n        *   `7` at (Row 11, Column 28)\n        *   `6` at (Row 28, Column 21)\n    *   **Structures:** I identified four composite bracket structures:\n        1.  **Top Left (Vertical):** Columns 4-5, Rows 0-6. Opens Left.\n        2.  **Bottom Middle (Vertical):** Columns 9-10, Rows 22-28. Opens Right.\n        3.  **Right Middle (Vertical):** Columns 24-25, Rows 10-16. Opens Right.\n        4.  **Top Right (Horizontal):** Rows 2-3, Columns 18-24. Opens Down.\n\n2.  **Determine Line Positions:**\n    *   Based on the examples, brackets of the same orientation share a relative pattern of line positions.\n    *   The markers provided clues for the line positions:\n        *   Marker `9` is at Row 1 (Top + 1) for Structure 1.\n        *   Marker `7` is at Row 11 (Top + 1) for Structure 3.\n        *   Marker `6` is at Row 28 (Bottom) for Structure 2 and Column 21 (Start + 3) for Structure 4.\n    *   Combining these observations, the pattern for line positions relative to the bracket start is: **+1**, **+3**, and **+6 (End)**.\n\n3.  **Assign Colors:**\n    *   Colors are assigned to lines based on markers falling within the line's path. If no marker is present, a default sequence is used, derived from the available markers `{9, 7, 6}`.\n    *   **Structure 1 (Left):** Line +1 matches Marker `9`. Default order for others leads to `7`, `6`. Colors: **9, 7, 6**.\n    *   **Structure 2 (Right):** Line +6 matches Marker `6`. Defaults for +1 and +3 are `9`, `7`. Colors: **9, 7, 6**.\n    *   **Structure 3 (Right):** Line +1 matches Marker `7`. Matches at intersections with Structure 4 imply `9` for +3, and `6` remains for +6. Colors: **7, 9, 6**.\n    *   **Structure 4 (Down):** Line +3 matches Marker `6`. Defaults `9` and `7` fill the remaining spots. Colors: **9, 6, 7**.\n\n4.  **Draw Lines:**\n    *   Lines were drawn extending from the brackets to the grid boundaries in the opening direction.\n    *   **Str 1:** Rows 1, 3, 6 extending Left (Cols 0-3).\n    *   **Str 2:** Rows 23, 25, 28 extending Right (Cols 11-28).\n    *   **Str 3:** Rows 11, 13, 16 extending Right (Cols 26-28).\n    *   **Str 4:** Cols 19, 21, 24 extending Down (Rows 4-28).\n    *   At intersections, vertical lines (from Str 4) generally took precedence, though colors often matched. Existing structures were not overwritten.\n\n### Output Grid\n\n8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,8,3,3,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,8,2,4,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,8,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,8,2,4,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,8,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,8,1,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,8,1,1,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,9,9,7,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,6,8,8,7,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain four main object types: (1) **Composite bracket/ruler structures** made of parallel lines using colors 1, 2, 3, and 4, with color 1 as the edge, color 4 as caps/corners, and color 2 as the body, oriented either horizontally or vertically; (2) **Extended line segments** - single-color horizontal or vertical stripes of variable length using colors 3, 6, 9, 5, or 1; (3) **Single-pixel markers** - isolated cells of colors 3, 6, 7, 9, 5, or 1; (4) **Background** of uniform color 8. Key attributes include position, orientation (horizontal/vertical), length, and color composition.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n**Transformation Rules:**\n\n1. **Identify** bracket structures (composite shapes using colors 1, 2, 3, 4) and single-pixel markers (colors 5, 1, 6 or 3, 6, 9)\n\n2. **For each bracket**, draw 3 lines extending in its opening direction:\n   - Lines extend from the bracket edge to the grid boundary\n   - One line at a cap position (inner cap near the opening)\n   - Two lines at body positions\n\n3. **Position mapping**:\n   - If a marker's perpendicular coordinate falls within the bracket's range, that position gets the marker's color\n   - Otherwise, use defaults: inner cap for one color, last two body rows (vertical) or first two body columns (horizontal) for other colors\n\n4. **Color assignment**: The 3 marker colors fill the 3 line positions per bracket, with the \"outlier\" marker (different position context) typically assigned to the cap line\n\n5. **All brackets** of the same orientation receive the same relative pattern of positions and colors\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain four main object types: (1) **Composite bracket/ruler structures** made of parallel lines using colors 1, 2, 3, and 4, with color 1 as the edge, color 4 as caps/corners, and color 2 as the body, oriented either horizontally or vertically; (2) **Extended line segments** - single-color horizontal or vertical stripes of variable length using colors 3, 6, 9, 5, or 1; (3) **Single-pixel markers** - isolated cells of colors 3, 6, 7, 9, 5, or 1; (4) **Background** of uniform color 8. Key attributes include position, orientation (horizontal/vertical), length, and color composition.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n**Transformation Rules:**\n\n1. **Identify** bracket structures (composite shapes using colors 1, 2, 3, 4) and single-pixel markers (colors 5, 1, 6 or 3, 6, 9)\n\n2. **For each bracket**, draw 3 lines extending in its opening direction:\n   - Lines extend from the bracket edge to the grid boundary\n   - One line at a cap position (inner cap near the opening)\n   - Two lines at body positions\n\n3. **Position mapping**:\n   - If a marker's perpendicular coordinate falls within the bracket's range, that position gets the marker's color\n   - Otherwise, use defaults: inner cap for one color, last two body rows (vertical) or first two body columns (horizontal) for other colors\n\n4. **Color assignment**: The 3 marker colors fill the 3 line positions per bracket, with the \"outlier\" marker (different position context) typically assigned to the cap line\n\n5. **All brackets** of the same orientation receive the same relative pattern of positions and colors\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "The grids consist of \u201cbracket\u201d objects built from colors\u202f1,\u202f2,\u202f3 and\u202f4, set against an 8\u2011colored background, plus three isolated \u201cmarker\u201d pixels of other colors. To construct the output you:\n\n- Identify each bracket and its opening direction. For vertical brackets the opening is on the side of the body\u2011colored column; for horizontals, the body row indicates the opening.\n- For each bracket, choose three target positions: the first body row/column (cap position) and the last two body rows or the first two body columns, depending on orientation.\n- For each bracket, work with the ordered marker list (top\u2011to\u2011bottom, left\u2011to\u2011right in the input). If a marker\u2019s perpendicular coordinate matches a target position, that position takes the marker\u2019s color. Fill the remaining target positions with the remaining marker colors in order.\n- From each target position, draw a line in the opening direction out to the grid boundary, colouring background cells along the way and leaving existing non\u2011background cells unchanged.\n\nApplying this to the test input with markers 9\u202f(row\u202f2), 7\u202f(row\u202f12) and 6\u202f(row\u202f29) gives the following output:\n\n8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n9,8,8,8,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,4,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,4,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain four main object types: (1) **Composite bracket/ruler structures** made of parallel lines using colors 1, 2, 3, and 4, with color 1 as the edge, color 4 as caps/corners, and color 2 as the body, oriented either horizontally or vertically; (2) **Extended line segments** - single-color horizontal or vertical stripes of variable length using colors 3, 6, 9, 5, or 1; (3) **Single-pixel markers** - isolated cells of colors 3, 6, 7, 9, 5, or 1; (4) **Background** of uniform color 8. Key attributes include position, orientation (horizontal/vertical), length, and color composition.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n**Transformation Rules:**\n\n1. **Identify** bracket structures (composite shapes using colors 1, 2, 3, 4) and single-pixel markers (colors 5, 1, 6 or 3, 6, 9)\n\n2. **For each bracket**, draw 3 lines extending in its opening direction:\n   - Lines extend from the bracket edge to the grid boundary\n   - One line at a cap position (inner cap near the opening)\n   - Two lines at body positions\n\n3. **Position mapping**:\n   - If a marker's perpendicular coordinate falls within the bracket's range, that position gets the marker's color\n   - Otherwise, use defaults: inner cap for one color, last two body rows (vertical) or first two body columns (horizontal) for other colors\n\n4. **Color assignment**: The 3 marker colors fill the 3 line positions per bracket, with the \"outlier\" marker (different position context) typically assigned to the cap line\n\n5. **All brackets** of the same orientation receive the same relative pattern of positions and colors\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Below is my reconstructed reasoning and the resulting output grid. I\u2019ll state upfront: the mapping from examples to a fully general rule is quite under\u2011specified, so I explicitly chose a concrete, consistent algorithm based on the provided description and applied it step\u2011by\u2011step to the test grid. The result is internally consistent with that algorithm, but it may differ from the original ARC task\u2019s hidden solution.\n\n---\n\n## Reasoning Outline\n\n### 1. Identify markers and brackets in the test input\n\n**Background color:** 8  \n**Marker colors (singletons):** allowed: {1,3,5,6,7,9}; in this test we find:\n\n- 9 at (row 2, col 1)\n- 7 at (row 12, col 29)\n- 6 at (row 29, col 22)\n\nSo the marker set is {9,7,6}.\n\nI treat the \u201coutlier\u201d marker as the one spatially separated from the other two.  \nHere, 9 is on the far left; 7 and 6 are both on the right, so I take:\n\n- outlier color = 9\n- remaining two = 7 and 6\n\n**Bracket structures (using colors 1,2,3,4):**\n\nFrom the grid:\n\n1. **Vertical bracket A** at columns 5\u20136, rows 1\u20137:\n   - r1: [1,1]\n   - r2: [4,1]\n   - r3\u20136: [4,2]\n   - r7: [3,3]\n   Body rows (having 2 or 3): rows 3\u20137 \u2192 Bstart=3, Bend=7.  \n   I classify it as **vertical, opening to the right** (2\u2019s are in the right column).\n\n2. **Horizontal bracket B** at rows 3\u20134, columns 19\u201325:\n   - Row 3: [3,2,2,2,2,1,1]\n   - Row 4: [3,4,4,4,4,4,1]\n   Body columns (having 2 or 3): cols 19\u201323 \u2192 Cstart=19, Cend=23.  \n   By analogy with training patterns, I treat it as **horizontal, opening downward**.\n\n3. **Vertical bracket C** at columns 10\u201311, rows 23\u201329:\n   - r23: [1,1]\n   - r24: [4,1]\n   - r25\u201328: [4,2]\n   - r29: [3,3]\n   Body rows: 25\u201329 \u2192 Bstart=25, Bend=29.  \n   Classified as **vertical, opening to the right** (2\u2019s on the right).\n\n4. **Vertical bracket D** at columns 25\u201326, rows 11\u201317:\n   - r11: [3,3]\n   - r12\u201315: [2,4]\n   - r16: [1,4]\n   - r17: [1,1]\n   Body rows (2 or 3): 11\u201315 \u2192 Bstart=11, Bend=15.  \n   Here, 2\u2019s are in the **left** column; I classify it as **vertical, opening to the left**.\n\nSo we have 3 vertical brackets (A, C, D) and 1 horizontal bracket (B).\n\n---\n\n### 2. My chosen line\u2011drawing rule (based on the description)\n\nFor each bracket we will draw **three stripes** in its opening direction:\n\n- For vertical brackets: **horizontal stripes**.\n- For horizontal brackets: **vertical stripes**.\n\nPer bracket, there are 3 line positions:\n\n- 1 \u201ccap\u201d position: **capRow** or **capCol** near the inner cap.\n- 2 \u201cbody\u201d positions near the end of the body region.\n\n#### 2.1. Vertical brackets\n\nGiven body rows Bstart\u2026Bend:\n\n- capRow  = Bstart \u2212 1\n- bodyRowOuter = Bend \u2212 1\n- bodyRowInner = Bend\n\nDefault stripe rows = {capRow, bodyRowOuter, bodyRowInner}.\n\nColor assignment:\n\n- the **outlier marker color (9)** goes to the **cap row**;\n- the other two colors {7,6} go to the body rows:\n  - outer body row \u2192 7\n  - inner body row \u2192 6.\n\nIf a marker\u2019s **row** lies inside the body range [Bstart, Bend], then for that color we use the marker\u2019s row instead of the default body row; but in all cases we keep exactly three stripe rows (one per color).\n\nStripes extend horizontally from the bracket edge to the nearest grid boundary in the opening direction, and they only overwrite background 8\u2019s (not the bracket itself or existing non\u20118 colors).\n\n#### 2.2. Horizontal bracket\n\nFor body columns Cstart\u2026Cend:\n\n- bodyCol1 = Cstart + 1\n- bodyCol2 = Cstart + 2\n- capCol   = some cap\u2011side column near the opening; here I pick col 24, the first column to the right where the lower row has a 4 and the upper row not a body color.\n\nDefault stripe columns = {bodyCol1, marker\u2011column if in\u2011range, capCol}, but concretely:\n\n- bodyCol1 \u2192 color 7\n- a \u201cmarker column\u201d (if any marker\u2019s column lies in [Cstart, Cend]) is assigned that marker\u2019s color and replaces one body position (here, 6 at col 22 replaces a body default).\n- capCol \u2192 outlier color 9.\n\nStripes extend vertically from just beyond the bracket in its opening direction (here, downward from row 4+1) to the nearest grid boundary, again only overwriting background 8\u2019s.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Applying the rule to each bracket\n\nGrid is 29\u00d729.\n\n#### 3.1. Bracket A (vertical, opening right), cols 5\u20136, rows 1\u20137\n\nBody rows: 3\u20137 \u2192 Bstart=3, Bend=7\n\nDefault rows:\n\n- capRow  = 2  (Bstart\u22121)\n- bodyOut = 6  (Bend\u22121)\n- bodyIn  = 7  (Bend)\n\nMarker rows: 2 (color 9), 12 (7), 29 (6).  \nOnly 9\u2019s row (2) lies within the full bracket range [1..7], but not in the body 3..7; I treat it as naturally aligned with capRow, so:\n\nStripe rows and colors for A:\n\n- row 2 \u2192 color 9 (cap)\n- row 6 \u2192 color 7 (outer body)\n- row 7 \u2192 color 6 (inner body)\n\nOpening is to the right, so for each of these rows we color columns 7\u201329 (right of the bracket) with the stripe\u2019s color, overwriting only 8\u2019s.\n\n#### 3.2. Bracket B (horizontal, opening downward), rows 3\u20134, cols 19\u201325\n\nBody columns: 19\u201323 \u2192 Cstart=19, Cend=23\n\nDefault body columns:\n\n- bodyCol1 = 20\n- bodyCol2 = 21\n\nCap column: I choose col 24 as the inner cap near the opening (down).\n\nMarker columns: 1 (9), 29 (7), 22 (6).  \nOnly column 22 (color 6) lies within the bracket span [19..25]. So:\n\nI assign:\n\n- col 22 \u2192 color 6 (marker\u2011governed body stripe)\n- col 20 \u2192 color 7 (remaining body stripe)\n- col 24 \u2192 color 9 (cap stripe)\n\nOpening is downward: for these columns, color rows 5\u201329 (below the bracket) with the stripe\u2019s color, overwriting only 8\u2019s.\n\n#### 3.3. Bracket D (vertical, opening left), cols 25\u201326, rows 11\u201317\n\nBody rows: 11\u201315 \u2192 Bstart=11, Bend=15\n\nDefault rows:\n\n- capRow  = 10 (Bstart\u22121)\n- bodyOut = 14 (Bend\u22121)\n- bodyIn  = 15 (Bend)\n\nMarkers rows: 2 (9), 12 (7), 29 (6).  \nOnly 7\u2019s row (12) lies inside body range [11..15]. So:\n\n- row 10 \u2192 color 9 (cap, default)\n- row 12 \u2192 color 7 (marker\u2011row body)\n- row 15 \u2192 color 6 (remaining body row)\n\nOpening is to the left, so for each of these rows we color columns 1\u201324 (left of the bracket), overwriting only 8\u2019s.\n\n#### 3.4. Bracket C (vertical, opening right), cols 10\u201311, rows 23\u201329\n\nBody rows: 25\u201329 \u2192 Bstart=25, Bend=29\n\nDefault rows:\n\n- capRow  = 24\n- bodyOut = 28\n- bodyIn  = 29\n\nMarker rows: 2 (9), 12 (7), 29 (6).  \nOnly 6\u2019s row (29) lies in the body range; we keep that as marker\u2011row for color 6.\n\nSo:\n\n- row 24 \u2192 color 9 (cap)\n- row 28 \u2192 color 7 (bodyOut)\n- row 29 \u2192 color 6 (bodyIn, from marker)\n\nOpening is right, so for these rows we color columns 12\u201329 (to the right of the bracket), overwriting only 8\u2019s.\n\n---\n\n### 4.

Objects Description\nThe grids contain four main object types: (1) **Composite bracket/ruler structures** made of parallel lines using colors 1, 2, 3, and 4, with color 1 as the edge, color 4 as caps/corners, and color 2 as the body, oriented either horizontally or vertically; (2) **Extended line segments** - single-color horizontal or vertical stripes of variable length using colors 3, 6, 9, 5, or 1; (3) **Single-pixel markers** - isolated cells of colors 3, 6, 7, 9, 5, or 1; (4) **Background** of uniform color 8. Key attributes include position, orientation (horizontal/vertical), length, and color composition.",
                "response": "Looking at the examples, I can identify the following transformations:\n\n## Object Analysis\n\n**Input contains:**\n1. **Bracket/ruler structures** - Composite shapes made of colors 1, 2, 3, 4 with vertical or horizontal orientation\n2. **Single-pixel markers** - 3 isolated colored pixels (colors like 5, 1, 6 in Example 1; 3, 6, 9 in Example 2)\n3. **Background** - Color 8\n\n## Identified Transformations\n\n### 1. Line Extension from Brackets\n- Each bracket structure generates **colored lines** extending outward in its \"opening\" direction\n- Vertical brackets generate horizontal lines extending left or right\n- Horizontal brackets generate vertical lines extending up or down\n- Lines extend from the bracket edge to the grid boundary\n\n### 2. Line Position Determination\nEach bracket receives **3 lines** at specific positions:\n- **1 line at a cap position** (typically the inner cap, near the \"opening\" end)\n- **2 lines at body positions**\n\nThe positions are determined by:\n- **Direct mapping**: If a marker's coordinate falls within the bracket's body range, that exact position gets the marker's color\n- **Default pattern**: If no marker falls in range, default positions are used (last two body positions for vertical brackets; first two for horizontal)\n\n### 3. Color Assignment\n- The 3 marker colors are distributed across the 3 line positions\n- The marker that maps to a cap position (or is positioned \"behind\" the bracket) gets assigned to the cap line\n- The other two markers get assigned to body lines based on their positions or defaults\n\n### 4. Bracket Orientation Detection\n- The \"opening direction\" is determined by which side has the simpler pattern (spine with 2s or 1s)\n- Lines extend toward the spine side, away from the cap/corner pattern\n\n<transformation_summary>\n**Transformation Rules:**\n\n1. **Identify** bracket structures (composite shapes using colors 1, 2, 3, 4) and single-pixel markers (colors 5, 1, 6 or 3, 6, 9)\n\n2. **For each bracket**, draw 3 lines extending in its opening direction:\n   - Lines extend from the bracket edge to the grid boundary\n   - One line at a cap position (inner cap near the opening)\n   - Two lines at body positions\n\n3. **Position mapping**:\n   - If a marker's perpendicular coordinate falls within the bracket's range, that position gets the marker's color\n   - Otherwise, use defaults: inner cap for one color, last two body rows (vertical) or first two body columns (horizontal) for other colors\n\n4. **Color assignment**: The 3 marker colors fill the 3 line positions per bracket, with the \"outlier\" marker (different position context) typically assigned to the cap line\n\n5. **All brackets** of the same orientation receive the same relative pattern of positions and colors\n</transformation_summary>",

line segments** - single-color horizontal or vertical stripes of variable length using colors 3, 6, 9, 5, or 1; (3) **Single-pixel markers** - isolated cells of colors 3, 6, 7, 9, 5, or 1; (4) **Background** of uniform color 8. Key attributes include position, orientation (horizontal/vertical), length, and color composition.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n**Transformation Rules:**\n\n1. **Identify** bracket structures (composite shapes using colors 1, 2, 3, 4) and single-pixel markers (colors 5, 1, 6 or 3, 6, 9)\n\n2. **For each bracket**, draw 3 lines extending in its opening direction:\n   - Lines extend from the bracket edge to the grid boundary\n   - One line at a cap position (inner cap near the opening)\n   - Two lines at body positions\n\n3. **Position mapping**:\n   - If a marker's perpendicular coordinate falls within the bracket's range, that position gets the marker's color\n   - Otherwise, use defaults: inner cap for one color, last two body rows (vertical) or first two body columns (horizontal) for other colors\n\n4. **Color assignment**: The 3 marker colors fill the 3 line positions per bracket, with the \"outlier\" marker (different position context) typically assigned to the cap line\n\n5. **All brackets** of the same orientation receive the same relative pattern of positions and colors\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nObject 1: Composite Structures (Colors 1, 2, 4). Attributes: L-shaped or rectangular with a distinct 'head', variable length, horizontal or vertical orientation.\nObject 2: Linear Strips (Colors 1, 3, 5, 6, 9). Attributes: Uniform color, horizontal or vertical lines, variable length.\nBackground: Color 8.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1.  Identify all isolated \"marker\" pixels and collect their colors.\n2.  Sort these colors into Ascending (Low-to-High) and Descending (High-to-Low) lists.\n3.  Locate all Composite Structures (vertical and horizontal).\n4.  Generate perpendicular lines from these structures based on specific \"port\" locations:\n    *   **Vertical Structures**: Lines extend from rows 1, 4, and 5 (relative to the structure's start). Colors are assigned in **Descending** order (Top-to-Bottom).\n    *   **Horizontal Structures**: Lines extend from columns corresponding to indices 1, 2, 5 or adjacent to markers. Colors are assigned in **Ascending** order (Left-to-Right).\n5.  **Direct Alignment Override**: If a marker aligns with a structure's port row/column, that port is forced to the marker's color. Remaining ports are filled with the remaining colors, preserving the sort order relative to the fixed position.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Algorithm for ARC Task - A Detailed Breakdown**\n\nOkay, here's the deal: I'm tasked with cracking an ARC puzzle based on a couple of examples. My mind is already racing, breaking down every detail to find the underlying logic.\n\nFirst, I dive into the provided input/output grids and the accompanying text. It's all about identifying the patterns and, more importantly, *how* those patterns transform. The key seems to be these \"Composite Structures\" and those single-pixel \"markers.\"\n\nI'm thinking, \"Color 8 is the background, those structures are made up of 1, 2, 3, and 4.\" The examples are the roadmap, but, wait, are the colors in the description precisely correct? In Example 1, I see 3's in the structures which are not mentioned in the text. I need to be careful with these \"descriptions\" they provided, they might generalize or just be clues. I want to build a very precise definition. Also, \"Beams,\" let's call them that: either vertical (two columns wide) or horizontal (two rows tall) with those \"caps\" on the ends.\n\nNow, those markers. They are *key*. Example 1 has a gray one (5), a blue one (1), and a magenta one (6). Example 2 adds a green one (3), a maroon one (9), and the same magenta (6). So far, so good.\n\nNext, I look at the \"transformation\" instructions. First, identify the markers and record those colors. The \"Sort\" part is important: it's either ascending or descending. The examples have markers sorted by color: (1, 5, 6), (3, 6, 9) in ascending order. Then, locate the composite structures (Beams). Here's where it gets interesting: generate perpendicular lines from the \"ports\" of these structures.\n\nAnd the indices for the lines? For the *vertical* structure, it's lines from rows 1, 4, 5 (relative to the top row). For the *horizontal* one, it's columns corresponding to indices 1, 2, and 5 (relative to the leftmost column).\n\nBut wait: the \"Direct Alignment Override\" rule. This is the crucial twist! If a marker \"aligns\" (is at the same row or column) with a structure's port, the port gets *that* marker's color. Then, the remaining ports are filled in according to the sort order!\n\nExample 2 is my testing ground here, I see marker 3 at row 1, marker 6 at row 0, and marker 9 at row 5. The rule states: \"If a marker aligns, it forces the color.\" So, with marker 3 aligned to line at row 1, port 1 will be forced to color 3. This means that lines R1, R4, R5 have colors 3, 6, 9, in that order, as they are not affected by a rule that requires descending order. Wait. Descending?\n\nI pause here. I need to verify that \"descending\" really means from top to bottom. No. I check the index values.\n\nThis is critical to the order.\n\nI spend significant effort analyzing this rule about the \"Default\" and the Override rules, since I'm trying to determine whether the examples tell me a rule about lines and structures.\n\nI have two questions:\n1) Is the \"transform the Composite Structure\" consistent with the index (1, 4, 5) or is the index relative to \"The Marker List\".\n2) Is there a structure to the order?\n\nI can infer it in two ways.\n\nI can infer the line order directly, in one pass, without referring to the colors. Or I can infer the Marker Order, which may be different.\n\nI hypothesize \"The Marker List\" drives the index order, the color.\n\nIf \"marker alignment\" *forces* the colors onto the lines, then if there are no marker alignments, is there a \"default sort order\". In Ex1? The default appears to be \"Descending\". In Ex2, if there is alignment, then it *overrides* that and may or may not agree with descending.\n\nNow, my mind shifts into overdrive! I have to refine my plan: First, I meticulously check for those isolated markers. Then, I sort the marker colors. Next, identify those Beams, starting with the vertical ones. This is where the magic happens:\n\nFor each vertical Beam (let's say it's rows 0-6), calculate the colors of lines, making note of those alignment \"overrides.\" For each horizontal Beam (let's say it's cols 18-24), same process\n\nThe problem asks us to identify \"Composite Structures\" and \"Markers\" in a grid, and then generate horizontal and vertical lines from the structures based on specific rules involving the markers.\n\n**1. Identify Markers and Sort Colors:**\nFirst, we locate all isolated marker pixels (pixels that are not part of the large composite structures).\n*   In the test input:\n    *   Row 1, Column 0: **9** (Maroon)\n    *   Row 28, Column 21: **6** (Magenta)\n    *   Row 11, Column 28: **7** (Orange)\n*   The set of marker colors is {6, 7, 9}.\n*   **Ascending Order:** 6, 7, 9.\n*   **Descending Order:** 9, 7, 6.\n\n**2. Identify Structures and Apply Transformation:**\nWe locate the composite structures and generate lines. Vertical structures produce horizontal lines at relative rows 1, 4, and 5. Horizontal structures produce vertical lines at relative columns 1, 2, and 5. The priority for coloring is: **Override** if a marker aligns with a port, otherwise follow the sort order (Descending for Vertical, Ascending for Horizontal).\n\n*   **Structure 1 (Vertical):** Located at Columns 4-5, Rows 0-6.\n    *   **Ports:** Row 1, Row 4, Row 5 (Relative) $\\rightarrow$ Absolute Rows 1, 4, 5.\n    *   **Alignment:** Marker **9** is at Row 1. It aligns with Port 1.\n    *   **Action:** Force Port 1 to **9**.\n    *   **Fill Remaining:** Remaining ports are Row 4, Row 5. Remaining colors are {6, 7}. Vertical defaults to Descending order. We fill remaining spots (R4, R5) with remaining colors (7, 6).\n    *   **Result:** Row 1 $\\rightarrow$ **9**, Row 4 $\\rightarrow$ **7**, Row 5 $\\rightarrow$ **6**.\n\n*   **Structure 2 (Horizontal):** Located at Rows 2-3, Columns 18-24.\n    *   **Ports:** Column 1, 2, 5 (Relative) $\\rightarrow$ Absolute Columns 19, 20, 23.\n    *   **Alignment:** No markers align with these columns.\n    *   **Action:** Use default Horizontal order (Ascending: 6, 7, 9).\n    *   **Result:** Column 19 $\\rightarrow$ **6**, Column 20 $\\rightarrow$ **7**, Column 23 $\\rightarrow$ **9**.\n\n*   **Structure 3 (Vertical):** Located at Columns 24-25, Rows 10-16.\n    *   **Ports:** Row 1, 4, 5 (Relative) $\\rightarrow$ Absolute Rows 11, 14, 15.\n    *   **Alignment:** Marker **7** is at Row 11. It aligns with Port 1.\n    *   **Action:** Force Port 1 to **7**.\n    *   **Fill Remaining:** Remaining ports are R14, R15. Remaining colors are {6, 9}. Vertical defaults to Descending order (9, 6).\n    *   **Result:** Row 11 $\\rightarrow$ **7**, Row 14 $\\rightarrow$ **9**, Row 15 $\\rightarrow$ **6**.\n\n*   **Structure 4 (Vertical):** Located at Columns 9-10, Rows 22-28.\n    *   **Ports:** Row 1, 4, 5 (Relative) $\\rightarrow$ Absolute Rows 23, 26, 27.\n    *   **Alignment:** No markers align with these rows.\n    *   **Action:** Use default Vertical order (Descending: 9, 7, 6).\n    *   **Result:** Row 23 $\\rightarrow$ **9**, Row 26 $\\rightarrow$ **7**, Row 27 $\\rightarrow$ **6**.\n\n**3. Rendering:**\n*   Lines are drawn across the entire grid but do not overwrite the structures themselves.\n*   Vertical lines (from the horizontal structure) take precedence over horizontal lines (from vertical structures) where they intersect.\n*   Markers are preserved.\n\n**Output Generation:**\nWe apply the calculated lines to the background (8), ensuring structures and markers remain intact.\n\n*   **Horizontal Lines:**\n    *   Rows 1, 14, 23 become 9s.\n    *   Rows 4, 11, 26 become 7s.\n    *   Rows 5, 15, 27 become 6s.\n*   **Vertical Lines:**\n    *   Column 19 becomes 6s.\n    *   Column 20 becomes 7s.\n    *   Column 23 becomes 9s.\n\n(Note: Vertical lines overwrite Horizontal lines at intersections).\n\n8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,4,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,6,6,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6,9,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,3,3,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,9,2,4,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,2,4,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,7,9,9,9,2,4,9,9,9\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6,9,1,4,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,1,1,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6,9,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nObject 1: Composite Structures (Colors 1, 2, 4). Attributes: L-shaped or rectangular with a distinct 'head', variable length, horizontal or vertical orientation.\nObject 2: Linear Strips (Colors 1, 3, 5, 6, 9). Attributes: Uniform color, horizontal or vertical lines, variable length.\nBackground: Color 8.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1.  Identify all isolated \"marker\" pixels and collect their colors.\n2.  Sort these colors into Ascending (Low-to-High) and Descending (High-to-Low) lists.\n3.  Locate all Composite Structures (vertical and horizontal).\n4.  Generate perpendicular lines from these structures based on specific \"port\" locations:\n    *   **Vertical Structures**: Lines extend from rows 1, 4, and 5 (relative to the structure's start). Colors are assigned in **Descending** order (Top-to-Bottom).\n    *   **Horizontal Structures**: Lines extend from columns corresponding to indices 1, 2, 5 or adjacent to markers. Colors are assigned in **Ascending** order (Left-to-Right).\n5.  **Direct Alignment Override**: If a marker aligns with a structure's port row/column, that port is forced to the marker's color.

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nObject 1: Composite Structures (Colors 1, 2, 4). Attributes: L-shaped or rectangular with a distinct 'head', variable length, horizontal or vertical orientation.\nObject 2: Linear Strips (Colors 1, 3, 5, 6, 9). Attributes: Uniform color, horizontal or vertical lines, variable length.\nBackground: Color 8.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1.  Identify all isolated \"marker\" pixels and collect their colors.\n2.  Sort these colors into Ascending (Low-to-High) and Descending (High-to-Low) lists.\n3.  Locate all Composite Structures (vertical and horizontal).\n4.  Generate perpendicular lines from these structures based on specific \"port\" locations:\n    *   **Vertical Structures**: Lines extend from rows 1, 4, and 5 (relative to the structure's start). Colors are assigned in **Descending** order (Top-to-Bottom).\n    *   **Horizontal Structures**: Lines extend from columns corresponding to indices 1, 2, 5 or adjacent to markers. Colors are assigned in **Ascending** order (Left-to-Right).\n5.  **Direct Alignment Override**: If a marker aligns with a structure's port row/column, that port is forced to the marker's color. Remaining ports are filled with the remaining colors, preserving the sort order relative to the fixed position.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Explanation**\n\n1. Identify the isolated single coloured pixels \u2013 these are the markers.  \n   In the test grid the isolated markers are colours 9 at (2,1), 7 at (12,29) and 6 at (29,22).  \n   Sort them: ascending\u202f[6,7,9], descending\u202f[9,7,6].\n\n2. Find the composite structures (the 2\u2011cell wide vertical blocks and the 2\u2011row high horizontal blocks).  \n   Vertical composites are at columns\u202f5\u20136 rows\u202f1\u20136, columns\u202f25\u201326 rows\u202f11\u201317, and columns\u202f10\u201311 rows\u202f23\u201329.  \n   There is one horizontal composite at rows\u202f3\u20134 columns\u202f19\u201325.\n\n3. For each vertical structure choose port rows at start+1, start+4, start+5 (positions 2,5,6 from the top).  \n   Decide the side to extend towards by which column is lower: extend towards the column with the smaller values.  \n   Assign colours from the descending marker list top\u2011to\u2011bottom, applying any marker row override.  \n   Draw horizontal lines from the structure edge to the border on the chosen side, only on background cells.\n\n   \u2022 Struct\u202fA (cols\u202f5\u20136, rows\u202f1\u20136), direction right, port rows\u202f2,5,6 \u2192 colours 9,7,6 (row\u202f2 forced by marker 9).  \n   \u2022 Struct\u202fC (cols\u202f25\u201326, rows\u202f11\u201317), direction left, port rows\u202f12,15,16 \u2192 colours 7(forced),9,6.  \n   \u2022 Struct\u202fD (cols\u202f10\u201311, rows\u202f23\u201329), direction right, port rows\u202f24,27,28 \u2192 colours 9,7,6.\n\n4. For the horizontal structure (rows\u202f3\u20134, cols\u202f19\u201325) take port columns start+1, start+2, start+5 \u2192 20,21,24.  \n   Assign ascending marker colours [6,7,9] left\u2011to\u2011right.  \n   Draw vertical lines downward from row\u202f5 to the bottom in those columns, only on background, and overwriting any previously drawn horizontal lines.\n\nApplying these steps yields the following output grid.\n\n**Output**\n\n8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,8,8,8,4,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6,9,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,3,3,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,9,2,4,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,2,4,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,7,9,9,9,2,4,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6,9,1,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,1,1,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,7,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6,9,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,6,8,9,8,8,8,8,8",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nObject 1: Composite Structures (Colors 1, 2, 4). Attributes: L-shaped or rectangular with a distinct 'head', variable length, horizontal or vertical orientation.\nObject 2: Linear Strips (Colors 1, 3, 5, 6, 9). Attributes: Uniform color, horizontal or vertical lines, variable length.\nBackground: Color 8.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1.  Identify all isolated \"marker\" pixels and collect their colors.\n2.  Sort these colors into Ascending (Low-to-High) and Descending (High-to-Low) lists.\n3.  Locate all Composite Structures (vertical and horizontal).\n4.  Generate perpendicular lines from these structures based on specific \"port\" locations:\n    *   **Vertical Structures**: Lines extend from rows 1, 4, and 5 (relative to the structure's start). Colors are assigned in **Descending** order (Top-to-Bottom).\n    *   **Horizontal Structures**: Lines extend from columns corresponding to indices 1, 2, 5 or adjacent to markers. Colors are assigned in **Ascending** order (Left-to-Right).\n5.  **Direct Alignment Override**: If a marker aligns with a structure's port row/column, that port is forced to the marker's color. Remaining ports are filled with the remaining colors, preserving the sort order relative to the fixed position.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Here is how I applied the transformation to the test grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Identify marker colors\n\nMarkers are single non\u2011background pixels (no 4\u2011connected non\u20118 neighbors):\n\n- (row 2, col 1) = **9**\n- (row 12, col 29) = **7**\n- (row 29, col 22) = **6**\n\nSo the marker color set is `{6, 7, 9}`.\n\nWe use:\n\n- Ascending list for vertical lines from horizontal structures: **[6, 7, 9]**\n- Descending list for horizontal lines from vertical structures: **[9, 7, 6]**\n\nWe\u2019ll reuse this triplet for every composite; it is **not** consumed globally.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Find composite structures\n\n### Vertical composites (2\u00d7k columns using 1/2/4/3)\n\n1. **V\u2081 (upper\u2011left)**  \n\n   - Columns 5\u20136, rows 1\u20137:\n\n     ```\n     row1: 1 1\n     row2: 4 1\n     row3: 4 2\n     row4: 4 2\n     row5: 4 2\n     row6: 4 2\n     row7: 3 3\n     ```\n\n   - Column 6 is the vertical \u201c2\u2011stem\u201d (2\u2019s in rows 3\u20136).\n   - First 2 in stem at row **s\u2081 = 3**.\n   - Rows above stem and inside object: rows 1\u20132 \u2192 **two head rows**.\n\n2. **V\u2082 (right\u2011middle)**  \n\n   - Columns 25\u201326, rows 11\u201317:\n\n     ```\n     row11: 3 3\n     row12: 2 4\n     row13: 2 4\n     row14: 2 4\n     row15: 2 4\n     row16: 1 4\n     row17: 1 1\n     ```\n\n   - Column 25 is 2\u2011stem (2\u2019s rows 12\u201315).\n   - Stem starts at **s\u2082 = 12**.\n   - One row above stem in object (row 11) \u2192 **one head row**.\n\n3. **V\u2083 (lower\u2011left)**  \n\n   - Columns 10\u201311, rows 23\u201329:\n\n     ```\n     row23: 1 1\n     row24: 4 1\n     row25: 4 2\n     row26: 4 2\n     row27: 4 2\n     row28: 4 2\n     row29: 3 3\n     ```\n\n   - Column 11 is 2\u2011stem (2\u2019s rows 25\u201328).\n   - Stem start **s\u2083 = 25**.\n   - Two rows above stem in object (rows 23\u201324) \u2192 **two head rows**.\n\n### Horizontal composite (2\u00d7k rows using 1/2/4/3)\n\n4. **H\u2081 (center)**  \n\n   - Rows 3\u20134, columns 19\u201325:\n\n     ```\n     row3: 3 2 2 2 2 1 1\n     row4: 3 4 4 4 4 4 1\n           ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^\n          c19..25\n     ```\n\n   - Bottom row\u2019s 2\u2011run is at columns **20\u201323**.\n   - Take its leftmost 2 as horizontal \u201cstart\u201d: **start col = 20**.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Port positions\n\n### Vertical composites \u2192 horizontal bands\n\nPorts are fixed rows relative to where the 2\u2011stem begins.  \nFrom the examples, the pattern depends on how many head rows sit above the 2\u2011stem:\n\n- If there are **two** head rows above: ports at rows **s\u22121, s+1, s+3**.\n- If there is **one** head row above: ports at rows **s, s+3, s+4**.\n\nApply to each vertical object:\n\n1. **V\u2081** (two heads, s\u2081 = 3):\n\n   - Port rows: **2, 4, 6**\n\n2. **V\u2082** (one head, s\u2082 = 12):\n\n   - Port rows: **12, 15, 16**\n\n3. **V\u2083** (two heads, s\u2083 = 25):\n\n   - Port rows: **24, 26, 28**\n\n**Direction of extension.**  \nHorizontal bands go from the composite outwards toward the **nearest grid edge**:\n\n- V\u2081 at columns 5\u20136: closer to left edge \u2192 extend **left**.\n- V\u2082 at columns 25\u201326: closer to right edge \u2192 extend **right**.\n- V\u2083 at columns 10\u201311: closer to left edge \u2192 extend **left**.\n\nLines stop just before the composite and affect only background (8); any non\u20118 cell (including markers or existing structure) is left unchanged.\n\n### Horizontal composite \u2192 vertical bands\n\nFor a horizontal composite:\n\n- Use leftmost 2 of the bottom 2\u2011run as start column.\n- Ports are at columns **start+1, start+2, start+5**.\n\nFor **H\u2081**:\n\n- 2\u2011run starts at col 20 \u2192 port columns:  \n  **c21, c22, c25**.\n\nVertical bands start **one row below** the composite (here, from row 5 downwards) and proceed to the bottom, only recoloring background 8\u2019s.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Color assignment with marker override\n\n### Base color rules\n\n- **Vertical composites (horizontal bands):** use descending marker list **[9, 7, 6]** from top port to bottom.\n- **Horizontal composites (vertical bands):** use ascending marker list **[6, 7, 9]** from left port to right.\n\n### Direct alignment override\n\nIf a port row/column contains a marker:\n\n- That port\u2019s band color is forced to that marker\u2019s color.\n- The remaining ports use the remaining colors, in the same sorted order (descending for vertical, ascending for horizontal).\n\nWe also **never overwrite** a non\u20118 cell when drawing a band.\n\n---\n\n### 4.1. Vertical composites\n\n#### V\u2081 (cols 5\u20136), ports at rows 2, 4, 6, bands to the **left**\n\nMarker rows are 2, 12, 29. One port row coincides:\n\n- Row 2 contains marker **9** \u2192 top port forced to **9**.\n\nSequence for V\u2081:\n\n- Available descending colors: [9, 7, 6]\n- Row 2: forced 9 (removes 9) \u2192 remaining [7, 6]\n- Row 4: next \u2192 7\n- Row 6: next \u2192 6\n\nSo:\n\n- **Row 2:** color 9 on columns 1\u20134 (left of col 5) but only where cells are 8  \n  \u2192 (2,1) stays 9 (marker), (2,2\u20134) become 9.\n- **Row 4:** color 7 on columns 1\u20134 (all 8) \u2192 become 7.\n- **Row 6:** color 6 on columns 1\u20134 (all 8) \u2192 become 6.\n\n#### V\u2082 (cols 25\u201326), ports at rows 12, 15, 16, bands to the **right**\n\nMarker rows: 2, 12, 29. Here, row 12 is a port:\n\n- Row 12 contains marker **7** \u2192 top port forced to **7**.\n\nSequence:\n\n- Descending list: [9, 7, 6]\n- Row 12: forced 7 \u2192 remaining [9, 6]\n- Row 15: 9\n- Row 16: 6\n\nBands extend from immediately right of the composite (col 27) to the right edge (col 29), changing only 8\u2019s:\n\n- **Row 12 (color 7):**  \n  c27, c28: 8\u21927; c29 is already marker 7 \u2192 unchanged.\n- **Row 15 (color 9):**  \n  c27\u2013c29: 8\u21929.\n- **Row 16 (color 6):**  \n  c27\u2013c29: 8\u21926.\n\n#### V\u2083 (cols 10\u201311), ports at rows 24, 26, 28, bands to the **left**\n\nMarker rows: 2, 12, 29. None coincide with 24, 26, 28; no overrides.\n\nUse descending [9,7,6] directly:\n\n- **Row 24:** color 9 left of col 10 \u2192 columns 1\u20139 (all 8) \u2192 9.\n- **Row 26:** color 7 on columns 1\u20139 (all 8) \u2192 7.\n- **Row 28:** color 6 on columns 1\u20139 (all 8) \u2192 6.\n\n---\n\n### 4.2. Horizontal composite H\u2081 (rows 3\u20134, cols 19\u201325)\n\nPorts at columns 21, 22, 25; vertical bands start at row 5.\n\nMarker columns are 1, 22, 29. One port column matches:\n\n- Column 22 contains marker **6** (at row 29) \u2192 that port forced to **6**.\n\nAscending color list: [6, 7, 9]\n\n- c22: forced 6 \u2192 remaining [7, 9]\n- c21: next \u2192 7\n- c25: next \u2192 9\n\nVertical bands:\n\n- Start at row 5 (2 rows of the composite are 3 & 4); go down to row 29.\n- Recolor only background 8\u2019s in those columns.\n\nResult:\n\n- **Column 21 (color 7):**  \n  For rows 5\u201329, all c21 are 8 \u2192 become 7.\n- **Column 22 (color 6):**  \n  For rows 5\u201328, c22 are 8 \u2192 become 6;  \n  row 29 already has marker 6 at c22 \u2192 unchanged.\n- **Column 25 (color 9):**  \n  Rows 5\u201310 and 18\u201329 have c25=8 \u2192 become 9;  \n  rows 11\u201317 are part of V\u2082 (3,2,2,2,2,1,1) \u2192 left as is.\n\n---\n\n## 5.

                "response": "**Initial Assessment of Grid Visuals**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at these grids, and I'm immediately noticing a few recurring elements. The first thing that jumps out is the background, which seems to be consistently color 8. Now, let's break down the more complex objects. There are these structures I'm seeing repeatedly, and they seem to be composed of three distinct colors, 4, 1, and 2, arranged in specific spatial relationships. It's almost like a rigid \"key\" shape, with a \"head\" (color 4), a \"spine\" or \"shaft\" (color 1), and a \"blade\" or \"block\" (color 2). Importantly, the \"key\" orientation can vary \u2013 sometimes it's vertical, with the head at the top, and other times horizontal.\n\nBeyond this rigid key object, there are these simpler, linear structures. These lines are just single colors extending across the grid, both horizontally and vertically, like stripes or beams. I'm seeing colors 3, 5, 6, and 9 frequently here. They seem to be floating within the color 8 background. In the last grid, I'm noticing an interesting point \u2013 a line of color 1 that isn't connected to one of the \"key\" structures, which reinforces the need to identify the \"lines\" as a separate object.\n\nSo, to summarize, the basic visual vocabulary seems to be this combination of these composite 'key' shapes, these color lines, and a background color.\n\n<objects_summary>\nObject 1: Composite Structures (Colors 1, 2, 4). Attributes: L-shaped or rectangular with a distinct 'head', variable length, horizontal or vertical orientation.\nObject 2: Linear Strips (Colors 1, 3, 5, 6, 9). Attributes: Uniform color, horizontal or vertical lines, variable length.\nBackground: Color 8.\n</objects_summary>\n\n\nThe grids contain a consistent set of geometric objects set against a uniform background. The objects can be categorized into composite structural shapes and simple linear elements.\n\n**Background:**\nThe entire grid space is filled with a background of **color 8**. All other objects are superimposed onto this field.\n\n**Composite Structures (Key-like Objects):**\nThese are distinct, multi-colored shapes that appear to be rigid bodies. They are composed of three specific components arranged in a fixed configuration:\n1.  **Head/Pivot:** A single cell of **color 4**.\n2.  **Shaft/Spine:** A straight line of **color 1** extending directly from the **color 4** cell.\n3.  **Body/Blade:** A rectangular block of **color 2** that runs parallel and adjacent to the **color 1** shaft.\n\nThese structures appear in two orientations:\n*   **Vertical:** The **color 4** is at the top, the **color 1** line extends downwards, and the **color 2** block is attached to the right side of the **color 1** line.\n*   **Horizontal:** The **color 4** is on the left, the **color 1** line extends to the right, and the **color 2** block is attached below the **color 1** line.\n\nThe length of the shaft (**color 1**) and the body (**color 2**) varies between different instances of these objects, but the relative arrangement of the three colors remains constant.\n\n**Linear Strips (Beams/Lines):**\nThese are long, straight lines or bars consisting of a single, uniform color.\n*   **Colors:** These lines primarily appear in **color 3**, **color 5**, **color 6**, and **color 9**. Occasionally, **color 1** also appears as a standalone linear strip (distinct from the shafts of the composite structures).\n*   **Orientation:** They appear as horizontal rows or vertical columns.\n*   **Attributes:** These strips vary in length.

                "response": "**Understanding the Grid Transformations**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to figure out how these input grids become the output grids. I need to break down the changes, see the patterns, and come up with a set of rules.\n\nHere's my thinking process:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Examples:** I start with the given examples, breaking them down into their parts. I need to spot any regularities. I look for the shapes, colors, and how those change between input and output. I'm focusing on the \"Composite Structures\" and those single-pixel colors scattered around because I think they play a special role.\n\n2.  **Identify \"Markers\":** These isolated pixels are key. They're like signals. Their color seems to \"route\" to other parts of the grid. Their position is also important because I noticed lines are often generated on the same rows or columns as markers.\n\n3.  **Detect \"Structures\":** These are the building blocks. I see repeating patterns of pixel values, vertical or horizontal. These will get \"ports\" where lines are created.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint \"Ports\":** Ports are key. The pixel value '2' appears to be the place where the structure interacts with the rest of the grid. If a structure has a '2' or '1' pixel on the side, that's a port for a line to come out. The direction the lines originate (left, right, top, or bottom) depends on the '2' and its location in the structure.\n\n5.  **Alignment is Key:** There seems to be a rule where, if a marker and a port are aligned (same row or same column), then the marker's color shoots out from that port.\n\n6.  **\"Filling\" the Gaps:** If there aren't direct connections, the remaining colors from the markers are sorted and distributed according to their location in the final output. The sorting direction is affected by the structure and if it used to 2s, 1s, or mixed numbers. It may either be ascending or descending order.\n\n**Summarized rules:**\n\n*   Identify the unique marker colors and sort them.\n*   Find composite structures.\n*   If a marker aligns with a structure, draw the color line to the marker.\n*   Remaining lines are drawn at available ports based on specific index patterns.\n*   Vertical structures with '2' components use descending color order. Horizontal use ascending.\n*   Lines extend from port cells.\n*   Lines extend until it hits something.\n\nOkay, that's what I've got. Let's make it happen.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the input and output grids, the transformations involve generating linear \"beams\" or \"wires\" of specific colors from the existing \"Composite Structures\" (Object 1). The colors of these new lines correspond to the isolated single pixels (\"Markers\") found in the input grid (from Object 2).\n\nThe process can be described as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Markers**: Scan the grid to find all isolated single pixels of colors that are not part of the main structures (typically colors other than 2, 4, 8). Collect these colors. In Example 1, markers are 1, 5, 6. In Example 2, markers are 3, 6, 9.\n\n2.  **Sort Colors**: Create two lists of these marker colors:\n    *   **Ascending**: Low to High (e.g., 1, 5, 6).\n    *   **Descending**: High to Low (e.g., 6, 5, 1).\n\n3.  **Identify Structures**: Locate the \"Composite Structures\".\n    *   **Vertical Structures**: Defined by vertical columns of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.\n    *   **Horizontal Structures**: Defined by horizontal rows of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.\n\n4.  **Determine Extension Ports and Directions**:\n    *   For Vertical structures, check the left and right columns. If a column contains '2's or '1's, it acts as a side for connections. The lines extend horizontally away from the structure (e.g., if the left column has ports, lines extend left).\n    *   For Horizontal structures, check the top and bottom rows. Lines extend vertically away.\n\n5.  **Map Colors to Ports (Routing Rules)**:\n    *   **Direct Alignment**: If a marker is on the same row (for vertical structures) or column (for horizontal structures) as a valid port, a line of that marker's color is generated at that position.\n    *   **Pattern Filling**: For the remaining colors, specific ports are selected based on the structure's length.\n        *   For structures of length 7 (common in examples), lines appear at relative indices **1, 4, 5** (0-indexed from the start of the structure).\n        *   For Horizontal structures, lines tend to fill adjacent available ports relative to any fixed alignments, or follow a spread pattern (e.g., indices 1, 2, 5).\n    *   **Color Ordering**:\n        *   **Vertical Structures** typically use **Descending** order (Top to Bottom). That is, the highest value color goes to the top-most active port, and the lowest to the bottom. (Exception: Pure '1' based structures may use Ascending).\n        *   **Horizontal Structures** typically use **Ascending** order (Left to Right).\n    *   **Constraint Satisfaction**: If a port is fixed by Direct Alignment, the remaining colors fill the remaining selected ports while maintaining the sorted order relative to the fixed color.\n\n6.  **Draw Lines**: Generate the lines of the determined colors extending from the ports to the grid boundaries or other objects.\n\n**Transformation Summary for Test Input:**\n*   **Markers**: 9 (Row 1, Col 0), 7 (Row 11, Col 28), 6 (Row 28, Col 21). Sorted: 6, 7, 9.\n*   **Top Left Vertical (Cols 4-5)**: Extends Right. Port at Row 1 aligns with Marker 9. Uses indices 1, 4, 5. Order Descending (9, 7, 6).\n    *   Row 1: Color **9**\n    *   Row 4: Color **7**\n    *   Row 5: Color **6**\n*   **Right Vertical (Cols 24-25)**: Extends Left. Port at Row 11 aligns with Marker 7. Uses indices 1, 4, 5 (Rows 11, 14, 15). Order Descending (9, 7, 6).\n    *   Row 11: Color **7** (Fixed, middle value)\n    *   Row 14: Color **9** (Higher value, but 7 is fixed at top? Adjusting for fixed: 7 is fixed. Remaining 9, 6. Descending -> 9, 6).\n    *   Row 15: Color **6**\n*   **Right Horizontal (Cols 18-24)**: Extends Up. Port at Col 21 aligns with Marker 6.

No alignment. Uses indices 1, 4, 5 (Rows 23, 26, 27). Order Descending (9, 7, 6).\n    *   Row 23: Color **9**\n    *   Row 26: Color **7**\n    *   Row 27: Color **6**\n\n<transformation_summary>\n1.

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nObject 1: Composite Structures (Colors 1, 2, 4). Attributes: L-shaped or rectangular with a distinct 'head', variable length, horizontal or vertical orientation.\nObject 2: Linear Strips (Colors 1, 3, 5, 6, 9). Attributes: Uniform color, horizontal or vertical lines, variable length.\nBackground: Color 8.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1.  Identify all isolated \"marker\" pixels and collect their colors.\n2.  Sort these colors into Ascending (Low-to-High) and Descending (High-to-Low) lists.\n3.  Locate all Composite Structures (vertical and horizontal).\n4.  Generate perpendicular lines from these structures based on specific \"port\" locations:\n    *   **Vertical Structures**: Lines extend from rows 1, 4, and 5 (relative to the structure's start). Colors are assigned in **Descending** order (Top-to-Bottom).\n    *   **Horizontal Structures**: Lines extend from columns corresponding to indices 1, 2, 5 or adjacent to markers. Colors are assigned in **Ascending** order (Left-to-Right).\n5.  **Direct Alignment Override**: If a marker aligns with a structure's port row/column, that port is forced to the marker's color. Remaining ports are filled with the remaining colors, preserving the sort order relative to the fixed position.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
