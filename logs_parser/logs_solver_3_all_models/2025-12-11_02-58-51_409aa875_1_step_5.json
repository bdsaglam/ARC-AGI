            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analysis and Transformation Strategy for ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I need to transform input grids into output grids. My initial approach involves meticulously analyzing pairs of input and output grids to discern the underlying transformation rules.  It's all about figuring out *how* the input is changed to become the output.\n\n**Step 1: Decoding Input and Identifying Structures.**\n\nI start by looking for repeated patterns or 'objects' within the input. I pay close attention to colors and the arrangement of pixels.  Take the first example, where the 'object' is a 'Space Invader' shape\u2014a specific pattern of maroon pixels on an orange background.  I focus on the spatial relationships of these maroon pixels. For the grid, I meticulously check coordinates by counting along rows and columns.\n\n**Step 2: Linking Input Objects to the Output Grid.**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the relationship between these identified objects and their corresponding changes in the output. In the example, I identify that this 'Space Invader' type object has some action. It turns out, that in the output, copies of the structure appear. I trace back the output to locate where the objects had a color change. I need to understand if the change is a one-to-one mapping, or a more complex interaction. \n\n**Step 3: Define Objects**.\n\nI needed to develop a specific template based on the object's geometry. For the 'Space Invader' types, I can see that it has 3 pixels. I will determine the center of this object for future calculations. \n\n**Step 4: Decoding the Transformation.**\n\nI look for the copy and color change patterns. Is it just a copy, or a color-altering transformation? What is the shift in the copy location? I must identify any geometric attributes of the object that relate to how the copy transforms. It's the type of object and its orientation that decides how the object copies to a new location. For instance, the original 'Space Invader' objects are at a specific location, while copies will appear at a location '5 rows above.' I need to know why and how.\n\n**Step 5: Generalizing Rules.**\n\nI hypothesize and then test general transformation rules using multiple examples. In a nutshell, the rule identifies shapes and then replicates those shapes with a specific 'vector' applied. The 'vector' is a defined offset to determine the target for this copy operation.  The shift is NOT fixed. It depends on the object type. \n\n**Step 6: Classifying Shape Interactions and their Vectors.**\n\nI create a shape-to-vector map. The goal here is to establish the direction of this move, where it copies to. Each specific object (like an L-shape) has a defined vector associated to it. If it is a Pyramid, the Vector is 'Up,' and the copy is generated a specific amount of rows above. If it is a Down-Arrow type (Inverted Pyramid) then the copy has to appear 'down'. These are the key relationships that must be determined for all shapes.\n\n**Step 7: Identifying Rules and Anomalies.**\n\nI must define marker colors. Normally it is Maroon (9), but there are specific conditions that must be defined. I identify anomalies where the source object itself undergoes a color change and where the copy is created as blue. I hypothesize that this color change is due to a 'bullseye' type of geometric positioning in the grid, but must continue to confirm this rule.\n\n**Step 8: Constructing the Output.**\n\nI construct a plan to derive the output. Starting with a copy of the original input. I calculate a target location for the copy and place a Marker at this location.  This must be repeated for each identified object, until the final map is completed.\n\n**Test Case - Test Input Grid**\n\nAfter reviewing the specific Test Input Grid, the process re-starts. I create my list of steps:\n\n1.  Identify the background and object colors of the grid.  I find the 'Objects.'  I look for the key elements. The test involves Magenta (6) pixels on a white (7) grid.\n2.  I generate all shapes, and apply my shift logic.\n3.  I generate the Marker at the Target location.\n4.  I generate the Output grid.\n\nI perform this process iteratively to derive the answer.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on rules inferred from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Object Identification:** The grids contain a background color (7) and various small foreground objects formed by other colors (9, 0, 2, 6).\n2.  **Shape Classification & Shift Logic:**\n    *   **Upright Pyramid** (e.g., Ex 1, 2, Test Input): Points Up. The transformation places a \"marker\" pixel at a position shifted by **(-5, 0)** (5 rows up).\n    *   **Inverted Pyramid** (e.g., Test Input Shape B): Points Down. The transformation places a marker shifted by **(+5, 0)** (5 rows down).\n    *   **Left-Pointing Arrow** (e.g., Test Input Shape C): Points Left. The transformation places a marker shifted by **(0, -5)** (5 columns left).\n    *   **L-Shapes / Corner Shapes** (e.g., Ex 3, Test Input Shapes A, D): These shapes have a \"mass\" or \"corner\" that implies a diagonal direction.\n        *   **Top-Left Mass** (Ex 3): Points Up-Left. Shift **(-5, -5)**.\n        *   **Bottom-Right Mass** (Test Shape A): Points Down-Right. Shift **(+5, +5)**.\n        *   **Top-Right Mass** (Test Shape D): Points Up-Right. Shift **(-5, +5)**.\n3.  **Marker Characteristics:**\n    *   The markers are single pixels.\n    *   The color of the marker is consistently **9** (Maroon), overwriting whatever is at the target location. (Example 1 had a special case with a Blue pixel, likely a specific center-alignment rule not applicable here as per Example 2/3 precedents).\n    *   The original objects generally remain (unless overwritten by a marker).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\nWe identify the shapes in the test input (Color 6 on Background 7) and calculate target marker positions:\n\n1.  **Pyramid** at `(5, 9)`: Points Up. Shift (-5, 0) $\\to$ **(0, 9)**.\n2.  **Pyramid** at `(7, 2)`: Points Up. Shift (-5, 0) $\\to$ **(2, 2)**.\n    *   Note: `(2, 2)` is part of Shape A. It gets overwritten by the marker (9).\n3.  **Pyramid** at `(13, 4)`: Points Up. Shift (-5, 0) $\\to$ **(8, 4)**.\n4.  **Pyramid** at `(14, 14)`: Points Up. Shift (-5, 0) $\\to$ **(9, 14)**.\n5.  **Inverted Pyramid (Shape B)** at `(2, 8)-(3, 9)`: Tip at `(3, 9)`. Points Down. Shift (+5, 0) $\\to$ **(8, 9)**.\n6.  **Left Arrow (Shape C)** at `(3, 14)-(5, 14)`: Tip at `(4, 13)`. Points Left. Shift (0, -5) $\\to$ **(4, 8)**.\n7.  **Shape A** at `(2, 2)-(3, 2)`: Mass is Bottom-Right (Corner `(3, 2)`). Points Down-Right. Shift (+5, +5) $\\to$ **(8, 7)**.\n8.  **Shape D** at `(14, 8)-(15, 9)`: Mass is Top-Right (Corner `(14, 9)`). Points Top-Right. Shift (-5, +5) $\\to$ **(9, 14)**. (Collides with marker from Pyramid 4, result is 9).\n\n**Final Markers to Plot:**\n*   `(0, 9)`\n*   `(2, 2)`\n*   `(4, 8)`\n*   `(8, 4)`\n*   `(8, 7)`\n*   `(8, 9)`\n*   `(9, 14)`\n\nWe superimpose these maroon (9) pixels onto the original test input.\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to identify the transformation rules from the examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\nIn all examples, I observe:\n1. There are V-shaped patterns (pointing up or down) made of colored cells\n2. There are also L-shaped or \"r\"-shaped patterns\n3. The transformation places markers (9s or 1s) at positions 5 rows above the apex of upward-pointing V-shapes (or 5 rows below for downward V-shapes)\n4. The \"middle\" V-shape (closest to the average column position among all V-shapes) gets marked with 1 instead of 9\n\n**Identifying patterns in the test input:**\n\n- V-up at rows 5-6, cols 8-10: apex at (5, 9)\n- V-up at rows 7-8, cols 1-3: apex at (7, 2)  \n- V-up at rows 13-14, cols 3-5: apex at (13, 4)\n- V-up at rows 14-15, cols 13-15: apex at (14, 14)\n- V-down at rows 2-3, cols 8-10: apex at (3, 9)\n- L-shape at rows 2-3, cols 1-2\n- \"r\"-shape at rows 14-15, cols 8-9\n\n**Calculating marker positions:**\n- V-up (5,9): marker at (0, 9)\n- V-up (7,2): marker at (2, 2) \n- V-up (13,4): marker at (8, 4)\n- V-up (14,14): marker at (9, 14)\n- V-down (3,9): marker at (8, 9)\n\n**Determining which gets 1:**\nColumn positions: 2, 4, 9, 9, 14. Average \u2248 7.6. Column 9 is the middle position, and the V-down is the unusual pattern type, so its marker at (8,9) gets 1.\n\n```\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Algorithm for Solving the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to crack this ARC puzzle. It's about modifying a grid based on shapes and some collision logic. Here's what I've figured out:\n\n1.  **Shape Identification:** I start by identifying connected regions of the foreground color. Then, I define shapes based on 8-connectivity (which means diagonal touching counts!).\n\n2.  **Shape Orientation:**\n    *   **Symmetric:** If a shape is symmetric along a vertical axis (like the upright or downward pointing 'V' shapes in the examples), it \"points\" straight up (or down, if it's mirrored).\n    *   **Asymmetric \"Corners\" (3 pixels in a 2x2 box):** If a shape is a 2x2 block with one corner background, the direction is towards the *opposite* corner.\n\n3.  **Key Pixel Selection:**\n    *   **Symmetric:** Pick the top-most pixel.\n    *   **Corners:**  Find the \"vertex\" - the pixel with 2 connected neighbors.\n\n4.  **Beam Projection:**  From the chosen \"anchor\" pixel, calculate a \"target\" coordinate, based on the shape's orientation and a fixed distance of 5 steps.  If the shape is symmetric (like the triangle) it's a vertical shift. Asymmetric corners need the formula: `target = key_pixel + orientation_vector * 5`. The key point is always the pixel with 2 neighbors.\n\n5.  **Interactions and Rules:**  Now I have a set of projected target points, or beams, for the identified shapes.  I check each pixel on the grid:\n    *   **Empty Cell:**\n        *   If a cell receives only *one* beam, make it a marker of color 9 (maroon).\n        *   If a cell receives *multiple* beams, make it a marker of color 1 (blue).\n    *   **Occupied Cell:**\n        *   If a cell is already occupied by another shape's pixel, take its position as a target and transform the original shape to color 9.\n\nSo, in essence, I'm finding basic patterns, giving them \"direction\", and then applying collision rules where the \"beams\" collide, or hit existing shapes. The color of the beams/markers depends on if they are colliding (Blue, 1), or alone (Maroon, 9).\n\n\nThe logic for this task involves identifying \"emitters\" (connected shapes), determining their \"firing direction\" based on their geometry, and placing markers or modifying objects where the \"beams\" land.\n\n**1. Object Identification & Classification:**\nWe treat connected components of non-background colors (not 7) as objects.\n*   **Symmetric \"V\" or \"Caret\" Shapes:** These shapes point in the direction of their vertex/tip.\n    *   **Up-pointing V:** (e.g., shapes in Example 1, 2). Vertex at top. **Vector:** `(-5, 0)` (Up).\n    *   **Down-pointing V:** Vertex at bottom. **Vector:** `(+5, 0)` (Down).\n    *   **Left-pointing V:** Vertex at left. **Vector:** `(0, -5)` (Left).\n*   **Asymmetric 3-pixel \"Corner\" Shapes (in a 2x2 box):** These shapes have one corner of the 2x2 box missing. They \"fire\" diagonally towards the corner *opposite* the missing one.\n    *   **Missing Bottom-Right:** Fires Top-Left `(-5, -5)`. (e.g., Example 3 flags).\n    *   **Missing Top-Right:** Fires Bottom-Left `(+5, -5)`. (e.g., Example 1 top shape).\n    *   **Missing Top-Left:** Fires Bottom-Right `(+5, +5)`.\n    *   **Missing Bottom-Left:** Fires Top-Right `(-5, +5)`.\n    The \"Anchor\" for the beam is the vertex pixel of the shape (the one with 2 neighbors).\n\n**2. Beam Interaction Rules:**\nCalculate the target coordinate for each shape: `Target = Anchor + Vector`.\n*   **Empty Target:**\n    *   If **one** beam hits an empty cell, place a **Maroon (9)** marker.\n    *   If **two or more** beams collide at the same empty cell, place a **Blue (1)** marker.\n*   **Occupied Target:**\n    *   If a beam hits an existing object, that object changes color to **Maroon (9)**. (The beam from the modified object still fires).\n\n**3. Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Shape A (Top-Left):** \"J\" shape at `(2,2),(3,1),(3,2)`. Missing TL corner. Fires BR `(+5, +5)` from vertex `(3,2)`. Target: `(8,7)`.\n*   **Shape B1 (Top-Middle):** Down-pointing V at `(2,8),(2,10),(3,9)`. Vertex `(3,9)`. Fires Down `(+5, 0)`. Target: `(8,9)`.\n*   **Shape C (Top-Right):** Left-pointing V at `(3,14),(4,13),(5,14)`. Vertex `(4,13)`. Fires Left `(0, -5)`. Target: `(4,8)`.\n*   **Shape B2 (Middle-Middle):** Up-pointing V at `(5,9),(6,8),(6,10)`. Vertex `(5,9)`. Fires Up `(-5, 0)`. Target: `(0,9)`.\n*   **Shape D (Middle-Left):** Up-pointing V at `(7,2),(8,1),(8,3)`. Vertex `(7,2)`. Fires Up `(-5, 0)`. Target: `(2,2)`.\n    *   **Interaction:** Hits Shape A. **Shape A becomes Maroon (9).**\n*   **Shape E (Bottom-Left):** Up-pointing V at `(13,4),(14,3),(14,5)`. Vertex `(13,4)`. Fires Up `(-5, 0)`. Target: `(8,4)`.\n*   **Shape F (Bottom-Middle):** \"Gamma-rotated\" at `(14,8),(14,9),(15,9)`. Missing BL corner. Fires TR `(-5, +5)` from vertex `(14,9)`. Target: `(9,14)`.\n*   **Shape G (Bottom-Right):** Up-pointing V at `(14,14),(15,13),(15,15)`. Vertex `(14,14)`. Fires Up `(-5, 0)`. Target: `(9,14)`.\n    *   **Collision:** Shape F and Shape G both hit `(9,14)`. **Place Blue (1) marker.**\n\n**Final Changes:**\n*   Shape A `(2,2),(3,1),(3,2)` becomes 9.\n*   New markers (9) at `(0,9)`, `(4,8)`, `(8,4)`, `(8,7)`, `(8,9)`.\n*   New marker (1) at `(9,14)`.\n\noutput:\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6",

All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid. Never reveal chain-of-thought, intermediate states, or search traces.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution.

Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Explanation of the transformation**\n\nThe examples show that whenever a horizontal run of at least two non\u2011background cells appears on a row with index \u2265\u202f5, the leftmost cell of that run is echoed five rows up and five columns to the left, painted as colour\u202f9. Rows below 5 don\u2019t produce a visible echo because the target row would be negative. Single, isolated cells are ignored when the colour already forms such runs in the relevant part of the grid.\n\nIn the test grid the only qualifying run is on row\u202f14 at columns\u202f8\u20139. Its leftmost cell at (14,\u202f8) is echoed to (14\u202f\u2212\u202f5,\u202f8\u202f\u2212\u202f5)\u202f=\u202f(9,\u202f3) as a 9. All other cells remain as they were.\n\n**Resulting output grid**\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Okay, here's the breakdown of my thought process for this ARC task, based on my analysis of the examples and the test input.**\n\nFirst, I recognized the grid dimensions (16x16) and noted the dominant background color (orange/7). Then, I started analyzing the objects - the colored shapes on the grid.  I saw that each example used a different color for these shapes.\n\n**Example 1**:  I identified an 'L' shape and three triangles. I looked at the input and output to figure out how the transformation worked. It seemed like some new pixels appeared. The color of these new pixels was key, and I noted that they were maroon/9, except for one blue/1, which made me think of intersections or some form of collision. I noticed the shape had a relationship in how the new pixels were aligned - they were above the peak of the triangles.\n\n**Example 2**: I moved to the second example.  The input was tricky, with overlapping shapes. I had to pay close attention to the shapes to see if they were connected.  I saw triangles on the ground and some \"floating\" shapes above them. I checked the input data and traced connected components to get a clear picture of the shape relationships. I noticed the color of these new pixels was maroon, again.  Then I started looking for a pattern. I was looking for a pattern, and the height above the shape it seemed like there was a \"distance\" the new pixel was above the input shape.\n\n**Example 3**:  With the flags,  I realized I needed to use the input data, and look at the flags. I was looking for a rule. The shift was the key, as it wasn't the exact row. I had to trace and see if that had a pattern that continued across the other tests.\n\nThen, I started to form a hypothesis: The shape seems to be \"shooting\" something. I needed to figure out the direction.\n\nI realized:  The shape of the connected components defines a direction.\n*   Triangle points up\n*   An inverted triangle points down.\n*   The \"L\" shape, depending on the orientation, shoots accordingly. I created a rule based on what direction the new pixels needed to travel, as it depended on the shape. I wanted to see if I could create a rule.\n\n**Making the Rule** I made a rule: A connected component shoots in a direction away from its \"empty space\" like a corner. Distance is 5 (Rows) and the columns changed a bit, too.\n\n**Then came the \"Collision\" logic**. If there was another shape in the path, it would hit the shape, and stop. This also included the color changing. I used the existing, test shapes.\n\n**Applying the Rules to Test Input** I went through each object in the test input, applied my shooting and collision rule and made sure I took into account all of the color changes and marker colors.\n\n\nThe problem involves simulating \"shots\" fired by shapes in a grid, which generate markers or modify other shapes upon collision.\n\n**1. Identification of Shapes and Directions**\nThe shapes are connected components of color 6 (magenta). Each shape has a specific geometry that determines its shooting direction, similar to an arrow or a corner pointing away from its empty quadrant.\n\n*   **Shape A (Top-Left):** Pixels at `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)`. This forms a corner with the empty spot at the top-left relative to its bounds. It shoots **Down-Right (+1, +1)**. Source point: `(3,2)`.\n*   **Shape B (Top-Middle):** Pixels at `(2,8), (2,10), (3,9)`. This is an inverted triangle (V-shape) pointing down. It shoots **Down (+1, 0)**. Source point: `(3,9)`.\n*   **Shape C (Top-Right):** Pixels at `(3,14), (4,13), (5,14)`. This is an arrowhead pointing left. It shoots **Left (0, -1)**. Source point: `(4,13)`.\n*   **Shape D (Middle):** Pixels at `(5,9), (6,8), (6,10)`. This is a triangle pointing up. It shoots **Up (-1, 0)**. Source point: `(5,9)`.\n*   **Shape E (Bottom-Left):** Pixels at `(7,2), (8,1), (8,3)`. This is a triangle pointing up. It shoots **Up (-1, 0)**. Source point: `(7,2)`.\n*   **Shape F (Bottom-Right-1):** Pixels at `(13,4), (14,3), (14,5)`. This is a triangle pointing up. It shoots **Up (-1, 0)**. Source point: `(13,4)`.\n*   **Shape G (Bottom-Middle):** Pixels at `(14,8), (14,9), (15,9)`. This is a corner with the empty spot at the bottom-left. It shoots **Top-Right (-1, +1)**. Source point: `(14,9)`.\n*   **Shape H (Bottom-Right-2):** Pixels at `(14,14), (15,13), (15,15)`. This is a triangle pointing up. It shoots **Up (-1, 0)**. Source point: `(14,14)`.\n\n**2. Simulation of Shots**\nEach shape fires a projectile that travels up to **5 steps**.\n*   **Hit:** If the path intercepts another shape within 5 steps, the target shape turns Maroon (9), and no marker is created.\n*   **Marker:** If the path is clear for 5 steps, a marker of color Maroon (9) is created at the destination.\n*   **Collision:** If two shots land on the same marker spot, the marker becomes Blue (1).\n\n**3. Applying Logic to Test Input**\n*   **Shape A:** Shoots from `(3,2)` to `(8,7)`. Path is clear. **Marker at `(8,7)` (color 9).**\n    *   *Incoming Hit:* Shape E shoots from `(7,2)` Up to `(2,2)`. Path hits Shape A at `(3,2)`. **Shape A turns Maroon (9).**\n*   **Shape B:** Shoots from `(3,9)` Down to `(8,9)`. Path hits Shape D at `(5,9)`. **Shape D turns Maroon (9).** No marker.\n    *   *Incoming Hit:* Shape D shoots from `(5,9)` Up to `(0,9)`. Path hits Shape B at `(3,9)`. **Shape B turns Maroon (9).**\n*   **Shape C:** Shoots from `(4,13)` Left to `(4,8)`. Path is clear. **Marker at `(4,8)` (color 9).**\n*   **Shape D:** Hits B (see above). Hit by B (see above).\n*   **Shape E:** Shoots from `(7,2)` Up to `(2,2)`. Hits Shape A at `(3,2)`. No marker.\n*   **Shape F:** Shoots from `(13,4)` Up to `(8,4)`. Path is clear. **Marker at `(8,4)` (color 9).**\n*   **Shape G:** Shoots from `(14,9)` Top-Right to `(9,14)`. Path is clear. Target shared with H.\n*   **Shape H:** Shoots from `(14,14)` Up to `(9,14)`. Path is clear. Target shared with G.\n    *   **Intersection:** G and H both place a marker at `(9,14)`. **Marker at `(9,14)` becomes Blue (1).**\n\n**4. Final Grid Construction**\n*   Base: Original grid.\n*   Colors: Shapes A, B, and D change from 6 to 9. Shapes C, E, F, G, H remain 6.\n*   Markers: Add 9s at `(8,7)`, `(4,8)`, `(8,4)`. Add 1 at `(9,14)`.\n\noutput:\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6",

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Okay, let's break down this ARC problem. Here's my thinking process:**\n\nFirst, I need to understand the task. It's about a 16x16 grid with an orange background (7). There are patterns made of other colors. My job is to find a rule that transforms an input grid into an output grid, based on examples and a test input. I see the importance of color and positions.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n*   **Initial Shapes:** I see an L-shape (maroon, color 9) at the top-right and some maroon triangles at the bottom of the input grid.\n*   **The Output is Key:**  The output grid is where the transformation happens. I see that the L-shape and triangles remain, but there are new pixels that appear in between!\n*   **Coordiantes and Distances:** I carefully check the pixel positions (rows and columns) to understand the relationship between the shapes and the new pixels. I identify them from the input and output. I recognize the column positions of the \"peaks\" (highest points) of the bottom triangle shapes in Example 1, at columns 1, 7, and 14.\n*   **Color Discrepancy:** The middle newly appeared pixel in the output is *blue*, whereas the other two are *maroon*! This sparks my curiosity.\n*   **L-Shape and Vector:** I start thinking about the L-shape at the top of the input. I have a hunch it might have something to do with the new pixel positions, but I don't see an obvious geometric relationship. I start wondering if the L-shape \"shoots\" something, thus creating a change in the pixels that will make the pixels change color to blue.\n*   **Height Discrepency:** I can see the height difference and that the triangles are the source. There is the floating new pixel between them. It is 5 units apart from each of the triangles.\n*   **Look for Pattern**: I re-examine and write out the shapes that I found. I have the \"L\" shape on top and the \"upside down V\" shapes on the bottom. In the middle, the new floating pixels show the same pattern as the other shapes. I wonder about colors, and if the colors have anything to do with this pattern.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n\n*   **Different Shapes:** The focus of the example 2 is the upside down Vs, but I call them \"mountains\". I am looking at the output, and I see a change in color to the pixels.\n*   **Height again:** The peaks of the triangles, and they appear on the output grid 5 units above.\n*   **Missing Pixel:** The output in the grid doesn't always have one of the floating pixels! I need to understand why! Is there a missing base?\n*   **Valid Triangle Rule:** I realize, to generate a pixel at the top, a \"triangle\" must be complete, with a peak and two bases, on the same color. Only these \"peaks\" make the floating pixels.\n\nI now have a rule: if there's a triangle, with the three pixels being the same color, a new pixel of color 9 will appear 5 rows above the triangle's peak.\n\n**Back to Example 1, but with New Information:**\n\n*   **Application of New Rule:** I can now explain the new pixels in Example 1: they are 5 rows above the peaks of the triangles!\n*   **Blue Pixel Mystery:** I still need to know *why* that middle pixel is blue. I think this difference is related to the top L-shape. The L-shape could be blocking or modifying the pixel.\n*   **Shape Analysis:** I think I see a pattern to the shapes. The orientation might have something to do with something.\n\n**Example 3 Analysis:**\n\n*   **New Shapes:** In this example, I see new \"gamma\" shapes (2, 2/ 2), I also find similar shapes at the bottom.\n*   **More Output Differences:** It's the same pattern: some new pixels appear at the top. I see a shift in the position of pixels. It looks like the same shapes, but shifted.\n*   **Position Shift:** The new pixels at row 1 are shifted by a consistent amount (row and column) compared to shapes at the bottom. I identify these shifts.\n*   **Collision Rule:** It looks like there's a projectile from each shape, shifted from the original, and it can land. if there is something in the destination, the color of that thing changes (to color 9). I identify the two collision rules. I am now able to apply this \"collision rule\" to future examples.\n*   **Collision = Color Change:**\n\nThe logic for solving this task involves identifying \"shooters\" (shapes) and their corresponding \"projectiles\" (new pixels).\n\n**1. Identification of Shapes and Firing Rules:**\nWe analyze the input grid to find small patterns of non-background colors (colors other than 7). These shapes determine the direction and target of a projectile. The background is orange (7).\n\n*   **Triangle Shapes (Hollow or filled 3-pixel pyramids):**\n    *   **Up-Pointing Triangle:** Peak at `(r, c)`, base at `(r+1, c-1)` and `(r+1, c+1)`.\n        *   **Action:** Fires a projectile UP. Target: `(r-5, c)`.\n    *   **Down-Pointing Triangle:** Peak at `(r, c)`, base at `(r-1, c-1)` and `(r-1, c+1)`.\n        *   **Action:** Fires a projectile DOWN. Target: `(r+5, c)`.\n    *   **Left-Pointing Triangle:** Peak at `(r, c)`, base at `(r-1, c+1)` and `(r+1, c+1)`.\n        *   **Action:** Fires a projectile LEFT. Target: `(r, c-5)`.\n    *   **Right-Pointing Triangle:** (Not present in test, but logically implied) Fires RIGHT. Target: `(r, c+5)`.\n\n*   **Gamma/L Shapes (3-pixel corners):**\n    *   These shapes fill a 2x2 bounding box with 3 pixels, leaving one corner empty. The *filled* corner determines the direction.\n    *   **Top-Left Filled (`XX` / `X.`):** Fires diagonally UP-LEFT. Target: `(r-5, c-5)` from the top-left pixel.\n    *   **Bottom-Left Filled (`X.` / `XX`):** Fires diagonally DOWN-LEFT. Target: `(r+5, c-5)` from the bottom-left pixel. (Seen in Ex 1).\n    *   **Top-Right Filled (`XX` / `.X`):** Fires diagonally UP-RIGHT. Target: `(r-5, c+5)` from the top-right pixel.\n    *   **Bottom-Right Filled (`.X` / `XX`):** Fires diagonally DOWN-RIGHT. Target: `(r+5, c+5)` from the bottom-right pixel.\n\n**2. Interaction Rules:**\n*   **Standard Projectile:** Creates a pixel of color **9** (maroon) at the target location.\n*   **Collision (Projectile vs Projectile):** If two projectiles land on the same empty coordinate, the resulting pixel is color **1** (blue).\n*   **Collision (Projectile vs Shape):** If a projectile lands on an existing shape, the projectile does not appear as a separate pixel; instead, the **entire shape** changes its color to **9**.\n\n**3. Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Shape A (Top-Left):** Pixels `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)` (Color 6).\n    *   Type: **Bottom-Right Filled L**. Corner at `(3,2)`.\n    *   Vector: `(+5, +5)`. Target: `(8, 7)`.\n*   **Shape B1 (Top-Middle):** Pixels `(2,8), (2,10), (3,9)` (Color 6).\n    *   Type: **Down-Pointing Triangle**. Peak at `(3,9)`.\n    *   Vector: `(+5, 0)`. Target: `(8, 9)`.\n*   **Shape B2 (Top-Middle):** Pixels `(5,9), (6,8), (6,10)` (Color 6).\n    *   Type: **Up-Pointing Triangle**. Peak at `(5,9)`.\n    *   Vector: `(-5, 0)`. Target: `(0, 9)`.\n*   **Shape C (Left):** Pixels `(3,14), (4,13), (5,14)` (Color 6).\n    *   Type: **Left-Pointing Triangle**. Peak at `(4,13)`.\n    *   Vector: `(0, -5)`. Target: `(4, 8)`.\n*   **Shape D (Left, below A):** Pixels `(7,2), (8,1), (8,3)` (Color 6).\n    *   Type: **Up-Pointing Triangle**. Peak at `(7,2)`.\n    *   Vector: `(-5, 0)`. Target: `(2, 2)`.\n    *   **Conflict:** Target `(2,2)` is part of **Shape A**.\n    *   **Result:** **Shape A** turns color **9**.\n*   **Shape E (Bottom-Left):** Pixels `(13,4), (14,3), (14,5)` (Color 6).\n    *   Type: **Up-Pointing Triangle**. Peak at `(13,4)`.\n    *   Vector: `(-5, 0)`. Target: `(8, 4)`.\n*   **Shape F (Bottom-Right):** Pixels `(14,8), (14,9), (15,9)` (Color 6).\n    *   Type: **Top-Right Filled Gamma**. Corner at `(14,9)`.\n    *   Vector: `(-5, +5)`. Target: `(9, 14)`.\n*   **Shape G (Bottom-Right):** Pixels `(14,14), (15,13), (15,15)` (Color 6).\n    *   Type: **Up-Pointing Triangle**. Peak at `(14,14)`.\n    *   Vector: `(-5, 0)`. Target: `(9, 14)`.\n    *   **Conflict:** Both F and G target `(9, 14)`.\n    *   **Result:** Pixel at `(9, 14)` becomes color **1** (Blue).\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\n1.  Copy input grid.\n2.  Change Shape A (pixels at `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)`) to color **9**.\n3.  Add new pixel **9** at `(0, 9)`.\n4.  Add new pixel **9** at `(4, 8)`.\n5.  Add new pixel **9** at `(8, 4)`.\n6.  Add new pixel **9** at `(8, 7)`.\n7.  Add new pixel **9** at `(8, 9)`.\n8.  Add new pixel **1** at `(9, 14)`.\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Understanding the transformation**\n\n1. **Common properties**\n   - All grids are 16\u00d716 with background color `7`.\n   - There is one *object color* different from 7 in each task:\n     - Example 1: `9`\n     - Example 2: `0`\n     - Example 3: `2`\n     - Test: `6`\n   - These colored cells form several identical **3\u2011cell \u201c\u0393\u201d-shaped (L\u2011shaped) pieces** along the bottom of the grid (and sometimes elsewhere).\n\n2. **What the output does**\n\n   Looking at the drawn image (and matching with the numeric grids):\n\n   - The bottom L\u2011shapes **stay exactly the same**.\n   - For each such L\u2011shape, a **single cell of a new color** is placed **directly above the \u201ccorner\u201d of the L** (i.e., above the cell that has two neighbors of the object color).\n   - The new color used for these added cells is:\n     - `1` in Example 1 (cyan in the drawing),\n     - `9` in Examples 2 and 3,\n     - and must analogously be `9` in the test (since `9` is the \u201cmarker\u201d color used for added cells).\n\n   Concretely, each L looks like:\n\n   ```\n   a b\n   a .\n   ```\n\n   (`a` = object color, `.` = background).  \n   The \u201ccorner\u201d cell is the lower\u2011left `a`.  \n   The rule is: **place a `9` one step above that corner**, i.e., at the position of the top\u2011left `a` minus one row.\n\n   In the text grids, this is exactly what you see:\n   - Example 2: the cluster of black L\u2011shapes near the bottom generates a scatter of magenta (`9`) cells some rows above them.\n   - Example 3: the red L\u2011shapes generate magenta (`9`) marker cells above; one of the L\u2011shapes itself is recolored, but the consistent effect is still: \u201ca `9` is placed above the corner of an L\u201d.\n\n3. **Apply to the test input**\n\n   In the test grid, color `6` forms such \u0393\u2011shapes.  \n   We identify all L\u2011shapes of `6` and mark the cell **above each corner** with `9`.\n\n   The `6` cells in the test input (row, column, 0\u2011based):\n\n   - Row2: (2,2), (2,8), (2,10)\n   - Row3: (3,1), (3,2), (3,9), (3,14)\n   - Row4: (4,13)\n   - Row5: (5,9), (5,14)\n   - Row6: (6,8), (6,10)\n   - Row7: (7,2)\n   - Row8: (8,1), (8,3)\n   - Row13: (13,4)\n   - Row14: (14,3), (14,5), (14,8), (14,9), (14,15)\n   - Row15: (15,9), (15,13), (15,15)\n\n   From these we locate the \u0393\u2011shapes of 6s.  \n   The consistent pattern of them (as in the image) is:\n\n   - One L whose corner is at (3,1)  \u2192 place `9` at (2,1)\n   - One L whose corner is at (3,9)  \u2192 place `9` at (2,9)\n   - One L whose corner is at (3,14) \u2192 place `9` at (2,14)\n   - One L whose corner is at (14,3) \u2192 place `9` at (13,3)\n   - One L whose corner is at (14,8) \u2192 place `9` at (13,8)\n   - One L whose corner is at (14,15)\u2192 place `9` at (13,15)\n\n   (These are the positions directly above the lower\u2011left cell of each \u0393\u2011shape.)\n\n   No existing `7` at those positions needs to be preserved; they are simply overwritten by `9`.\n\n4. **Constructing the output grid**\n\n   Start from the test input and change only the six positions listed above to `9`.  \n   All other cells stay the same.\n\n**Final output grid**\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,9,6,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,6,7,7,7,9,7  \n7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,9  \n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6",

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to identify the transformation pattern:\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\n1. **Example 1:** Has V-shaped patterns (pointing up) at the bottom and an L-shaped pattern at top-right. The output adds markers 5 rows above each V's apex. The V that's not associated with the unique L-pattern gets marker \"1\" instead of \"9\".\n\n2. **Example 2:** Has only V-shaped patterns (all same type). All markers are \"9\" placed 5 rows above each apex.\n\n3. **Example 3:** Has L-shaped patterns. Markers are placed 5 rows up AND 5 columns left from each L's reference point. When an isolated pattern's marker overlaps with another pattern, that pattern changes to \"9\".\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\nIdentifying patterns:\n- **L-shape at rows 2-3, cols 1-2** (. 6 / 6 6)\n- **V pointing down at rows 2-3, cols 8-10** (6 . 6 / . 6 .)\n- **V pointing up at rows 5-6, cols 8-10** - apex at (5,9)\n- **V pointing up at rows 7-8, cols 1-3** - apex at (7,2)\n- **V pointing up at rows 13-14, cols 3-5** - apex at (13,4)\n- **L-shape at rows 14-15, cols 8-9**\n- **V pointing up at rows 14-15, cols 13-15** - apex at (14,14)\n\n**Marker Placement (5 rows above apex for V's):**\n- V at (5,9) \u2192 marker at (0,9) = 9\n- V at (7,2) \u2192 marker at (2,2) = 9 (overwrites existing 6)\n- V at (13,4) \u2192 marker at (8,4) = 1 (isolated, not associated with unique patterns)\n- V at (14,14) \u2192 marker at (9,14) = 9\n- L at (14,8) \u2192 marker at (9,3) = 9 (5 up, 5 left)\n\nThe V at (13-14, 3-5) is the most isolated pattern (column range 3-5 doesn't overlap with any unique patterns at cols 1-2 or 8-10), so its marker becomes \"1\".\n\n**Output:**\n```\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n```",

All other cells remain as in the input.\n\nApplying this to the test grid (with \\(c_{\\min}=1\\)) yields the following output:\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6",

For each such cell at \\((r,c)\\), look at \\((r\\!-\\!5,c\\!-\\!5)\\). If that is inside the grid and empty, place a 9 there.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Look for the repeated \u201cobject\u201d shape**\n\n   In each example there is one non\u2011background colour (call it `B`) on an orange background `7`.\n\n   The coloured cells form many small 3\u2011cell patterns, but only *one* kind of pattern is repeated several times:\n\n   * In Examples 1 and 2 the repeated pattern is a **V\u2011shape** of three cells  \n\n     ```\n       B          (apex at (r,c))\n      B B   ->  cells at (r+1,c-1) and (r+1,c+1)\n     ```\n   * In Example 3 the repeated pattern is an **L\u2011shape** of three cells  \n\n     ```\n     B B        (apex at (r,c))\n     B      ->  cells at (r,c+1) and (r+1,c)\n     ```\n\n   We treat this most frequent 3\u2011cell pattern as the \u201cmotif\u201d for the task.\n\n2. **How the motif is transformed**\n\n   For each occurrence of the motif we look at its **apex cell** `(r,c)` (the one that touches both other cells).\n\n   We then move from the apex **five cells in the open direction of the angle**:\n\n   * For a V\u2011shape (open upward), the open direction is straight up, so the target is  \n     `(r\u20115, c)`.\n   * For an L\u2011shape with arms to the right and down (open to the upper\u2011left), the open\n     direction is up\u2011left, so the target is `(r\u20115, c\u20115)`.\n\n   If the target position lies inside the grid:\n\n   * If that target cell is just background, we colour it `9`.\n   * If that target cell is itself the apex of another motif, we recolour that entire\n     second motif (its three cells) to `9`.  \n     (This happens in Example 3: the central L is projected onto the apex of a top L,\n     so that whole top L becomes colour `9`.)\n\n   Checking against the examples:\n\n   * **Example 1:** three V\u2011apexes at row 14 create three new cells at row 9, same\n     columns. (One of them is coloured `1` in the provided output, but geometrically\n     all three come from this rule.)\n   * **Example 2:** six V\u2011apexes at rows 10\u201314 project to the six new `9`s exactly\n     five rows above.\n   * **Example 3:** nine L\u2011apexes project diagonally up\u2011left by 5; eight give single\n     `9`s, and the one that lands on another L\u2011apex recolours that whole L to `9`.\n\n3. **Apply the rule to the test input**\n\n   The test has background `7` and object colour `6`.  \n   We search for repeated 3\u2011cell motifs.\n\n   The repeated motif is the **V\u2011shape** (same as Examples 1 and 2):\n\n   A V\u2011shape apex at `(r,c)` satisfies:\n   * cell `(r,c)` is `6`\n   * cells `(r+1, c\u20111)` and `(r+1, c+1)` are also `6`.\n\n   Scanning the grid gives four such V\u2011apexes:\n\n   1. `(5,9)` with base at `(6,8)` and `(6,10)`\n   2. `(7,2)` with base at `(8,1)` and `(8,3)`\n   3. `(13,4)` with base at `(14,3)` and `(14,5)`\n   4. `(14,14)` with base at `(15,13)` and `(15,15)`\n\n   For a V\u2011shape, the projection is straight up by 5, so the target cells are:\n\n   1. `(0,9)`\n   2. `(2,2)`\n   3. `(8,4)`\n   4. `(9,14)`\n\n   All four targets are inside the grid. None of them is the apex of another V\u2011shape, so we simply colour those cells `9` (overwriting any previous value; at `(2,2)` we overwrite a `6`).\n\n4. **Output grid**\n\nHere is the final output grid after applying these four changes:\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7  \n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7  \n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Test Input Solution - ARC Task Analysis**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where the goal is to figure out the rule. I am given 3 examples and hints and I need to figure out what happens when you shoot a pixel.\n\n*   **Initial Analysis**\n    *   The grids are 16x16.\n    *   There's an orange background (7).\n    *   There are objects of a different color. They are made of non-7 pixels.\n    *   The hints say objects are shooting \"projectiles\".\n    *   Need to find out what counts as an object.\n    *   Need to understand the projectile and its behavior: how far it goes, what it does when it hits an object or edge.\n*   **Hint Breakdown:**\n    *   \"Projectiles emit upwards.\"\n    *   \"The projectile has a fixed range and stops.\"\n    *   \"If hits something, it recolors. Else creates a new pixel.\"\n    *   \"Stops at the grid edge.\"\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   There are maroon (9) objects at the bottom.\n    *   I need to locate objects in all of the Examples, and then trace the pixel's path.\n    *   Example 1 Output shows new maroon pixels above the original objects. The first pixel had an unexpected result with a blue pixel.\n    *   The Blue pixel is weird. What is the rule behind it?\n    *   The shooting color is probably the original color of the ship.\n    *   I will trace the shots.\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Objects are gray (0).\n    *   New maroon (9) pixels are produced at the same distance, 5. So the range is 5 pixels.\n    *   The projectile is always Maroon (9) or maybe not.\n    *   The first example has weird color. Example 2's projectiles are 9. In Example 1, projectiles are 9 and 1. Why?\n    *   Example 1 had some blue pixels. So I need to find the rule of the color.\n    *   It seems the input color doesn't match the output color.\n*   **Example 3:**\n    *   Objects are red (2).\n    *   There are new pixels above.\n    *   Here's a clue: objects recolored. The red blocks shot diagonal Up-Left!\n    *   Objects can be recolored by a pixel. Is range always 5? Or greater?\n    *   If a pixel from the bottom row hits an object at top left then...\n    *   The first pixel went from `(14, 5)` -> `(9, 0)`. Range is 5 and direction is Up-Left, which is different from Examples 1 & 2.\n    *   The column number might be important, and/or the pixel itself.\n*   **Refining the Theory and making conclusions:**\n    *   Object's color is important, and each color has a direction.\n    *   **Gray (0):** Shoots **Straight Up**. Color is 9, Range 5.\n    *   **Maroon (9):** Shoots **Straight Up**. Color is 9. Range 5. But why the Blue (1)?\n    *   **Red (2):** Shoots **Diagonal Up-Left**. Color is 9. Range is 5. And it recolors.\n    *   **Shooting Behavior:** Top-Left-most pixel. Range 5.\n*   **Refining the Theory:**\n    *   Now the question is where does a \"Shooter\" point come from.\n    *   Now need to decide what the shooter type is for different objects.\n    *   Also, where does the color 1 come from in the first example?\n    *   This is the biggest question. Is it a typo, or a subtle rule? The color 1 doesn't fit! I'll come back to this.\n    *   I need to come up with a rule for the Magenta pixel.\n    *   \"Object emits a single pixel upwards\" implies either straight up or Up-Left.\n    *   Is Up-Right possible?\n    *   If Up-Right: Red (2) and Magenta (6) are symmetric. 6 is Up-Right. So color might be the opposite on the other side of the row. I will see if that's the case.\n    *   If Magenta is Up-Right: Magenta object in Test Input shoots to `(0, 4)`.\n    *   I will try to work with a \"Standard Project\n\nTo solve this ARC task, we need to analyze the interaction between \"objects\" and \"projectiles\" as described in the hints and observed in the examples.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\n1.  **Object Identification:** Objects are connected components of non-background pixels (background is 7).\n2.  **Shooting Mechanism:** Each object emits a single pixel \"projectile\" from its **highest point** (minimum row index). If the object has a flat top, the **leftmost** pixel at that height acts as the source.\n3.  **Projectile Trajectory:** The direction of the projectile depends on the color of the source object.\n    *   **Gray (0) and Maroon (9):** Shoot **Straight Up**.\n    *   **Red (2):** Shoots **Diagonally Up-Left**.\n    *   **Magenta (6):** Based on the symmetry with Red (2) and the arrangement in the test input, Magenta (6) shoots **Diagonally Up-Right** (decreasing row, increasing column).\n4.  **Range and Behavior:**\n    *   The projectile travels a maximum of **5 steps**.\n    *   **Hit:** If the projectile encounters another object (non-7 pixel) along its path (including the final step), it stops immediately and **recolors the entire target object to Maroon (9)**.\n    *   **Miss:** If the projectile travels the full 5 steps without hitting anything, it becomes a new **Maroon (9)** pixel at the destination `(start_row - 5, start_col + 5)`.\n    *   **Edge:** If the projectile hits the grid edge before traveling 5 steps (either row < 0 or col >= 16), it stops at the last valid position on the grid edge and becomes a **Maroon (9)** pixel there.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\nThe input contains **Magenta (6)** objects. We apply the **Diagonal Up-Right** trajectory.\n\n*   **Identified Shooters (Highest points) & Simulations:**\n    1.  `(2,2)` $\\rightarrow$ Path `(1,3), (0,4)` (Edge).

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this puzzle, I need to understand how objects emit \"projectiles\" upward.\n\n## Analysis of Examples\n\n**Example 1 & 2:** V-shaped objects (like `  9 / 9   9`) emit projectiles **straight up** from their tip (highest point). The projectile travels 5 rows up. If nothing is hit, a new pixel (color 9) appears at that location.\n\n**Example 3:** L-shaped objects (like `2 2 / 2`) emit projectiles **diagonally** (up-left for left-corner L shapes). When a projectile hits another object within range, it **recolors that entire object to 9** instead of creating a new pixel.\n\n## Identifying Objects in Test Input\n\n**Upward V-shapes (emit straight up):**\n1. (2,2), (3,1), (3,2) - tip at (2,2)\n2. (7,2), (8,1), (8,3) - tip at (7,2)  \n3. (5,9), (6,8), (6,10) - tip at (5,9)\n4. (13,4), (14,3), (14,5) - tip at (13,4)\n5. (14,14), (15,13), (15,15) - tip at (14,14)\n\n**Downward V-shape (doesn't emit):**\n- (2,8), (2,10), (3,9)\n\n**L-shape (emits diagonally up-right due to mirror orientation):**\n- (14,8), (14,9), (15,9) - corner at (14,9)\n\n**Isolated points:** (3,14), (4,13), (5,14)\n\n## Calculating Projectiles\n\n1. **V at (2,2):** Goes up, stops at edge \u2192 9 at **(0,2)**\n2. **V at (7,2):** Goes up 5 rows, **hits V-shape 1** at row 2 \u2192 Recolors shape 1 to 9\n3. **V at (5,9):** Goes up, **hits downward V** at row 3 \u2192 Recolors that shape to 9\n4. **V at (13,4):** Goes up 5 rows to row 8 \u2192 9 at **(8,4)**\n5. **V at (14,14):** Goes up 5 rows to row 9 \u2192 9 at **(9,14)**\n6. **L-shape at (14,9):** Goes diagonally up-right 5 steps \u2192 9 at **(9,14)**\n\n## Final Output\n\n```\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task Summary - My Approach**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with solving an ARC problem using a few examples. The core seems to be transforming an input grid of integer \"colors\" into an output grid. Most of the grid is orange (`7`), but there are other colored \"objects\". The problem is to understand the rules of this transformation.\n\nHere's my breakdown of what I'm thinking:\n\n*   **Initial Setup:** I've noticed the input grids are mostly orange (`7`), with \"objects\" of other colors. The goal is to figure out how these objects change the grid.\n*   **Key Hints:** The hints are very specific, and I'm going to follow them step-by-step:\n    1.  Objects emit a single pixel \"projectile\" upwards from their highest point.\n    2.  The projectile has a fixed maximum range.\n    3.  If nothing gets hit, it stops and becomes a pixel at the limit.\n    4.  If it hits an object, it changes the object's color.\n    5.  If it hits the grid edge before the limit, it stops at the edge.\n*   **Analyzing Example 1:**\n    *   I'm studying the first example in detail, looking at the input and the output.\n    *   I'm focusing on the objects and how they're identified. I'm grouping connected pixels (ignoring orange) to define an object.\n    *   I'm checking the outputs. Something seems to be happening to a `9` at (14,7). There is an emission from that point.\n    *   I'm comparing rows and coordinates to figure out the range. It looks like the range is 5 (14 - 9 = 5).\n    *   I'm thinking about the color of the projectiles, whether it is fixed, or if there is a color mapping.\n    *   I'm confused about why the 9 in (14,7) resulted in a 1 (blue) in (9,7) and why some emissions produced `9`s while others gave the `1`.\n    *   I am noticing a pattern! The color of the object matters.\n*   **Generalizing from Example 1:**\n    *   There is some color mapping, 9 becomes 1.\n    *   Object color (the \"emitter\") matters, and the type (color) of the objects can determine the emitted pixel color.\n*   **Example 2 Analysis:**\n    *   Now, I am looking at another example, with different colors. It reinforces that all objects have the same range of 5.\n    *   It seems the input color directly influences the outcome color.\n*   **Example 3 Deeper Dive:**\n    *   Example 3 introduces a new pattern: the emitter color is 2. The result has 9s but they do not have the same column indexes.\n    *   I'm thinking that if the emission stops without hitting anything, then the emission will keep its color.\n    *   There seems to be an unexpected column \"shift\" in the output that I can't explain. I am going back to the rules.\n    *   \"Projectiles go up, upwards\".\n    *   I think maybe the output rows are not in the right positions, or maybe I am interpreting the numbers incorrectly!\n    *   After checking the grid closely, it looks like there is a TOP-LEFT diagonal.\n    *   I am thinking of the color to shape combination: `2` (red) produces a Top-Left diagonal.\n    *   I test that rule and it is the key! The emitter is not only a color, but a shape! Flat Top (horizontal pixels) goes Diagonal, Single Pixel goes Up.\n*   **Test Input:**\n    *   Now, I'm at the real test! I am finding the objects.\n    *   I define the tops of the objects and if they are single or not.\n    *   I will verify: UP if single pixel, Top-Left Diagonal if Flat.\n    *   The problem is the edge. Does the projectile create a pixel there?\n    *   A pixel is created if the projectile reaches its limit, the edge.\n    *   In the case of objects closer to the edge, the hit is registered as an absence of emission. The object doesn't shoot.\n    *   I need to consider the case of hits.\n    *   If there's a hit, the \"projectile\" color changes the target object.\n    *   Based on how examples and text are, it will be an UP pixel or a Diagonal pixel, so I simulate them and start creating the new image.\n    *   It's\n\nTo solve this task, I identified the rules governing the behavior of the objects and their \"projectiles\" based on the provided examples.\n\n**Rules Inferred:**\n1.  **Object Identification**: Connected components of non-background (non-7) pixels are treated as objects. Connectivity includes diagonals (8-connectivity).\n2.  **Projectile Emission**:\n    *   Each object emits a single projectile from its **highest point** (minimum row index).\n    *   If an object has a single highest pixel (pointed top), the projectile moves **Straight Up**.\n    *   If an object has multiple highest pixels (flat top), the projectile moves **Diagonally Top-Left** (slope 1).\n    *   **Close-to-Edge Constraint**: Objects located within the projectile's range of the top edge (Row < Range) do not produce a visible pixel at the edge (or simply don't shoot).\n3.  **Projectile Properties**:\n    *   **Color**: The projectile and its effects are color `9`.\n    *   **Range**: The fixed maximum range is **5 steps**.\n4.  **Interaction**:\n    *   **Hit**: If the projectile's path intersects another object, it stops, and the **entire target object is recolored** to `9`. No new pixel is created at the impact site.\n    *   **Miss**: If the projectile travels the full range without hitting anything, it creates a single pixel of color `9` at the limit (Source Row - 5, Source Col - [0 or 5 depending on direction]).\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Object Analysis**:\n    1.  **Obj 1** (Top-Left): Tops at `(2,2)`. Pointed. Shoots Up. Too close to edge (Row 2 < 5). No pixel created.\n    2.  **Obj 2** (Top-Middle 'V'): Tops at `(2,8)` and `(2,10)`. Pointed tops (separated). Shoots Up. Too close to edge. No pixel created.\n    3.  **Obj 3** (Top-Right): Top at `(3,14)`. Pointed. Shoots Up. Too close to edge. No pixel created.\n    4.  **Obj 4** (Middle-Left, inverted V): Top at `(5,9)`. Pointed. Shoots Up.\n        *   Path: `(4,9), (3,9)`.\n        *   Hit: At `(3,9)`, it hits **Obj 2**.\n        *   Effect: **Obj 2** is recolored to `9`.\n    5.  **Obj 5** (Middle-Left-Low): Top at `(7,2)`. Pointed. Shoots Up.\n        *   Path: `(6,2)...(2,2)`.\n        *   Hit: At `(2,2)`, it hits **Obj 1**.\n        *   Effect: **Obj 1** is recolored to `9`.\n    6.  **Obj 6** (Bottom-Left): Top at `(13,4)`. Pointed. Shoots Up.\n        *   Range: 5. Target: `(8,4)`.\n        *   Path is clear.\n        *   Effect: Creates pixel `9` at `(8,4)`.\n    7.  **Obj 7** (Bottom-Middle): Top at `(14,8), (14,9)`. **Flat Top**. Shoots **Diagonal Top-Left** (from leftmost top `14,8`).\n        *   Range: 5.\n        *   Path: `(13,7), (12,6), (11,5), (10,4), (9,3)`.\n        *   Path is clear.\n        *   Effect: Creates pixel `9` at `(9,3)`.\n    8.  **Obj 8** (Bottom-Right): Top at `(14,14)`. Pointed. Shoots Up.\n        *   Range: 5. Target: `(9,14)`.\n        *   Path is clear.\n        *   Effect: Creates pixel `9` at `(9,14)`.\n\n**Final Changes:**\n*   **Obj 1** pixels `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)` become `9`.\n*   **Obj 2** pixels `(2,8), (2,10), (3,9)` become `9`.\n*   New pixel `9` at `(8,4)`.\n*   New pixel `9` at `(9,3)`.\n*   New pixel `9` at `(9,14)`.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Reasoning / rule inferred**\n\n1. **Background and objects**\n\n   - Background color is `7`.\n   - An *object* is a connected component (8\u2011connectivity) of non\u20117 cells.\n   - In the training examples, these objects are small 3\u2011cell patterns.  \n   - Each object can fire a single \u201cprojectile\u201d.\n\n2. **Projectile direction and range**\n\n   - Every object has a **highest point**: the cell in that object with the smallest row index; if there are multiple, take the leftmost (smallest column).\n   - From training examples we infer a **fixed projectile range** `L = 5` steps.\n   - The direction depends on the *shape type* of the object. The only diagonal case we see is the specific 2\u00d72 \u201cL\u201d shape used in Example 3:\n     - Normalized coordinates `{(0,0), (0,1), (1,0)}` (top\u2011left, top\u2011right, bottom\u2011left filled; bottom\u2011right empty).\n     - For that shape, projectiles travel **diagonally up\u2011left** (`dr = -1, dc = -1`).\n   - **All other object shapes (including all shapes present in this test)** fire **straight up** (`dr = -1, dc = 0`), as in Examples 1 and 2.\n\n3. **Firing constraints**\n\n   - If the object\u2019s highest point is **less than 5 rows from the top** (i.e., `row < 5`), in the examples such objects do not produce visible projectiles; we treat them as **not firing**.\n   - Otherwise, from the highest point we step cell by cell in the direction `(dr, dc)` up to 5 steps or until the grid edge would be crossed.\n\n4. **Collision vs. free flight**\n\n   Along the path (excluding the starting cell):\n\n   - If we hit a cell belonging to **another object** (any non\u20117 cell from a *different* component) before we have stepped 5 times:\n     - **No projectile pixel** is created.\n     - Instead, the **entire hit object is recolored** to the projectile color.\n   - If we do not hit any object:\n     - The projectile **stops at the last valid cell** reached (either 5 steps, or sooner if the edge would be crossed) and that cell becomes a **projectile pixel**.\n\n5. **Projectile color**\n\n   - In the examples, the projectile (and recoloring) color is consistently `9`.\n   - We use `9` as the projectile color here as well.\n   - In this test, all objects are color `6`, so recoloring turns some 6\u2011components into 9, and new lone 9 pixels appear where projectiles stop.\n\n6. **Apply to the test grid**\n\n   First, identify 6\u2011colored objects via 8\u2011connectivity. There are eight 3\u2011cell components:\n\n   - **A**: {(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)}\n   - **B**: {(2,8), (2,10), (3,9)}\n   - **C**: {(3,14), (4,13), (5,14)}\n   - **D**: {(5,9), (6,8), (6,10)}\n   - **E**: {(7,2), (8,1), (8,3)}\n   - **F**: {(13,4), (14,3), (14,5)}\n   - **G**: {(14,8), (14,9), (15,9)}\n   - **H**: {(14,14), (15,13), (15,15)}\n\n   (Coordinates are given as (row, col), 0\u2011based.)\n\n   **Determine which fire** (highest point row \u2265 5):\n\n   - A: highest point (2,2) \u2192 row 2 < 5 \u2192 **does not fire**.\n   - B: highest (2,8) \u2192 row 2 < 5 \u2192 **does not fire**.\n   - C: highest (3,14) \u2192 row 3 < 5 \u2192 **does not fire**.\n   - D: highest (5,9)  \u2192 row 5 \u2265 5 \u2192 **fires, vertical**.\n   - E: highest (7,2)  \u2192 row 7 \u2265 5 \u2192 **fires, vertical**.\n   - F: highest (13,4) \u2192 row 13 \u2265 5 \u2192 **fires, vertical**.\n   - G: highest (14,8) \u2192 row 14 \u2265 5 \u2192 **fires, vertical**.\n   - H: highest (14,14)\u2192 row 14 \u2265 5 \u2192 **fires, vertical**.\n\n   **Projectile traces (vertical, up to 5 steps)**\n\n   - **D** from (5,9):  \n     Path: (4,9) \u2192 (3,9) \u2192 (2,9) \u2192 (1,9) \u2192 (0,9)  \n     At (3,9) we hit object **B**.  \n     \u21d2 Recolor all of B to 9.

Inferred rule from the examples\n\n### 1.1. Objects and background\n\n- The background color is 7 (it fills most of each grid).\n- Every non\u20117 cell belongs to some **object**.\n- Objects are defined using **8\u2011connectivity**: cells of the same color that touch horizontally, vertically, or diagonally are in the same object.\n\n### 1.2. \u201cProjectile\u201d behavior\n\nFor each object:\n\n1. **Classify its shape** in its minimal bounding box (all examples and the test use small 3\u2011pixel shapes).  \n   Only two shape types actually matter for the test:\n\n   - **V\u2011shape** (three pixels):\n\n     In its bounding box (2 rows \u00d7 3 columns) it looks like:\n     ```\n     . x .\n     x . x\n     ```\n     (coordinates relative to top-left of box: (0,1), (1,0), (1,2))\n\n   - **\u0393\u2011shape with leg on the right** (\u201cgamma\u2011right\u201d):\n\n     In its bounding box (2 rows \u00d7 2 columns) it looks like:\n     ```\n     x x\n     . x\n     ```\n     (coords: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1))\n\n   (A mirror \u201cgamma\u2011left\u201d `xx / x.` also appears in Example 3; its direction is up\u2011left, but that isn\u2019t needed for new directions in the test\u2014only to understand the mechanism.)\n\n2. **Choose the emission point (\u201chighest point\u201d)**:\n   - Find the **minimum row index** of the object (topmost row).\n   - Among cells on that row:\n     - For V\u2011shapes: that row has a single pixel; that pixel is the emission point.\n     - For gamma\u2011shapes: that row has two pixels;  \n       - For **gamma\u2011left** (`xx / x.`): use the **left** of the two.  \n       - For **gamma\u2011right** (`xx / .x`): use the **right** of the two.\n\n3. **Choose the direction according to shape type**:\n   - V\u2011shape: projectile goes **straight up**: direction vector `(-1, 0)`.\n   - Gamma\u2011left (`xx / x.`): projectile goes **up\u2011left**: `(-1, -1)`.\n   - Gamma\u2011right (`xx / .x`): projectile goes **up\u2011right**: `(-1, +1)`.\n\n4. **Range and collision**:\n   - The projectile has a **fixed maximum range of 5 steps**.\n   - Starting at the emission point, move step by step in the chosen direction:\n     - Step 1: position = `p1 = p0 + d`\n     - Step 2: `p2 = p0 + 2d`\n     - \u2026\n     - Step 5: `p5 = p0 + 5d`\n   - If at any step the position would go **outside the grid**, the projectile is **aborted entirely** (no new pixel, no recolor).\n   - Otherwise, as you step:\n     - If you first land on a cell that is **not background 7** (i.e., some other object), then:\n       - The projectile **hits that target object**.\n       - The entire target object is **recolored to 9**.\n       - No \u201cendpoint\u201d pixel is created for this projectile.\n     - If you reach step 5 without hitting any object:\n       - The projectile **stops at that step\u20115 cell**, and you paint that cell **9**.\n\n5. **All projectiles are computed on the original grid**:\n   - You determine hits and endpoints based on the original object layout.\n   - Then you:\n     - Recolor all hit objects to 9.\n     - Add all endpoint pixels as 9.\n   - These can happen simultaneously (an object can both shoot and be recolored by someone else, as seen in Example 3).\n\nThis procedure reproduces Example 2 perfectly, and Example 3 including the diagonal hit where the middle gamma object recolors another. (Example 1 has a single anomalous pixel color, but the spatial behavior matches.)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Apply the rule to the test input\n\n### 2.1.

            "Full raw LLM response": "To reproduce the seen behaviour I first treat any non\u2011background colour as an \u201cobject\u201d. Objects are the 8\u2011connected components of non\u20117 cells. For each object I find its highest point (smallest row, and in a tie the leftmost column). To decide which way it \u201cshoots\u201d, I look at the horizontal distribution of the object relative to that point: compute the mean column offset of the object\u2019s cells relative to the highest point. If that mean is positive the shot drifts one column to the left each step, if it is negative it drifts one column to the right, and if it is zero it goes straight up; the row component of the motion is always \u22121 (upwards). Projectiles have a fixed range of 5 steps; if an edge would be reached sooner, only that many steps are taken and the shot stops at the edge.\n\nAll shots are considered simultaneously on the original grid. For each shot, take its endpoint after the allowed number of steps. If that endpoint was originally part of an object, recolour that entire target object to the projectile colour (9) and do not create an extra pixel; otherwise place a single 9 at the endpoint. Being hit does not prevent an object from firing its own shot.\n\nApplying this to the test input, the 6\u2011clusters are identified, their directions and endpoints computed as above, and one cluster is hit and recoloured.

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "To reproduce the transformation seen in the examples you can proceed as follows:\n\n* Treat every non\u2011`7` region as an object, using 8\u2011connectedness to group pixels.\n* Determine the leftmost column index among all object pixels; call this `minCol`.\n* For each object, find its \u201chighest\u201d pixel (smallest row index; if several, take the leftmost). From this origin, project a point 5 cells upward: `row_target = origin_row \u2013 5`, and shift the column by the global offset: `col_target = origin_col \u2013 minCol`.\n* If the target lies outside the grid, do nothing. If it lies on another object, recolor that whole target object to `9`. Otherwise place a `9` at the target cell. The original objects remain unchanged.\n\nApplying this rule to the test grid, the leftmost object column is at `col=1`. The objects with origins at (2,2), (2,8), and (3,14) are too near the top to project. The remaining origins project to empty cells at (0,8), (2,1), (9,3), (10,7) and (10,13), where `9`s are added.\n\nThe completed output grid is:\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,6,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this ARC-AGI problem:**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with these image pairs, and my job is to crack the pattern.  First, I'm focusing on the basics: the consistent orange background. Then, I'm diving into each input-output pair, noting shapes, colors, and their transformations. Input 1 reveals three maroon 'T' shapes at the bottom and an 'L' at the top-right. The output has these unchanged, but adds new pixels: maroon and one blue. The arrangement of these new pixels is key - right above the 'T' shapes.  This blue pixel is suspicious. Why blue when everything else is maroon? That is a recurring question.\n\nInput 2 introduces a \"landscape\" of black pyramids.  The output shows maroon pixels above each pyramid peak.  Okay, so maybe it's not the same pixel color as the origin object. I notice the maroon pixels 'shoot' from the peaks upwards. Input 3 gives me red \"Gamma\" shapes.  The output again adds maroon pixels. Some shapes change color to maroon. Aha! \"Shooting\" is the emerging pattern, with objects sending up projectiles. But why the blue pixel in the first example?  \n\nThe key is this: objects \"shoot\" maroon projectiles, but the one in Output 1 is blue. So it seems some object is different. Is the blue result a color for a specific case, or a pattern I am missing? Maybe a \"type\" or \"color\" or shape can determine the pixel's result color. I need to keep the \"shooting\" analogy in mind while accounting for this anomaly. The projectiles either hit the top of the grid or something else. I keep revisiting this question. \n\nObserving the distances, and how the dots \"float\" in some examples, makes me re-evaluate the \"projectile\" distance. Is there a limited range? Inputs 1 & 2 suggest there is one, while Input 3 hits the top.  And the fact that the third shape changes color in Input 3?  A collision! When a projectile hits, the target changes color. The blue pixel is an anomaly that I can't definitively explain. I can infer there are different object classes.\n\nThe key insights:\n\n*   **Objects shoot projectiles upwards.**\n*   **Projectiles travel a fixed distance or hit something.**\n*   **The collision turns the object's color to the projectile's.**\n\nSo I've got this rule: Shoot up. Hit top? Stay. Hit another object? Re-color. No obstacle. Fixed range. The blue pixel I am going to write that it's a color rule!  I need a way to present this. My summary must be super clear. Okay, I think I've got it. Let's draft this up.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided image containing three input-output pairs, here is the breakdown of the transformation rules.\n\n### **1. Describe the observable structures**\n\n*   **Background:** A solid orange grid.\n*   **Objects:**\n    *   **Input 1:** Three small maroon pyramid-like shapes (3 pixels wide at base, 1 pixel on top) at the bottom edge. One floating maroon L-shape in the top-right quadrant.\n    *   **Input 2:** A complex \"landscape\" of black pyramid shapes along the bottom, varying in height.\n    *   **Input 3:** A row of four red \"gamma\" shapes (hook-like) near the top. One additional red gamma shape near the bottom-right.\n*   **Changes (Input \u2192 Output):**\n    *   **Added Pixels:** New single pixels appear above the existing shapes.\n        *   In Output 1, there are three new pixels: Maroon, Blue, Maroon. They are floating in the middle of the empty space.\n        *   In Output 2, there are many new maroon pixels floating above the black pyramids. They follow the contour of the pyramids (higher pyramid = higher pixel).\n        *   In Output 3, there are maroon pixels at the very top edge of the grid. There is also a change in the objects themselves.\n    *   **State Change (Recoloring):** In Output 3, one of the previously red gamma shapes (the third one in the top row) has turned dark maroon.\n*   **Preservation:** The original position and shape of the source objects generally remain (except for the color change in Input 3).\n\n### **2. Identify transformation categories**\n\n*   **Object movement:** Absent (objects stay, but \"projectiles\" move).\n*   **Object recoloring:** **Present** (Input 3 shows a shape changing color).\n*   **Bordering / outlining:** Absent.\n*   **Filling holes or cavities:** Absent.\n*   **Removing noise / extracting main shape:** Absent.\n*   **Copying / pasting / repositioning:** **Present** (creating new pixels at offsets).\n*   **Using a key anchor location:** **Present** (the top peak of existing shapes).\n*   **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors:** Maybe (determining projectile color).\n*   **Size-based filtering:** Absent.\n*   **Symmetry or reflection:** Absent.\n*   **Growth, dilation, shrinking:** Absent.\n*   **Cluster \u2192 icon mapping:** Maybe (peak \u2192 single pixel).\n\n### **3. Extract the key non-obvious insights**\n\n1.  **Projectiles with Limited Range:** The new pixels seem to be \"shot\" upwards from the highest point of the source objects. However, they don't always reach the top. In Input 1 and 2, they stop in mid-air (floating). This implies a **fixed range** or travel distance limit (e.g., travel 5 pixels up and stop).\n2.  **Interaction vs. Termination:**\n    *   If the projectile hits the top wall within its range (Input 3, top row), it settles at the wall.\n    *   If the projectile runs out of range (Input 1 & 2), it settles in mid-air.\n    *   **Crucial:** If the projectile hits *another object* within its range (Input 3, bottom shape shooting up at the 3rd top shape), it **doesn't** create a new pixel. Instead, it **recolors the object it hit**.\n3.  **Path Checking:** In Input 1, the top-right L-shape does *not* get hit by the pyramid below it. The new pixel appears *below* the L-shape. This confirms the projectile ran out of range before it could collide. In contrast, Input 3's bottom shape is vertically closer to the target, leading to a successful collision/recolor.\n4.  **Source-Dependent Output Color:** While most projectiles are Maroon (from Black and Red sources), Input 1 produces a **Blue** pixel from the middle pyramid. This implies the source objects possess distinct properties (possibly different color codes not easily distinguished in the image, or a specific rule for the center object) that determine the \"payload\" color.\n\n### **4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)**\n\nThe transformation simulates objects \"shooting\" a single pixel straight up from their highest point. This projectile travels a fixed distance (e.g., 4-5 cells).\n\n*   **Case A (Free Space):** If the projectile travels the full distance without hitting anything, it solidifies as a single pixel at that maximum range.\n*   **Case B (Wall):** If the top boundary is closer than the maximum range, the pixel solidifies at the boundary.\n*   **Case C (Collision):** If the projectile encounters another object in its path, it disappears and \"infects\" that object, changing the target object's color to the projectile's color (Maroon).\n\n*Note on Colors:* The color of the projectile is generally Maroon, but exceptions exist (Blue in Input 1), likely depending on the specific properties (color/type) of the source object.\n\n### **5. List checks you would perform when solving**\n\n1.  **Measure Vertical Offset:** Calculate the exact $Y_{new} - Y_{peak}$ for the floating pixels in Input 1 and 2. Verify if this delta is consistent (e.g., always 4 pixels).\n2.  **Check Collision Coordinates:** In Input 3, verify that the bottom shape's column exactly aligns with the recolored shape's column.\n3.  **Verify Range Logic:** Check if the L-shape in Input 1 is located at a distance $> \\text{Range}$ from the pyramid below it (explaining why it wasn't hit). Check if the target shape in Input 3 is located at a distance $\\le \\text{Range}$.\n4.  **Source Color Analysis:** Inspect the raw grid values of the middle pyramid in Input 1. Is it a different integer value than its neighbors? This would explain the Blue output.\n\n### **6. Summarize final insights**\n\nHINT_START\n*   Objects emit a single pixel \"projectile\" upwards from their highest point.\n*   The projectile has a **fixed maximum range**; if it doesn't hit anything, it stops and becomes a pixel at that limit.\n*   If the projectile hits another object within that range, it **recolors the target object** instead of creating a new pixel.\n*   If the grid edge is encountered before the limit, the pixel stops at the edge.\nHINT_END",

Background: 16x16 field of color 7.\n2. Color 0 Sprites: Small, 3-pixel upward-pointing triangles/pyramids.\n3. Color 2 Sprites: 3-pixel inverted 'L' shapes (top-left corner blocks).\n4. Color 9 Sprites: Small clusters, often 'L' shaped or linear.\n5. Color 6 Sprites: Irregular small pixel groups.\n6. Color 1 Object: Isolated single pixel.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Identify 3-pixel sprites: Up-Triangles move marker -5 rows; Down-Triangles move +5 rows; Left-Triangles move -5 cols.\n2. Identify 3-pixel L-shapes (Corners): Top-Left L moves marker (-5, -5); Top-Right L moves (-5, +5); Bottom-Right L moves (+5, +5).\n3. Markers are Color 9. If two markers collide at the same empty pixel, the result is Color 1.\n4. If a marker lands on an existing shape, that shape changes to Color 9. Otherwise, markers are placed on the background.\n5. Original shapes persist; only those hit by markers change color.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**My thought process for this ARC task centered around understanding the rules of a pixel transformation game. Here's a summary:**\n\nI started by observing that the input grids were always 16x16 with an orange (7) background and various small \"sprites\" of different colors. I noticed that the output seemed to involve the creation of new sprites or changes to existing ones, but I needed to figure out the underlying logic.\n\nMy initial approach involved comparing the input and output grids and noting changes.  I then moved on to analyzing the provided \"Object Descriptions\" and \"Transformation Description\", but I approached these with some skepticism, and made sure to verify them against the examples. I noticed the rules involved specific shapes like triangles and L-shapes, and their color. My first hypothesis was related to \"markers\" which were projected by the original shapes, and possibly collided and formed 1's or changed the color of existing shapes to 9s.\n\nI meticulously analyzed each example, starting with Example 1. I tried to relate the sprites to outputs to derive my own rules, and not rely on the initial description only. Initially, the presence of just one colored pixel in the output puzzled me, but I eventually connected the dots with the concept of \"collisions\" leading to the creation of a '1' pixel. I observed that the shapes looked like specific \"L\" and Up-Triangle structures.\n\nWith Example 2, I noticed that all sprites were Up-Triangles and followed this movement rule:  move a marker at `(TipRow - 5, TipCol)`.  But this didn't explain the logic in Ex 1.\n\nI went back to Example 1, suspecting that the \"markers\" from a color-9 Up-Triangle might not shoot, and it was the L-shape, that shot a marker.  I eventually arrived at the rule: \"Simple shapes (Triangles) of Color 9 do not produce markers; Complex shapes (Ls) of Color 9 do\". This was crucial.\n\nI realized that the shape's orientation was crucial. I spent quite a while determining which direction the shape's \"corner\" was in.\n\nAfter that, Example 3 confirmed that other shapes (of other colors) produce markers and move.\n\nI then generalized the different moves of different shapes: Up, Down, Left, Right and L-Shapes. The L-shapes could have one of four possible orientations, and the direction and the coordinate change depended on its corner. I deduced that Top-Left L means move (-5, -5), Bottom-Right L means (+5, +5) and so on.\n\nFinally, I applied all the derived rules to the Test Input. Based on my analysis and the hypothesis that ONLY color 9s did not \"shoot\", I arrived at the final solution.\n\nTo solve this challenge, I analyzed the provided examples and derived the transformation rules governing the movement of \"markers\" from source sprites to target locations. Here is the step-by-step logic:\n\n1.  **Identify Sprites**: The input grid contains background pixels (Color 7) and sprite pixels (Color 6 in the test case). I identified connected components of 3 pixels to determine their shape type.\n    *   **Up-Triangle**: A pyramid shape (1 pixel on top, 2 on bottom). Action: Shoot a marker **-5 rows** (up) from the tip.\n    *   **Down-Triangle**: An inverted pyramid (2 pixels on top, 1 on bottom). Action: Shoot a marker **+5 rows** (down) from the tip.\n    *   **Left-Triangle**: A triangle pointing left (1 pixel on left, 2 on right). Action: Shoot a marker **-5 columns** (left) from the tip.\n    *   **L-Shapes**: 3 pixels filling a corner of a 2x2 box. The \"corner\" is the pixel with two neighbors.\n        *   **Top-Left L (Corner at TL)**: Moves marker **(-5 rows, -5 cols)**.\n        *   **Top-Right L (Corner at TR)**: Moves marker **(-5 rows, +5 cols)**.\n        *   **Bottom-Left L (Corner at BL)**: Moves marker **(+5 rows, -5 cols)**.\n        *   **Bottom-Right L (Corner at BR)**: Moves marker **(+5 rows, +5 cols)**.\n\n2.  **Determine Markers for Test Input**:\n    *   **Sprite 1** (Rows 2-3, Cols 1-2): Shape is a **Bottom-Right L**. Corner at (3,2). Target: (3+5, 2+5) = **(8, 7)**.\n    *   **Sprite 2** (Rows 2-3, Cols 8-10): Shape is a **Down-Triangle**. Tip at (3,9). Target: (3+5, 9) = **(8, 9)**.\n    *   **Sprite 3** (Rows 3-5, Cols 13-14): Shape is a **Left-Triangle**. Tip at (4,13). Target: (4, 13-5) = **(4, 8)**.\n    *   **Sprite 4** (Rows 5-6, Cols 8-10): Shape is an **Up-Triangle**. Tip at (5,9). Target: (5-5, 9) = **(0, 9)**.\n    *   **Sprite 5** (Rows 7-8, Cols 1-3): Shape is an **Up-Triangle**. Tip at (7,2). Target: (7-5, 2) = **(2, 2)**.\n    *   **Sprite 6** (Rows 13-14, Cols 3-5): Shape is an **Up-Triangle**. Tip at (13,4). Target: (13-5, 4) = **(8, 4)**.\n    *   **Sprite 7** (Rows 14-15, Cols 8-9): Shape is a **Top-Right L**. Corner at (14,9). Target: (14-5, 9+5) = **(9, 14)**.\n    *   **Sprite 8** (Rows 14-15, Cols 13-15): Shape is an **Up-Triangle**. Tip at (14,14). Target: (14-5, 14) = **(9, 14)**.\n\n3.  **Apply Marker Rules**:\n    *   **Collision**: Markers from Sprite 7 and Sprite 8 land on the same empty pixel **(9, 14)**. The result is **Color 1** (Blue).\n    *   **Hit Shape**: The marker from Sprite 5 lands on **(2, 2)**, which is part of Sprite 1. This causes the entire Sprite 1 to change to **Color 9** (Maroon).\n    *   **Empty Space**: All other markers land on empty background pixels (Color 7). These pixels become **Color 9** (Maroon).\n        *   (0, 9) becomes 9.\n        *   (4, 8) becomes 9.\n        *   (8, 4) becomes 9.\n        *   (8, 7) becomes 9.\n        *   (8, 9) becomes 9.\n\n4.  **Final Grid Construction**:\n    *   Start with Input Grid.\n    *   Change Sprite 1 pixels at (2,2), (3,1), (3,2) to 9.\n    *   Place 9s at (0,9), (4,8), (8,4), (8,7), (8,9).\n    *   Place 1 at (9,14).\n\n**Output Grid:**\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6",

Background: 16x16 field of color 7.\n2. Color 0 Sprites: Small, 3-pixel upward-pointing triangles/pyramids.\n3. Color 2 Sprites: 3-pixel inverted 'L' shapes (top-left corner blocks).\n4. Color 9 Sprites: Small clusters, often 'L' shaped or linear.\n5. Color 6 Sprites: Irregular small pixel groups.\n6. Color 1 Object: Isolated single pixel.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Identify 3-pixel sprites: Up-Triangles move marker -5 rows; Down-Triangles move +5 rows; Left-Triangles move -5 cols.\n2. Identify 3-pixel L-shapes (Corners): Top-Left L moves marker (-5, -5); Top-Right L moves (-5, +5); Bottom-Right L moves (+5, +5).\n3. Markers are Color 9. If two markers collide at the same empty pixel, the result is Color 1.\n4. If a marker lands on an existing shape, that shape changes to Color 9. Otherwise, markers are placed on the background.\n5. Original shapes persist; only those hit by markers change color.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

Background: 16x16 field of color 7.\n2. Color 0 Sprites: Small, 3-pixel upward-pointing triangles/pyramids.\n3. Color 2 Sprites: 3-pixel inverted 'L' shapes (top-left corner blocks).\n4. Color 9 Sprites: Small clusters, often 'L' shaped or linear.\n5. Color 6 Sprites: Irregular small pixel groups.\n6. Color 1 Object: Isolated single pixel.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Identify 3-pixel sprites: Up-Triangles move marker -5 rows; Down-Triangles move +5 rows; Left-Triangles move -5 cols.\n2. Identify 3-pixel L-shapes (Corners): Top-Left L moves marker (-5, -5); Top-Right L moves (-5, +5); Bottom-Right L moves (+5, +5).\n3. Markers are Color 9. If two markers collide at the same empty pixel, the result is Color 1.\n4. If a marker lands on an existing shape, that shape changes to Color 9. Otherwise, markers are placed on the background.\n5. Original shapes persist; only those hit by markers change color.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

Background: 16x16 field of color 7.\n2. Color 0 Sprites: Small, 3-pixel upward-pointing triangles/pyramids.\n3. Color 2 Sprites: 3-pixel inverted 'L' shapes (top-left corner blocks).\n4. Color 9 Sprites: Small clusters, often 'L' shaped or linear.\n5. Color 6 Sprites: Irregular small pixel groups.\n6. Color 1 Object: Isolated single pixel.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Identify 3-pixel sprites: Up-Triangles move marker -5 rows; Down-Triangles move +5 rows; Left-Triangles move -5 cols.\n2. Identify 3-pixel L-shapes (Corners): Top-Left L moves marker (-5, -5); Top-Right L moves (-5, +5); Bottom-Right L moves (+5, +5).\n3. Markers are Color 9. If two markers collide at the same empty pixel, the result is Color 1.\n4. If a marker lands on an existing shape, that shape changes to Color 9. Otherwise, markers are placed on the background.\n5. Original shapes persist; only those hit by markers change color.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "To solve this, first identify all 3\u2011pixel sprites in the test grid. There are four up\u2011pointing triangles (apex at (5,9), (7,2), (13,4), (14,14)), one down\u2011pointing triangle (apex at (3,9)), one left\u2011pointing triangle (apex at (4,13)), and two L\u2011shapes: a bottom\u2011right corner at (3,2) and a top\u2011right corner at (14,9). Each sprite produces a marker displaced by 5 cells in the direction dictated by its type: up triangles go 5 rows up, down triangles 5 rows down, left triangles 5 columns left; L\u2011shapes move to (-5,-5) for top\u2011left, (-5,+5) for top\u2011right, (+5,+5) for bottom\u2011right (and by symmetry +5,\u20115 for bottom\u2011left). Markers are colour 9 unless two land on the same empty background cell, in which case a 1 is placed. If a marker lands on an existing shape cell, the entire shape is recoloured to 9.\n\nApplying this to the test input, the markers land at (0,9), (2,2), (8,4), (9,14), (8,9), (4,8), (9,14), (8,7). The two at (9,14) collide on empty background, producing a 1 there. The marker at (2,2) hits the L\u2011shape at (2,2),(3,1),(3,2), recolouring that shape to 9. All other markers sit on background. The rest of the original 6\u2019s persist.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6",

                "response": "**Analyzing the Grid Content**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at these grids, and the goal is to describe the *types* of objects within them, without inferring any relationships or transformations. Just a straight-up inventory, using only the provided numeric color values. Seems simple enough. Let's see...\n\nFirst off, it's clear that the background is predominantly color 7 in all of them. Got that. Now, I notice some other colors pop out, forming distinct shapes. Let's see what we've got in Grid 1. It's mostly 0s in the bottom half. They kind of form inverted \"V\" shapes or triangles. Okay, small triangles.\n\nGrid 2 is different. It's got the background 7. There are 2s, but they are forming shapes like inverted \"L\"s or gamma shapes. It's like a 2x2 box, but the top-right corner is missing. So it is an inverted gamma, or a bracket. These things are scattered around.\n\nMoving onto Grid 3, we have color 9. Again, 7 background, which is the constant. The 9s are, again, clustered. They look like small \"L\" shapes too. Some of them seem like just lines of a single pixel.\n\nThen, Grid 4 mixes things up - 2 and 9 together. Hmm, a composite of the patterns. This suggests the patterns are reusable blocks.\n\nIn Grid 5, it is a mix of 0s and 9s. We saw 0 as triangles. They're still there.\n\nGrid 6 has color 6. These are irregular clusters. Hmm, looks like some 2-3 pixel connections that create shapes. Looks like we have some \"L\" shapes again or small groups.\n\nAnd Grid 7 is more of the same with color 9, but there's a single 1 too. Okay, so that's the full set of elements.\n\nSo, let me synthesize this: There's a uniform color 7 background. Then we have these colored objects, all fairly small.\n\n*   **Color 0:** These are inverted triangular, or pyramid shapes (one pixel on top, two below)\n*   **Color 2:** Inverted L or gamma shape, or like a bracket (2 pixels horizontal, 1 underneath).\n*   **Color 9:** Little \"L\" shapes, or little lines/dots, irregular clusters.\n*   **Color 6:** More irregular clusters of 2-4 pixels (possibly Ls).\n*   **Color 1:** A single isolated pixel, appears only once.\n\nThey're all scattered around the grids, with the same background. Positions vary but they seem mostly in the bottom half. Size is also consistent, with boxes of roughly 2x2 or 3x3 dimensions. This should be a concise and complete description!\n\n\nThe grids contain a background field populated by several distinct types of small, geometric objects.\n\n**Background**\n*   **Attribute:** The canvas for every grid is a uniform field of color 7. All other objects exist within this 16x16 space.\n\n**Foreground Objects**\nThe foreground objects are small clusters of pixels in various colors. They generally fall into specific shape categories based on their color:\n\n1.  **Color 0 Objects (Triangular Sprites):**\n    *   **Appearance:** These objects typically form a small triangular or pyramid shape pointing upwards.\n    *   **Structure:** They usually consist of a single pixel on top centered over two pixels on the row immediately below (a 3-pixel cluster).\n    *   **Distribution:** They appear in clusters, often positioned in the lower half of the grid.\n\n2.  **Color 2 Objects (Corner/Gamma Sprites):**\n    *   **Appearance:** These objects resemble an inverted 'L' or the top-left corner of a box.\n    *   **Structure:** They occupy a 2x2 area, typically consisting of two pixels horizontally on the top row and one pixel on the bottom row (aligned to the left).\n    *   **Distribution:** These are arranged in rows or specific formations, primarily in the lower sections of the grids.\n\n3.  **Color 9 Objects (L-Shapes and Clusters):**\n    *   **Appearance:** These appear as small clusters, often resembling 'L' shapes or small lines.\n    *   **Structure:** A common form is a 3-pixel 'L' (one pixel on top, two on the bottom). Sometimes they appear as disconnected dots or lines depending on the grid.\n    *   **Distribution:** Scattered across various quadrants, with significant presence in corners or edges.\n\n4.  **Color 6 Objects (Irregular Clusters):**\n    *   **Appearance:** These are small, irregular groupings of pixels.\n    *   **Structure:** They vary more than the other shapes, forming diagonal lines, 'L' shapes, or small blobs within a 3x3 area.\n    *   **Distribution:** Scattered throughout the grid, appearing less ordered than the color 2 objects.\n\n5.  **Color 1 Object:**\n    *   **Appearance:** A single pixel.\n    *   **Distribution:** Appears as a solitary point in one of the grids.\n\n<objects_summary>\n1.

                "response": "**Thought Process for Analyzing Grid Transformations**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to figure out how these input grids become output grids, right? And then, use that knowledge on a new input. Got it. Let's dig in. I need to look at these examples carefully, and identify the transformations.\n\nFirst, Example 1. Hmmm, background is orange, and some maroon 9s scattered about. There's a neat 'L' shape and some little 'V' or triangle shapes at the bottom. The output... the 'L' stays put, good. But the 'V' shapes... what's going on with them? The middle one seems to have generated a *blue* pixel at Row 9. Wait, let me check the coordinates... is there some shift or rotation here?\n\nOkay, so the middle 'V' (or triangle, technically) at the bottom has a 9 at Row 14, at column 7, 6, and 8. Output has a 1 at Row 9, Column 7. So, that's a five-row shift upwards. But, *why* is the middle pixel blue (1), not maroon (9)? And only for the middle triangle? What's special about it? Maybe a symmetry thing? Let me see if the pixels around the transformed pixel are changed in the input.\n\nOkay, checking the text, input Row 9 is all 7s. Row 14 contains the apex of the bottom triangles. Output Row 9 has \"7,9,7,7,7,7,7,1,7...\" Interesting. The 9s match the apexes. The middle triangle is symmetric. Ah-ha. A new pixel on Row 9 is being created above the apex of each of the lower triangles. I have an idea. This seems like a new object is being created and it's color depends on something.\n\nLet me jot that down... Transformation: *Create a marker pixel above the triangles.* The shift is +5 rows (up). But why that color change? Maybe, each column has its rules? Maybe I should analyze the color of the output. Let's move onto Example 2.\n\nIn Example 2, there are objects of color 0 in rows 10-15. Another three pixel shape: (10,1), (11,0), (11,2). An up-pointing triangle. Let's see... also (12,4), (13,3), (13,5). Again, an up-pointing triangle. Now, reading, (12,7), (12,9) maybe (14,7) which makes the shape a three pixel group (14, 7), (15,6), (15,8). Output: All the shapes have generated a new pixel at color 9. Rows 5-9 have changed. It is another upward-pointing shape with color zero.\n\nThe markers seem to have color 9. So the transformation of color 0 object, is output as color 9 at 5 rows above the apex. So, a general rule. But, is the marker single pixel? Let's check coordinates again. Row 5,1 looks to be +5-rows. Another one at Row 6 which is +5. So, yes.\n\nOk, let's look at Ex 3. Input has pixels with color 2. Now the shape at (6,5) and (6,6) and (7,5). An L-shape. Transformation? Output Row 1?\n\n(6,5) and (6,6) became (1, 0) and (1, 3). Transformation Shift (-5, -5). Wait, maybe translation based on the coordinates? Okay, so all objects were shifted by (-5, -5). Is there a new object? Color 9? Is something else going on?\n\nOk, going back: All three examples produce some output pixels (markers), and shift upward or left-upward. However, the color is not always the same as the input pixels (color).\nWhat is going on with color \"1\"? Let me analyze the color output. So, 9, 7. But in Example 1, there's that anomalous pixel with the color \"1\" at the middle bottom triangle! That pixel at the center, the output one, has a color \"1\". Maybe it is there to signify some collision? Let's check Example 2: Nothing, it is always the color \"9\" there. OK.\n\nOK, so now I am thinking: Let's formulate the hypotheses:\n(1) Identify the shape of the group.\n(2) Move up (or up and left) based on the *shape*, not just the\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided examples and the test input, here are the identified transformations:\n\n1.  **Shape Identification and Projection:**\n    The system identifies small, 3-pixel objects (sprites) of a specific color (e.g., 9, 0, 2, or 6) against the background (color 7). Each shape type projects a \"marker\" (a single pixel) to a new location based on its geometry:\n    *   **Upward-Pointing Pyramid (Triangle Up):** A cluster of 3 pixels (Apex at top, two base pixels below). It projects a marker **5 rows up** from the apex.\n    *   **Downward-Pointing Pyramid (Triangle Down):** A cluster of 3 pixels (Base at top, Apex below). It projects a marker **5 rows down** from the apex.\n    *   **Left-Pointing Arrow/Pyramid:** A cluster of 3 pixels (Apex left, base vertical right). It projects a marker **5 columns left** from the apex.\n    *   **Corner / L-Shapes:** A cluster of 3 pixels occupying 3 corners of a 2x2 square. These project a marker diagonally based on the quadrant they occupy (moving away from their occupied center or towards the \"missing\" corner's direction).\n        *   *Top-Left Occupied (Missing Bottom-Right):* Moves **5 rows up and 5 columns left** (from Example 3).\n        *   *Top-Right Occupied (Missing Bottom-Left):* Moves **5 rows up and 5 columns right** (seen in Test Input).\n        *   *Bottom-Right Occupied (Missing Top-Left):* Moves **5 rows down and 5 columns right** (seen in Test Input).\n\n2.  **Marker Properties:**\n    *   **Standard Color:** The projected marker is **Color 9** (Maroon), regardless of the source shape's color (except as noted below).\n    *   **Collision Rule:** If two markers are projected to the same coordinate, the resulting pixel is **Color 1** (Blue).\n    *   **Interaction with Existing Objects:** If a marker lands on a pixel already occupied by a shape, that shape changes its color to **Color 9**. The shape retains its form but is overwritten by the marker's color influence. The marker is effectively absorbed into the shape.\n\n3.  **Source Object Persistence:**\n    *   The original shapes remain in the grid at their original positions.\n    *   They retain their original color (e.g., 6) unless \"hit\" by a marker as described above.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Shape at (5, 9) [Triangle Up]:** Projects marker to (0, 9).\n*   **Shape at (7, 2) [Triangle Up]:** Projects marker to (2, 2). This location is occupied by the \"Corner\" shape described below.\n*   **Shape at (2, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2) [Corner Bottom-Right]:** This shape is \"hit\" by the marker from (7, 2), so it changes from Color 6 to **Color 9**. This shape itself projects a marker (move Down 5, Right 5) from its vertex (3, 2) to **(8, 7)**.\n*   **Shape at (13, 4) [Triangle Up]:** Projects marker to **(8, 4)**.\n*   **Shape at (3, 9) [Triangle Down]:** Projects marker (move Down 5) from apex (3, 9) to **(8, 9)**.\n*   **Shape at (4, 13) [Triangle Left]:** Projects marker (move Left 5) from apex (4, 13) to **(4, 8)**.\n*   **Shape at (14, 14) [Triangle Up]:** Projects marker to **(9, 14)**.\n*   **Shape at (14, 8), (14, 9), (15, 9) [Corner Top-Right]:** Projects marker (move Up 5, Right 5) from vertex (14, 9) to **(9, 14)**.\n*   **Collision:** The markers from the Triangle Up at (14, 14) and the Corner Top-Right at (14, 9) both land on **(9, 14)**. This creates a **Color 1** pixel at (9, 14).\n\n<transformation_summary>\n1. Identify 3-pixel sprites: Up-Triangles move marker -5 rows; Down-Triangles move +5 rows; Left-Triangles move -5 cols.\n2.

If two markers collide at the same empty pixel, the result is Color 1.\n4. If a marker lands on an existing shape, that shape changes to Color 9. Otherwise, markers are placed on the background.\n5.

Background: 16x16 field of color 7.\n2. Color 0 Sprites: Small, 3-pixel upward-pointing triangles/pyramids.\n3. Color 2 Sprites: 3-pixel inverted 'L' shapes (top-left corner blocks).\n4. Color 9 Sprites: Small clusters, often 'L' shaped or linear.\n5. Color 6 Sprites: Irregular small pixel groups.\n6. Color 1 Object: Isolated single pixel.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. Identify 3-pixel sprites: Up-Triangles move marker -5 rows; Down-Triangles move +5 rows; Left-Triangles move -5 cols.\n2. Identify 3-pixel L-shapes (Corners): Top-Left L moves marker (-5, -5); Top-Right L moves (-5, +5); Bottom-Right L moves (+5, +5).\n3. Markers are Color 9. If two markers collide at the same empty pixel, the result is Color 1.\n4. If a marker lands on an existing shape, that shape changes to Color 9. Otherwise, markers are placed on the background.\n5. Original shapes persist; only those hit by markers change color.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."

Object types include: single isolated pixels (colors 1, 9), V-shaped/chevron patterns of 3 pixels (colors 0, 6, 9), and L-shaped/corner patterns of 3 pixels (colors 2, 6, 9). Objects vary in color, position, orientation, and can repeat multiple times within a grid.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. For V-shaped patterns pointing down: place marker (color 9) 5 rows directly above apex; the V-shape closest to horizontal center (column 7.5) gets marker color 1 when a unique shape exists\n2. For L-shaped patterns: place marker (color 9) at position (row-5, left_column-5); the center-most L-shape is changed entirely from original color to 9\n3. Unique/variant shapes (different orientation or type) serve as indicators but don't receive markers\n4. When marker position overlaps existing shape pixel, overwrite with 9\n5. Background color 7 is preserved except where markers are placed\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Dissection**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task. The goal is to predict the output grid based on a given input and some examples. I immediately notice the grid size: 16x16, with orange (7) background and various small \"objects\" sprinkled around. It's time to dive into the examples and try to understand the underlying logic.\n\n**Example 1: Shape Identification and Marker Rule Attempt**\n\nExample 1 immediately throws some V-shaped objects at me. The input has what *looks* like a V-shape pointing down in a few places. The output seems to replicate those shapes and add a few new pixels. The new pixels are all maroon (9), which is interesting. It also appears there's an L-shaped pattern.\n\nI focus on coordinates for a bit, trying to understand the shape of the V. Eventually, I nail down that it's more of an inverted V - Apex at the top, opening down. Then I see some L shapes. There are three V-shapes on one side, and then an L-Shape on the other side. This immediately makes me wonder if there's a spatial rule.\n\nI compare the input and output coordinates of the V shapes. I see a shift in the row coordinates, a consistent -5 rows shift in the apex coordinate. I make a note about the new color (9) of the new pixel. The L-shape doesn't seem to have new pixels around it, which leads me to think that rule doesn't involve the L-shape. The provided description talks about V-shaped patterns \"pointing down\". My shapes are pointing UP! This makes me pause and double-check, as I have an error.\n\n**Deeper Dive into Shapes, Coordinates, and Prompt Ambiguity**\n\nLet's look at the other shapes. Examining Example 2 reveals more. I find what looks like L shapes, and again, some more V-shapes (but *again* inverted/pointing up). Now I see there is also a pixel that is a color 1. I look back at Example 1 for this condition: \"the V-shape closest to horizontal center (column 7.5) gets marker color 1 when a unique shape exists\".\n\nExample 2 seems to be missing the L shape from Example 1, but I confirm that all the newly added pixels are all 9. There are also a few more new inverted Vs, and there are a bunch of rows of 0, 7s and some 9s. I notice that the pattern is inverted: The Apex is above the two lines. The prompt keeps saying \"V-shaped pattern pointing down\". Is the prompt wrong?\n\nLet's look more closely.\n\nI list out the colors and find a pattern in terms of column numbers. I calculate distances and see that the closest V, closest to column 7.5, is tied with another column. The color of newly added pixels confirms my -5 row shift. I can't confirm the colors. The explanation for Example 1 explains how an L-shape is a condition. This doesn't make sense because the shapes are not pointing down.\n\n**Unraveling the Mystery: Inverted V and the \"Pointing Down\" Conundrum**\n\nHere, I stop and try to clarify this weirdness. The text says \"V-shaped pattern pointing down\" but the V shapes are `/\\`. Perhaps \"pointing down\" means the *opening* of the V is down, not the direction of the V itself? If so, this applies to the Exs.\n\nI start counting to double-check shapes in Example 2, and then I note each shape. I try to organize the shapes in a logical way, but I have a bit of trouble because the Ls are mixed in with other shapes. There are different configurations, but they seem pretty similar to the Examples. The rule to generate the colors is -5 for the top.\n\nI re-examine the outputs of Example 2. I have to find the \"unique\" shape. There are *a lot* of shapes in Ex 2, and no L shape. This means that there aren't *unique* shapes. I also confirm what's unique (there's only one L shape), and everything adds up. So all of these 9s are from -5 shift on the row. I re-read and discover that the rule is only about generating colors for the V shapes and moving them up on the grid.\n\n**Example 3: Enter the L-Shape Rule and Overlapping Markers**\n\nExample 3 introduces L-shaped patterns, and here is where things get interesting. I see a bunch of L-shapes in the input, clustered together, and a bunch of 9s in the output. The description says \"place marker (color 9) at position (row-\n\nThe problem asks us to identify specific shapes in the grid and place markers based on their positions. There are two main types of shapes of interest: V-shaped patterns (specifically `/\\` orientation, apex at the top) and L-shaped patterns. The test input contains \"variant\" shapes (different orientations) which affect the coloring of the markers but do not receive markers themselves.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Grid for Shapes:**\n    We scan the grid for objects made of the color 6 (Magenta).\n\n    *   **Object 1:** Located at pixels (2,2), (3,1), (3,2). This forms a corner pattern, but its orientation is bottom-right (`. X / X X`). This is a variant L-shape. It serves as an indicator but does not receive a marker.\n    *   **Object 2:** Located at pixels (2,8), (2,10), (3,9). This is a V-shape pointing down (`\\/`). This is a variant V-shape. It serves as an indicator.\n    *   **Object 3:** Located at pixels (3,14), (4,13), (5,14). This is a diagonal line pattern.\n    *   **Object 4 (Target V-Shape):** Apex at (5,9), Legs at (6,8) and (6,10). This is a `/\\` shape (V pointing up/opening down). This is a target shape.\n    *   **Object 5 (Target V-Shape):** Apex at (7,2), Legs at (8,1) and (8,3). This is a `/\\` shape. This is a target shape.\n    *   **Object 6 (Target V-Shape):** Apex at (13,4), Legs at (14,3) and (14,5). This is a `/\\` shape. This is a target shape.\n    *   **Object 7:** Located at (14,8), (14,9), (15,9). This is a top-right L-pattern (`XX / .X`). This is a variant L-shape.\n    *   **Object 8 (Target V-Shape):** Apex at (14,14), Legs at (15,13) and (15,15). This is a `/\\` shape. This is a target shape.\n\n2.  **Determine Markers:**\n    The rule for V-shaped patterns (`/\\`) is to place a marker 5 rows directly above the apex.\n    *   **From Object 4 (Apex 5,9):** Target is (0,9).\n    *   **From Object 5 (Apex 7,2):** Target is (2,2). Note that pixel (2,2) is part of Object 1. The rule states to overwrite with 9 if it overlaps.\n    *   **From Object 6 (Apex 13,4):** Target is (8,4).\n    *   **From Object 8 (Apex 14,14):** Target is (9,14).\n\n3.  **Determine Marker Colors:**\n    *   The prompt states that if \"unique/variant shapes\" exist (which they do: the `\\/` and rotated Ls), the V-shape closest to the horizontal center (column 7.5) gets marker color 1. All others get 9.\n    *   **Distances from center (7.5):**\n        *   Object 4 (Col 9): |9 - 7.5| = 1.5\n        *   Object 5 (Col 2): |2 - 7.5| = 5.5\n        *   Object 6 (Col 4): |4 - 7.5| = 3.5\n        *   Object 8 (Col 14): |14 - 7.5| = 6.5\n    *   Object 4 is the closest. Its marker at (0,9) will be **color 1** (Blue).\n    *   All other markers will be **color 9** (Maroon).\n\n4.  **L-Shape Processing:**\n    *   The rule for L-shapes applies to \"standard\" orientations (Top-Left, as seen in Example 3). No such shapes exist in the test input (only variants). Therefore, no markers are generated for L-shapes, and no L-shapes are changed to color 9.\n\n5.  **Apply Transformations:**\n    *   Start with Input Grid.\n    *   Set pixel (0, 9) to 1.\n    *   Set pixel (2, 2) to 9. (Overwrites existing 6).\n    *   Set pixel (8, 4) to 9.\n    *   Set pixel (9, 14) to 9.\n\n**Output Generation:**\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6",

Object types include: single isolated pixels (colors 1, 9), V-shaped/chevron patterns of 3 pixels (colors 0, 6, 9), and L-shaped/corner patterns of 3 pixels (colors 2, 6, 9). Objects vary in color, position, orientation, and can repeat multiple times within a grid.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. For V-shaped patterns pointing down: place marker (color 9) 5 rows directly above apex; the V-shape closest to horizontal center (column 7.5) gets marker color 1 when a unique shape exists\n2. For L-shaped patterns: place marker (color 9) at position (row-5, left_column-5); the center-most L-shape is changed entirely from original color to 9\n3. Unique/variant shapes (different orientation or type) serve as indicators but don't receive markers\n4. When marker position overlaps existing shape pixel, overwrite with 9\n5. Background color 7 is preserved except where markers are placed\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

Object types include: single isolated pixels (colors 1, 9), V-shaped/chevron patterns of 3 pixels (colors 0, 6, 9), and L-shaped/corner patterns of 3 pixels (colors 2, 6, 9). Objects vary in color, position, orientation, and can repeat multiple times within a grid.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. For V-shaped patterns pointing down: place marker (color 9) 5 rows directly above apex; the V-shape closest to horizontal center (column 7.5) gets marker color 1 when a unique shape exists\n2. For L-shaped patterns: place marker (color 9) at position (row-5, left_column-5); the center-most L-shape is changed entirely from original color to 9\n3. Unique/variant shapes (different orientation or type) serve as indicators but don't receive markers\n4. When marker position overlaps existing shape pixel, overwrite with 9\n5. Background color 7 is preserved except where markers are placed\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**High-level reasoning**\n\n1. **Identify objects in the input grid**\n\n   - Background is color **7**.\n   - Non-7 pixels (color **6**) form small objects:\n     - **V-shapes (3 pixels)** of the form:\n       - Apex at `(r,c)` and two pixels at `(r+1,c-1)` and `(r+1,c+1)`.\n     - **L-shapes (3 pixels)**: any 3 pixels in a 2\u00d72 block (rows `r..r+1`, cols `c..c+1`) where exactly 3 cells are color 6 (a right-angle corner).\n\n2. **Find all V-shaped patterns pointing down**\n\n   Using the above pattern, the 6-colored V-shapes (apex positions) are at:\n   - `(6,10)` with arms `(7,9)` and `(7,11)`\n   - `(8,3)`  with arms `(9,2)` and `(9,4)`\n   - `(14,5)` with arms `(15,4)` and `(15,6)`\n   - `(15,15)` with arms `(16,14)` and `(16,16)`\n\n   For each V:\n   - Place a marker **5 rows above the apex**, same column `(r-5, c)`.\n\n   These marker positions are:\n   - From `(6,10)` \u2192 `(1,10)`\n   - From `(8,3)`  \u2192 `(3,3)`\n   - From `(14,5)` \u2192 `(9,5)`\n   - From `(15,15)`\u2192 `(10,15)`\n\n   Among these Vs, the one whose apex is **closest to the horizontal center** (column 8.5 on a 16-wide grid) is the V with apex at `(6,10)` (distance 1.5 columns). It is uniquely closest, so:\n   - Its marker at `(1,10)` is colored **1** instead of 9.\n   - All other V-markers are **9**.\n\n   If a marker lands on an existing non-7 pixel, it overwrites it with the marker color. In this case, `(3,3)` overwrites a `6` with a `9`; the other V-markers land on background 7.\n\n3. **Find L-shaped patterns and markers**\n\n   Look for every 2\u00d72 block with exactly **three** cells of color **6** (an L/corner shape). There is one such L-shape:\n\n   - 2\u00d72 block covering rows 15\u201316, cols 9\u201310:\n     - Cells `{(15,9), (15,10), (16,10)}` are 6; `(16,9)` is 7.\n     - This is one L-shaped object.\n     - Its bounding box has top row `row = 15` and leftmost column `left_column = 9`.\n\n   For an L-shape, place a marker at `(row-5, left_column-5)`:\n   - From this L: `(15-5, 9-5) = (10,4)` \u2192 put marker **9** at `(10,4)`.\n\n   This marker lands on background 7, so it just becomes a new 9.\n\n4. **Center-most L recoloring**\n\n   There is **only one** L-shape in the grid, so it is trivially the center-most L. Per the rule:\n   - Recolor all three cells of that L from 6 to 9:\n     - `(15,9)`, `(15,10)`, `(16,10)` become 9.\n\n5. **All other cells**\n\n   - Everything else stays the same (background 7 or other original 6s that are not in the center-most L or under markers).\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n\nHere is the final transformed grid:\n\nRow 1:  \n`7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7`\n\nRow 2:  \n`7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7`\n\nRow 3:  \n`7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7`\n\nRow 4:  \n`7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7`\n\nRow 5:  \n`7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7`\n\nRow 6:  \n`7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7`\n\nRow 7:  \n`7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7`\n\nRow 8:  \n`7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7`\n\nRow 9:  \n`7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7`\n\nRow 10:  \n`7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7`\n\nRow 11:  \n`7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7`\n\nRow 12:  \n`7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7`\n\nRow 13:  \n`7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7`\n\nRow 14:  \n`7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7`\n\nRow 15:  \n`7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,6,7`\n\nRow 16:  \n`7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,6,7,6`",

Object types include: single isolated pixels (colors 1, 9), V-shaped/chevron patterns of 3 pixels (colors 0, 6, 9), and L-shaped/corner patterns of 3 pixels (colors 2, 6, 9). Objects vary in color, position, orientation, and can repeat multiple times within a grid.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. For V-shaped patterns pointing down: place marker (color 9) 5 rows directly above apex; the V-shape closest to horizontal center (column 7.5) gets marker color 1 when a unique shape exists\n2. For L-shaped patterns: place marker (color 9) at position (row-5, left_column-5); the center-most L-shape is changed entirely from original color to 9\n3. Unique/variant shapes (different orientation or type) serve as indicators but don't receive markers\n4. When marker position overlaps existing shape pixel, overwrite with 9\n5. Background color 7 is preserved except where markers are placed\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "To produce the output, I first identify the small 3\u2011cell patterns on the background of 7s. V\u2011shapes are the chevrons consisting of a single \u201capex\u201d cell with two cells one row below and one column to either side; for each such caret\u2011shaped V I place a marker five rows directly above the apex. The marker is normally 9, but if one V is uniquely closest to the horizontal centre of the grid, that marker is 1 instead. L\u2011shapes are any 2\u00d72 block with exactly three cells filled; for each L I place a marker five rows up and five columns left from the top\u2011left of the block. Among the Ls, the one closest to the grid centre has its three cells recoloured to 9. Markers overwrite whatever was underneath; all other cells remain as in the input.\n\nIn the test grid there are four V\u2011shapes with apices at (5,9), (7,2), (13,4) and (14,14), giving markers at (0,9), (2,2), (8,4) and (9,14), with the first one coloured 1 as the unique central V. There are two L\u2011shapes at 2\u00d72 blocks starting at (2,1) and (14,8); only the latter has its marker in bounds at (9,3) and is also the central L, so its three cells are changed to 9.\n\nThe resulting grid is:\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,6,7,6",

For V-shaped patterns pointing down: place marker (color 9) 5 rows directly above apex; the V-shape closest to horizontal center (column 7.5) gets marker color 1 when a unique shape exists\n2.

Object types include: single isolated pixels (colors 1, 9), V-shaped/chevron patterns of 3 pixels (colors 0, 6, 9), and L-shaped/corner patterns of 3 pixels (colors 2, 6, 9). Objects vary in color, position, orientation, and can repeat multiple times within a grid.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n1. For V-shaped patterns pointing down: place marker (color 9) 5 rows directly above apex; the V-shape closest to horizontal center (column 7.5) gets marker color 1 when a unique shape exists\n2. For L-shaped patterns: place marker (color 9) at position (row-5, left_column-5); the center-most L-shape is changed entirely from original color to 9\n3. Unique/variant shapes (different orientation or type) serve as indicators but don't receive markers\n4. When marker position overlaps existing shape pixel, overwrite with 9\n5. Background color 7 is preserved except where markers are placed\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
