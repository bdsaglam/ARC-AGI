The goal seems to be to manipulate shapes with different colors. My thought process here involved carefully dissecting the provided examples. The first thing I noticed was these distinct \"V\" shapes composed of a single pixel on top and two on the bottom. I observed that these shapes, or sometimes other shapes, appear to move or trigger some transformation.\n\nExample 1 showed a grid primarily orange (7) with some maroon (9) shapes and some other shape. I saw that, in the output, one of the maroon \"V\" shapes had a blue pixel (1) in the center, and the main thing I saw in the output was that row 9 seemed to be a modified version of row 14 from the input. I suspected that row 9 was related to a particular shape in row 14, and there was also a smaller shape (L-shape) in rows 3,4. I initially thought it was a copy, but it seemed more like some kind of transformation. The L-shape and V shape are different.\n\nExample 2 had grey (0) and maroon (9) shapes. The output had single maroon (9) pixels in various locations. I saw that the output 9s were at the \"heads\" of the shapes and that the shapes were shifted upwards.\n\nExample 3 had red (2) shapes and the output had a combination of reds, maroons, and other colors. I got confused by the flag shapes, but ultimately realized they were similar to the V shapes, but \"lying down\". I saw that one shape changed to maroon, and the outputs had horizontal-vertical shift offsets.\n\nBased on these examples, I'm forming a few hypotheses: there are primary shapes (V shapes).\nThere are \"other\" shapes. The other shapes may be important. There is a shift involved (usually 5 rows). There's collision detection: If a shape moves to another pixel that is not an empty 7, the target pixel may become a different color. If there's no collision, place a new pixel in the target location, of a specific \"indicator\" color. The color of the indicator is almost always the same as the shape, unless there's a collision.\n\nI started to test this with the Test Input. First, I identify the existing shape types in the Test Input (Gamma, V shape, Flag-Inv, and Complex shapes). Based on Example 1, I suspected the L shape had something to do with the transformation, I found a few V shapes in the test input. Then, I decided the standard transformation involved shifting V-shaped objects upwards by 5 rows and a horizontal offset that's probably zero. Then, I found the positions of the target pixels.\n\nNext, I looked at which shapes had a partner, such as a vertical alignment. The Test Input has the Gamma shape, the Inverted V shape, and some other shapes aligned with the V shapes. I identified a \"Collision\" in the case that the target location has a shape in the way. I identified this by searching for shapes along the path between the original V and the location it should move to, or if the \"destination\" pixel of a shape is occupied.\n\nIn cases of collision, the \"obstacle\" turns the indicator color (maroon). In cases of no collision, create the pixel. Finally, I preserved all other pixels that weren't hit by a path and didn't have collisions.\n\nFinally, I checked my predictions again and ensured all shapes were accounted for. So that's how I identified the patterns: shape shifting, \"collision\" triggers, and color assignment.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the rules inferred from three examples.\n\n**Inferred Rules:**\n1.  **Identify \"V-shapes\"**: These are distinct shapes consisting of 3 pixels: one \"head\" pixel in a row, and two \"feet\" pixels in the row below it, diagonally adjacent to the head.\n    *   Example 1 (color 9) and Example 2 (color 0) show these shapes moving.\n    *   In the Test Input, these shapes are color 6 (magenta). We find 4 such shapes with heads at coordinates: `(5,9)`, `(7,2)`, `(13,4)`, and `(14,14)`.\n\n2.  **Transformation Vector**: The examples show that these shapes project a \"marker\" or \"beam\" to a new location.\n    *   In Examples 1 and 2, the marker appears **5 rows above** the head of the V-shape (offset `-5` rows, `0` cols).\n    *   In Example 3, the shape was different (a flag), and the offset was `-5` rows, `-5` cols. Since our shapes in the Test Input are symmetric V-shapes like in Ex 1 and 2, we use the offset **(-5, 0)**.\n\n3.  **Interaction/Collision Logic**:\n    *   **Empty Target**: If the target location (5 rows up) is empty (background color 7) and the path is clear, a single pixel of color **9** (maroon) is created at the target location.\n    *   **Occupied Target/Path**: If the target location is occupied by another shape, or if the \"beam\" passes through another shape on its way to the target, that obstructing shape **changes its color to 9**. The marker is \"absorbed\" by the shape.\n    *   Original V-shapes remain unchanged.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **V-shape 1**: Head at `(5,9)`. Target is `(0,9)`.\n    *   The path goes through `(3,9)`.\n    *   `(3,9)` is part of an \"Inverted V\" shape (pixels at `(2,8), (2,10), (3,9)`).\n    *   **Action**: The Inverted V shape is hit. Change pixels `(2,8), (2,10), (3,9)` from 6 to **9**.\n\n2.  **V-shape 2**: Head at `(7,2)`. Target is `(2,2)`.\n    *   The target `(2,2)` is occupied by a \"Gamma\" shape (pixels at `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)`).\n    *   **Action**: The Gamma shape is hit. Change pixels `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)` from 6 to **9**.\n\n3.  **V-shape 3**: Head at `(13,4)`. Target is `(8,4)`.\n    *   Row 8, col 4 is empty. Path is clear.\n    *   **Action**: Create a pixel **9** at `(8,4)`.\n\n4.  **V-shape 4**: Head at `(14,14)`. Target is `(9,14)`.\n    *   Row 9, col 14 is empty. The complex shape at `(3,14)` is above the target, so it's not hit.\n    *   **Action**: Create a pixel **9** at `(9,14)`.\n\n**Final Output Generation**:\n*   Start with Test Input.\n*   Change `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)` to 9.\n*   Change `(2,8), (2,10), (3,9)` to 9.\n*   Set `(8,4)` to 9.\n*   Set `(9,14)` to 9.\n*   All other pixels remain 7 or 6.\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n<REASONING_MODEL_B model_id=\"gpt-5.1-high_9_step_5_generate_hint\">\nFirst I\u2019ll describe the rule inferred from the examples, then I\u2019ll apply it to the test grid step by step, and finally I\u2019ll show the resulting output grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Inferred rule from the examples\n\n### 1.1. Objects and background\n\n- The background color is 7 (it fills most of each grid).\n- Every non\u20117 cell belongs to some **object**.\n- Objects are defined using **8\u2011connectivity**: cells of the same color that touch horizontally, vertically, or diagonally are in the same object.\n\n### 1.2. \u201cProjectile\u201d behavior\n\nFor each object:\n\n1. **Classify its shape** in its minimal bounding box (all examples and the test use small 3\u2011pixel shapes).  \n   Only two shape types actually matter for the test:\n\n   - **V\u2011shape** (three pixels):\n\n     In its bounding box (2 rows \u00d7 3 columns) it looks like:\n     ```\n     . x .\n     x . x\n     ```\n     (coordinates relative to top-left of box: (0,1), (1,0), (1,2))\n\n   - **\u0393\u2011shape with leg on the right** (\u201cgamma\u2011right\u201d):\n\n     In its bounding box (2 rows \u00d7 2 columns) it looks like:\n     ```\n     x x\n     . x\n     ```\n     (coords: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1))\n\n   (A mirror \u201cgamma\u2011left\u201d `xx / x.` also appears in Example 3; its direction is up\u2011left, but that isn\u2019t needed for new directions in the test\u2014only to understand the mechanism.)\n\n2. **Choose the emission point (\u201chighest point\u201d)**:\n   - Find the **minimum row index** of the object (topmost row).\n   - Among cells on that row:\n     - For V\u2011shapes: that row has a single pixel; that pixel is the emission point.\n     - For gamma\u2011shapes: that row has two pixels;  \n       - For **gamma\u2011left** (`xx / x.`): use the **left** of the two.  \n       - For **gamma\u2011right** (`xx / .x`): use the **right** of the two.\n\n3. **Choose the direction according to shape type**:\n   - V\u2011shape: projectile goes **straight up**: direction vector `(-1, 0)`.\n   - Gamma\u2011left (`xx / x.`): projectile goes **up\u2011left**: `(-1, -1)`.\n   - Gamma\u2011right (`xx / .x`): projectile goes **up\u2011right**: `(-1, +1)`.\n\n4. **Range and collision**:\n   - The projectile has a **fixed maximum range of 5 steps**.\n   - Starting at the emission point, move step by step in the chosen direction:\n     - Step 1: position = `p1 = p0 + d`\n     - Step 2: `p2 = p0 + 2d`\n     - \u2026\n     - Step 5: `p5 = p0 + 5d`\n   - If at any step the position would go **outside the grid**, the projectile is **aborted entirely** (no new pixel, no recolor).\n   - Otherwise, as you step:\n     - If you first land on a cell that is **not background 7** (i.e., some other object), then:\n       - The projectile **hits that target object**.\n       - The entire target object is **recolored to 9**.\n       - No \u201cendpoint\u201d pixel is created for this projectile.\n     - If you reach step 5 without hitting any object:\n       - The projectile **stops at that step\u20115 cell**, and you paint that cell **9**.\n\n5. **All projectiles are computed on the original grid**:\n   - You determine hits and endpoints based on the original object layout.\n   - Then you:\n     - Recolor all hit objects to 9.\n     - Add all endpoint pixels as 9.\n   - These can happen simultaneously (an object can both shoot and be recolored by someone else, as seen in Example 3).\n\nThis procedure reproduces Example 2 perfectly, and Example 3 including the diagonal hit where the middle gamma object recolors another. (Example 1 has a single anomalous pixel color, but the spatial behavior matches.)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Apply the rule to the test input\n\n### 2.1.

Inferred transformation\n\nAll examples are 16\u00d716 grids with background color `7` and one other \u201cobject\u201d color:\n\n- Example 1: object color `9`\n- Example 2: object color `0`\n- Example 3: object color `2`\n- Test: object color `6`\n\nThe output always keeps the original grid and adds some `9`s according to the structure of the object-color cells.\n\n### 1.1. Connected components of the object color\n\nTake all cells whose color \u2260 7. Group them into **8-connected components** (neighbors can touch horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).\n\nFor each component, we will use its **top row** (smallest row index inside that component).\n\nWithin that top row of a component, the object-color cells may appear in one or more contiguous horizontal blocks (e.g. columns `[5,6]` is one block; `[8]` is another block).\n\nLet:\n\n- `r_min` = that component\u2019s minimum row index (its top row)\n- On row `r_min`, the component has one or more contiguous column blocks; for each such block, let `c_block_min` be the smallest column in that block.\n\nAlso compute:\n\n- `global_cmin` = the minimum column index over **all** object-color cells in the grid.\n\n### 1.2. Rule A: project the top blocks upward by 5 rows\n\nFor every component and each top-row block:\n\n- Compute:\n  - `dest_row = r_min - 5`\n  - `dest_col = c_block_min - global_cmin`\n- If `dest_row \u2265 0` and `0 \u2264 dest_col < width`, set `output[dest_row][dest_col] = 9`.\n\nThis explains:\n\n- Example 2 exactly: each 8-connected cluster of `0`s contributes 1 `9` at row `r_min - 5`, same column (since there `global_cmin = 0`).\n- Example 1 (bottom cluster of `9`s): bottom cluster is one big 8-connected component whose top row is `14` with cells in columns `1, 7, 14`. Each of those three isolated columns is its own block, so we place `9`s at row `14 - 5 = 9` in columns `1, 7, 14` (the provided output has `1` instead of `9` at (9,7), which appears to be a typo).\n- Example 3:\n  - Object color `2` has `global_cmin = 5`.\n  - Top block at rows 6\u20137 has 4 components; each has a top contiguous block of width 2 (e.g. columns `[5,6]`, `[8,9]`, \u2026), so we use `c_block_min` = 5, 8, 11, 14 and place `9`s at row `6 - 5 = 1`, columns `5-5=0`, `8-5=3`, `11-5=6`, `14-5=9`.   \n    \u2192 matches row 1 of the output.\n  - Bottom block at rows 14\u201315 similarly maps to row `14 - 5 = 9` with columns `0,3,6,9`.   \n    \u2192 matches row 9 of the output.\n  - The small middle component at rows 11\u201312, columns `[13,14]`, has top row 11, block `[13,14]`, so we place a `9` at `(11-5=6, 13-5=8)`, matching the `9` at (6,8).\n\nSo Rule A matches all examples (modulo that single suspicious `1` in example 1).\n\n### 1.3. Rule B: highlight overlapping pattern shifted by (5,5)\n\nExample 3 has additional `9`s at (6,9) and (7,8), which don\u2019t come from Rule A. Those are explained by a second effect seen only when the object pattern is self-repeated with a shift of (5,5).\n\nFor every object-color cell `(r,c)`:\n\n- If `r \u2265 5`, `c \u2265 5`, and the cell `(r-5, c-5)` **also** had the object color in the input,\n- Then set `output[r-5][c-5] = 9`.\n\nThis effectively finds all pairs of object-color cells separated by vector (5,5) and marks the **upper-left** one with `9`.\n\nIn Example 3:\n\n- The middle component at `(11,13), (11,14), (12,13)` has corresponding cells `(6,8), (6,9), (7,8)` above-left, all of which are also `2`s. These three positions are turned into `9`s.\n- No such overlapping `(r, c)` and `(r-5, c-5)` pairs exist in Examples 1 and 2, so Rule B adds nothing there.\n\nIn the **test** grid, there are no 6-cells such that another 6 is exactly 5 rows up and 5 columns left, so Rule B will add nothing; only Rule A applies.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Apply the transformation to the test input\n\n### 2.1.

Apply Rule A: top blocks shifted up\n\nFor each component:\n\n- Compute `r_min`.\n- On row `r_min`, find contiguous column blocks; for each block:\n  - `dest_row = r_min - 5`\n  - `dest_col = c_block_min - global_cmin = c_block_min - 1`\n  - If `dest_row \u2265 0`, set that cell to 9.\n\nComponent-wise:\n\n1. **A**: r_min = 2; top row cells: only (2,2) \u2192 block [2].  \n   dest_row = 2 - 5 = -3 < 0 \u2192 no 9.\n2. **B**: r_min = 2; top row cells: (2,8) and (2,10) \u2192 blocks [8] and [10].  \n   dest_row = -3 \u2192 no 9.\n3. **C**: r_min = 3; dest_row = 3 - 5 = -2 \u2192 no 9.\n4. **D**: r_min = 4; dest_row = 4 - 5 = -1 \u2192 no 9.\n5. **E**: r_min = 5; top row cells: (5,9) \u2192 block [9].  \n   dest_row = 5 - 5 = 0  \n   dest_col = 9 - 1 = 8  \n   \u2192 place 9 at (0,8).\n6. **F**: r_min = 7; top row cells: (7,2) \u2192 block [2].  \n   dest_row = 7 - 5 = 2  \n   dest_col = 2 - 1 = 1  \n   \u2192 place 9 at (2,1).\n7. **G**: r_min = 13; top row cells: (13,4) \u2192 block [4].  \n   dest_row = 13 - 5 = 8  \n   dest_col = 4 - 1 = 3  \n   \u2192 place 9 at (8,3).\n8. **H**: r_min = 14; top row cells: (14,8), (14,9) \u2192 contiguous block [8..9], so `c_block_min = 8`.  \n   dest_row = 14 - 5 = 9  \n   dest_col = 8 - 1 = 7  \n   \u2192 place 9 at (9,7).\n9. **I**: r_min = 14; top row cells: (14,14) \u2192 block [14].  \n   dest_row = 14 - 5 = 9  \n   dest_col = 14 - 1 = 13  \n   \u2192 place 9 at (9,13).\n\nSo Rule A adds 9s at:\n- (0,8), (2,1), (8,3), (9,7), (9,13).\n\n### 2.3. Apply Rule B: overlapping 6s shifted by (5,5)\n\nFor each 6 at (r,c) with r \u2265 5 and c \u2265 5, check if (r-5, c-5) is also 6 in the input. If so, set (r-5, c-5) to 9.\n\nCheck all relevant 6s:\n\n- (5,9) \u2192 (0,4) is 7\n- (5,14) \u2192 (0,9) is 7\n- (6,8) \u2192 (1,3) is 7\n- (6,10) \u2192 (1,5) is 7\n- (13,4) \u2192 (8,-1) invalid\n- (14,5) \u2192 (9,0) is 7\n- (14,8) \u2192 (9,3) is 7\n- (14,9) \u2192 (9,4) is 7\n- (14,14) \u2192 (9,9) is 7\n- (15,9) \u2192 (10,4) is 7\n- (15,13) \u2192 (10,8) is 7\n- (15,15) \u2192 (10,10) is 7\n\nNo `(r-5, c-5)` positions are 6 in the input, so Rule B adds no extra 9s for the test.\n\n### 2.4.

What the training examples have in common\n\nIn all three training examples:\n\n- The background color is 7.\n- There is exactly one *other* color \\(P\\) in the input:\n  - Example 1: \\(P = 9\\)\n  - Example 2: \\(P = 0\\)\n  - Example 3: \\(P = 2\\)\n- The non\u20117 pixels form **disjoint connected components of size 3**.\n- Each component is 8\u2011connected and occupies either:\n  - exactly 2 rows (with 1 pixel in one row and 2 in the other), or  \n  - in the test input, we\u2019ll also see a 3\u2011row \u201czigzag\u201d, but that had no training analogue.\n\nFrom the training, two main shapes appear for the 3\u2011pixel components:\n\n1. **V\u2011shapes (triangle\u2011like)**:  \n   2 pixels in one row, 1 pixel in the neighboring row, such that the single pixel is centered between the two.\n   - Example 2 zeros: patterns like  \n     Row r:     `.,0,.`  \n     Row r+1:   `0,.,0`\n   - Example 1 bottom 9\u2019s: similarly `{(14,1),(15,0),(15,2)}`, etc.\n2. **L\u2011shapes**:  \n   2 horizontally adjacent pixels in one row and one pixel in the neighboring row aligned with one of them, e.g.  \n   Row r:     `2,2`  \n   Row r+1:   `2,.`  \n   (and rotations/reflections of this).\n\n### 2. Rule inferred from training\n\nFor each 3\u2011cell component of the non\u20117 color \\(P\\):\n\n1. **Classify its shape** (using just its 3 pixels):\n   - Let the rows that contain pixels be \\(r_1 < r_2\\).  \n   - Count pixels per row: either \\((1,2)\\) or \\((2,1)\\).\n   - If the row with 2 pixels has columns \\((c_{\\min}, c_{\\max})\\) and  \n     the row with 1 pixel has a pixel at column \\(c_A\\) such that  \n     \\(c_A = \\frac{c_{\\min} + c_{\\max}}{2}\\) (i.e., the single pixel is centered between the two), **treat this as a V\u2011type**.\n   - Otherwise (still two rows, counts 1 and 2, but not centered), **treat as an L\u2011type**.\n\n2. **For V\u2011type components**:\n   - Let the **apex** be the row that has only 1 pixel, at \\((r_A, c_A)\\).\n   - In the output, place a 9 at \\((r_A - 5, c_A)\\) if that row index is \u2265 0.\n   - (This matches Example 2 perfectly and matches the bottom triangles of Example 1, apart from the special color 1 in the middle, which I treat as a special case not relevant to new colors.)\n\n3. **For L\u2011type components**:\n   - Let the **pivot** be the \u201cnorth\u2011west\u2011most\u201d pixel of the component:\n     - The pixel with minimal row, and among those, minimal column.\n   - In the output, place a 9 at \\((r_{\\text{pivot}} - 5, c_{\\text{pivot}} - 5)\\) if both row and column indices are \u2265 0.\n   - This exactly reproduces the main pattern of 9\u2019s in Example 3 (those on rows 1, 6 and 9). Extra 9\u2019s in the middle L in Example 3 appear to be additional decoration; the core, consistent behavior across examples is this pivot shift.\n\n4. **All other pixels are left unchanged** (same as input), and if a new 9 lands on a non\u20117 pixel (e.g. overlaps the original foreground color), we simply overwrite it with 9. This happens in Example 3 and is allowed.\n\nWe ignore the special single \u20181\u2019 in Example 1 as a quirk specific to using 9 as both original and \u201cmarker\u201d color; in the test the foreground color is 6, so such an ambiguity does not arise.\n\n### 3. Apply the rule to the test input\n\nForeground color here is \\(P = 6\\).

Here's a summary:**\n\nI started by observing that the input grids were always 16x16 with an orange (7) background and various small \"sprites\" of different colors. I noticed that the output seemed to involve the creation of new sprites or changes to existing ones, but I needed to figure out the underlying logic.\n\nMy initial approach involved comparing the input and output grids and noting changes.  I then moved on to analyzing the provided \"Object Descriptions\" and \"Transformation Description\", but I approached these with some skepticism, and made sure to verify them against the examples. I noticed the rules involved specific shapes like triangles and L-shapes, and their color. My first hypothesis was related to \"markers\" which were projected by the original shapes, and possibly collided and formed 1's or changed the color of existing shapes to 9s.\n\nI meticulously analyzed each example, starting with Example 1. I tried to relate the sprites to outputs to derive my own rules, and not rely on the initial description only. Initially, the presence of just one colored pixel in the output puzzled me, but I eventually connected the dots with the concept of \"collisions\" leading to the creation of a '1' pixel. I observed that the shapes looked like specific \"L\" and Up-Triangle structures.\n\nWith Example 2, I noticed that all sprites were Up-Triangles and followed this movement rule:  move a marker at `(TipRow - 5, TipCol)`.  But this didn't explain the logic in Ex 1.\n\nI went back to Example 1, suspecting that the \"markers\" from a color-9 Up-Triangle might not shoot, and it was the L-shape, that shot a marker.  I eventually arrived at the rule: \"Simple shapes (Triangles) of Color 9 do not produce markers; Complex shapes (Ls) of Color 9 do\". This was crucial.\n\nI realized that the shape's orientation was crucial. I spent quite a while determining which direction the shape's \"corner\" was in.\n\nAfter that, Example 3 confirmed that other shapes (of other colors) produce markers and move.\n\nI then generalized the different moves of different shapes: Up, Down, Left, Right and L-Shapes. The L-shapes could have one of four possible orientations, and the direction and the coordinate change depended on its corner. I deduced that Top-Left L means move (-5, -5), Bottom-Right L means (+5, +5) and so on.\n\nFinally, I applied all the derived rules to the Test Input. Based on my analysis and the hypothesis that ONLY color 9s did not \"shoot\", I arrived at the final solution.\n\nTo solve this challenge, I analyzed the provided examples and derived the transformation rules governing the movement of \"markers\" from source sprites to target locations. Here is the step-by-step logic:\n\n1.  **Identify Sprites**: The input grid contains background pixels (Color 7) and sprite pixels (Color 6 in the test case). I identified connected components of 3 pixels to determine their shape type.\n    *   **Up-Triangle**: A pyramid shape (1 pixel on top, 2 on bottom). Action: Shoot a marker **-5 rows** (up) from the tip.\n    *   **Down-Triangle**: An inverted pyramid (2 pixels on top, 1 on bottom). Action: Shoot a marker **+5 rows** (down) from the tip.\n    *   **Left-Triangle**: A triangle pointing left (1 pixel on left, 2 on right). Action: Shoot a marker **-5 columns** (left) from the tip.\n    *   **L-Shapes**: 3 pixels filling a corner of a 2x2 box. The \"corner\" is the pixel with two neighbors.\n        *   **Top-Left L (Corner at TL)**: Moves marker **(-5 rows, -5 cols)**.\n        *   **Top-Right L (Corner at TR)**: Moves marker **(-5 rows, +5 cols)**.\n        *   **Bottom-Left L (Corner at BL)**: Moves marker **(+5 rows, -5 cols)**.\n        *   **Bottom-Right L (Corner at BR)**: Moves marker **(+5 rows, +5 cols)**.\n\n2.  **Determine Markers for Test Input**:\n    *   **Sprite 1** (Rows 2-3, Cols 1-2): Shape is a **Bottom-Right L**. Corner at (3,2). Target: (3+5, 2+5) = **(8, 7)**.\n    *   **Sprite 2** (Rows 2-3, Cols 8-10): Shape is a **Down-Triangle**. Tip at (3,9). Target: (3+5, 9) = **(8, 9)**.\n    *   **Sprite 3** (Rows 3-5, Cols 13-14): Shape is a **Left-Triangle**. Tip at (4,13). Target: (4, 13-5) = **(4, 8)**.\n    *   **Sprite 4** (Rows 5-6, Cols 8-10): Shape is an **Up-Triangle**. Tip at (5,9). Target: (5-5, 9) = **(0, 9)**.\n    *   **Sprite 5** (Rows 7-8, Cols 1-3): Shape is an **Up-Triangle**. Tip at (7,2). Target: (7-5, 2) = **(2, 2)**.\n    *   **Sprite 6** (Rows 13-14, Cols 3-5): Shape is an **Up-Triangle**. Tip at (13,4). Target: (13-5, 4) = **(8, 4)**.\n    *   **Sprite 7** (Rows 14-15, Cols 8-9): Shape is a **Top-Right L**. Corner at (14,9). Target: (14-5, 9+5) = **(9, 14)**.\n    *   **Sprite 8** (Rows 14-15, Cols 13-15): Shape is an **Up-Triangle**. Tip at (14,14). Target: (14-5, 14) = **(9, 14)**.\n\n3.  **Apply Marker Rules**:\n    *   **Collision**: Markers from Sprite 7 and Sprite 8 land on the same empty pixel **(9, 14)**. The result is **Color 1** (Blue).\n    *   **Hit Shape**: The marker from Sprite 5 lands on **(2, 2)**, which is part of Sprite 1. This causes the entire Sprite 1 to change to **Color 9** (Maroon).\n    *   **Empty Space**: All other markers land on empty background pixels (Color 7). These pixels become **Color 9** (Maroon).\n        *   (0, 9) becomes 9.\n        *   (4, 8) becomes 9.\n        *   (8, 4) becomes 9.\n        *   (8, 7) becomes 9.\n        *   (8, 9) becomes 9.\n\n4.  **Final Grid Construction**:\n    *   Start with Input Grid.\n    *   Change Sprite 1 pixels at (2,2), (3,1), (3,2) to 9.\n    *   Place 9s at (0,9), (4,8), (8,4), (8,7), (8,9).\n    *   Place 1 at (9,14).\n\n**Output Grid:**\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,9,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,9,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,6,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,6,7,6\n</REASONING_MODEL_A>\n<REASONING_MODEL_B model_id=\"gpt-5.1-high_11_step_5_gemini_gen_sol\">\n**Reasoning**\n\n1. **Understand the rule from the examples**\n\n   From the three examples (with colors 0, 2, and 9 as shapes) and the provided description:\n\n   - Background is color **7**.\n   - **Sprites** are exactly 3 pixels of a non\u20117 color forming specific patterns:\n     - **Up\u2011triangle** (apex on top, two pixels one row below, diagonally left/right):  \n       apex at \\((r,c)\\), base at \\((r+1,c-1)\\) and \\((r+1,c+1)\\).  \n       \u2192 marker goes to \\((r-5,c)\\).\n     - **Down\u2011triangle**:  \n       apex at \\((r,c)\\), base at \\((r-1,c-1)\\) and \\((r-1,c+1)\\).  \n       \u2192 marker goes to \\((r+5,c)\\).\n     - **Left\u2011triangle**:  \n       apex at \\((r,c)\\), base at \\((r-1,c+1)\\) and \\((r+1,c+1)\\).  \n       \u2192 marker goes to \\((r,c-5)\\).\n     - **L\u2011shapes**: check 2\u00d72 blocks with exactly 3 same\u2011color pixels.\n       Use the 2\u00d72 anchor \\((r,c)\\) as top\u2011left of that block:\n       - Case TL\u2011L (missing bottom\u2011right):\n         ```\n         X X\n         X .\n         ```\n         pivot = top\u2011left = \\((r,c)\\)  \n         \u2192 marker to \\((r-5,c-5)\\).\n       - Case TR\u2011L (missing bottom\u2011left):\n         ```\n         X X\n         .

There are four up\u2011pointing triangles (apex at (5,9), (7,2), (13,4), (14,14)), one down\u2011pointing triangle (apex at (3,9)), one left\u2011pointing triangle (apex at (4,13)), and two L\u2011shapes: a bottom\u2011right corner at (3,2) and a top\u2011right corner at (14,9). Each sprite produces a marker displaced by 5 cells in the direction dictated by its type: up triangles go 5 rows up, down triangles 5 rows down, left triangles 5 columns left; L\u2011shapes move to (-5,-5) for top\u2011left, (-5,+5) for top\u2011right, (+5,+5) for bottom\u2011right (and by symmetry +5,\u20115 for bottom\u2011left). Markers are colour 9 unless two land on the same empty background cell, in which case a 1 is placed. If a marker lands on an existing shape cell, the entire shape is recoloured to 9.\n\nApplying this to the test input, the markers land at (0,9), (2,2), (8,4), (9,14), (8,9), (4,8), (9,14), (8,7). The two at (9,14) collide on empty background, producing a 1 there. The marker at (2,2) hits the L\u2011shape at (2,2),(3,1),(3,2), recolouring that shape to 9. All other markers sit on background.

It's about modifying a grid based on shapes and some collision logic. Here's what I've figured out:\n\n1.  **Shape Identification:** I start by identifying connected regions of the foreground color. Then, I define shapes based on 8-connectivity (which means diagonal touching counts!).\n\n2.  **Shape Orientation:**\n    *   **Symmetric:** If a shape is symmetric along a vertical axis (like the upright or downward pointing 'V' shapes in the examples), it \"points\" straight up (or down, if it's mirrored).\n    *   **Asymmetric \"Corners\" (3 pixels in a 2x2 box):** If a shape is a 2x2 block with one corner background, the direction is towards the *opposite* corner.\n\n3.  **Key Pixel Selection:**\n    *   **Symmetric:** Pick the top-most pixel.\n    *   **Corners:**  Find the \"vertex\" - the pixel with 2 connected neighbors.\n\n4.  **Beam Projection:**  From the chosen \"anchor\" pixel, calculate a \"target\" coordinate, based on the shape's orientation and a fixed distance of 5 steps.  If the shape is symmetric (like the triangle) it's a vertical shift. Asymmetric corners need the formula: `target = key_pixel + orientation_vector * 5`. The key point is always the pixel with 2 neighbors.\n\n5.  **Interactions and Rules:**  Now I have a set of projected target points, or beams, for the identified shapes.  I check each pixel on the grid:\n    *   **Empty Cell:**\n        *   If a cell receives only *one* beam, make it a marker of color 9 (maroon).\n        *   If a cell receives *multiple* beams, make it a marker of color 1 (blue).\n    *   **Occupied Cell:**\n        *   If a cell is already occupied by another shape's pixel, take its position as a target and transform the original shape to color 9.\n\nSo, in essence, I'm finding basic patterns, giving them \"direction\", and then applying collision rules where the \"beams\" collide, or hit existing shapes. The color of the beams/markers depends on if they are colliding (Blue, 1), or alone (Maroon, 9).\n\n\nThe logic for this task involves identifying \"emitters\" (connected shapes), determining their \"firing direction\" based on their geometry, and placing markers or modifying objects where the \"beams\" land.\n\n**1. Object Identification & Classification:**\nWe treat connected components of non-background colors (not 7) as objects.\n*   **Symmetric \"V\" or \"Caret\" Shapes:** These shapes point in the direction of their vertex/tip.\n    *   **Up-pointing V:** (e.g., shapes in Example 1, 2). Vertex at top. **Vector:** `(-5, 0)` (Up).\n    *   **Down-pointing V:** Vertex at bottom. **Vector:** `(+5, 0)` (Down).\n    *   **Left-pointing V:** Vertex at left. **Vector:** `(0, -5)` (Left).\n*   **Asymmetric 3-pixel \"Corner\" Shapes (in a 2x2 box):** These shapes have one corner of the 2x2 box missing. They \"fire\" diagonally towards the corner *opposite* the missing one.\n    *   **Missing Bottom-Right:** Fires Top-Left `(-5, -5)`. (e.g., Example 3 flags).\n    *   **Missing Top-Right:** Fires Bottom-Left `(+5, -5)`. (e.g., Example 1 top shape).\n    *   **Missing Top-Left:** Fires Bottom-Right `(+5, +5)`.\n    *   **Missing Bottom-Left:** Fires Top-Right `(-5, +5)`.\n    The \"Anchor\" for the beam is the vertex pixel of the shape (the one with 2 neighbors).\n\n**2. Beam Interaction Rules:**\nCalculate the target coordinate for each shape: `Target = Anchor + Vector`.\n*   **Empty Target:**\n    *   If **one** beam hits an empty cell, place a **Maroon (9)** marker.\n    *   If **two or more** beams collide at the same empty cell, place a **Blue (1)** marker.\n*   **Occupied Target:**\n    *   If a beam hits an existing object, that object changes color to **Maroon (9)**. (The beam from the modified object still fires).\n\n**3. Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Shape A (Top-Left):** \"J\" shape at `(2,2),(3,1),(3,2)`. Missing TL corner. Fires BR `(+5, +5)` from vertex `(3,2)`. Target: `(8,7)`.\n*   **Shape B1 (Top-Middle):** Down-pointing V at `(2,8),(2,10),(3,9)`. Vertex `(3,9)`. Fires Down `(+5, 0)`. Target: `(8,9)`.\n*   **Shape C (Top-Right):** Left-pointing V at `(3,14),(4,13),(5,14)`. Vertex `(4,13)`. Fires Left `(0, -5)`. Target: `(4,8)`.\n*   **Shape B2 (Middle-Middle):** Up-pointing V at `(5,9),(6,8),(6,10)`. Vertex `(5,9)`. Fires Up `(-5, 0)`. Target: `(0,9)`.\n*   **Shape D (Middle-Left):** Up-pointing V at `(7,2),(8,1),(8,3)`. Vertex `(7,2)`. Fires Up `(-5, 0)`. Target: `(2,2)`.\n    *   **Interaction:** Hits Shape A. **Shape A becomes Maroon (9).**\n*   **Shape E (Bottom-Left):** Up-pointing V at `(13,4),(14,3),(14,5)`. Vertex `(13,4)`. Fires Up `(-5, 0)`. Target: `(8,4)`.\n*   **Shape F (Bottom-Middle):** \"Gamma-rotated\" at `(14,8),(14,9),(15,9)`. Missing BL corner. Fires TR `(-5, +5)` from vertex `(14,9)`.

Here's my thinking process:**\n\nFirst, I need to understand the task. It's about a 16x16 grid with an orange background (7). There are patterns made of other colors. My job is to find a rule that transforms an input grid into an output grid, based on examples and a test input. I see the importance of color and positions.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n*   **Initial Shapes:** I see an L-shape (maroon, color 9) at the top-right and some maroon triangles at the bottom of the input grid.\n*   **The Output is Key:**  The output grid is where the transformation happens. I see that the L-shape and triangles remain, but there are new pixels that appear in between!\n*   **Coordiantes and Distances:** I carefully check the pixel positions (rows and columns) to understand the relationship between the shapes and the new pixels. I identify them from the input and output. I recognize the column positions of the \"peaks\" (highest points) of the bottom triangle shapes in Example 1, at columns 1, 7, and 14.\n*   **Color Discrepancy:** The middle newly appeared pixel in the output is *blue*, whereas the other two are *maroon*! This sparks my curiosity.\n*   **L-Shape and Vector:** I start thinking about the L-shape at the top of the input. I have a hunch it might have something to do with the new pixel positions, but I don't see an obvious geometric relationship. I start wondering if the L-shape \"shoots\" something, thus creating a change in the pixels that will make the pixels change color to blue.\n*   **Height Discrepency:** I can see the height difference and that the triangles are the source. There is the floating new pixel between them. It is 5 units apart from each of the triangles.\n*   **Look for Pattern**: I re-examine and write out the shapes that I found. I have the \"L\" shape on top and the \"upside down V\" shapes on the bottom. In the middle, the new floating pixels show the same pattern as the other shapes. I wonder about colors, and if the colors have anything to do with this pattern.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n\n*   **Different Shapes:** The focus of the example 2 is the upside down Vs, but I call them \"mountains\". I am looking at the output, and I see a change in color to the pixels.\n*   **Height again:** The peaks of the triangles, and they appear on the output grid 5 units above.\n*   **Missing Pixel:** The output in the grid doesn't always have one of the floating pixels! I need to understand why! Is there a missing base?\n*   **Valid Triangle Rule:** I realize, to generate a pixel at the top, a \"triangle\" must be complete, with a peak and two bases, on the same color. Only these \"peaks\" make the floating pixels.\n\nI now have a rule: if there's a triangle, with the three pixels being the same color, a new pixel of color 9 will appear 5 rows above the triangle's peak.\n\n**Back to Example 1, but with New Information:**\n\n*   **Application of New Rule:** I can now explain the new pixels in Example 1: they are 5 rows above the peaks of the triangles!\n*   **Blue Pixel Mystery:** I still need to know *why* that middle pixel is blue. I think this difference is related to the top L-shape. The L-shape could be blocking or modifying the pixel.\n*   **Shape Analysis:** I think I see a pattern to the shapes. The orientation might have something to do with something.\n\n**Example 3 Analysis:**\n\n*   **New Shapes:** In this example, I see new \"gamma\" shapes (2, 2/ 2), I also find similar shapes at the bottom.\n*   **More Output Differences:** It's the same pattern: some new pixels appear at the top. I see a shift in the position of pixels. It looks like the same shapes, but shifted.\n*   **Position Shift:** The new pixels at row 1 are shifted by a consistent amount (row and column) compared to shapes at the bottom. I identify these shifts.\n*   **Collision Rule:** It looks like there's a projectile from each shape, shifted from the original, and it can land. if there is something in the destination, the color of that thing changes (to color 9). I identify the two collision rules. I am now able to apply this \"collision rule\" to future examples.\n*   **Collision = Color Change:**\n\nThe logic for solving this task involves identifying \"shooters\" (shapes) and their corresponding \"projectiles\" (new pixels).\n\n**1. Identification of Shapes and Firing Rules:**\nWe analyze the input grid to find small patterns of non-background colors (colors other than 7). These shapes determine the direction and target of a projectile. The background is orange (7).\n\n*   **Triangle Shapes (Hollow or filled 3-pixel pyramids):**\n    *   **Up-Pointing Triangle:** Peak at `(r, c)`, base at `(r+1, c-1)` and `(r+1, c+1)`.\n        *   **Action:** Fires a projectile UP. Target: `(r-5, c)`.\n    *   **Down-Pointing Triangle:** Peak at `(r, c)`, base at `(r-1, c-1)` and `(r-1, c+1)`.\n        *   **Action:** Fires a projectile DOWN. Target: `(r+5, c)`.\n    *   **Left-Pointing Triangle:** Peak at `(r, c)`, base at `(r-1, c+1)` and `(r+1, c+1)`.\n        *   **Action:** Fires a projectile LEFT. Target: `(r, c-5)`.\n    *   **Right-Pointing Triangle:** (Not present in test, but logically implied) Fires RIGHT. Target: `(r, c+5)`.\n\n*   **Gamma/L Shapes (3-pixel corners):**\n    *   These shapes fill a 2x2 bounding box with 3 pixels, leaving one corner empty. The *filled* corner determines the direction.\n    *   **Top-Left Filled (`XX` / `X.`):** Fires diagonally UP-LEFT. Target: `(r-5, c-5)` from the top-left pixel.\n    *   **Bottom-Left Filled (`X.` / `XX`):** Fires diagonally DOWN-LEFT. Target: `(r+5, c-5)` from the bottom-left pixel. (Seen in Ex 1).\n    *   **Top-Right Filled (`XX` / `.X`):** Fires diagonally UP-RIGHT. Target: `(r-5, c+5)` from the top-right pixel.\n    *   **Bottom-Right Filled (`.X` / `XX`):** Fires diagonally DOWN-RIGHT. Target: `(r+5, c+5)` from the bottom-right pixel.\n\n**2. Interaction Rules:**\n*   **Standard Projectile:** Creates a pixel of color **9** (maroon) at the target location.\n*   **Collision (Projectile vs Projectile):** If two projectiles land on the same empty coordinate, the resulting pixel is color **1** (blue).\n*   **Collision (Projectile vs Shape):** If a projectile lands on an existing shape, the projectile does not appear as a separate pixel; instead, the **entire shape** changes its color to **9**.\n\n**3. Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Shape A (Top-Left):** Pixels `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)` (Color 6).\n    *   Type: **Bottom-Right Filled L**. Corner at `(3,2)`.\n    *   Vector: `(+5, +5)`. Target: `(8, 7)`.\n*   **Shape B1 (Top-Middle):** Pixels `(2,8), (2,10), (3,9)` (Color 6).\n    *   Type: **Down-Pointing Triangle**. Peak at `(3,9)`.\n    *   Vector: `(+5, 0)`. Target: `(8, 9)`.\n*   **Shape B2 (Top-Middle):** Pixels `(5,9), (6,8), (6,10)` (Color 6).\n    *   Type: **Up-Pointing Triangle**. Peak at `(5,9)`.\n    *   Vector: `(-5, 0)`. Target: `(0, 9)`.\n*   **Shape C (Left):** Pixels `(3,14), (4,13), (5,14)` (Color 6).\n    *   Type: **Left-Pointing Triangle**. Peak at `(4,13)`.\n    *   Vector: `(0, -5)`. Target: `(4, 8)`.\n*   **Shape D (Left, below A):** Pixels `(7,2), (8,1), (8,3)` (Color 6).\n    *   Type: **Up-Pointing Triangle**. Peak at `(7,2)`.\n    *   Vector: `(-5, 0)`. Target: `(2, 2)`.\n    *   **Conflict:** Target `(2,2)` is part of **Shape A**.\n    *   **Result:** **Shape A** turns color **9**.\n*   **Shape E (Bottom-Left):** Pixels `(13,4), (14,3), (14,5)` (Color 6).\n    *   Type: **Up-Pointing Triangle**. Peak at `(13,4)`.\n    *   Vector: `(-5, 0)`. Target: `(8, 4)`.\n*   **Shape F (Bottom-Right):** Pixels `(14,8), (14,9), (15,9)` (Color 6).\n    *   Type: **Top-Right Filled Gamma**. Corner at `(14,9)`.\n    *   Vector: `(-5, +5)`. Target: `(9, 14)`.\n*   **Shape G (Bottom-Right):** Pixels `(14,14), (15,13), (15,15)` (Color 6).\n    *   Type: **Up-Pointing Triangle**. Peak at `(14,14)`.\n    *   Vector: `(-5, 0)`. Target: `(9, 14)`.\n    *   **Conflict:** Both F and G target `(9, 14)`.\n    *   **Result:** Pixel at `(9, 14)` becomes color **1** (Blue).\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\n1.  Copy input grid.\n2.  Change Shape A (pixels at `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)`) to color **9**.\n3.  Add new pixel **9** at `(0, 9)`.\n4.  Add new pixel **9** at `(4, 8)`.\n5.  Add new pixel **9** at `(8, 4)`.\n6.

What *actually* happened?\"\n  3. **Verdict:** \"Do they match?\"\n- **Fatal Contradictions to Watch For:**\n  * **Scope Error:** Rule applies to specific colors (e.g., \"Blue\"), but the example changes \"Red\" pixels.\n  * **Geometry Error:** Rule says \"rotate 90,\" but example shows a flip.\n  * **Object Error:** Rule treats pixels individually, but example shows objects moving as blocks.\n- *Constraint:* Record exactly how many Solved Examples the candidate PASSED vs FAILED. **Do not stop at the first failure**; check all examples to determine the severity of the failure (e.g., \"Passed 2/3 Examples\").\n\n### PHASE 3: EXECUTION CONSISTENCY\n- For Candidates that survived Phase 2 (or passed at least one example):\n- Look at the {{TEST_INPUT}} and the Candidate's <PROPOSED_SOLUTION> grid.\n- Does the proposed output actually follow the Crystallized Rule?\n- *Common Hallucination:* The text says \"Move Blue,\" but the grid shows Blue staying still. Mark this as **INTERNAL_CONTRADICTION**.\n\n### PHASE 4: STACK RANKING & TIE-BREAKING\n- Rank ALL candidates from Best to Worst based on this hierarchy:\n  1. **GOLD (Tier 1):** Passed ALL Solved Examples + Consistent Execution on Test Input.\n  2. **SILVER (Tier 2):** Passed ALL Solved Examples + Minor Execution Error on Test Input.\n  3. **BRONZE (Tier 3):** Passed MOST Solved Examples (Partial Logic).\n  4. **INVALID (Tier 4):** Failed ALL/MOST Solved Examples, Vague Reasoning, or Severe Internal Contradictions.\n\n- **Tie-Breaking:** If two candidates are in the same Tier, rank the one with the **Simplest Rule** (Occam's Razor) higher.\n</AUDIT_PROTOCOL>\n\n<OUTPUT_FORMAT>\nReturn a single JSON object with the following structure:\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 0,\n      \"score\": 8.7,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Partial\"\n          /* add more keys if there are more training examples */\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Rule matches main behaviors across examples; minor ambiguity in example 3.\"\n      },\n      \"test_grid_consistency\": \"Plausible\",\n      \"rule_summary\": \"Short, 1-3 sentence description of this candidate's representative rule.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 1,\n      \"score\": 6.0,\n      \"tier\": \"INVALID\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Partial\",\n          \"2\": \"Fail\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Contradiction in example 2; seems overfit\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</OUTPUT_FORMAT>",
                "response": "**Comprehensive ARC Puzzle Analysis and Candidate Solution Audit**\n\nMy task is to meticulously evaluate four proposed solutions for an ARC puzzle involving 16x16 grids. The core challenge involves understanding how small colored structures within an orange (7) background grid transform to produce a new output grid. I need to break down the logic of each candidate solution and assess its accuracy and completeness.\n\n**Phase 1: Puzzle Decomposition and Pattern Recognition**\n\nI begin by dissecting the provided examples. The puzzle's essence lies in identifying the color and shape of the small structures and how they determine the output.  The initial examples reveal that the puzzle revolves around \"Up-Triangle\" and \"L-shape\" (and the missing corners). I see that \"Up-Triangles\" consistently \"shoot\" a color 9 marker 5 rows up.\n\nFor L-shapes, the rule is less obvious. After close examination of Example 1, I hypothesize that an L-shape \"shoots\" in a specific diagonal direction.\n\nExample 2 confirms the \"Up-Triangle shoots up\" pattern. Example 3 reveals that the L-shape shifts by (-5,-5) if the top-left corner is not filled.\n\nTo solidify my understanding, I meticulously analyze the coordinates of the shapes and their corresponding pixels in the input and output grids.\n\n**Phase 2: Candidate Solution Audit and Validation**\n\nI dive into the core of the audit, evaluating each candidate solution. I begin with Candidate 12 (Model E), which I quickly recognize as the most promising. Model E suggests that L-shapes shoot based on their missing corners (i.e. if the top-left corner is missing, the marker moves bottom right). It gives the 8-directional shots for each missing corner (missing BR shoots TL, etc).\n\nCandidate 12's logic provides an explanation for the complex behavior exhibited in Example 1, where the L-shape produces a blue pixel (1) and a maroon (9) pixel at a specific location, seemingly through a collision. I find this especially elegant and convincing.\nI thoroughly test Model E with a new test input to confirm the 8-way logic.\nI then start to construct the target grid, based on Candidate 12. I go through the motions and mark down the locations.\nI can reproduce the predicted color and position for the 9s and also the 1.\nI analyze the \"Missing BL\" scenario to confirm Candidate 12's claims. The directional changes I see are exactly as predicted.\n\nOther candidate solutions quickly fall apart. Candidate 0 contains a critical flaw: Candidate 0 failed the 8-way L shape directional logic by treating all shapes like they were just up/down. Candidate 5 fails. Candidate 10 fails. Candidate 15 fails.\n\n**Phase 3: Validation, Accuracy Assessment, and Conclusion**\n\nCandidate 12 is the only one I can confirm.\n\nI then check and double check Candidate 12's logic, including all edge cases. I test the model.\nIt turns out that candidate 12, after some testing, shows that it accurately predicts the transformations exhibited.\n\nMy final judgment:\nCandidate 12 is the only accurate and comprehensive solution.\n\n**Final Solution Summary:**\nModel E is Gold.\nThe others are invalid.\n\n\n<AUDIT_LOG>\n### PHASE 1: LOGIC SELECTION & CRYSTALLIZATION\n**Candidate Selected:** Candidate 12 (Reasoning Model E)\n\n**Reasoning Analysis:**\nThe candidate provides a highly detailed geometric rule set based on \"Shooters\" (3-pixel shapes) and \"Projectiles\" (Markers).\n- **Core Concept:** 3-pixel shapes shoot a marker exactly 5 units away.\n- **Direction Rules:**\n  1. **Up-Triangle:** Shoots UP `(-5, 0)`.\n  2. **Down-Triangle:** Shoots DOWN `(+5, 0)`.\n  3. **Left-Triangle:** Shoots LEFT `(0, -5)`.\n  4. **Right-Triangle:** Shoots RIGHT `(0, +5)`.\n  5. **L-Shapes (Corner Logic):** The direction is determined by the \"missing\" corner of the 2x2 bounding box. The projectile flies towards the *opposite* (filled) diagonal direction.\n     - Missing Top-Left -> Shoots Bottom-Right `(+5, +5)`.\n     - Missing Top-Right -> Shoots Bottom-Left `(+5, -5)`.\n     - Missing Bottom-Left -> Shoots Top-Right `(-5, +5)`.\n     - Missing Bottom-Right -> Shoots Top-Left `(-5, -5)`.\n- **Interaction Rules:**\n  1. **Empty Target:** Place Marker 9.\n  2. **Collision (Marker + Marker):** Place Marker 1 (Blue).\n  3. **Hit (Marker + Shape):** The entire target shape turns to Color 9.\n- **Anchor Point:** For triangles, it's the tip. For L-shapes, it's the corner pixel (the one with 2 neighbors).\n\n### PHASE 2: THE GROUND TRUTH AUDIT\n**Example 1:**\n- **Input:**\n  - Up-Triangles at bottom (Tips at row 14).\n  - One L-shape at top (Rows 3-4, Cols 12-13). Pixels: (3,12), (4,12), (4,13). This shape fills TR, BL, BR of the 2x2 box. It is **Missing Top-Right**.\n- **Hypothesis (Candidate 12):**\n  - Up-Triangles shoot Up to Row 9 (Color 9).\n  - The L-Shape (Missing TR) shoots Bottom-Left `(+5, -5)`.\n    - Anchor is Bottom-Left pixel of the L? Or the \"Corner\" pixel (4,12)? The candidate defines the anchor as the \"vertex\" (pixel with 2 neighbors). For this L-shape, (4,12) has neighbors (3,12) and (4,13). So Anchor is (4,12).\n    - Target: `(4+5, 12-5)` = `(9, 7)`.\n  - The middle Up-Triangle has its tip at `(14, 7)`. It shoots Up `(-5, 0)` to `(9, 7)`.\n  - **Collision:** Two markers land at `(9, 7)`. Result should be **Color 1**.\n- **Observation:** The Official Output has `9`s at `(9,1)` and `(9,14)`, and a **`1` at `(9,7)`**.\n- **Verdict:** **PERFECT PASS**. This is the only candidate that explains the \"Blue Pixel\" anomaly logically without dismissing it as random.\n\n**Example 2:**\n- **Input:** Multiple Up-Triangles.\n- **Hypothesis:** All shoot Up `(-5, 0)`.\n- **Observation:** All markers appear 5 rows above tips.\n- **Verdict:** **PASS**.\n\n**Example 3:**\n- **Input:** Various L-shapes and Triangles.\n  - Top L-shapes (Row 6) are Missing Bottom-Right.\n  - Hypothesis: Shoot Top-Left `(-5, -5)`. Target Row 1.\n  - Middle L-shape (Row 11) is Missing Bottom-Right. Shoots Top-Left to `(6, 8)`.\n  - Target `(6, 8)` is occupied by a shape.\n  - Hypothesis: The shape at `(6, 8)` turns to Color 9.\n- **Observation:** Output shows Row 1 markers shifted left (matches `(-5, -5)`). Output shows the shape at `(6, 8)` turned to Color 9.\n- **Verdict:** **PERFECT PASS**.\n\n### PHASE 3: EXECUTION CONSISTENCY\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n- **Shape A (L-Shape):** `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)`. Missing Top-Left. Anchor `(3,2)`.\n  - Action: Shoot Bottom-Right `(+5, +5)` -> Target `(8, 7)`.\n- **Shape B (Down-Triangle):** Tip `(3,9)`.\n  - Action: Shoot Down `(+5, 0)` -> Target `(8, 9)`.\n- **Shape C (Left-Triangle):** Tip `(4,13)`.\n  - Action: Shoot Left `(0, -5)` -> Target `(4, 8)`.\n- **Shape D (Up-Triangle):** Tip `(7,2)`.\n  - Action: Shoot Up `(-5, 0)` -> Target `(2, 2)`.\n  - **Hit:** `(2,2)` is part of Shape A. **Shape A turns 9**.\n- **Shape E (Up-Triangle):** Tip `(13,4)`.\n  - Action: Shoot Up `(-5, 0)` -> Target `(8, 4)`.\n- **Shape F (L-Shape):** `(14,8), (14,9), (15,9)`. Missing Bottom-Left. Anchor `(14,9)`.\n  - Action: Shoot Top-Right `(-5, +5)` -> Target `(9, 14)`.\n- **Shape G (Up-Triangle):** Tip `(14,14)`.\n  - Action: Shoot Up `(-5, 0)` -> Target `(9, 14)`.\n  - **Collision:** F and G both hit `(9, 14)`. **Pixel becomes 1**.\n\n**Proposed Grid Check:**\n- Row 2: `...9...` (Shape A converted). **Consistent.**\n- Row 3: `...99...` (Shape A converted). **Consistent.**\n- Row 4: `...9...` at col 8 (Shape C marker). **Consistent.**\n- Row 8: `...9...9...9...` at cols 4, 7, 9. (Shape E, A, B markers). **Consistent.**\n- Row 9: `...1...` at col 14 (Collision). **Consistent.**\n\n### PHASE 4: STACK RANKING\n1.  **Candidate 12 (Tier 1):** The logic is flawless. It identifies the orientation-based firing rules that explain every nuance of the examples (including the rare Blue pixel and collision transformations). The execution on the Test Input is perfectly consistent with these rules.\n2.  **Candidate 0 (Tier 3):** It identified the \"V-shape\" rule but failed to generalize the \"Shooter\" logic to other shapes (L-shapes, Down-Triangles). It missed the explanation for the Blue pixel in Ex 1 and failed to predict the collision in the Test Input.\n3.  **Candidate 5 (Tier 4):** Hallucinated a \"Typo\" for the Blue pixel. Logic is insufficient.\n4.  **Candidate 10 (Tier 4):** Dismissed the Blue pixel as \"irrelevant\". Logic is insufficient.\n5.  **Candidate 15 (Tier 4):** Invented a \"closest to center\" rule to explain the Blue pixel, which contradicts the deterministic geometry of the puzzle.\n\n**Final Verdict:** Candidate 12 is the only robust solution.\n</AUDIT_LOG>\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 12,\n      \"score\": 10.0,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"Correctly identified that 3-pixel shapes 'shoot' markers 5 units away based on their missing corner/orientation.

Task**\n\nOkay, so the task is to predict the output grid given some input and examples. The goal seems to be to manipulate shapes with different colors. My thought process here involved carefully dissecting the provided examples. The first thing I noticed was these distinct \"V\" shapes composed of a single pixel on top and two on the bottom. I observed that these shapes, or sometimes other shapes, appear to move or trigger some transformation.\n\nExample 1 showed a grid primarily orange (7) with some maroon (9) shapes and some other shape. I saw that, in the output, one of the maroon \"V\" shapes had a blue pixel (1) in the center, and the main thing I saw in the output was that row 9 seemed to be a modified version of row 14 from the input. I suspected that row 9 was related to a particular shape in row 14, and there was also a smaller shape (L-shape) in rows 3,4. I initially thought it was a copy, but it seemed more like some kind of transformation. The L-shape and V shape are different.\n\nExample 2 had grey (0) and maroon (9) shapes. The output had single maroon (9) pixels in various locations. I saw that the output 9s were at the \"heads\" of the shapes and that the shapes were shifted upwards.\n\nExample 3 had red (2) shapes and the output had a combination of reds, maroons, and other colors. I got confused by the flag shapes, but ultimately realized they were similar to the V shapes, but \"lying down\". I saw that one shape changed to maroon, and the outputs had horizontal-vertical shift offsets.\n\nBased on these examples, I'm forming a few hypotheses: there are primary shapes (V shapes).\nThere are \"other\" shapes. The other shapes may be important. There is a shift involved (usually 5 rows). There's collision detection: If a shape moves to another pixel that is not an empty 7, the target pixel may become a different color. If there's no collision, place a new pixel in the target location, of a specific \"indicator\" color. The color of the indicator is almost always the same as the shape, unless there's a collision.\n\nI started to test this with the Test Input. First, I identify the existing shape types in the Test Input (Gamma, V shape, Flag-Inv, and Complex shapes). Based on Example 1, I suspected the L shape had something to do with the transformation, I found a few V shapes in the test input. Then, I decided the standard transformation involved shifting V-shaped objects upwards by 5 rows and a horizontal offset that's probably zero. Then, I found the positions of the target pixels.\n\nNext, I looked at which shapes had a partner, such as a vertical alignment. The Test Input has the Gamma shape, the Inverted V shape, and some other shapes aligned with the V shapes. I identified a \"Collision\" in the case that the target location has a shape in the way. I identified this by searching for shapes along the path between the original V and the location it should move to, or if the \"destination\" pixel of a shape is occupied.\n\nIn cases of collision, the \"obstacle\" turns the indicator color (maroon). In cases of no collision, create the pixel. Finally, I preserved all other pixels that weren't hit by a path and didn't have collisions.\n\nFinally, I checked my predictions again and ensured all shapes were accounted for. So that's how I identified the patterns: shape shifting, \"collision\" triggers, and color assignment.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the rules inferred from three examples.\n\n**Inferred Rules:**\n1.  **Identify \"V-shapes\"**: These are distinct shapes consisting of 3 pixels: one \"head\" pixel in a row, and two \"feet\" pixels in the row below it, diagonally adjacent to the head.\n    *   Example 1 (color 9) and Example 2 (color 0) show these shapes moving.\n    *   In the Test Input, these shapes are color 6 (magenta). We find 4 such shapes with heads at coordinates: `(5,9)`, `(7,2)`, `(13,4)`, and `(14,14)`.\n\n2.  **Transformation Vector**: The examples show that these shapes project a \"marker\" or \"beam\" to a new location.\n    *   In Examples 1 and 2, the marker appears **5 rows above** the head of the V-shape (offset `-5` rows, `0` cols).\n    *   In Example 3, the shape was different (a flag), and the offset was `-5` rows, `-5` cols. Since our shapes in the Test Input are symmetric V-shapes like in Ex 1 and 2, we use the offset **(-5, 0)**.\n\n3.  **Interaction/Collision Logic**:\n    *   **Empty Target**: If the target location (5 rows up) is empty (background color 7) and the path is clear, a single pixel of color **9** (maroon) is created at the target location.\n    *   **Occupied Target/Path**: If the target location is occupied by another shape, or if the \"beam\" passes through another shape on its way to the target, that obstructing shape **changes its color to 9**. The marker is \"absorbed\" by the shape.\n    *   Original V-shapes remain unchanged.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n1.  **V-shape 1**: Head at `(5,9)`. Target is `(0,9)`.\n    *   The path goes through `(3,9)`.\n    *   `(3,9)` is part of an \"Inverted V\" shape (pixels at `(2,8), (2,10), (3,9)`).\n    *   **Action**: The Inverted V shape is hit. Change pixels `(2,8), (2,10), (3,9)` from 6 to **9**.\n\n2.  **V-shape 2**: Head at `(7,2)`. Target is `(2,2)`.\n    *   The target `(2,2)` is occupied by a \"Gamma\" shape (pixels at `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)`).\n    *   **Action**: The Gamma shape is hit.

Inferred rule from the examples\n\n### 1.1. Objects and background\n\n- The background color is 7 (it fills most of each grid).\n- Every non\u20117 cell belongs to some **object**.\n- Objects are defined using **8\u2011connectivity**: cells of the same color that touch horizontally, vertically, or diagonally are in the same object.\n\n### 1.2. \u201cProjectile\u201d behavior\n\nFor each object:\n\n1. **Classify its shape** in its minimal bounding box (all examples and the test use small 3\u2011pixel shapes).  \n   Only two shape types actually matter for the test:\n\n   - **V\u2011shape** (three pixels):\n\n     In its bounding box (2 rows \u00d7 3 columns) it looks like:\n     ```\n     . x .\n     x . x\n     ```\n     (coordinates relative to top-left of box: (0,1), (1,0), (1,2))\n\n   - **\u0393\u2011shape with leg on the right** (\u201cgamma\u2011right\u201d):\n\n     In its bounding box (2 rows \u00d7 2 columns) it looks like:\n     ```\n     x x\n     . x\n     ```\n     (coords: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1))\n\n   (A mirror \u201cgamma\u2011left\u201d `xx / x.` also appears in Example 3; its direction is up\u2011left, but that isn\u2019t needed for new directions in the test\u2014only to understand the mechanism.)\n\n2. **Choose the emission point (\u201chighest point\u201d)**:\n   - Find the **minimum row index** of the object (topmost row).\n   - Among cells on that row:\n     - For V\u2011shapes: that row has a single pixel; that pixel is the emission point.\n     - For gamma\u2011shapes: that row has two pixels;  \n       - For **gamma\u2011left** (`xx / x.`): use the **left** of the two.  \n       - For **gamma\u2011right** (`xx / .x`): use the **right** of the two.\n\n3. **Choose the direction according to shape type**:\n   - V\u2011shape: projectile goes **straight up**: direction vector `(-1, 0)`.\n   - Gamma\u2011left (`xx / x.`): projectile goes **up\u2011left**: `(-1, -1)`.\n   - Gamma\u2011right (`xx / .x`): projectile goes **up\u2011right**: `(-1, +1)`.\n\n4. **Range and collision**:\n   - The projectile has a **fixed maximum range of 5 steps**.\n   - Starting at the emission point, move step by step in the chosen direction:\n     - Step 1: position = `p1 = p0 + d`\n     - Step 2: `p2 = p0 + 2d`\n     - \u2026\n     - Step 5: `p5 = p0 + 5d`\n   - If at any step the position would go **outside the grid**, the projectile is **aborted entirely** (no new pixel, no recolor).\n   - Otherwise, as you step:\n     - If you first land on a cell that is **not background 7** (i.e., some other object), then:\n       - The projectile **hits that target object**.\n       - The entire target object is **recolored to 9**.\n       - No \u201cendpoint\u201d pixel is created for this projectile.\n     - If you reach step 5 without hitting any object:\n       - The projectile **stops at that step\u20115 cell**, and you paint that cell **9**.\n\n5. **All projectiles are computed on the original grid**:\n   - You determine hits and endpoints based on the original object layout.\n   - Then you:\n     - Recolor all hit objects to 9.\n     - Add all endpoint pixels as 9.\n   - These can happen simultaneously (an object can both shoot and be recolored by someone else, as seen in Example 3).\n\nThis procedure reproduces Example 2 perfectly, and Example 3 including the diagonal hit where the middle gamma object recolors another. (Example 1 has a single anomalous pixel color, but the spatial behavior matches.)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Apply the rule to the test input\n\n### 2.1. List all non\u20117 cells and group into 8\u2011connected objects\n\nTest grid (16\u00d716). Non\u20117 cells are all color 6.\n\nList of 6s (row, col):\n\n- Row 2:  (2,2), (2,8), (2,10)\n- Row 3:  (3,1), (3,2), (3,9), (3,14)\n- Row 4:  (4,13)\n- Row 5:  (5,9), (5,14)\n- Row 6:  (6,8), (6,10)\n- Row 7:  (7,2)\n- Row 8:  (8,1), (8,3)\n- Row 13: (13,4)\n- Row 14: (14,3), (14,5), (14,8), (14,9), (14,14)\n- Row 15: (15,9), (15,13), (15,15)\n\nNow group by 8\u2011connectivity (taking neighbors within \u0394row \u2264 1 and \u0394col \u2264 1):\n\nObjects (I\u2019ll label them O1..O8):\n\n1. **O1** = { (2,2), (3,1), (3,2) }  \n   (a 3\u2011pixel L in rows 2\u20133, cols 1\u20132)\n\n2. **O2** = { (2,8), (2,10), (3,9) }  \n   (a V\u2011like cluster in rows 2\u20133, cols 8\u201310)\n\n3. **O3** = { (3,14), (4,13), (5,14) }\n\n4. **O4** = { (5,9), (6,8), (6,10) }\n\n5. **O5** = { (7,2), (8,1), (8,3) }\n\n6. **O6** = { (13,4), (14,3), (14,5) }\n\n7. **O7** = { (14,8), (14,9), (15,9) }\n\n8. **O8** = { (14,14), (15,13), (15,15) }\n\nAll of these are separate under 8\u2011connectivity.\n\n### 2.2. Classify shapes and emission directions\n\nWe only care about objects whose emission point is at least 5 steps from the \u201ctop\u201d in their direction; however, classification first:\n\nUse local bounding boxes:\n\n- **O4** { (5,9), (6,8), (6,10) }  \n  Bounding rows 5\u20136, cols 8\u201310:\n\n  ```\n  row 5: . 6 .   \u2192 . x .\n  row 6: 6 . 6   \u2192 x . x\n  ```\n  This is the **V\u2011shape** `.x./x.x`.  \n  \u2192 Direction: **up** (`d = (-1, 0)`).\n\n- **O5** { (7,2), (8,1), (8,3) }  \n  Bounding rows 7\u20138, cols 1\u20133:\n\n  ```\n  row 7: . 6 .   \u2192 . x .\n  row 8: 6 . 6   \u2192 x . x\n  ```\n  Also V\u2011shape.  \n  \u2192 Direction: **up**.\n\n- **O6** { (13,4), (14,3), (14,5) }  \n  Bounding rows 13\u201314, cols 3\u20135:\n\n  ```\n  row 13: . 6 .  \u2192 . x .\n  row 14: 6 . 6  \u2192 x . x\n  ```\n  V\u2011shape.  \n  \u2192 Direction: **up**.\n\n- **O7** { (14,8), (14,9), (15,9) }  \n  Bounding rows 14\u201315, cols 8\u20139:\n\n  ```\n  row 14: 6 6   \u2192 x x\n  row 15: . 6   \u2192 . x\n  ```\n  This is gamma\u2011right `xx / .x`.  \n  \u2192 Direction: **up\u2011right** (`d = (-1, +1)`).  \n  Emission point = top\u2011right of the two top cells \u2192 (14,9).\n\n- **O8** { (14,14), (15,13), (15,15) }  \n  Bounding rows 14\u201315, cols 13\u201315:\n\n  ```\n  row 14: . 6 . \u2192 . x .\n  row 15: 6 . 6 \u2192 x . x\n  ```\n  Again a V\u2011shape.  \n  \u2192 Direction: **up**.\n\nThe other three objects are too close to the top to fire a 5\u2011step projectile while staying on the grid:\n\n- **O1** min row = 2  (< 5) \u2192 its 5\u2011step path up would exit the grid \u2192 **no shot by itself**.\n- **O2** min row = 2  (< 5) \u2192 **no shot**.\n- **O3** min row = 3  (< 5) \u2192 **no shot**.\n\n(They can however be **targets** of other projectiles.)\n\nSo only O4, O5, O6, O7, O8 will emit projectiles.\n\n### 2.3. Compute projectile paths and collisions\n\nWe always use the **original** positions of objects (all 6s) to decide collisions.\n\n#### O4: V\u2011shape at { (5,9), (6,8), (6,10) }\n\n- Highest row in O4: row = 5, only cell (5,9).\n- Emission point: (5,9)\n- Direction: up \u2192 `d = (-1, 0)`\n- Steps (max 5):\n\n  1.

(13,10)\n  2. (12,11)\n  3. (11,12)\n  4. (10,13)\n  5. (9,14)\n\n  All these positions are 7 in the original grid.\n\n- Result:\n  - **Endpoint at (9,14)** painted 9.\n\n#### O8: V\u2011shape at { (14,14), (15,13), (15,15) }\n\n- Highest row: 14, emission point (14,14)\n- Direction: up `(-1,0)`\n- Steps:\n\n  1.

Inferred transformation\n\nAll examples are 16\u00d716 grids with background color `7` and one other \u201cobject\u201d color:\n\n- Example 1: object color `9`\n- Example 2: object color `0`\n- Example 3: object color `2`\n- Test: object color `6`\n\nThe output always keeps the original grid and adds some `9`s according to the structure of the object-color cells.\n\n### 1.1. Connected components of the object color\n\nTake all cells whose color \u2260 7. Group them into **8-connected components** (neighbors can touch horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).\n\nFor each component, we will use its **top row** (smallest row index inside that component).\n\nWithin that top row of a component, the object-color cells may appear in one or more contiguous horizontal blocks (e.g. columns `[5,6]` is one block; `[8]` is another block).\n\nLet:\n\n- `r_min` = that component\u2019s minimum row index (its top row)\n- On row `r_min`, the component has one or more contiguous column blocks; for each such block, let `c_block_min` be the smallest column in that block.\n\nAlso compute:\n\n- `global_cmin` = the minimum column index over **all** object-color cells in the grid.\n\n### 1.2. Rule A: project the top blocks upward by 5 rows\n\nFor every component and each top-row block:\n\n- Compute:\n  - `dest_row = r_min - 5`\n  - `dest_col = c_block_min - global_cmin`\n- If `dest_row \u2265 0` and `0 \u2264 dest_col < width`, set `output[dest_row][dest_col] = 9`.\n\nThis explains:\n\n- Example 2 exactly: each 8-connected cluster of `0`s contributes 1 `9` at row `r_min - 5`, same column (since there `global_cmin = 0`).\n- Example 1 (bottom cluster of `9`s): bottom cluster is one big 8-connected component whose top row is `14` with cells in columns `1, 7, 14`. Each of those three isolated columns is its own block, so we place `9`s at row `14 - 5 = 9` in columns `1, 7, 14` (the provided output has `1` instead of `9` at (9,7), which appears to be a typo).\n- Example 3:\n  - Object color `2` has `global_cmin = 5`.\n  - Top block at rows 6\u20137 has 4 components; each has a top contiguous block of width 2 (e.g. columns `[5,6]`, `[8,9]`, \u2026), so we use `c_block_min` = 5, 8, 11, 14 and place `9`s at row `6 - 5 = 1`, columns `5-5=0`, `8-5=3`, `11-5=6`, `14-5=9`.   \n    \u2192 matches row 1 of the output.\n  - Bottom block at rows 14\u201315 similarly maps to row `14 - 5 = 9` with columns `0,3,6,9`.   \n    \u2192 matches row 9 of the output.\n  - The small middle component at rows 11\u201312, columns `[13,14]`, has top row 11, block `[13,14]`, so we place a `9` at `(11-5=6, 13-5=8)`, matching the `9` at (6,8).\n\nSo Rule A matches all examples (modulo that single suspicious `1` in example 1).\n\n### 1.3. Rule B: highlight overlapping pattern shifted by (5,5)\n\nExample 3 has additional `9`s at (6,9) and (7,8), which don\u2019t come from Rule A. Those are explained by a second effect seen only when the object pattern is self-repeated with a shift of (5,5).\n\nFor every object-color cell `(r,c)`:\n\n- If `r \u2265 5`, `c \u2265 5`, and the cell `(r-5, c-5)` **also** had the object color in the input,\n- Then set `output[r-5][c-5] = 9`.\n\nThis effectively finds all pairs of object-color cells separated by vector (5,5) and marks the **upper-left** one with `9`.\n\nIn Example 3:\n\n- The middle component at `(11,13), (11,14), (12,13)` has corresponding cells `(6,8), (6,9), (7,8)` above-left, all of which are also `2`s. These three positions are turned into `9`s.\n- No such overlapping `(r, c)` and `(r-5, c-5)` pairs exist in Examples 1 and 2, so Rule B adds nothing there.\n\nIn the **test** grid, there are no 6-cells such that another 6 is exactly 5 rows up and 5 columns left, so Rule B will add nothing; only Rule A applies.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Apply the transformation to the test input\n\n### 2.1. Object cells and components\n\nObject color: `6`.\n\nList all `6` positions (row, col; 0-based):\n\n- Row 2: (2,2), (2,8), (2,10)\n- Row 3: (3,1), (3,2), (3,9), (3,15)\n- Row 4: (4,13)\n- Row 5: (5,9), (5,14)\n- Row 6: (6,8), (6,10)\n- Row 7: (7,2)\n- Row 8: (8,1), (8,3)\n- Row 13: (13,4)\n- Row 14: (14,3), (14,5), (14,8), (14,9), (14,14)\n- Row 15: (15,9), (15,13), (15,15)\n\nGlobal minimum column among all 6s:\n\n- There are 6s at column 1 (e.g. (3,1) and (8,1)), but none at column 0.  \n  \u2192 `global_cmin = 1`.\n\nNow find 8-connected components:\n\n1. **Component A**: {(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)}  \n   (2,2) touches (3,1),(3,2) diagonally/vertically.\n2. **Component B**: {(2,8), (2,10), (3,9)}  \n   2,8 diagonally to 3,9; 3,9 to 2,10, etc.\n3. **Component C**: {(3,15)} (isolated).\n4. **Component D**: {(4,13), (5,14)} (4,13 diagonally to 5,14).\n5. **Component E**: {(5,9), (6,8), (6,10)} (5,9 neighbors 6,8 and 6,10).\n6. **Component F**: {(7,2), (8,1), (8,3)} (7,2 neighbors 8,1 and 8,3).\n7. **Component G**: {(13,4), (14,3), (14,5)} (13,4 neighbors 14,3 and 14,5).\n8. **Component H**: {(14,8), (14,9), (15,9)}.\n9. **Component I**: {(14,14), (15,13), (15,15)} (all mutually 8-connected).\n\n### 2.2. Apply Rule A: top blocks shifted up\n\nFor each component:\n\n- Compute `r_min`.\n- On row `r_min`, find contiguous column blocks; for each block:\n  - `dest_row = r_min - 5`\n  - `dest_col = c_block_min - global_cmin = c_block_min - 1`\n  - If `dest_row \u2265 0`, set that cell to 9.\n\nComponent-wise:\n\n1. **A**: r_min = 2; top row cells: only (2,2) \u2192 block [2].  \n   dest_row = 2 - 5 = -3 < 0 \u2192 no 9.\n2. **B**: r_min = 2; top row cells: (2,8) and (2,10) \u2192 blocks [8] and [10].  \n   dest_row = -3 \u2192 no 9.\n3. **C**: r_min = 3; dest_row = 3 - 5 = -2 \u2192 no 9.\n4. **D**: r_min = 4; dest_row = 4 - 5 = -1 \u2192 no 9.\n5. **E**: r_min = 5; top row cells: (5,9) \u2192 block [9].  \n   dest_row = 5 - 5 = 0  \n   dest_col = 9 - 1 = 8  \n   \u2192 place 9 at (0,8).\n6. **F**: r_min = 7; top row cells: (7,2) \u2192 block [2].  \n   dest_row = 7 - 5 = 2  \n   dest_col = 2 - 1 = 1  \n   \u2192 place 9 at (2,1).\n7. **G**: r_min = 13; top row cells: (13,4) \u2192 block [4].  \n   dest_row = 13 - 5 = 8  \n   dest_col = 4 - 1 = 3  \n   \u2192 place 9 at (8,3).\n8. **H**: r_min = 14; top row cells: (14,8), (14,9) \u2192 contiguous block [8..9], so `c_block_min = 8`.  \n   dest_row = 14 - 5 = 9  \n   dest_col = 8 - 1 = 7  \n   \u2192 place 9 at (9,7).\n9. **I**: r_min = 14; top row cells: (14,14) \u2192 block [14].  \n   dest_row = 14 - 5 = 9  \n   dest_col = 14 - 1 = 13  \n   \u2192 place 9 at (9,13).\n\nSo Rule A adds 9s at:\n- (0,8), (2,1), (8,3), (9,7), (9,13).\n\n### 2.3. Apply Rule B: overlapping 6s shifted by (5,5)\n\nFor each 6 at (r,c) with r \u2265 5 and c \u2265 5, check if (r-5, c-5) is also 6 in the input. If so, set (r-5, c-5) to 9.\n\nCheck all relevant 6s:\n\n- (5,9) \u2192 (0,4) is 7\n- (5,14) \u2192 (0,9) is 7\n- (6,8) \u2192 (1,3) is 7\n- (6,10) \u2192 (1,5) is 7\n- (13,4) \u2192 (8,-1) invalid\n- (14,5) \u2192 (9,0) is 7\n- (14,8) \u2192 (9,3) is 7\n- (14,9) \u2192 (9,4) is 7\n- (14,14) \u2192 (9,9) is 7\n- (15,9) \u2192 (10,4) is 7\n- (15,13) \u2192 (10,8) is 7\n- (15,15) \u2192 (10,10) is 7\n\nNo `(r-5, c-5)` positions are 6 in the input, so Rule B adds no extra 9s for the test.\n\n### 2.4.

What the training examples have in common\n\nIn all three training examples:\n\n- The background color is 7.\n- There is exactly one *other* color \\(P\\) in the input:\n  - Example 1: \\(P = 9\\)\n  - Example 2: \\(P = 0\\)\n  - Example 3: \\(P = 2\\)\n- The non\u20117 pixels form **disjoint connected components of size 3**.\n- Each component is 8\u2011connected and occupies either:\n  - exactly 2 rows (with 1 pixel in one row and 2 in the other), or  \n  - in the test input, we\u2019ll also see a 3\u2011row \u201czigzag\u201d, but that had no training analogue.\n\nFrom the training, two main shapes appear for the 3\u2011pixel components:\n\n1. **V\u2011shapes (triangle\u2011like)**:  \n   2 pixels in one row, 1 pixel in the neighboring row, such that the single pixel is centered between the two.\n   - Example 2 zeros: patterns like  \n     Row r:     `.,0,.`  \n     Row r+1:   `0,.,0`\n   - Example 1 bottom 9\u2019s: similarly `{(14,1),(15,0),(15,2)}`, etc.\n2. **L\u2011shapes**:  \n   2 horizontally adjacent pixels in one row and one pixel in the neighboring row aligned with one of them, e.g.  \n   Row r:     `2,2`  \n   Row r+1:   `2,.`  \n   (and rotations/reflections of this).\n\n### 2. Rule inferred from training\n\nFor each 3\u2011cell component of the non\u20117 color \\(P\\):\n\n1. **Classify its shape** (using just its 3 pixels):\n   - Let the rows that contain pixels be \\(r_1 < r_2\\).  \n   - Count pixels per row: either \\((1,2)\\) or \\((2,1)\\).\n   - If the row with 2 pixels has columns \\((c_{\\min}, c_{\\max})\\) and  \n     the row with 1 pixel has a pixel at column \\(c_A\\) such that  \n     \\(c_A = \\frac{c_{\\min} + c_{\\max}}{2}\\) (i.e., the single pixel is centered between the two), **treat this as a V\u2011type**.\n   - Otherwise (still two rows, counts 1 and 2, but not centered), **treat as an L\u2011type**.\n\n2. **For V\u2011type components**:\n   - Let the **apex** be the row that has only 1 pixel, at \\((r_A, c_A)\\).\n   - In the output, place a 9 at \\((r_A - 5, c_A)\\) if that row index is \u2265 0.\n   - (This matches Example 2 perfectly and matches the bottom triangles of Example 1, apart from the special color 1 in the middle, which I treat as a special case not relevant to new colors.)\n\n3. **For L\u2011type components**:\n   - Let the **pivot** be the \u201cnorth\u2011west\u2011most\u201d pixel of the component:\n     - The pixel with minimal row, and among those, minimal column.\n   - In the output, place a 9 at \\((r_{\\text{pivot}} - 5, c_{\\text{pivot}} - 5)\\) if both row and column indices are \u2265 0.\n   - This exactly reproduces the main pattern of 9\u2019s in Example 3 (those on rows 1, 6 and 9). Extra 9\u2019s in the middle L in Example 3 appear to be additional decoration; the core, consistent behavior across examples is this pivot shift.\n\n4. **All other pixels are left unchanged** (same as input), and if a new 9 lands on a non\u20117 pixel (e.g. overlaps the original foreground color), we simply overwrite it with 9. This happens in Example 3 and is allowed.\n\nWe ignore the special single \u20181\u2019 in Example 1 as a quirk specific to using 9 as both original and \u201cmarker\u201d color; in the test the foreground color is 6, so such an ambiguity does not arise.\n\n### 3. Apply the rule to the test input\n\nForeground color here is \\(P = 6\\).

Here's a summary:**\n\nI started by observing that the input grids were always 16x16 with an orange (7) background and various small \"sprites\" of different colors. I noticed that the output seemed to involve the creation of new sprites or changes to existing ones, but I needed to figure out the underlying logic.\n\nMy initial approach involved comparing the input and output grids and noting changes.  I then moved on to analyzing the provided \"Object Descriptions\" and \"Transformation Description\", but I approached these with some skepticism, and made sure to verify them against the examples. I noticed the rules involved specific shapes like triangles and L-shapes, and their color. My first hypothesis was related to \"markers\" which were projected by the original shapes, and possibly collided and formed 1's or changed the color of existing shapes to 9s.\n\nI meticulously analyzed each example, starting with Example 1. I tried to relate the sprites to outputs to derive my own rules, and not rely on the initial description only. Initially, the presence of just one colored pixel in the output puzzled me, but I eventually connected the dots with the concept of \"collisions\" leading to the creation of a '1' pixel. I observed that the shapes looked like specific \"L\" and Up-Triangle structures.\n\nWith Example 2, I noticed that all sprites were Up-Triangles and followed this movement rule:  move a marker at `(TipRow - 5, TipCol)`.  But this didn't explain the logic in Ex 1.\n\nI went back to Example 1, suspecting that the \"markers\" from a color-9 Up-Triangle might not shoot, and it was the L-shape, that shot a marker.  I eventually arrived at the rule: \"Simple shapes (Triangles) of Color 9 do not produce markers; Complex shapes (Ls) of Color 9 do\". This was crucial.\n\nI realized that the shape's orientation was crucial. I spent quite a while determining which direction the shape's \"corner\" was in.\n\nAfter that, Example 3 confirmed that other shapes (of other colors) produce markers and move.\n\nI then generalized the different moves of different shapes: Up, Down, Left, Right and L-Shapes. The L-shapes could have one of four possible orientations, and the direction and the coordinate change depended on its corner. I deduced that Top-Left L means move (-5, -5), Bottom-Right L means (+5, +5) and so on.\n\nFinally, I applied all the derived rules to the Test Input. Based on my analysis and the hypothesis that ONLY color 9s did not \"shoot\", I arrived at the final solution.\n\nTo solve this challenge, I analyzed the provided examples and derived the transformation rules governing the movement of \"markers\" from source sprites to target locations. Here is the step-by-step logic:\n\n1.  **Identify Sprites**: The input grid contains background pixels (Color 7) and sprite pixels (Color 6 in the test case). I identified connected components of 3 pixels to determine their shape type.\n    *   **Up-Triangle**: A pyramid shape (1 pixel on top, 2 on bottom).

There are four up\u2011pointing triangles (apex at (5,9), (7,2), (13,4), (14,14)), one down\u2011pointing triangle (apex at (3,9)), one left\u2011pointing triangle (apex at (4,13)), and two L\u2011shapes: a bottom\u2011right corner at (3,2) and a top\u2011right corner at (14,9). Each sprite produces a marker displaced by 5 cells in the direction dictated by its type: up triangles go 5 rows up, down triangles 5 rows down, left triangles 5 columns left; L\u2011shapes move to (-5,-5) for top\u2011left, (-5,+5) for top\u2011right, (+5,+5) for bottom\u2011right (and by symmetry +5,\u20115 for bottom\u2011left). Markers are colour 9 unless two land on the same empty background cell, in which case a 1 is placed. If a marker lands on an existing shape cell, the entire shape is recoloured to 9.\n\nApplying this to the test input, the markers land at (0,9), (2,2), (8,4), (9,14), (8,9), (4,8), (9,14), (8,7). The two at (9,14) collide on empty background, producing a 1 there. The marker at (2,2) hits the L\u2011shape at (2,2),(3,1),(3,2), recolouring that shape to 9. All other markers sit on background.

It's about modifying a grid based on shapes and some collision logic. Here's what I've figured out:\n\n1.  **Shape Identification:** I start by identifying connected regions of the foreground color. Then, I define shapes based on 8-connectivity (which means diagonal touching counts!).\n\n2.  **Shape Orientation:**\n    *   **Symmetric:** If a shape is symmetric along a vertical axis (like the upright or downward pointing 'V' shapes in the examples), it \"points\" straight up (or down, if it's mirrored).\n    *   **Asymmetric \"Corners\" (3 pixels in a 2x2 box):** If a shape is a 2x2 block with one corner background, the direction is towards the *opposite* corner.\n\n3.  **Key Pixel Selection:**\n    *   **Symmetric:** Pick the top-most pixel.\n    *   **Corners:**  Find the \"vertex\" - the pixel with 2 connected neighbors.\n\n4.  **Beam Projection:**  From the chosen \"anchor\" pixel, calculate a \"target\" coordinate, based on the shape's orientation and a fixed distance of 5 steps.  If the shape is symmetric (like the triangle) it's a vertical shift. Asymmetric corners need the formula: `target = key_pixel + orientation_vector * 5`. The key point is always the pixel with 2 neighbors.\n\n5.  **Interactions and Rules:**  Now I have a set of projected target points, or beams, for the identified shapes.  I check each pixel on the grid:\n    *   **Empty Cell:**\n        *   If a cell receives only *one* beam, make it a marker of color 9 (maroon).\n        *   If a cell receives *multiple* beams, make it a marker of color 1 (blue).\n    *   **Occupied Cell:**\n        *   If a cell is already occupied by another shape's pixel, take its position as a target and transform the original shape to color 9.\n\nSo, in essence, I'm finding basic patterns, giving them \"direction\", and then applying collision rules where the \"beams\" collide, or hit existing shapes. The color of the beams/markers depends on if they are colliding (Blue, 1), or alone (Maroon, 9).\n\n\nThe logic for this task involves identifying \"emitters\" (connected shapes), determining their \"firing direction\" based on their geometry, and placing markers or modifying objects where the \"beams\" land.\n\n**1. Object Identification & Classification:**\nWe treat connected components of non-background colors (not 7) as objects.\n*   **Symmetric \"V\" or \"Caret\" Shapes:** These shapes point in the direction of their vertex/tip.\n    *   **Up-pointing V:** (e.g., shapes in Example 1, 2). Vertex at top. **Vector:** `(-5, 0)` (Up).\n    *   **Down-pointing V:** Vertex at bottom. **Vector:** `(+5, 0)` (Down).\n    *   **Left-pointing V:** Vertex at left. **Vector:** `(0, -5)` (Left).\n*   **Asymmetric 3-pixel \"Corner\" Shapes (in a 2x2 box):** These shapes have one corner of the 2x2 box missing. They \"fire\" diagonally towards the corner *opposite* the missing one.\n    *   **Missing Bottom-Right:** Fires Top-Left `(-5, -5)`. (e.g., Example 3 flags).\n    *   **Missing Top-Right:** Fires Bottom-Left `(+5, -5)`. (e.g., Example 1 top shape).\n    *   **Missing Top-Left:** Fires Bottom-Right `(+5, +5)`.\n    *   **Missing Bottom-Left:** Fires Top-Right `(-5, +5)`.\n    The \"Anchor\" for the beam is the vertex pixel of the shape (the one with 2 neighbors).\n\n**2. Beam Interaction Rules:**\nCalculate the target coordinate for each shape: `Target = Anchor + Vector`.\n*   **Empty Target:**\n    *   If **one** beam hits an empty cell, place a **Maroon (9)** marker.\n    *   If **two or more** beams collide at the same empty cell, place a **Blue (1)** marker.\n*   **Occupied Target:**\n    *   If a beam hits an existing object, that object changes color to **Maroon (9)**. (The beam from the modified object still fires).\n\n**3. Applying to Test Input:**\n*   **Shape A (Top-Left):** \"J\" shape at `(2,2),(3,1),(3,2)`. Missing TL corner. Fires BR `(+5, +5)` from vertex `(3,2)`. Target: `(8,7)`.\n*   **Shape B1 (Top-Middle):** Down-pointing V at `(2,8),(2,10),(3,9)`. Vertex `(3,9)`. Fires Down `(+5, 0)`. Target: `(8,9)`.\n*   **Shape C (Top-Right):** Left-pointing V at `(3,14),(4,13),(5,14)`. Vertex `(4,13)`. Fires Left `(0, -5)`. Target: `(4,8)`.\n*   **Shape B2 (Middle-Middle):** Up-pointing V at `(5,9),(6,8),(6,10)`. Vertex `(5,9)`. Fires Up `(-5, 0)`. Target: `(0,9)`.\n*   **Shape D (Middle-Left):** Up-pointing V at `(7,2),(8,1),(8,3)`. Vertex `(7,2)`. Fires Up `(-5, 0)`. Target: `(2,2)`.\n    *   **Interaction:** Hits Shape A. **Shape A becomes Maroon (9).**\n*   **Shape E (Bottom-Left):** Up-pointing V at `(13,4),(14,3),(14,5)`. Vertex `(13,4)`. Fires Up `(-5, 0)`.

Here's my thinking process:**\n\nFirst, I need to understand the task. It's about a 16x16 grid with an orange background (7). There are patterns made of other colors. My job is to find a rule that transforms an input grid into an output grid, based on examples and a test input. I see the importance of color and positions.\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n*   **Initial Shapes:** I see an L-shape (maroon, color 9) at the top-right and some maroon triangles at the bottom of the input grid.\n*   **The Output is Key:**  The output grid is where the transformation happens. I see that the L-shape and triangles remain, but there are new pixels that appear in between!\n*   **Coordiantes and Distances:** I carefully check the pixel positions (rows and columns) to understand the relationship between the shapes and the new pixels. I identify them from the input and output. I recognize the column positions of the \"peaks\" (highest points) of the bottom triangle shapes in Example 1, at columns 1, 7, and 14.\n*   **Color Discrepancy:** The middle newly appeared pixel in the output is *blue*, whereas the other two are *maroon*! This sparks my curiosity.\n*   **L-Shape and Vector:** I start thinking about the L-shape at the top of the input. I have a hunch it might have something to do with the new pixel positions, but I don't see an obvious geometric relationship. I start wondering if the L-shape \"shoots\" something, thus creating a change in the pixels that will make the pixels change color to blue.\n*   **Height Discrepency:** I can see the height difference and that the triangles are the source. There is the floating new pixel between them. It is 5 units apart from each of the triangles.\n*   **Look for Pattern**: I re-examine and write out the shapes that I found. I have the \"L\" shape on top and the \"upside down V\" shapes on the bottom. In the middle, the new floating pixels show the same pattern as the other shapes. I wonder about colors, and if the colors have anything to do with this pattern.\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n\n*   **Different Shapes:** The focus of the example 2 is the upside down Vs, but I call them \"mountains\". I am looking at the output, and I see a change in color to the pixels.\n*   **Height again:** The peaks of the triangles, and they appear on the output grid 5 units above.\n*   **Missing Pixel:** The output in the grid doesn't always have one of the floating pixels! I need to understand why! Is there a missing base?\n*   **Valid Triangle Rule:** I realize, to generate a pixel at the top, a \"triangle\" must be complete, with a peak and two bases, on the same color. Only these \"peaks\" make the floating pixels.\n\nI now have a rule: if there's a triangle, with the three pixels being the same color, a new pixel of color 9 will appear 5 rows above the triangle's peak.\n\n**Back to Example 1, but with New Information:**\n\n*   **Application of New Rule:** I can now explain the new pixels in Example 1: they are 5 rows above the peaks of the triangles!\n*   **Blue Pixel Mystery:** I still need to know *why* that middle pixel is blue. I think this difference is related to the top L-shape. The L-shape could be blocking or modifying the pixel.\n*   **Shape Analysis:** I think I see a pattern to the shapes. The orientation might have something to do with something.\n\n**Example 3 Analysis:**\n\n*   **New Shapes:** In this example, I see new \"gamma\" shapes (2, 2/ 2), I also find similar shapes at the bottom.\n*   **More Output Differences:** It's the same pattern: some new pixels appear at the top. I see a shift in the position of pixels. It looks like the same shapes, but shifted.\n*   **Position Shift:** The new pixels at row 1 are shifted by a consistent amount (row and column) compared to shapes at the bottom. I identify these shifts.\n*   **Collision Rule:** It looks like there's a projectile from each shape, shifted from the original, and it can land. if there is something in the destination, the color of that thing changes (to color 9). I identify the two collision rules. I am now able to apply this \"collision rule\" to future examples.\n*   **Collision = Color Change:**\n\nThe logic for solving this task involves identifying \"shooters\" (shapes) and their corresponding \"projectiles\" (new pixels).\n\n**1. Identification of Shapes and Firing Rules:**\nWe analyze the input grid to find small patterns of non-background colors (colors other than 7). These shapes determine the direction and target of a projectile. The background is orange (7).\n\n*   **Triangle Shapes (Hollow or filled 3-pixel pyramids):**\n    *   **Up-Pointing Triangle:** Peak at `(r, c)`, base at `(r+1, c-1)` and `(r+1, c+1)`.\n        *   **Action:** Fires a projectile UP. Target: `(r-5, c)`.\n    *   **Down-Pointing Triangle:** Peak at `(r, c)`, base at `(r-1, c-1)` and `(r-1, c+1)`.\n        *   **Action:** Fires a projectile DOWN. Target: `(r+5, c)`.\n    *   **Left-Pointing Triangle:** Peak at `(r, c)`, base at `(r-1, c+1)` and `(r+1, c+1)`.\n        *   **Action:** Fires a projectile LEFT. Target: `(r, c-5)`.\n    *   **Right-Pointing Triangle:** (Not present in test, but logically implied) Fires RIGHT. Target: `(r, c+5)`.\n\n*   **Gamma/L Shapes (3-pixel corners):**\n    *   These shapes fill a 2x2 bounding box with 3 pixels, leaving one corner empty. The *filled* corner determines the direction.\n    *   **Top-Left Filled (`XX` / `X.`):** Fires diagonally UP-LEFT. Target: `(r-5, c-5)` from the top-left pixel.\n    *   **Bottom-Left Filled (`X.` / `XX`):** Fires diagonally DOWN-LEFT. Target: `(r+5, c-5)` from the bottom-left pixel. (Seen in Ex 1).\n    *   **Top-Right Filled (`XX` / `.X`):** Fires diagonally UP-RIGHT. Target: `(r-5, c+5)` from the top-right pixel.\n    *   **Bottom-Right Filled (`.X` / `XX`):** Fires diagonally DOWN-RIGHT. Target: `(r+5, c+5)` from the bottom-right pixel.\n\n**2. Interaction Rules:**\n*   **Standard Projectile:** Creates a pixel of color **9** (maroon) at the target location.\n*   **Collision (Projectile vs Projectile):** If two projectiles land on the same empty coordinate, the resulting pixel is color **1** (blue).\n*   **Collision (Projectile vs Shape):** If a projectile lands on an existing shape, the projectile does not appear as a separate pixel; instead, the **entire shape** changes its color to **9**.\n\n**3. Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Shape A (Top-Left):** Pixels `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)` (Color 6).\n    *   Type: **Bottom-Right Filled L**. Corner at `(3,2)`.\n    *   Vector: `(+5, +5)`. Target: `(8, 7)`.\n*   **Shape B1 (Top-Middle):** Pixels `(2,8), (2,10), (3,9)` (Color 6).\n    *   Type: **Down-Pointing Triangle**. Peak at `(3,9)`.\n    *   Vector: `(+5, 0)`. Target: `(8, 9)`.\n*   **Shape B2 (Top-Middle):** Pixels `(5,9), (6,8), (6,10)` (Color 6).\n    *   Type: **Up-Pointing Triangle**. Peak at `(5,9)`.\n    *   Vector: `(-5, 0)`. Target: `(0, 9)`.\n*   **Shape C (Left):** Pixels `(3,14), (4,13), (5,14)` (Color 6).\n    *   Type: **Left-Pointing Triangle**. Peak at `(4,13)`.\n    *   Vector: `(0, -5)`. Target: `(4, 8)`.\n*   **Shape D (Left, below A):** Pixels `(7,2), (8,1), (8,3)` (Color 6).\n    *   Type: **Up-Pointing Triangle**. Peak at `(7,2)`.\n    *   Vector: `(-5, 0)`. Target: `(2, 2)`.\n    *   **Conflict:** Target `(2,2)` is part of **Shape A**.\n    *   **Result:** **Shape A** turns color **9**.\n*   **Shape E (Bottom-Left):** Pixels `(13,4), (14,3), (14,5)` (Color 6).\n    *   Type: **Up-Pointing Triangle**. Peak at `(13,4)`.\n    *   Vector: `(-5, 0)`. Target: `(8, 4)`.\n*   **Shape F (Bottom-Right):** Pixels `(14,8), (14,9), (15,9)` (Color 6).\n    *   Type: **Top-Right Filled Gamma**. Corner at `(14,9)`.\n    *   Vector: `(-5, +5)`. Target: `(9, 14)`.\n*   **Shape G (Bottom-Right):** Pixels `(14,14), (15,13), (15,15)` (Color 6).\n    *   Type: **Up-Pointing Triangle**. Peak at `(14,14)`.\n    *   Vector: `(-5, 0)`. Target: `(9, 14)`.\n    *   **Conflict:** Both F and G target `(9, 14)`.\n    *   **Result:** Pixel at `(9, 14)` becomes color **1** (Blue).\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\n1.  Copy input grid.\n2.  Change Shape A (pixels at `(2,2), (3,1), (3,2)`) to color **9**.\n3.  Add new pixel **9** at `(0, 9)`.\n4.  Add new pixel **9** at `(4, 8)`.\n5.  Add new pixel **9** at `(8, 4)`.\n6.

It is uniquely closest, so:\n   - Its marker at `(1,10)` is colored **1** instead of 9.\n   - All other V-markers are **9**.\n\n   If a marker lands on an existing non-7 pixel, it overwrites it with the marker color. In this case, `(3,3)` overwrites a `6` with a `9`; the other V-markers land on background 7.\n\n3. **Find L-shaped patterns and markers**\n\n   Look for every 2\u00d72 block with exactly **three** cells of color **6** (an L/corner shape). There is one such L-shape:\n\n   - 2\u00d72 block covering rows 15\u201316, cols 9\u201310:\n     - Cells `{(15,9), (15,10), (16,10)}` are 6; `(16,9)` is 7.\n     - This is one L-shaped object.\n     - Its bounding box has top row `row = 15` and leftmost column `left_column = 9`.\n\n   For an L-shape, place a marker at `(row-5, left_column-5)`:\n   - From this L: `(15-5, 9-5) = (10,4)` \u2192 put marker **9** at `(10,4)`.\n\n   This marker lands on background 7, so it just becomes a new 9.\n\n4. **Center-most L recoloring**\n\n   There is **only one** L-shape in the grid, so it is trivially the center-most L. Per the rule:\n   - Recolor all three cells of that L from 6 to 9:\n     - `(15,9)`, `(15,10)`, `(16,10)` become 9.\n\n5. **All other cells**\n\n   - Everything else stays the same (background 7 or other original 6s that are not in the center-most L or under markers).\n\n---\n\n## Output grid\n\nHere is the final transformed grid:\n\nRow 1:  \n`7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7`\n\nRow 2:  \n`7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7`\n\nRow 3:  \n`7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7`\n\nRow 4:  \n`7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7`\n\nRow 5:  \n`7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7`\n\nRow 6:  \n`7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7`\n\nRow 7:  \n`7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7`\n\nRow 8:  \n`7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7`\n\nRow 9:  \n`7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7`\n\nRow 10:  \n`7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7`\n\nRow 11:  \n`7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7`\n\nRow 12:  \n`7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7`\n\nRow 13:  \n`7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7`\n\nRow 14:  \n`7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7`\n\nRow 15:  \n`7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,6,7`\n\nRow 16:  \n`7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,6,7,6`\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,6,7,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n    <ANSWER id=\"C\" model_id=\"gpt-5.1-codex-max-xhigh_12_step_5_opus_gen_sol\">\n      <EXPLANATION>\nTo produce the output, I first identify the small 3\u2011cell patterns on the background of 7s. V\u2011shapes are the chevrons consisting of a single \u201capex\u201d cell with two cells one row below and one column to either side; for each such caret\u2011shaped V I place a marker five rows directly above the apex. The marker is normally 9, but if one V is uniquely closest to the horizontal centre of the grid, that marker is 1 instead. L\u2011shapes are any 2\u00d72 block with exactly three cells filled; for each L I place a marker five rows up and five columns left from the top\u2011left of the block. Among the Ls, the one closest to the grid centre has its three cells recoloured to 9. Markers overwrite whatever was underneath; all other cells remain as in the input.\n\nIn the test grid there are four V\u2011shapes with apices at (5,9), (7,2), (13,4) and (14,14), giving markers at (0,9), (2,2), (8,4) and (9,14), with the first one coloured 1 as the unique central V. There are two L\u2011shapes at 2\u00d72 blocks starting at (2,1) and (14,8); only the latter has its marker in bounds at (9,3) and is also the central L, so its three cells are changed to 9.\n\nThe resulting grid is:\n\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,6,7\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,6,7,6\n      </EXPLANATION>\n      <OUTPUT_GRID>\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,1,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,7,6,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n      7,7,7,6,7,6,7,7,9,9,7,7,7,7,6,7\n      7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,9,7,7,7,6,7,6\n      </OUTPUT_GRID>\n    </ANSWER>\n  </CANDIDATE>\n</CANDIDATES>\n\n<INSTRUCTIONS>\nYou must behave as an AUDITOR, not a solver.\n\nYour overall goal:\n- For each candidate, choose a representative explanation and treat it as that\n  candidate's proposed rule.\n- Audit that rule against all training examples.\n- Check whether the candidate's predicted test OUTPUT_GRID actually follows\n  that rule.\n- Assign each candidate a score from 0 to 10 and rank all candidates.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\nSTEP 1 -- CHOOSE A REPRESENTATIVE RULE PER CANDIDATE\nFor each CANDIDATE:\n\n  1.

                "response": "**Assessment of ARC Task Solutions**\n\nAlright, I've got the task laid out: audit four proposed solutions for this ARC problem. The core is analyzing how shapes in an input grid transform to an output. My initial focus is on understanding the rules through the training examples.\n\n**Rule Extraction & Hypothesis Formation**\n\n*   **Up-Triangles:** These fire projectiles upwards, shifting -5 rows (no column shift).\n*   **L-Shapes:** Here's where it gets interesting. In Ex 1, a \"missing Top-Right L\" fires Down-Left (+5, -5). Conversely, in Ex 3 a \"missing Bottom-Right L\" fires Top-Left (-5, -5) to hit the starting shape.  I need to generalize this and define which pixels are the anchors for the projectile. The pixel at the \"corner\" of the shape appears to be the anchor.\n*   **Collision Logic:** If an empty cell is hit by the projectile of a shape, it turns maroon (9). If a pixel is hit by two projectiles, it becomes Blue (1), as shown in Ex 1 and is the key to understanding all examples.\n\n**Test Case Application**\n\nNow, let's break down the test input:\n\n1.  **Shape A:** Looks like a \"Missing Top-Left\" shape. Corner Pixel is (3,2). Based on my observations, it's missing the top left corner. Given this, it should fire to the bottom right (Target: (8,7)).\n2.  **Shape B:** Down-pointing triangle. Fired down to (8,9)\n3.  **Shape C:** Left-pointing triangle. Shift left to (4,8).\n4.  **Shape D:** Up-triangle, Fired up to (0,9)\n5.  **Shape E:** This fires up to (2,2) which then hits shape A, and therefore should turn to 9.\n6.  **Shape F:** Up-triangle fired up to (8,4).\n7.  **Shape G:** Missing Bottom Left. Vertex is at (14,9), which is the Top-Right pixel. Thus should fire up and right to (9,14).\n8.  **Shape H:** Fired up from the top triangle to (9,14).\n\nBased on these, the interactions would be as follows. These interactions must be confirmed by the auditing of the potential solutions.\n\n*   Shape A (becomes 9)\n*   Shape C (0,9)\n*   Shape B (8,7)\n*   Shape D (8,4)\n*   Shape F (8,9)\n*   Shape E (4,8)\n*   Shapes G/H Collision at (9,14) makes Blue.\n\n**Candidate Evaluation - Key Findings:**\n\nI've reviewed the candidates' solutions, each with its strengths and weaknesses:\n\n*   **Candidate 12 (Gemini 3 High):** This is the gold standard! It correctly identifies all shape types and their firing directions, handles collisions precisely, and consistently explains every detail. **Score: 10/10**\n*   **Candidate 0 (Gemini 3 High):** It correctly does some shape interactions and projectile. It missed the most complex detail of the blue collision in Ex 1. Still got a decent grip on shape interactions. **Score: 5/10**\n*   **Candidate 10 (GPT-5.1 High):** Dismisses key examples and has ad-hoc logic. **Score: 3/10**\n*   **Candidate 5 (GPT-5.1 High):**  Ad-hoc rules and calls examples \"typos\". **Score: 2/10**\n*   **Candidate 15 (Claude):** Uses ad-hoc rules and misses important aspects of the test cases. **Score: 2/10**\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n\nCandidate 12 is the only solution with a complete and accurate theory, making it the clear winner. The other solutions are invalid due to their inability to fully explain all aspects of the training data.\n\n\n{\n  \"candidates\": [\n    {\n      \"candidate_id\": 12,\n      \"score\": 10.0,\n      \"tier\": \"GOLD\",\n      \"example_audit\": {\n        \"per_example\": {\n          \"1\": \"Pass\",\n          \"2\": \"Pass\",\n          \"3\": \"Pass\"\n        },\n        \"summary\": \"The candidate perfectly deduces a comprehensive system of 'shooters' and 'projectiles'.
