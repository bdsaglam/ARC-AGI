Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment and Exploration**\n\nOkay, so the goal is to solve an ARC task by figuring out the transformation rules based on examples. I'm starting by analyzing the provided examples, especially focusing on identifying patterns and key elements within the input and output grids.  My initial hypothesis is that there are \"emitters\" (structures within the grid that emit beams) and \"markers\" (single pixels that influence the beam's color and direction).  I'll be very careful to verify my visual estimates of grid sizes using actual data.\n\n**Example 1: Deconstructing the Transformation**\n\nI started by looking at Example 1, noting the rectangular structures and scattered pixels. I visually defined structures and looked for common characteristics.  The key seemed to be identifying 'emitters' (vertical and horizontal structures composed of colored pixels) and 'markers' which appeared to act as \"seeds\" or triggers.  I carefully analyzed the data to locate these elements.  I found that the beam's color seemed to be connected to some arithmetic relationship within the emitter's paired colors.\n\nI figured out that the emitters have internal pairs of colors. The beam gets projected. The presence of specific colors (like 5, 1, 6) in the input seemed linked to the beams, but I wasn't clear how. I went back and forth between input and output, tracing the beams to their sources and destinations. Initially, I thought that the \"markers\" acted as global triggers, but the results didn't completely match that model. Then, I observed the Output grid and noticed that the beams' colors and positions seem to be influenced by those markers.  I observed that for each emitter, the beam color and direction are determined by offsets and marker colors from other sections.\n\nThe arithmetic logic between emitters and beam colors was confirmed. At this point, I had a good handle on how the emitters and markers work, and the color computation seemed to involve an arithmetic operation applied to the pairs inside each emitter. I realized it was like a \"routing\" problem, with emitters deflecting beams that started at marker locations.  But the colors and directions were still a bit fuzzy.\n\nI tried to verify with Ex 1. I realized that specific arithmetic results were triggering certain operations, but that all markers of a color triggered the behavior. This caused an \"activate/not activate\" confusion in the outputs. The presence of color 1 (diff) would cause a beam from an emitter, for instance, even if there was no other marker near that emitter.\n\nSo, I re-examined the numbers 1-6 in Example 1. I found the beams, the pixels, the arithmetic logic. I thought the operations were sum, diff, or prod, and I was going to use those to figure out what was going on.  This also got me thinking about the idea of the markers \"activating\" operations, and the presence of these in the input grid that would tell the process what to produce.\n\nMy thought process was that all emitters' offsets might be calculated from the \"1,1\" corner (if vertical) or the Top/Left. From these offsets, a color could be computed (using the pairs inside). Also, the grid had a size. I started thinking about modular arithmetic. The \"pairs\" (top/bottom, left/right) inside an emitter structure, the offset within the emitter (distance from one end).\n\nI eventually figured out how the values from the internal structure relate to an output beam. This involved distance from specific starting points.\n\nI got confused about vertical / horizontal beam generation, but eventually I made sure that I was clear on this point. I was certain to check all this work with Example 2.\n\n**Example 2: Refining the Model**\n\nI moved on to Example 2. I confirmed the logic by carefully mapping input markers and beam colors. I was able to build a map relating the distance from the \"1,1\" end of an emitter to a particular color.   I made a hypothesis that beams can be \"deflected\" or influenced by these positions relative to different parts of the structures in the image. I saw that specific locations and directions would generate these beams, and they would do so only if the correct marker was present. This led me to develop a \"hypothesis.\"\n\nI saw connections between where these pixels are and where the beams are. It seemed like the inputs (9, 6, 3 from the input example text) were getting \"re-routed\" from one part of the image to another. The emitters are a key routing mechanism and are also the location of a transformation.\n\nI saw a connection between the marker at row 1, Col 0, and what was happening with the beam.  I got a bit confused by this section, as the data had been laid out a bit oddly. The marker was a number, and the colors would be related to other numbers.\n\nI reanalyzed the input,\n\nThe logic for solving this ARC task involves identifying \"emitters\" and \"markers\" and establishing a mapping between them to generate beams of color.\n\n**1. Identification of Emitters**\nEmitters are rectangular structures containing pairs of numbers. In the test input, there are four emitters:\n*   **Emitter 1 (Vertical):** Rows 0-6, Columns 4-5. The top pair is `1,1` (Row 0), and the bottom pair is `3,3` (Row 6). This defines `1,1` as the \"Start\" or origin of the emitter.\n*   **Emitter 2 (Horizontal):** Rows 2-3, Columns 18-24. The rightmost pair is `1,1` (Col 24) and the leftmost is `3,3` (Col 18). The \"Start\" is Column 24.\n*   **Emitter 3 (Vertical):** Rows 10-16, Columns 24-25. The bottom pair is `1,1` (Row 16) and the top is `3,3` (Row 10). The \"Start\" is Row 16.\n*   **Emitter 4 (Vertical):** Rows 22-28, Columns 9-10. The top pair is `1,1` (Row 22) and the bottom is `3,3` (Row 28). The \"Start\" is Row 22.\n\n**2. Identification of Markers**\nMarkers are single non-background pixels aligned with the emitters.\n*   **Marker at (1, 0):** Color 9. Aligns with Emitter 1 at Row 1.\n*   **Marker at (11, 28):** Color 7. Aligns with Emitter 3 at Row 11.\n*   **Marker at (28, 21):** Color 6. Aligns with Emitter 4 at Row 28 and Emitter 2 at Column 21.\n\n**3. Establishing the Logic (Distance Mapping)**\nBy calculating the distance of each marker from its emitter's \"Start\" (`1,1` end), we infer a mapping from Distance to Color:\n*   **Emitter 1:** Marker 9 is at Row 1. Start is Row 0. Distance = $|1 - 0| = 1$.  \n    $\\rightarrow$ **Distance 1 produces Color 9.**\n*   **Emitter 3:** Marker 7 is at Row 11. Start is Row 16. Distance = $|11 - 16| = 5$.  \n    $\\rightarrow$ **Distance 5 produces Color 7.**\n*   **Emitter 4 / Emitter 2 Intersection:** Marker 6 is at (28, 21).\n    *   For Emitter 4 (Start Row 22): Distance = $|28 - 22| = 6$.\n    *   For Emitter 2 (Start Col 24): Distance = $|21 - 24| = 3$.\n    *   This implies **Distance 6 produces Color 6** and **Distance 3 produces Color 6**.\n\n**4. Generating the Output**\nWe apply this mapping to all valid distances for all emitters.\n*   **Map:** Dist 1 $\\rightarrow$ 9, Dist 3 $\\rightarrow$ 6, Dist 5 $\\rightarrow$ 7, Dist 6 $\\rightarrow$ 6.\n\n*   **Emitter 1 (Start Row 0):**\n    *   Row 1 (Dist 1): Color 9\n    *   Row 3 (Dist 3): Color 6\n    *   Row 5 (Dist 5): Color 7\n    *   Row 6 (Dist 6): Color 6\n\n*   **Emitter 2 (Start Col 24):**\n    *   Col 23 (Dist 1): Color 9\n    *   Col 21 (Dist 3): Color 6\n    *   Col 19 (Dist 5): Color 7\n    *   Col 18 (Dist 6): Color 6\n\n*   **Emitter 3 (Start Row 16):**\n    *   Row 15 (Dist 1): Color 9\n    *   Row 13 (Dist 3): Color 6\n    *   Row 11 (Dist 5): Color 7\n    *   Row 10 (Dist 6): Color 6\n\n*   **Emitter 4 (Start Row 22):**\n    *   Row 23 (Dist 1): Color 9\n    *   Row 25 (Dist 3): Color 6\n    *   Row 27 (Dist 5): Color 7\n    *   Row 28 (Dist 6): Color 6\n\nThe output grid is constructed by filling these rows and columns with the specified colors, ensuring the emitters themselves are preserved.\n\n8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,4,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,7,9,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,6,6,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,9,6,6,3,3,6,6,6\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,9,7,7,2,4,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,6,9,8,8,2,4,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,9,6,6,2,4,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,6,9,8,8,2,4,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,7,6,9,9,9,1,4,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,6,9,8,8,1,1,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,1,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,6,7,6,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,9,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,6,9,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6,7,6,9,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6",

Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Task Understanding and Approach:**\n\nThe user has tasked me with solving an ARC problem using examples and a test input. I need to figure out the rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid. I'll need to analyze the examples, pinpoint the transformation rule and apply it to the test input.\n\n**Example Grid Analysis & Initial Hypothesis:**\n\nI've begun by examining the examples, noting the input/output sizes and what the background color is (8). I've observed that the elements in the grid are non-background color shapes. My initial focus is on figuring out the rules for these colored shapes. I will look at their arrangement and relationship in the input and output. I noticed that there are these \"structures\" (blocks of connected colors, and individual pixels) and I suspect that individual pixels trigger beams that are influenced by the shape of the structures. \n\n**Structure & Source Detection:**\n\nI'm focused on identifying the components and their roles in the grid transformation. The shapes seem to interact with these single pixel \"sources\" that appear and trigger the creation of horizontal or vertical lines of specific colors in the output. The structures also have certain points which seem to act as channels. I have begun to index each \"port\" on these structure elements.\n\n**Pinout Mapping:**\n\nI hypothesized that the structures might be connected to a bus, and each structure \"taps\" into this bus through specific pins, kind of like a circuit. To check my hypothesis, I am going to try and build a mapping table that defines how the pinout works for each structure orientation.\n\n**Orientation & Mapping Table Construction:**\n\nThrough careful analysis of the provided examples, I've managed to build an hypothesis for how pins and the beam colors are mapped for each orientation. Through a geometric analysis of orientation, I am hypothesizing how to apply it across different shapes.\n\n**Test Input application:**\n\nI've started analyzing the test input in relation to the rules derived from the example. I need to identify sources, connect them to structures and calculate where the lines should appear in the output. I am taking care to identify all structures and apply the appropriate rules.\n\n**Finalized Solution & Output Prediction:**\n\nI have now finalized all rules and calculations. My final step is predicting the final output and creating an output grid by using all of these individual rules.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to determine the transformation rule from input to output based on the provided examples and apply it to the test input.\n\n**Analysis of the Transformation:**\n\n1.  **Structures and Ports:** The grid contains \"structures\" made of various colors, primarily defined by linear segments of color '2' (red) and '4' (yellow). The segments of '2's act as \"ports\" or connection points.\n    *   In the examples, structures have 6 ports (indices 0-5). In the test input, structures have 4 ports (indices 0-3). This indicates a scalable component size.\n    *   Each structure has an orientation (Up, Down, Left, Right) determined by the side containing the '2's (Front) vs the side containing '4's or other back-plane colors (Back). \"End Caps\" (usually color '4' or '3') are located at the ends of the port sequence.\n\n2.  **Sources:** Isolated single pixels of specific colors (non-8 background) are positioned adjacent to structures. These act as signal sources.\n    *   A source can inject a signal into a **Pin** (aligned with a '2' or '4' segment) or a **Cap** (aligned with the end of the structure).\n    *   The injection fills a \"Channel\" on a shared bus connecting all structures.\n\n3.  **Signal Propagation (The Bus):**\n    *   **Pins:** The structures are connected such that Pin $i$ on one structure connects to Pin $N-1-i$ on another, where $N$ is the number of ports.\n        *   In Example 1 (Size 6), Pin $i$ mapped to Pin $5-i$.\n        *   In the Test Input (Size 4), Pin $i$ maps to Pin $3-i$.\n        *   If a source drives Pin 0 of a structure, all other structures will emit that color from Pin 3.\n    *   **Caps:** The End Caps also connect via the bus, mapping \"Start\" caps to \"End\" caps.\n        *   Top/Left Cap corresponds to \"Start\". Bottom/Right Cap corresponds to \"End\".\n        *   A signal injected into a Start Cap (e.g., Top) comes out of the End Cap (e.g., Bottom) of a compatible structure, and vice versa.\n        *   Mapping appears to be: Struct A Start $\\leftrightarrow$ Struct B End.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Structure 1 (Top Left):** Vertical, facing Right. 2s at Rows 2-5 (Cols 4-5).\n    *   Pins: 0 (Row 2), 1 (Row 3), 2 (Row 4), 3 (Row 5).\n    *   Caps: Top (Row 1), Bottom (Row 6).\n*   **Structure 2 (Top Right):** Horizontal, facing Up. 2s at Col 19-22 (Row 2).\n    *   Pins: 0 (Col 19), 1 (Col 20), 2 (Col 21), 3 (Col 22).\n    *   Caps: Left (Col 18), Right (Col 23).\n*   **Structure 3 (Bottom Right):** Vertical, facing Left. 2s at Rows 11-14 (Cols 24-25).\n    *   Pins: 0 (Row 11), 1 (Row 12), 2 (Row 13), 3 (Row 14).\n    *   Caps: Top (Row 10), Bottom (Row 15).\n*   **Structure 4 (Bottom Center):** Vertical, facing Right. 2s at Rows 24-27 (Cols 9-10).\n    *   Pins: 0 (Row 24), 1 (Row 25), 2 (Row 26), 3 (Row 27).\n    *   Caps: Top (Row 23), Bottom (Row 28).\n\n**Tracing Signals:**\n\n1.  **Source 9 (Maroon):** Located at (1, 0). Aligned with **Structure 1 Top Cap**.\n    *   Injects 9 into \"Start\" Channel.\n    *   Exits at \"End\" Caps of other structures. Mapping: R-Top (Start) $\\leftrightarrow$ L-Bottom (End).\n    *   Output: **Structure 3 Bottom Cap (Row 15)** emits **9** to the Left.\n\n2.  **Source 3 (Green):** Located at (2, 18). Aligned with **Structure 2 Left Cap**.\n    *   Injects 3 into \"Start\" Channel.\n    *   Exits at \"End\" Caps. Mapping: U-Left (Start) $\\leftrightarrow$ R-Bottom (End).\n    *   Output: **Structure 1 Bottom Cap (Row 6)** emits **3** to the Right.\n\n3.  **Source 1 (Blue):** Located at (2, 23). Aligned with **Structure 2 Right Cap**.\n    *   Injects 1 into \"End\" Channel.\n    *   Exits at \"Start\" Caps. Mapping: U-Right (End) $\\leftrightarrow$ R-Top (Start).\n    *   Output: **Structure 4 Top Cap (Row 23)** emits **1** to the Right.\n\n4.  **Source 6 (Magenta):** Located at (28, 21). Aligned with **Structure 4 Bottom Cap**.\n    *   Injects 6 into \"End\" Channel.\n    *   Exits at \"Start\" Caps. Mapping: R-Bottom (End) $\\leftrightarrow$ L-Top (Start).\n    *   Output: **Structure 3 Top Cap (Row 10)** emits **6** to the Left.\n\n5.  **Source 7 (Orange):** Located at (11, 28). Aligned with **Structure 3 Pin 0**.\n    *   Injects 7 into Pin Channel 0.\n    *   Exits at Pin 3 ($3-0$) of all other structures.\n    *   **Structure 1 Pin 3 (Row 5):** Emits **7** to the Right.\n    *   **Structure 2 Pin 3 (Col 22):** Emits **7** Upward.\n    *   **Structure 4 Pin 3 (Row 27):** Emits **7** to the Right.\n\n**Final Grid Construction:**\n-   **Row 5:** Fill Cols 6-28 with **7**.\n-   **Row 6:** Fill Cols 6-28 with **3**.\n-   **Row 10:** Fill Cols 0-23 with **6**.\n-   **Row 15:** Fill Cols 0-23 with **9**.\n-   **Row 23:** Fill Cols 11-28 with **1**.\n-   **Row 27:** Fill Cols 11-28 with **7**.\n-   **Col 22:** Fill Rows 0-1 with **7**.\n\n8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,8,8,8,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,3,3,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to understand the transformation by analyzing the examples.\n\n**Pattern Analysis:**\n\nThe examples contain:\n1. **Connectors**: L-shaped structures made of specific colors (like 2, 3, 4 or 1, 2, 4) forming \"combs\" with teeth and edges\n2. **Markers**: Single colored cells (like 1, 5, 6 or 3, 6, 9) positioned at specific locations\n\nThe transformation:\n- Each marker defines a color mapping for a specific position type within connectors\n- Lines are drawn perpendicular to connectors, extending from the side opposite the \"teeth\"\n- For vertical connectors: count teeth from BOTTOM\n- For horizontal connectors: count teeth from LEFT\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n\nConnectors found:\n1. Vertical at cols 4-5 (rows 0-6): teeth at rows 2-5\n2. Horizontal at rows 2-3 (cols 18-24): teeth at cols 19-22\n3. Vertical at cols 24-25 (rows 10-16): teeth at rows 11-14\n4. Vertical at cols 9-10 (rows 22-28): teeth at rows 24-27\n\nMarkers:\n- 9 at (1, 0): defines non-corner 4 position \u2192 color 9\n- 7 at (11, 28): defines 4th tooth from bottom (vertical) \u2192 color 7\n- 6 at (28, 21): defines 3rd tooth from left (horizontal) \u2192 color 6\n\n**Applying the mappings:**\n- Non-corner 4 position \u2192 color 9\n- 4th tooth from bottom/left \u2192 color 7  \n- 3rd tooth from bottom/left \u2192 color 6\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,3,3,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,2,4,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,2,4,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,1,4,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,1,1,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,7,9,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation pattern:\n\n1. **Structures**: There are \"comb\" structures made of colors 1, 2, 3, 4 - both vertical and horizontal orientations.\n\n2. **Markers**: Single colored pixels (like 5, 6, 9, 7) placed outside structures that trigger projections.\n\n3. **Transformation rules**:\n   - Markers directly aligned with a structure project their color from the marker position to the structure\n   - Markers propagate between structures using complementary position mapping (position i \u2192 position (n-1-i) in connected structures)\n   - Vertical structures project horizontally; horizontal structures project vertically\n   - The projection direction follows the marker's original position\n\nFor the test input, I identify:\n- **VS1**: cols 4-5, rows 0-6 (vertical structure)\n- **HS**: cols 18-24, rows 2-3 (horizontal structure)  \n- **VS2**: cols 24-25, rows 10-16 (vertical structure)\n- **VS3**: cols 9-10, rows 22-28 (vertical structure)\n\n**Markers**: 9 at (1,0), 7 at (11,28), 6 at (28,21)\n\nApplying the rules:\n- Marker 9 \u2192 projects left from VS1, propagates to HS col 23, then to VS3 row 23 (leftward)\n- Marker 7 \u2192 projects right from VS2, propagates to HS col 23, then to VS3 row 23 (rightward)\n- Marker 6 \u2192 projects right from VS3, propagates to HS col 18, then to VS1 row 6 and VS2 row 16\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,7,3,3,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,7,2,4,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,7,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,7,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,7,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,7,1,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,7,1,1,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,1,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,7,8,8,8,8,8\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Below is how I analyzed the task and derived a concrete transformation that can be applied to the test grid, followed by the final output grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Interpreting the training examples\n\n### 1.1. Background vs. structure vs. \u201csignal\u201d colors\n\nIn all examples:\n\n- Color `8` is always the background.\n- The remaining colors fall into:\n  - **Structural colors**, forming repeated geometric patterns (frames, ladders, or \u201cbuses\u201d).  \n    - Example 1: `{2,3,4}` form repeated 2\u00d7N and vertical structures.\n    - Example 2: `{1,2,4}` form a vertical bar, a horizontal bar, and another vertical bar.\n  - **Signal colors**, which:\n    - Appear only a few times in the input.\n    - Get **replicated** into large rectangular/strip regions of the output.\n    - Example 1 signals: `{1,5,6}`.\n    - Example 2 signals: `{3,6,9}`.\n\nIn the **test input**, `8` is background. The heavily used structural colors are `{1,2,3,4}`. The rare colors are:\n\n- `9` appears exactly once at (row 2, col 1).\n- `7` appears exactly once at (row 12, col 29).\n\nSo the **signal set for the test** is `{7,9}` and the \u201cwires/bus\u201d are formed from `{1,2,3,4}`.\n\n---\n\n### 1.2. What happens in the training examples?\n\nFrom both examples, the transformation has two main aspects:\n\n1. **Identify \u201cframes\u201d or \u201cbus segments\u201d** built from the structural colors.\n\n   - Example 2:\n     - Vertical frame on column 6 (with 1\u2019s and adjacent 2/4).\n     - Horizontal frame on row 3 (1\u2019s spanning columns 15\u201323).\n     - Vertical frame on column 18 (1\u2019s with 2/4 around).\n   - Example 1:\n     - A 2\u00d77 structure around rows 8\u20139, cols 2\u20138.\n     - A similar one around rows 16\u201317, cols 13\u201319.\n     - A tall right-hand structure around cols 23\u201324, rows 19\u201326.\n\n2. **Each frame has an adjacent \u201cport region\u201d in the background**, exposed toward the outer border of the grid. In those port regions:\n\n   - A number of **parallel stripes** (either horizontal or vertical) of background cells are turned into **solid stripes** of signal colors.\n   - The number of stripes for a given frame equals the number of signal colors.\n   - For each frame, the stripes:\n     - Run from the frame **to the boundary** of the grid in a straight line.\n     - Use **each signal color exactly once** within that frame\u2019s port region.\n   - Orientation is determined by the frame:\n     - Vertical frames \u2192 horizontal stripes extending left or right.\n     - Horizontal frames \u2192 vertical stripes extending up (in the examples, only \u201ctop-of-frame\u201d is used).\n\n   Examples:\n\n   - Example 2, left vertical frame (col 6):\n     - Port region: left of the frame (cols 1\u20135).\n     - Three stripes on rows 2, 4, 6 (every other row in a band beneath the frame\u2019s top).\n     - They are fully filled from col 1 up to col 5 with colors 3, 6, 9 respectively.\n   - Example 2, right vertical frame (col 18):\n     - Port region: right of the frame (cols 20\u201327).\n     - Three stripes on rows 11, 13, 15 (again, every other row in a band beneath the frame\u2019s top).\n     - They fill cols 20\u201327 with colors 3, 6, 9.\n   - Example 2, horizontal frame (row 3, cols 15\u201323):\n     - Port region: above the frame (rows 1\u20132).\n     - Three vertical stripes at columns 18, 20, 22, each from row 1\u20132 down to row 3.\n     - Colors again 9, 6, 3 (one for each signal).\n\n   In all these, the rare input colors serve as the **palette** for these stripes.\n\n3. **Input occurrences of the signal colors lie on or at the ends of some stripes**:\n   - Example 2:\n     - The `3` at (2,1) sits on the left-of-frame stripe for color 3.\n     - The `9` at (6,1) similarly aligns with its stripe.\n     - The `6` at (1,20) aligns with the top-of-horizontal-frame stripe at that column.\n   - But crucially, the **placement of stripes is determined by the frames**, not by searching from the signals. The signals only determine which colors are used.\n\nSo the operational rule we use is:\n\n> 1. Identify structural frames made from frequent colors (not background).  \n> 2. For each frame, locate an adjacent **port region** of pure background cells between the frame and the grid edge.  \n> 3. In that port region, on a small number of evenly spaced rows/columns (one per signal color), draw full stripes from the frame out to the border, using each signal color exactly once.\n\nWe now apply this pattern to the test grid.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Analyzing the test input\n\nDimensions: 29\u00d729.\n\n### 2.1. Structural frames in the test\n\nInspecting the `{1,2,3,4}` patterns, we can see several structured \u201cframes\u201d:\n\n1. **Top-left vertical frame (Frame A)** around columns 5\u20136 and rows 1\u20137:\n\n   - Columns 5\u20136, rows 1\u20137:\n\n     ```\n     r1: [1,1]\n     r2: [4,1]\n     r3: [4,2]\n     r4: [4,2]\n     r5: [4,2]\n     r6: [4,2]\n     r7: [3,3]\n     ```\n\n   - This is a 2-column vertical bus with consistent pattern, open to the **left** (cols 1\u20134 are background).\n\n2. **Central horizontal frame (Frame B)** around rows 3\u20134 and columns 19\u201325:\n\n   - Rows 3\u20134, cols 19\u201325:\n\n     ```\n     row3: [3,2,2,2,2,1,1]\n     row4: [3,4,4,4,4,4,1]\n     ```\n\n   - Very similar 2\u00d77 pattern to those in the training examples; the **port region above it** (rows 1\u20132, same columns) is background.\n\n3. **Mid-right vertical frame (Frame C)** around columns 25\u201326 and rows 11\u201317:\n\n   - Rows 11\u201317, cols 25\u201326:\n\n     ```\n     row11: [3,3]\n     row12: [2,4]\n     row13: [2,4]\n     row14: [2,4]\n     row15: [2,4]\n     row16: [1,4]\n     row17: [1,1]\n     ```\n\n   - A 2-column vertical bus open to the **right** (cols 27\u201329 are background).\n\n4. There is also a **bottom-left structure** around rows 23\u201329, cols 10\u201311 that mirrors Frame A, but in the training data, the bottom-side cases were not clearly driven by the same stripe rule in a way we can generalize safely. The clearest, analogously used frames are A, B, C.\n\n### 2.2. Signal colors\n\nAs noted:\n\n- Background: `8`.\n- Structural: `{1,2,3,4}`.\n- Signals: `{7,9}`.\n\nWe\u2019ll use these two signal colors to create stripes in each frame\u2019s port region.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Applying the rule to the test\n\n### 3.1. Frame A (top-left vertical), stripes to the left\n\n- Frame A: columns 5\u20136, rows 1\u20137.\n- Port region: columns 1\u20134, rows 1\u20137 (all 8 except the single `9` at (2,1)).\n\nFrom the training examples for a vertical frame and `N` signals:\n\n- We place stripes on **every other row** in a band starting just below the top of the frame.\n- With `N = 2` signals (`7` and `9`), we need **2 stripe rows**.\n- For a frame whose top row index is `rTop = 1`, the stripe rows are:\n  - `rTop + 1 = 2`\n  - `rTop + 3 = 4`\n\nSo we draw **two horizontal stripes**:\n\n- On **row 2**, cols 1\u20134: fill with signal color that matches the signal already present there (`9`).  \n  So row 2, col 1\u20134 become `9,9,9,9`.\n- On **row 4**, cols 1\u20134: use the other signal color, `7`.  \n  So row 4, col 1\u20134 become `7,7,7,7`.\n\nWe do **not** touch the frame itself (cols 5\u20136).\n\n### 3.2. Frame C (mid-right vertical), stripes to the right\n\n- Frame C: columns 25\u201326, rows 11\u201317.\n- Port region: columns 27\u201329, rows 11\u201317 (all 8\u2019s), except the single input `7` at (12,29).\n\nAgain, for vertical frames and `N=2` signals, we select two stripe rows starting just under the top of the frame:\n\n- Frame C top row `rTop = 11`.\n- Stripe rows: `rTop + 1 = 12` and `rTop + 3 = 14`.\n\nSo we draw two **horizontal stripes** to the right:\n\n- On **row 12**, cols 27\u201329: we choose color `7` to coincide with the original `7` at (12,29), so we keep that and extend to the left:\n  - Row 12, cols 27\u201329 become `7,7,7`.\n- On **row 14**, cols 27\u201329: use the remaining signal color `9`:\n  - Row 14, cols 27\u201329 become `9,9,9`.\n\nAgain we do not alter the frame itself (cols 25\u201326).\n\n### 3.3. Frame B (central horizontal), stripes above\n\n- Frame B: rows 3\u20134, columns 19\u201325.\n- Port region: above row 3, i.e. rows 1\u20132, same columns 19\u201325 are currently all background.\n\nTraining (Example 2) shows that for a horizontal frame:\n\n- Stripes are **vertical**.\n- They are placed on a subset of columns inside the frame, regularly spaced, and drawn from the top border down to the frame.\n\nFor a 2\u00d77 horizontal frame and `N = 2` signals, we choose 2 interior columns, fairly centered and spaced by 2 columns; consistent with Example 2\u2019s pattern (using 18,20,22 out of 15\u201323). For our frame spanning columns 19\u201325, we select:\n\n- Columns 22 and 24 as the two stripe columns.\n\nThen:\n\n- For **column 22**: draw a vertical stripe of one signal color from row 1 down to row 2 (stopping before row 3 which is the frame).\n- For **column 24**: draw a stripe of the other signal.\n\nWe assign left-to-right:\n\n- Column 22 \u2192 color `9`.\n- Column 24 \u2192 color `7`.\n\nThus:\n\n- Row 1, col 22 becomes `9` (was 8).\n- Row 2, col 22 becomes `9`.\n- Row 1, col 24 becomes `7` (was 8).\n- Row 2, col 24 becomes `7`.\n\nAll other cells preserve their original colors.\n\nWe deliberately do **not** add extra stripes for the bottom-left structure because there is no clear, consistent way to generalize its usage from the provided training examples without overfitting.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

        "Full raw LLM response": "**High\u2011level pattern**\n\nFrom the two solved examples:\n\n- The grid contains \u201cframe\u201d structures made only from colors `{1,2,3,4}` (and background `8`).  \n- Colors outside `{1,2,3,4,8}` appear exactly once each; these are **special marker colors** (the \u201cseeds\u201d).  \n- The task is to draw **straight monochrome bars of the seed colors** into the background 8\u2011regions, aligned with and adjacent to these frames:\n  - **Vertical frames** get **horizontal seed bars** drawn on their *outer* side.\n  - **Horizontal frames** get **vertical seed bars** drawn on their *outer* side.\n- The frames themselves (made of 1/2/3/4) are not modified.\n\nFor the test, we only have to be consistent with how this mechanism works in the training examples, not to re\u2011derive the full hidden logic of the ARC author.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Identify frames and seeds in the test input\n\n### Frames (made of `{1,2,3,4}`)\n\nLooking for connected rectilinear patterns using only 1,2,3,4:\n\n1. **Top\u2011left vertical frame A** at columns 5\u20136, rows 1\u20137:\n\n   - Rows 1\u20136 have `4/1/2/3` combinations at (r,5)-(r,6):\n     - r1: `1,1`\n     - r2: `4,1`\n     - r3\u20136: `4,2`\n     - r7: `3,3`\n   - This is a 2\u2011wide vertical bar of frame colors.\n\n2. **Horizontal frame B** at rows 3\u20134, columns 19\u201325:\n\n   - Row 3: `3,2,2,2,2,1,1` at cols 19\u201325  \n   - Row 4: `3,4,4,4,4,4,1` at cols 19\u201325  \n   - This is a 7\u2011wide horizontal frame.\n\n3. **Mid\u2011right vertical frame C** at columns 25\u201326, rows 11\u201317:\n\n   - r11\u201317 at (25,26): pattern of `3,3; 2,4; 2,4; 2,4; 2,4; 1,4; 1,1`.\n\n4. **Bottom vertical frame D** at columns 10\u201311, rows 23\u201329:\n\n   - r23\u201329 around (10,11): pattern `1,1; 4,1; 4,2; 4,2; 4,2; 4,2; 3,3`.\n\nSo we have **three vertical frames (A, C, D)** and **one horizontal frame (B)**.\n\nFrom the training examples, the bars are only drawn adjacent to \u201couter\u201d vertical frames: those which border the outside of the arrangement, not the internal linking frame. Here:\n\n- A is outer on its **left** side (columns 1\u20134).\n- C is outer on its **right** side (columns 27\u201329).\n- D sits between other frames (topologically \u201cinternal\u201d), so we treat it as an internal frame and do **not** draw bars there.\n\n### Seeds (singletons in colors not in `{1,2,3,4,8}`)\n\nScan the grid for colors not in `{1,2,3,4,8}`:\n\n- `9` at (row 2, col 1)\n- `7` at (row 12, col 29)\n- `6` at (row 29, col 22)\n\nSo the **seed colors** are `{6, 7, 9}`.  \nWe\u2019ll use them (in ascending order `6, 7, 9`) to color new bars.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Bars for outer vertical frames\n\nFrom the training examples:\n\n- For a vertical frame whose top row is `t`, we draw **three horizontal bars** on its outer side in the rows:\n\n  \\[\n  t+1,\\quad t+3,\\quad t+5\n  \\]\n\n- Each bar is filled completely from the border up to the frame with **one seed color**, and we don\u2019t overwrite any existing non\u20118 cells.\n- The bars\u2019 colors across those three rows follow the seeds sorted ascending (e.g. in Example 2: rows `t+1, t+3, t+5` had colors `3, 6, 9`).\n\nWe apply that to A and C using seeds `[6, 7, 9]`.\n\n### 2.1. Vertical frame A (cols 5\u20136, rows 1\u20137), outer side left\n\n- Top of A: `t = 1` \u2192 bars at rows `2, 4, 6`.\n- Outer side is **left** \u2192 columns 1\u20134.\n\nAssign colors per seed order `[6, 7, 9]`:\n\n- Row 2 (t+1): color 6\n- Row 4 (t+3): color 7\n- Row 6 (t+5): color 9\n\nApply on columns 1\u20134, but **only where the cell is 8**:\n\n- **Row 2** original: `9,8,8,8,4,1,...`\n  - c1 is 9 (seed) \u2192 keep.\n  - c2\u2013c4 are 8 \u2192 set to 6.\n  - \u2192 row2 becomes: `9,6,6,6,4,1,...`\n\n- **Row 4** original: `8,8,8,8,4,2,...`\n  - c1\u2013c4 are 8 \u2192 set to 7.\n  - \u2192 row4 becomes: `7,7,7,7,4,2,...`\n\n- **Row 6** original: `8,8,8,8,4,2,...`\n  - c1\u2013c4 are 8 \u2192 set to 9.\n  - \u2192 row6 becomes: `9,9,9,9,4,2,...`\n\n### 2.2. Vertical frame C (cols 25\u201326, rows 11\u201317), outer side right\n\n- Top of C: `t = 11` \u2192 bars at rows `12, 14, 16`.\n- Outer side is **right** \u2192 columns 27\u201329.\n\nAgain use seed order `[6, 7, 9]`:\n\n- Row 12 (t+1): color 6\n- Row 14 (t+3): color 7\n- Row 16 (t+5): color 9\n\nApply on columns 27\u201329, not overwriting non\u20118:\n\n- **Row 12** original ending: `...,2,4,8,8,7` at cols 25\u201329\n  - c27, c28 = 8 \u2192 set to 6\n  - c29 = 7 (seed) \u2192 keep.\n  - \u2192 tail becomes `2,4,6,6,7`\n\n- **Row 14** original tail: `...,2,4,8,8,8`\n  - c27\u2013c29 = 8 \u2192 set to 7\n  - \u2192 tail becomes `2,4,7,7,7`\n\n- **Row 16** original tail: `...,1,4,8,8,8`\n  - c27\u2013c29 = 8 \u2192 set to 9\n  - \u2192 tail becomes `1,4,9,9,9`\n\nVertical frame D is internal, so no bars there.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Bars for horizontal frame B (rows 3\u20134, cols 19\u201325)\n\nFrom Example 1, for a 7\u2011wide horizontal frame:\n\n- Width 7, columns `c..c+6`.\n- We draw **three vertical stripes** of seeds in columns with indices `{2, 3, 6}` from the left of the frame, **on the outer vertical side** of that frame.\n- If the frame is in the upper half of the grid (closer to top), the **outer side is upward** \u2013 the stripes go upward from just above the frame to the top border. In Example 2, the top horizontal frame produced short stripes into rows 1\u20132.\n\nOur test frame B:\n\n- B: rows 3\u20134, columns 19\u201325.\n- Width = 7, so indices `{2,3,6}` \u21d2 columns:\n  - index 2 \u2192 col 20\n  - index 3 \u2192 col 21\n  - index 6 \u2192 col 24\n- B is near the **top** \u2192 outer side is **upwards**:\n  - stripes from row 2 up to row 1 (until border or a non\u20118).\n\nColor assignment follows the same \u201couter\u2011side orientation\u201d rule as in examples:\n\n- For downward stripes (Example 1) we assign seeds **ascending left\u2011to\u2011right**.\n- For upward stripes (Example 2) we assign seeds **ascending right\u2011to\u2011left**.\n\nHere, B\u2019s outer side is upward, so we assign seeds `[6,7,9]` ascending from **rightmost to leftmost** stripe:\n\n- Rightmost stripe at col 24 \u2192 color 6 (smallest seed)\n- Middle stripe at col 21 \u2192 color 7\n- Leftmost stripe at col 20 \u2192 color 9\n\nNow paint these vertical stripes through rows 1\u20132, but only over 8\u2019s:\n\n- Column 20:\n  - (r1,c20): 8 \u2192 9\n  - (r2,c20): 8 \u2192 9\n- Column 21:\n  - (r1,c21): 8 \u2192 7\n  - (r2,c21): 8 \u2192 7\n- Column 24:\n  - (r1,c24): 8 \u2192 6\n  - (r2,c24): 8 \u2192 6\n\nNo frame cell or seed is overwritten.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Everything else\n\n- All other cells (including the frames in `{1,2,3,4}` and the seeds themselves) remain unchanged.\n- Background 8\u2019s are only changed where we explicitly drew a bar or stripe.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Final output grid\n\nPutting all modifications together, the resulting grid is:\n\nRow 1  \n`8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,7,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8`\n\nRow 2  \n`9,6,6,6,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,7,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8`\n\nRow 3  \n`8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,8,8,8,8`\n\nRow 4  \n`7,7,7,7,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,8,8,8`\n\nRow 5  \n`8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n\nRow 6  \n`9,9,9,9,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n\nRow 7  \n`8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n\nRow 8  \n`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n\nRow 9  \n`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n\nRow 10  \n`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n\nRow 11  \n`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8`\n\nRow 12  \n`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,6,6,7`\n\nRow 13  \n`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8`\n\nRow 14  \n`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,7,7,7`\n\nRow 15  \n`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8`\n\nRow 16  \n`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,4,9,9,9`\n\nRow 17  \n`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8`\n\nRow 18  \n`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n\nRow 19  \n`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n\nRow 20  \n`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n\nRow 21  \n`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n\nRow 22  \n`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n\nRow 23  \n`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n\nRow 24  \n`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n\nRow 25  \n`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n\nRow 26  \n`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n\nRow 27  \n`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n\nRow 28  \n`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`\n\nRow 29  \n`8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8`",

        "Full raw LLM response": "To understand the transformation I looked for the regularities between the given inputs and outputs. Each training grid had \u201ccomponents\u201d formed by two adjacent non\u2011background columns that ran over several rows. For each such vertical component you can pick the \u201cbase\u201d pair of colours (the pair that occurs most often in that component) and compute three values\n\n- \\(k_1 = s\\),\n- \\(k_2 = 2s\\) wrapped into 1\u20139 by subtracting 9 if necessary,\n- \\(k_3 = 3s\\) similarly wrapped,\n\nwhere \\(s\\) is the sum of the two base colours. These three values were then written into the margin on the side nearest the edge of the grid, one whole margin row at a time. For components with sum greater than 4 the rows used are the third and fourth rows of the base segment (getting \\(k_1\\) and \\(k_2\\) respectively) and the last variant row above the base (getting \\(k_3\\)); for components with small sums the ordering is reversed as in the second example. Only background cells are overwritten. In addition, any non\u2011background cell at the very top or bottom edge propagates its colour inward along its column through background cells until the next non\u2011background cell in that column.\n\nApplying those rules to the test grid:\n\n- Component at columns\u202f5\u20136 with base (4,2), \\(s=6\\): rows\u202f5 and\u202f6 left margin get 6 and\u202f3, row\u202f2 left margin gets 9.\n- Component at columns\u202f25\u201326 with base (2,4), \\(s=6\\): rows\u202f14 and\u202f15 right margin get 6 and\u202f3, row\u202f11 right margin gets\u202f9.\n- Component at columns\u202f10\u201311 with base (4,2), \\(s=6\\): rows\u202f28 and\u202f29 left margin get 6 and\u202f3, row\u202f25 left margin gets 9.\n- Bottom\u2011edge cell (30,22)=6 propagates upward through column\u202f22 until row\u202f4.\n\nThe resulting output grid is:\n\n8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,3,3,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,2,4,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,2,4,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,2,4,3,3,3\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,1,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,1,1,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8",

        "Full raw LLM response": "The transformation in the examples can be understood in terms of a recurring two\u2011row \u201cshape\u201d that appears in different rotations. Three singleton colours are mapped to the three principal colours of the shape, and for each occurrence of the shape \u201cbeams\u201d of the singleton colours are extended from specific rows or columns of the shape into the surrounding 8\u2011background.\n\nIn the test input the shape is 7 cells wide and occurs horizontally at rows\u202f3\u20134, and vertically at columns\u202f5\u20136, 25\u201326, and 10\u201311. The three singleton colours are 6,\u202f7 and\u202f9; mapping in this instance is taken in descending order of the base colours. For the horizontal shape, beams are projected upwards from columns at offsets 1,\u202f2 and\u202f5 from the left of the shape; for the vertical shapes of height\u202f7, beams are projected from rows 2,\u202f5 and\u202f6. Beams run across 8\u2011cells only, stopping at existing non\u20118 values and extending to the grid edge.\n\nApplying this to the test grid gives the following output:\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,7,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n9,6,6,6,4,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,7,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,2,2,2,2,1,1,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,4,4,4,4,4,1,8,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8\n6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,2,4,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,4,8,8,8\n7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,2,4,8,8,8\n9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1,4,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,1,1,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,1,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,4,2,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,6,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",
