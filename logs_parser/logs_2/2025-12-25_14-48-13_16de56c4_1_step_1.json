        "Full raw LLM response": "First, let\u2019s infer the rule from the three solved examples, then apply it to the test input.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Understanding the transformation\n\n### 1.1. What stays the same?\n\nAcross all examples:\n\n- The **width** of the output grid equals the width of the input grid.\n- The **height** of the output grid equals the height of the input grid.\n- All nonzero cells from the input appear in the output, but often **copied** vertically into multiple rows.\n- Column positions of colors do **not** change; we only duplicate certain rows.\n\nSo: we\u2019re taking the original rows as \u201ctemplates\u201d and stacking duplicates in specific positions.\n\n---\n\n### 1.2. Find the \u201cmain\u201d row and \u201cspine\u201d column\n\nLook for a column that appears to be a **vertical spine** along which many objects align or are copied.\n\n#### Example 2\n\nInput (last row repeated here for reference):\n\nRow 8: `0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,9,0`\n\nOutput is:\n\nRow 0: `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,9,0`  \nRow 1: `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow 2 (copy of original row 2 + extra at col 9 & 18): `0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0`  \nRow 3: `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0`  \nRow 4 (copy of original row 4 + extra at col 9 & 18): `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,9,0`  \nRow 5: `0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow 6: `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0`  \nRow 7: `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow 8: `0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,9,0`\n\nObserve:\n\n- Column 10 (index 9) has a `3` in **every** row.\n- Column 16 and 19 (indices 15 and 18) have patterns of `1` and `9` that match the last row.\n- The last row of input is exactly row 8 of output: it\u2019s like the **template** row.\n- That last row\u2019s nonzero columns (2, 9, 15, 18) are propagated upward such that:\n  - Column 9 is filled on all rows.\n  - Column 2 appears on rows 2, 5, 8.\n  - Column 15 appears on rows 0, 4, 8.\n  - Column 18 appears on rows 2, 4, 6, 8.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\n- The \u201cmain\u201d row seems to be row 4 of the input, whose output becomes a full line of 1\u2019s across all columns where that color appears (filling that row).\n- Some nonzero colors in the bottom section of the grid (9,6,8,3) are then extended horizontally along their rows according to repeated vertical positions of those colors.\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nInput row 6:\n`0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,2,0`\n\nOutput has row 0,2,4,6 and some others as copies or partial copies of this pattern, with 2's and 6's replicated vertically in those same columns.\n\n**Abstract pattern:**\n\n1. Identify one or more **key template rows** that contain multiple nonzero colors.\n2. For each nonzero in a template row, **replicate that color vertically** in its column on a specific set of rows, forming a vertical \u201cstripe\u201d pattern aligned with visible patterns in the input.\n3. The exact set of rows used seems to be based on rows already containing that color somewhere (or similar structural repetition patterns).\n\nConcretely, in all the examples, the **bottommost row that has multiple distinct colors** is treated as the **main template row**, and its colors are propagated vertically in a repeating pattern that includes that bottom row itself and all rows above where the same color already occurs.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Applying the rule to the test input\n\nTest input (indexed by row r and column c, 0-based):\n\nRow 0: `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow 1: `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2`  \nRow 2: `0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5`  \nRow 3: `0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2`  \nRow 4: `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow 5: `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,6,0,0,0,0,6`  \nRow 6: `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0`  \nRow 7: `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8`  \nRow 8: `0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7`\n\nThe **bottommost row containing multiple different nonzero colors** is row 8:\n- Row 8 has `4` at col 7, and `7` at cols 18 and 20.\n- This is analogous to the template row in the earlier examples.\n\nWe also see other rows with those colors:\n\n- Color 4:\n  - Only appears at (8,7).\n- Color 7:\n  - At (1,9), (8,18), (8,20).\n- No other row has 7 except row 1 and row 8.\n- 4 doesn\u2019t appear elsewhere.\n\nFrom the examples, propagation is **conservative**: colors are replicated vertically only in columns where they already appear and mostly into rows where that color already has some presence or into a repeating pattern anchored by an existing \u201cspine\u201d row. In the test, unlike Example 2 and 3, there are no repeated occurrences of 4 or 7 forming a strong vertical pattern, and no column appears to be a universal spine across many rows (like the 3\u2019s in example 2 or 6\u2019s in example 3).\n\nAlso, note how in Example 2 and Example 3, the output always **retains the original template row exactly** and adds vertical copies of that row into other rows where the same colors or pattern align. In the test:\n\n- For 7: there is an occurrence at (1,9) separate from (8,18)/(8,20). The columns don\u2019t match; it\u2019s not a vertical stripe candidate across multiple rows.\n- For 4: solitary.\n\nGiven this, the safest consistent extension of the learned behavior is:\n\n- Treat row 8 as the template row.\n- Copy its nonzero cells (4 in col 7, 7 in cols 18 and 20) only onto other rows that already contain those same colors somewhere in those columns. But no such rows exist (no other row has 4 or a 7 in those same columns).\n- Thus, **no vertical propagation** is triggered.\n- Therefore, the transformation does **nothing** on this test: the output should equal the input.\n\nThis is also consistent with the idea that the rule is about extending existing regularity; when no vertical alignment exists to extend, we preserve the original grid.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Final output grid\n\nSo the output grid is the same as the input grid:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,5  \n0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,6,0,0,0,0,6  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7",
