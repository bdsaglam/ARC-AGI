        "Full raw LLM response": "First, I\u2019ll infer the rule from the three examples, then apply it to the test input, and finally give the output grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Understanding the pattern\n\nAcross all examples, the grids are mostly filled with a background color (8), with some \u201cinteresting\u201d non\u20118 shapes in the interior.\n\nKey observations:\n\n- There is always a central horizontal \u201cbar\u201d or \u201cobject\u201d that contains a distinctive internal color (1 in examples 1\u20133; 2,5,6,7,9 also appear but 1 is special because it\u2019s in an interior, thin vertical or central structure).\n- The transformation does **not** modify the central object.\n- Instead, the transformation \u201cprojects\u201d the presence of that central object **vertically** up and down, but in a constrained way:  \n  - In Example 1, the vertical projection is through the column that contains the 1\u2019s and 7\u2019s and 2\u2019s; but notice it only cleans background around that vertical structure and does not extend the 1,2,7,6,5 that are already present elsewhere.\n  - In Example 2, the main internal column with 1s (column 8, 0\u2011indexed) becomes a sort of \u201cspine\u201d where rows that intersect with non\u2011background structure seem to be preserved, while parts of the rows that do not \u201csupport\u201d that spine revert to background (8).\n  - In Example 3, the center vertical column with 1\u2019s stays as is; the transformation clears some 1\u2019s in top and bottom rows that are isolated from the central \u201cbody\u201d and replaces them with background (8), while copying 7\u2019s on the vertical extent that aligns with vertical connectivity.\n\nA more consistent description that fits all three examples:\n\n- Identify the main connected non\u2011background \u201cbody\u201d that:\n  - includes the row containing an interior \u201cspine\u201d of color 1; and\n  - includes the horizontally extended, thicker block around it (possibly formed by colors like 5,2,6,7 or 4,5,7 etc.).\n- Keep that entire connected component unchanged.\n- Then, for each row that lies **above or below** the thickest part of that body:\n  - If a given column in that row does **not** vertically lie in the same x\u2011range as the main body, turn it to background (8).\n  - Where a column *does* align vertically with the body\u2019s x\u2011extent, keep non\u2011background content that vertically stacks to form a continuous object; otherwise revert to background.\n- The result visually \u201cthins out\u201d the non\u2011background cells toward the top and bottom, keeping only those that are part of or aligned with the main central structure.\n\nNow inspect each example more concretely to verify:\n\n### Example 1\n\n- The central \u201cbody\u201d is around rows 3\u20139 and columns 1\u20139 (0\u2011indexed): the vertical bar of 5\u2019s, a central vertical spine of 2\u20117\u20111, and some 6\u2019s at row 6.\n- In the **output**:\n  - Rows far above (0\u20131) and far below (11\u201312) are fully 8.\n  - In intermediate rows outside the thickest body (e.g., input row 2 and 10), only the part aligning with the central spine is kept; flanking 5\u2019s, 2\u2019s that are not in the vertical central \u201cbody\u201d are removed.\n- The visible outcome is that the central 2\u20117\u20111 vertical structure is preserved, the big 5 column is shortened from the top and bottom, and some 8\u2019s replace 5\u2019s and 2\u2019s where those extensions are not supported by the main core.\n\n### Example 2\n\n- The central, thick body is around row 7 (0\u2011indexed) with a horizontal stripe of 4,7,5,1,9, and vertical extensions of 4\u2019s, 5\u2019s, 7\u2019s, 9\u2019s, and 1\u2019s.\n- The output cleans up non\u2011background cells in rows above and below, but keeps a compact core around the vertical line of 1\u2019s and the surrounding horizontal band.\n- Non\u2011background cells that are \u201ctoo far\u201d from that central frame (e.g. 4\u2019s on upper rows) are removed if they are not connected to that core through a path of non\u20118 cells.\n\n### Example 3\n\n- There is a central vertical band of 1\u2019s from row 1 to 5 between columns 2 and 4 (0\u2011indexed), and flanking 4\u2019s and 7\u2019s rows 2\u20134.\n- The output:\n  - Top row all 8 remains.\n  - Second row rightmost 7 is introduced (aligning with the central 7\u2019s column from the middle row).\n  - Some 1\u2019s near the borders that form \u201ctips\u201d are removed if they are isolated above/below.\n- The net effect: the central compact structure (rows 2\u20134) is unchanged, and top/bottom rows are simplified to a minimal vertical projection aligned to the middle core.\n\nSo conceptually, the rule is:\n\n> Preserve the \u201cmain connected core\u201d of non\u2011background cells and restrict any extension above/below it to align only where those columns belong to this core; otherwise set to background.\n\nThis is more an *ARC\u2011style shape regularization* and vertical alignment rule, rather than a simple linear operation.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

It has the maximal spread of non\u20118 cells across the width (0..16 except some gaps). That forms the main body.\n\nAccording to the inferred rule:\n\n- The main body (rows around 5\u201311, especially 8) should be preserved as is.\n- Above and below, non\u20118 cells that are \u201cin line\u201d with this main body and part of its connected component should remain.\n- There is no suggestion from the examples that any **new** non\u2011background color would be introduced where none existed, nor that any part of the core gets pruned unnecessarily.\n- The non\u20118 cells in the test input already form a well\u2011connected, compact shape (a sort of fat cross with 9 column and 5/2/6 bands).\n- There are no isolated \u201cdangling\u201d bits at the top or bottom like in Example 3 that should be removed, because:\n  - The topmost 9s at rows 3\u20135 connect straight down via 9s to row 8.\n  - The 5s at rows 5\u201311 connect vertically to the thicker band at row 8.\n  - The 2s at rows 6\u201310 connect through rows 7\u20139 to the row 8 core.\n  - The 6s and 7 at row 8 are part of the core row itself; there are no detached 6 or 7 islands above/below them.\n\nSo there is no extraneous vertical \u201cextension\u201d that violates the shape regularity the examples seemed to fix; the given shape is already the regularized body.\n\nThat implies:\n\n> The transformation on this particular input leaves the grid unchanged.\n\nThus, the output grid should be identical to the input.\n\n---\n\n## 3.

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation pattern:\n\n1. Each example has a horizontal reference line marked with 6s\n2. There are vertical bars of different colors intersecting this horizontal line\n3. The vertical bars have different lengths (extend different distances from the center line)\n4. The transformation swaps the lengths of vertical bars - the shortest bar becomes the longest, and vice versa, maintaining symmetry around the horizontal line\n\nLet me analyze the test input:\n- Row 8 is the horizontal center line (marked with 6s)\n- Column 0 has 9s: extends rows 3-12 (10 cells total, 5 above + 5 below center)\n- Columns 2-4 have 5s: extends rows 5-11 (7 cells, 3 above + 3 below center)\n- Columns 7-9 have 2s: extends rows 6-10 (5 cells, 2 above + 2 below center)\n- Column 16 has 7: only at row 8 (1 cell, 0 above + 0 below center)\n\nAfter transformation, the lengths reverse:\n- Column 16 (7): expands to 10 cells (5 above + 5 below = rows 3-12)\n- Columns 7-9 (2s): expands to 7 cells (3 above + 3 below = rows 5-11)\n- Columns 2-4 (5s): shrinks to 5 cells (2 above + 2 below = rows 6-10)\n- Column 0 (9s): shrinks to 1 cell (only row 8)\n\n```\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,5,5,5,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,5,5,5,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n9,6,5,5,5,6,6,2,2,2,6,6,6,6,6,6,7\n8,8,5,5,5,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,5,5,5,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8\n```",
