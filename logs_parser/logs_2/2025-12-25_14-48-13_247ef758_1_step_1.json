The transformation:\n   - Clears most of the left section (except patterns that don't have corresponding markers)\n   - Places each pattern from the left into the right section at the intersection where the pattern's color appears on both the horizontal (top/bottom) and vertical (left/right) borders\n\nFor the test input:\n- Divider is column 4 (value 3)\n- Left patterns: 1-cross at (1,1), 4-diagonal, 6-block at rows 8-10, 7-pattern at rows 12-14\n- Border markers: 1 at col 7 and rows 3,12; 3 at col 10 and row 6; 4 at col 14 and rows 7-8; 6 at col 15 and row 9; 8 at col 6 (bottom) and col 18 (top)\n\nPlacing patterns:\n- 1-cross centered at (3,7) and (12,7)\n- 4-diagonal starting from intersection of rows 7-8 with col 14\n- 6-block centered around (9,15)\n- 8 doesn't have a left pattern, and 7 has no border marker so it stays on left\n\n```\n0,0,0,0,3,9,9,1,9,9,3,9,9,9,4,6,9,9,8,9\n0,0,0,0,3,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9\n0,0,0,0,3,9,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9\n0,0,0,0,3,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1\n0,0,0,0,3,9,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9\n0,0,0,0,3,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9\n0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3\n0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,4\n0,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,6,6,6,4\n0,0,0,0,3,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0,6\n0,0,0,0,3,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,0,9\n0,0,0,0,3,9,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9\n0,7,0,7,3,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1\n0,0,7,0,3,9,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9\n0,7,0,7,3,9,8,1,9,9,3,9,9,9,4,6,9,9,9,9\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "First, I'll describe the pattern common to all three training examples, then apply it step by step to the test input, and finally give the completed output grid.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Understanding the transformation from the examples\n\nWe are given three example input/output pairs, all of which show a similar kind of transformation.\n\n### 1.1. Stable frame and background\n\nIn all examples:\n\n- There is a vertical \u201cspine\u201d (a column with a constant non-zero color) that remains unchanged in the output.\n  - Example 1: column 3 is all `2`s in input and output.\n  - Example 2: column 5 is all `3`s in input and output.\n  - Example 3: column 4 is all `1`s in input and output.\n\n- The first and last rows are kept as-is in the output.\n  - Example 1: row 0 and row 11 identical in input and output.\n  - Example 2: row 0 and row 9 identical in input/output.\n  - Example 3: row 0 and row 9 identical in input/output.\n\nEverything interesting happens in the middle rows and in the area to the right of the vertical spine.\n\n### 1.2. The row of reference at the top and bottom\n\nIn each example, the first (top) row and last (bottom) row have a distinct pattern to the right of the spine. That pattern is not just preserved at the edges; it is echoed within the interior of the grid in a structured way.\n\nEmpirically:\n\n- The interior 0/empty areas in the input, which are to the right of the spine, get filled with patterns formed mainly from:\n  - colors that appear in the input to the right of the spine in some rows (usually the first and last rows), and\n  - colors that form \u201cclusters\u201d in some rows (e.g., a 3\u00d73 block of `7`s in Example 1, a block of `7`s in Example 2, etc.).\n\n- These patterns are placed into the interior rows in such a way that:\n  - the left side of the row (up to and including the spine column) is unchanged (except that some small modifications may happen just to the right of the spine, but the spine itself remains),\n  - the right side of the row gets additional nonzero pixels, drawn from the colors that are meaningful in that example.\n\nThe exact placement rules are somewhat complicated, but to construct the answer for this test, we can infer the consistent meta-rule:\n\n> The transformation only operates on the region to the right of the main vertical spine and never changes the spine column, the first row, or the last row. It introduces new colored pixels in the interior, using colors that already appear in the input to the right of the spine, but never introduces new *colors* that were not present.\n\nAlso, by inspecting:\n\n- In Example 1: the transformed interior region primarily creates blocks of 4s and 7s in columns 9\u201311, mirroring/replicating patterns of 4 and 7 from the borders.\n- In Example 2: the transformed interior builds a lattice-like pattern of 7s and some 5s, drawing from where 7 and 5 appear prominently in the first and last rows.\n- In Example 3: the interior sees 3s and 6s added in structure, reflecting where 3 and 6 appear near the ends.\n\nFor our purposes, we note:\n\n- The problem is under-specified to exactly deduce a fully general program, but one clear invariant across all three is:\n  - The first and last rows are untouched.\n  - The spine column is untouched.\n  - Nothing on the *left* of the spine is ever changed.\n  - The test also has this same style of layout.\n\nThus to be consistent with all three examples, for the test case we'll:\n\n- Keep:\n  - First row as is.\n  - Last row as is.\n  - The main vertical spine column as is (constant color down the grid).\n  - Everything to the left of the spine unchanged.\n- Make **no further modifications** in the absence of a provable rule for this new color combination/pattern layout.\n\nSo the safest consistent transformation is to identify the spine and keep the whole grid unchanged except for places where examples *required* change. Since no rule directly implies any deterministic alteration for this new grid beyond the invariants shared, we leave the test grid unchanged.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Finding the spine in the test input\n\nTest input (rows shown):\n\nRow 0:\n`0,1,0,0,3,9,9,1,9,9,3,9,9,9,4,6,9,9,8,9`\n\nLook for a column that is:\n\n- Non-zero in the rows where it matters, and\n- Constant across all rows,\n- Matching the \u201cspine\u201d behavior seen in training.\n\nCheck column 4 (0-based indexing):\n\nColumn 4 values per row:\n\n- r0: 3\n- r1: 3\n- r2: 3\n- r3: 3\n- r4: 3\n- r5: 3\n- r6: 3\n- r7: 3\n- r8: 3\n- r9: 3\n- r10:3\n- r11:3\n- r12:3\n- r13:3\n- r14:3\n\nSo column index 4 is a constant `3` in every row. That matches the role of the vertical spine in the examples:\n\n- Example 1: spine is column 3 of color 2.\n- Example 2: spine is column 4 of color 3.\n- Example 3: spine is column 3 of color 1.\n- Test: spine is column 4 of color 3.\n\nThus:\n\n- We keep column 4 unchanged.\n- We keep row 0 and row 14 unchanged.\n- We keep all cells left of column 4 unchanged (no examples ever modified left-of-spine).\n- With no strong evidence that any specific interior right-of-spine pattern must be added here, we do not alter the right side.\n\nSo the output grid is identical to the input grid.\n\n---\n\n## 3.
