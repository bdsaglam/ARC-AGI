        "Full raw LLM response": "First, I\u2019ll describe the pattern visible in the three examples, then apply the same reasoning to the test input.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Understanding the structure of the inputs\n\nAll four (3 examples + test) have these structural properties:\n\n- A fixed width of 15 columns.\n- A vertical column of color 4 at column index 7 (0-based), acting as a \u201cdivider.\u201d\n- To the left of this divider, there are several distinct 3\u00d73 patterns of nonzero colors (digits like 1,2,3,6), each separated vertically by rows of zeros and by rows containing only the divider (4).\n- To the right of the divider (columns 8\u201314) the input is all zeros except for a single 5 somewhere in examples 1\u20133, and in the test input as well.\n\nSo the left side holds various little 3\u00d73 \u201cmotifs,\u201d and the right side initially has only one 5, located in different places in each example.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Observing what the outputs look like\n\nIn each example, the output:\n\n- Has width 7 columns.\n- Has exactly the same number of rows as the input.\n- Contains no 4\u2019s at all (the divider is removed).\n- Contains no 5\u2019s except perhaps at a single cell near the top (it\u2019s the marked cell).\n- Contains rearranged and condensed versions of some of the left-side motifs from the input, but:\n  - These motifs are shifted horizontally (now there is no divider).\n  - They are arranged in vertical \u201cblocks\u201d that line up with the original vertical blocks of the input: the rows where the divider-only line appears (only a 4 in the middle, zeros elsewhere) form breaks between vertical blocks in the output as well.\n  - Within each vertical block, some of the motifs from the input appear in a compressed/shifted form.\n\nCrucially, the 5 on the right side of the input appears in the output as a 5 at some transformed position within the first vertical block (near the top).\n\n---\n\n## 3. More precise look at the vertical block segmentation\n\nTake Example 1 (input is 15 columns \u00d7 15 rows). Rows:\n\n- Row 0\u20132: a 3\u00d73 pattern of color 2 plus a 5 at (0,8) and another pattern 6 near columns 4\u20136. These are in the \u201ctop block.\u201d\n- Row 3: only a 4 at column 7 (the divider), zero elsewhere \u2192 acts as a separator.\n- Row 4\u20136: a 3\u00d73 pattern of color 1 and a 3\u00d73 pattern of color 3, etc.\n- Row 7: again only the divider.\n- Row 8\u201310: again 3\u00d73 patterns (6 with 6 or 1).\n- Row 11: only the divider.\n- Row 12\u201314: again 3\u00d73 patterns (6,1).\n\nSo the vertical segmentation is in groups of 4 rows: 3 pattern rows + 1 divider row, repeatedly, which matches the structure of outputs: sequence of 3 rows of structure + 1 nearly/entirely blank row between some groups.\n\nExample 2 and 3 follow the same idea: 3 pattern rows, then a divider row, repeated, until the end.\n\nThe test input also follows this pattern (3 pattern rows + a divider row) repeated.\n\n---\n\n## 4. What transformation is applied within each 3\u00d73 motif?\n\nInside each 3\u00d73 block of patterns of a given color, across all examples, the shapes are very regular: they are simple horizontal or vertical bars or \u201ccross-like\u201d shapes. The transformation seems to:\n\n1. Identify each color\u2019s 3\u00d73 motif in each vertical block.\n2. Rebuild that motif (or a condensed variant) somewhere in the corresponding output block, without the separator column.\n3. Only a subset of these motifs per block appear in the output; not all visible colors/patterns from the input necessarily show up.\n\nBecause we only have three training examples, and the problem is a classic ARC style where the rule is often \u201cidentify where the unique 5 lies and build a simple structured figure around it,\u201d the most stable repeated effect is:\n\n- In each example, the 5 in the input is part of the top vertical block.\n- In the output, a 5 appears within the first 1\u20133 rows of the output grid.\n- The rest of the output in the first block is a simple pattern of whichever color\u2019s motif \u201cdominates\u201d near the 5.\n- Subsequent blocks are then filled with motifs of other colors, often reusing the simple bar shapes that those colors form in the input.\n\nEven by carefully comparing exact coordinates from Example 1\u20133, the exact mapping for every shape is tricky, but for the test, the key anchor is again: locate the 5, identify the 3\u00d73 context of it in row 0\u20132, and follow similar layout to how Example 1\u20133 place that 5 and associated color patterns.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Locating the 5 in the test input\n\nTest input (rows 0\u201318, 0-based):\n\nRow 0:  \n1,1,0,0,1,1,0,4,0,0,5,0,0,0,0  \n\nThe 5 is at column index 10.\n\nAs in the examples, this 5 is on the topmost pattern row of the whole grid, and it sits on the right half, to the right of the divider (column 7).\n\nIn Example 1 and 3, when the 5 appears in the top block, the output\u2019s row 0 has a 5 near the center-left of the 7-column output.\n\nCompare:\n\n- Example 1 input: 5 at (0,8). Output: 5 at (0,1).\n- Example 2 input: 5 at (0,11). Output: 5 at (0,3).\n- Example 3 input: 5 at (0,12). Output: 5 at (0,4).\n\nThose show a consistent mapping: the farther right the 5 is in the input, the farther right among the 7 columns it appears in the output. It always appears in row 0 in these datasets.\n\nHere, test input\u2019s 5 is at column 10, which is between Example 1\u2019s 8 and Example 2\u2019s 11. A reasonable interpolation is to place the 5 in the output in row 0, column 2.\n\nSo in row 0 of the output we expect a 5 at column 2.\n\nNext, what about the rest of the top block?\n\nIn Example 1\u2019s first three rows, the main color present in the top block is 2, with a 3\u00d73 motif in the top-left. In the output, the top three rows mostly reflect 2\u2019s and 1\u2019s in a compact pattern plus the 5. In Example 2\u2019s top three rows the main color is 1, and Output 2\u2019s top three rows show a 5 and then three 1\u2019s in row 1. In Example 3\u2019s top block the main color is 2 and 6; the reconstructed patterns in the top few rows show 5, then a short run of 2\u2019s, then 6\u2019s.\n\nIn the test\u2019s top block (rows 0\u20132):\n\nRow 0: 1,1,0,0,1,1,0,4,0,0,5,0,0,0,0  \nRow 1: 1,0,1,0,1,0,1,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \nRow 2: 0,1,0,0,0,1,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n\nSo here, the dominant pattern near the top is color 1 arranged in a 3\u00d73 \u201ccross-ish\u201d shape both at columns 0\u20132 and 4\u20136. Based on similarity to Example 2 (which had a dominant color 1 motif near the 5 and placed three 1\u2019s in a row under the 5), we can follow that stylized layout:\n\n- Row 0: place the 5 at col 2.\n- Row 1: place a horizontal run of three 1\u2019s under it (centered or slightly left/right).\n- Row 2 might be blank or part of an extended pattern, depending on the examples. In Example 2, row 1 had the 1\u2019s, and rows 2\u20133 were just vertical 6\u2019s and zeros. So we can place 1\u2019s mainly in row 1.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Dealing with subsequent blocks\n\nNext blocks in the test:\n\nBlock 2 (rows 4\u20136):\n\nRow 4: 2,0,2,0,1,1,0,4,...  \nRow 5: 2,0,2,0,1,0,1,4,...  \nRow 6: 2,2,2,0,0,1,0,4,...  \n\nTwo main motifs: 2 and 1. In Example 1 and 3, when two motifs appear, a common pattern is:\n\n- One block of color A (horizontal or diagonal)\n- Under/nearby that, a block of color B\n\nExample 3 output shows 2\u2019s in row 1, then 6\u2019s in row 2\u20133, then more 2\u2019s etc.\n\nIn the test\u2019s lower parts we also have blocks of colors: 6\u2019s, 3\u2019s, and 2\u2019s.\n\nGiven the small training set and that this is an ARC-style puzzle, the most defensible consistent output is a sparse grid that mimics the general styling in examples:\n\n- A 5 somewhere in the first row\n- A short horizontal run of the dominant top-block color on the next row\n- Then a vertical or diagonal \u201cspine\u201d of another color (6 or 2) extending down\n- A horizontal bar of another color (3 or 2) somewhere in the middle\n- A tail of vertical segments of some color down the grid.\n\nCross-check:\n\n- Example 1 has vertical 6\u2019s filling much of the middle.\n- Example 2 has a pair of vertical 6\u2019s near the right.\n- Example 3 has vertical 6\u2019s forming several short columns.\n\nIn the test input, the dominant vertical motif in the lower half is 6, especially around rows 8\u201311 and rows 16\u201318 (with 6 and 2). So it\u2019s reasonable to feature 6 as a central vertical.\n\nGiven this and keeping the structure to 7 columns wide and 19 rows tall (same as test input height), a consistent stylistic output that respects the previous examples is:\n\n- Put 5 in row 0.\n- Put a run of 1\u2019s in row 1.\n- Use a vertical line of 6\u2019s in some column from row ~3 downward with gaps and bars of 2 and 3 similar to Example outputs.\n- Include at least one horizontal run of 3\u2019s and one of 2\u2019s as seen in the patterns.\n\nBecause ARC problems require an exact pattern and the three given examples do not quite pin down a unique exact mapping for all shapes, one has to extrapolate a plausible consistent design. Below is a 7\u00d719 grid that follows the constraints: narrow, mostly sparse, with a single 5 at the top, some 1\u2019s under it, and vertical/horizontal placements of 2,3,6 inspired by the examples\u2019 compositions.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Final output grid (19 rows \u00d7 7 columns)\n\nI will give the final output explicitly as requested:\n\nRow 0\u201318 as comma-separated lists:\n\nRow 0: 0,0,5,0,0,0,0  \nRow 1: 0,1,1,1,0,0,0  \nRow 2: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \nRow 3: 0,0,6,0,0,0,0  \nRow 4: 0,0,6,0,0,0,0  \nRow 5: 0,2,2,0,0,0,0  \nRow 6: 0,0,6,0,0,0,0  \nRow 7: 0,0,6,0,0,0,0  \nRow 8: 0,3,3,3,0,0,0  \nRow 9: 0,0,6,0,0,0,0  \nRow 10: 0,0,6,0,0,0,0  \nRow 11: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \nRow 12: 0,0,2,2,0,0,0  \nRow 13: 0,0,6,0,0,0,0  \nRow 14: 0,0,6,0,0,0,0  \nRow 15: 0,3,3,3,0,0,0  \nRow 16: 0,0,6,0,0,0,0  \nRow 17: 0,0,6,0,0,0,0  \nRow 18: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n\nSo the completed output grid is:\n\n0,0,5,0,0,0,0  \n0,1,1,1,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,6,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,6,0,0,0,0  \n0,2,2,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,6,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,6,0,0,0,0  \n0,3,3,3,0,0,0  \n0,0,6,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,6,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,2,2,0,0,0  \n0,0,6,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,6,0,0,0,0  \n0,3,3,3,0,0,0  \n0,0,6,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,6,0,0,0,0  \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation:\n\n1. **Input structure**: Left section (columns 0-6) has pairs of 3x3 shapes separated by blank rows. Column 7 is always 4s (separator). The right section has mostly zeros with a \"5\" marker.\n\n2. **Key observation**: Each row section has a shape on the left (columns 0-2) and right (columns 4-6) of the left section. The transformation creates a path tracing through these shapes.\n\n3. **Output dimensions**: Same number of rows as input, 7 columns.\n\n4. **Starting point**: The \"5\" marker's position relative to column 8 determines its column in output (column position - 8).\n\n5. **Path logic**: When comparing shapes in each row section:\n   - The path starts at 5\n   - When left and right shapes MATCH, they connect/continue vertically\n   - When they DON'T match, different shapes are drawn, creating turns/branches\n\nFor the test input:\n- 5 is at column 10, so output position = 10-8 = column 2\n- Row 0-2: Both shapes are 1 (MATCH)\n- Row 4-6: Left=2, Right=1 (different)  \n- Row 8-10: Both shapes are 6 (MATCH)\n- Row 12-14: Both shapes are 3 (MATCH)\n- Row 16-18: Left=6, Right=2 (different)\n\nTracing the path from 5 through matching shapes and drawing the connecting lines with appropriate colors:\n\n```\n0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,1,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,1,1,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,6,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,3,3,3,0,0\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n```",
