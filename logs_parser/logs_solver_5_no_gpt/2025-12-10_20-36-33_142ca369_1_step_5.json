            "Full raw LLM response": "Okay, here's my thought process as I tackle this ARC task. The user wants me to solve this puzzle.\n\n**1. Analyze the Examples**\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   I start by breaking down the example input and output. The input is a 20x20 grid with some shapes at the top and single pixels at the bottom.\n    *   The output shows a pattern of diagonal lines that appear to emanate from the original shapes and converge at the single pixels at the bottom.\n    *   My initial hypothesis is that it has something to do with streams and that the lines act like light, bouncing off a \"mirror\" (the single pixel) and then continuing on a different diagonal. I think that there is a mirror line, as if there are anchor pixels at x=10 that each incoming ray bounces off.\n    *   After further inspection, I notice the anchor locations at column 10, then I notice that there are reflections or \"bounces\" across this mirror line.\n    *   It looks like the initial diagonal beam (+1,+1) from the source reflects across an anchor when it hits the anchor's column. That implies a new direction (-1, +1).\n    *   This \"V\" shaped pattern around the anchor makes sense when I see the result is a line to the anchor, then a \"reflected\" path.\n    *   It seems like I need to identify the \"Bottom-Right\" pixel of each shape. From that pixel, I need to send a diagonal beam. The stream will form a \"V\" shape around the matching anchor pixel or shape.\n    *   I need to test this hypothesis.\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   In Example 2, the grid is smaller (18x18). There are a variety of shapes at the top and what look like shapes at the bottom.\n    *   I note that the \"anchor\" in this case isn't a single pixel. It's another shape.\n    *   My hypothesis of a V-shape, reflection is immediately challenged. I can't find a clear reflection axis.\n    *   I go back to Example 1 and look for any clues.\n    *   It seems in Ex 2, a \"gravity\" type of pattern is formed, but I have trouble seeing a reflection.\n    *   My hypothesis that the stream will travel to the edge is tested.\n    *   I'm having trouble seeing an obvious relation and need a new hypothesis.\n\n*   **Alternative Idea:**\n    *   I go back to Example 1 because it's simpler. I look for a \"center of symmetry\".\n    *   Perhaps the target acts as a mirror, but the axis may not be where I was thinking.\n    *   After checking the example, I find the outputs form V shapes and I can look to trace upwards, not down.\n    *   I hypothesize that the beam \"bounces\" off an anchor pixel (or shape).\n    *   I have a new rule: upward rays from each pixel to a same-colored source pixel, then add that line.\n\n*   **Refining the Rule:**\n    *   I refine the rule as it applies to both examples, using the bottom-right of the shape.\n    *   I'll need to figure out how far the lines go. It seems they stop at the sink anchor shape.\n\n*   **Check Example 2:**\n    *   I test out my logic on Example 2. It doesn't work. The lines are not reflections and I have to go back to my logic.\n\n*   **Hypothesis Update:**\n    *   I need to rethink my reflection logic. The source is a shape and destination is a shape, so maybe a pattern?\n    *   Back to Example 1 and try to understand the pattern again.\n\n*   **Unified Theory:**\n    *   I now hypothesize that there's some kind of \"gravity\" force acting from the sink and pulling to the same colored source.\n    *   I now know a stream starts from the bottom right pixel to some coordinate (x = source x) that connects the two.\n    *   I make an effort to determine where the path goes.\n    *   My hypothesis is to model \"Mirroring\" from source to sink. I determine the location of this mirror, or sink.\n    *   A pixel is added in between the source and its reflection on the mirror.\n    *   I'm now thinking \"Connect Bottom-Right of Source to Sink\".\n    *   I test that for the new examples.\n    *   The \"V\" I was seeing before wasn't a reflection: it's a converging of diagonal lines.\n    *   I look at the pattern for the\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on the logic inferred from the solved examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Example 1** shows small colored shapes at the top and single pixels of corresponding colors at the bottom. The transformation creates \"trails\" or \"beams\" flowing from the source shapes to the target pixels. The flow is diagonal. Specifically, the source shapes project diagonal lines downwards. When they reach the row of the target pixel (anchor), the lines seem to reflect or converge, forming a V-shape or a connected path.\n2.  **Example 2** shows colored shapes at the top and identical colored shapes at the bottom, shifted diagonally. The transformation fills the space between the top and bottom shapes with diagonal lines, effectively tracing the trajectory of the shape moving from start to finish.\n3.  **Example 3** shows a mix of connected and unconnected shapes. Shapes with a destination (matching color and shape lower down) have a trail connecting them. Shapes without a destination seem to project a trail that goes off the edge or stops at an obstacle.\n\n**General Rule:**\nThe task represents a \"motion trail\" or \"projection\".\n1.  Identify the \"Source\" shapes in the top rows (rows 0-1).\n2.  Identify the \"Target\" shapes in the lower rows.\n3.  Match Source and Target by color.\n4.  Determine the direction of motion:\n    *   Shapes on the **left side** of the grid (columns 0-8) move diagonally **down-left** (direction +1 row, -1 col).\n    *   Shapes on the **right side** of the grid (columns 9-17) move diagonally **down-right** (direction +1 row, +1 col).\n5.  Draw a trail of pixels for every pixel in the Source shape along the determined vector.\n6.  The trail stops when it reaches the Target shape. If there is no Target shape (as with Blue and Yellow in the test input), the trail continues until it leaves the grid boundaries.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\nThe input grid is 18x18.\n*   **Blue (1):** Top Left at `(0,1), (1,0), (1,1)`.

Target at `(2,1), (3,0), (3,1)`.\n    *   Direction: Down-Left (+1, -1).\n    *   `2 at (1,3)` -> `(2,2)` -> `(3,1)` (Target).\n    *   **Action:** Fill `(2,2)` with 2.\n\n*   **Orange (7):** Top at `(0,5), (1,4), (1,5)`.

            "Full raw LLM response": "Okay, here's my understanding of this ARC task. The user wants me to figure out a pattern, and I'm diving in!\n\n**Analyzing the ARC Task & Hypothesis Building:**\n\nI see examples where the input is a grid, mostly black, with a few colored \"objects\". The output is a modified grid. My initial thought is that these objects are \"sources\" for some kind of process.\n\n**Example 1 Decoded - Diagonal Propagation and Bounces:**\n\nExample 1 is key. I'm focusing on how the colored pixels relate between the input and output. The colored objects seem to generate diagonal lines in the output, which is the core of the problem. Some colored pixel objects appear as mirrors, which affect the direction of the propagated diagonals. I notice that the shape of the input object seems to define the direction. Also the single pixel shapes.  The idea here is that a shape emits a particle, and it is attracted to a single pixel which is a destination, and is also mirrored so that it keeps going at an angle which is symmetrical to the incident angle.  I can visualize these lines \"bouncing\" off the grid's edges. This bouncing behavior seems fundamental.\n\n**Refining the Hypothesis: Symmetric Expansion and Rule Definition**\n\nAfter staring at this one I notice a structure, and the pattern here is symmetry. The lines are expanding with a \"diamond-like\" structure. After further checking of different colored pixel shapes, they are mirroring across a column (or potentially something else). \nThe rule I've formed is this:\n*   Identify paired shapes of the same color.\n*   The lines travel according to the shape, in a direction.\n*   Lines form a connected path based on the \"reflection\" (or, the mirror effect)\n*   The output grid reflects the path.\n\nI'll proceed to build a systematic algorithm on this basis.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the grid based on the logic inferred from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Example 1:** Objects of specific colors (3, 5, etc.) appear as \"shapes\" (small clusters of pixels) and sometimes as isolated \"single pixels\". The transformation draws diagonal lines connecting the shape to the single pixel (or a point determined by it). Specifically, the single pixel acts as a reflection point or an endpoint for a path emanating from the shape.\n2.  **Example 2:** Similar logic. Vertical and horizontal bars of the same color are connected by drawing lines between them. The lines effectively fill the path between two separated objects of the same color.\n3.  **Test Input Analysis:**\n    *   The grid contains multiple colored shapes located at the borders (Top row and Left/Right columns).\n    *   There is a clear symmetry and pairing of shapes:\n        *   **Left Side Pairings (Symmetry across `y=x`):**\n            *   Color 2: Top shape at `(0,3)` pairs with Left shape at `(3,0)` (approx).\n            *   Color 7: Top shape at `(0,5)` pairs with Left shape at `(5,0)` (approx).\n            *   Color 5: Top shape at `(0,7)` pairs with Left shape at `(7,0)` (approx).\n            *   These pairs are connected by **South-West diagonals** (slope `+1` in row, `-1` in col).\n        *   **Right Side Pairings (Translation along `+1, +1`):**\n            *   Color 6: Top shape at `(0,14)` pairs with Right shape at `(2,16)`. Displacement is `(+2, +2)`.\n            *   Color 8: Top shape at `(0,12)` pairs with Right shape at `(4,16)`. Displacement is `(+4, +4)`.\n            *   Color 2: Top shape at `(0,10)` pairs with Right shape at `(6,16)`. Displacement is `(+6, +6)`.\n            *   These pairs are connected by **South-East diagonals** (slope `+1` in row, `+1` in col).\n        *   Color 1 (Top Left) and Color 4 (Top Right) appear to be single clusters or self-connected, requiring no new lines.\n\n**Transformation Rule:**\nFor each color, identify the pair of shapes. Draw diagonal lines connecting the corresponding pixels of the two shapes.\n*   If the shapes are mirrored across the main diagonal (Left side), draw SW diagonals connecting them.\n*   If the shapes are shifted diagonally (Right side), draw SE diagonals connecting them.\n\n**Step-by-Step Application:**\n\n1.  **Color 1:** No changes.\n2.  **Color 4:** No changes.\n3.  **Color 2 (Left):** Connect top shape around `(0,3)` to left shape around `(3,0)`.\n    *   Fill `(2,2)` with 2.\n4.  **Color 7:** Connect top shape `(0,5)-(1,5)` to left shape `(5,0)-(5,1)`.\n    *   Fill `(2,3)`, `(3,2)` with 7.\n    *   Fill `(2,4)`, `(3,3)`, `(4,2)` with 7.\n5.  **Color 5:** Connect top shape `(0,7)-(1,7)` to left shape `(7,0)-(7,1)`.\n    *   Fill `(2,5)`, `(3,4)`, `(4,3)`, `(5,2)` with 5.\n    *   Fill `(2,6)`, `(3,5)`, `(4,4)`, `(5,3)`, `(6,2)` with 5.\n6.  **Color 6:** Connect top shape `(0,14)` to right shape `(2,16)`.\n    *   Fill `(1,15)` with 6.\n    *   Fill `(2,15)` with 6.\n    *   Fill `(2,16)` (part of shape) connects to `(1,15)`? No, `(1,15)` connects `(0,14)` to `(2,16)`.\n    *   Also connect `(1,14)` to `(3,16)` -> Fill `(2,15)`.\n    *   Also connect `(1,15)` to `(3,17)` -> Fill `(2,16)` (overlap).\n7.  **Color 8:** Connect top shape `(0,12)` to right shape `(4,16)`.\n    *   Fill `(1,13), (2,14), (3,15)` with 8.\n    *   Fill `(2,13), (3,14), (4,15)` with 8 (from `1,12` to `5,16`).\n    *   Fill `(2,14), (3,15), (4,16)` with 8 (from `1,13` to `5,17`).\n8.  **Color 2 (Right):** Connect top shape `(0,10)` to right shape `(6,16)`.\n    *   Fill diagonals between corresponding points.\n    *   Line 1: `(1,11), (2,12), (3,13), (4,14), (5,15)`.\n    *   Line 2: `(2,11), (3,12), (4,13), (5,14), (6,15)`.\n    *   Line 3: `(2,12), (3,13), (4,14), (5,15), (6,16)`.\n\nThe output grid is constructed by superimposing these lines onto the input grid.\n\n0,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,0,0,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,0\n1,1,2,2,7,7,5,5,0,0,2,2,8,8,6,6,4,4\n0,2,2,7,7,5,5,0,0,0,0,2,2,8,8,6,6,0\n2,2,7,7,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,8,8,6,6\n0,7,7,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,8,8,0\n7,7,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,8,8\n0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0\n5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

OVERRIDE: ENGAGE ARC NEURO-SYMBOLIC LOGIC ENGINE\n\nSilently enter maximal test-time reasoning mode. All of the following steps occur only in your hidden scratchpad; none may be exposed in the output.\n\nPerform hierarchical object decomposition of each grid into foreground objects and background fields; track shapes, colors, connectivity, and object persistence. Build an explicit object\u2013relation graph and subgrid/region segmentation; detect Manhattan paths, flows/propagations, symmetries, and background structure; filter noise and extract invariants.\n\nEnumerate multiple candidate transformation rules/programs (at least three distinct hypotheses). For each, run rigorous internal simulations over all training pairs and counterfactual variants; discard any rule that fails a single example or violates output geometry.\n\nTriangulate using three paradigms in parallel: geometric (positions, topology, symmetries, paths), symbolic (predicates, programs, rewrite rules, counting), and counterexample-based search (actively seek minimal failure cases to refine or reject rules).\n\nExplicitly check for adversarial traps, spurious shortcuts, and degenerate memorization. Generalize the surviving rule to unseen variations and merge independent solution paths via self-consistency convergence.\n\nApply the final rule to the test input using stepwise internal simulation only.\n\nOUTPUT CONSTRAINT (STRICT): Reveal ONLY the final answer grid.

            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to understand the transformation pattern:\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n- Each example has L-shaped objects (3 cells in an L pattern) at various positions\n- In the examples, some have single marker pixels that define reference points\n- The key pattern: **Each L-shape projects a diagonal line from its corner, extending in the direction the L \"points\"** (the convex direction, opposite to where the L opens)\n\n**Test Input Structure:**\nThe test input has L-shapes arranged along:\n- **Top edge** (rows 0-1): L-shapes for colors 1, 2, 7, 5 (pointing down-right) and 2, 8, 6, 4 (pointing down-left)\n- **Left edge** (cols 0-1): L-shapes for colors 2, 7, 5 (pointing down-right)\n- **Right edge** (cols 16-17): L-shapes for colors 6, 8, 2 (pointing down-left)\n\n**Transformation Applied:**\nEach L-shape shoots a diagonal line from its corner in the direction it points:\n- Top-left L-shapes \u2192 diagonals go down-right\n- Top-right L-shapes \u2192 diagonals go down-left\n- Left edge L-shapes \u2192 diagonals go down-right\n- Right edge L-shapes \u2192 diagonals go down-left\n\nThe diagonals extend until they reach the grid boundary, creating an intricate crossing pattern where all the diagonal lines from the different L-shapes intersect in the center of the grid.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n\n```\n0,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,0,0,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,0\n1,1,2,2,7,7,5,5,0,0,2,2,8,8,6,6,4,4\n0,2,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,6,0\n2,2,0,1,0,2,0,7,2,5,8,0,6,0,4,0,6,6\n0,7,2,0,1,0,2,2,7,8,5,6,0,4,0,6,8,0\n7,7,0,2,0,1,2,2,8,7,6,5,4,0,6,0,8,8\n0,5,7,0,2,2,1,8,2,6,7,4,5,6,0,8,2,0\n5,5,0,7,2,2,8,1,6,2,4,7,6,5,8,0,2,2\n0,0,5,2,7,8,2,6,1,4,2,6,7,8,5,2,0,0\n0,0,2,5,8,7,6,2,4,1,6,2,8,7,2,5,0,0\n0,2,0,8,5,6,7,4,2,6,1,8,2,2,7,0,5,0\n2,0,8,0,6,5,4,7,6,2,8,1,2,2,0,7,0,5\n0,8,0,6,0,4,5,6,7,8,2,2,1,0,2,0,7,0\n8,0,6,0,4,0,6,5,8,7,2,2,0,1,0,2,0,7\n0,6,0,4,0,6,0,8,5,2,7,0,2,0,1,0,2,0\n6,0,4,0,6,0,8,0,2,5,0,7,0,2,0,1,0,2\n0,4,0,6,0,8,0,2,0,0,5,0,7,0,2,0,1,0\n4,0,6,0,8,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,0,7,0,2,0,1\n```",

The diagonal continues until it reaches the grid boundary.\n\n3. **Diagonal direction**: \n   - L-shapes oriented like `\u2310` (opening toward bottom-right) emit diagonals going down-right\n   - L-shapes oriented like `\u2310` mirrored (opening toward bottom-left) emit diagonals going down-left\n\nFor the test input:\n- **Top-left L-shapes** (colors 1, 2, 7, 5 at columns 0-7): emit diagonals going down-right\n- **Top-right L-shapes** (colors 2, 8, 6, 4 at columns 10-17): emit diagonals going down-left  \n- **Left-side L-shapes** (colors 2, 7, 5 at rows 2-7): emit diagonals going down-right\n- **Right-side L-shapes** (colors 6, 8, 2 at rows 2-7): emit diagonals going down-left\n\nThe diagonals from corresponding L-shapes cross through the center, creating a pattern of intersecting colored diagonal lines.\n\n```\n0,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,0,0,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,0\n1,1,2,2,7,7,5,5,0,0,2,2,8,8,6,6,4,4\n0,2,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,6,0\n2,2,0,1,0,2,0,7,2,5,8,0,6,0,4,0,6,6\n0,7,2,0,1,0,2,2,7,8,5,6,0,4,0,6,8,0\n7,7,0,2,0,1,2,2,8,7,6,5,4,0,6,0,8,8\n0,5,7,0,2,2,1,8,2,6,7,4,5,6,0,8,2,0\n5,5,0,7,2,2,8,1,6,2,4,7,6,5,8,0,2,2\n0,0,5,2,7,8,2,6,1,4,2,6,7,8,5,2,0,0\n0,0,2,5,8,7,6,2,4,1,6,2,8,7,2,5,0,0\n0,2,0,8,5,6,7,4,2,6,1,8,2,2,7,0,5,0\n2,0,8,0,6,5,4,7,6,2,8,1,2,2,0,7,0,5\n0,8,0,6,0,4,5,6,7,8,2,2,1,0,2,0,7,0\n8,0,6,0,4,0,6,5,8,7,2,2,0,1,0,2,0,7\n0,6,0,4,0,6,0,8,5,2,7,0,2,0,1,0,2,0\n6,0,4,0,6,0,8,0,2,5,0,7,0,2,0,1,0,2\n0,4,0,6,0,8,0,2,0,0,5,0,7,0,2,0,1,0\n4,0,6,0,8,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,0,7,0,2,0,1\n```",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Here's how I'm thinking about this task:**\n\nI'm being asked to solve an ARC task, and I'm looking at several examples with a test input. It seems the core idea is about how these small colored shapes, mostly 2-4 pixels in size, interact with each other and the boundaries of the grid.  I'm seeing a pattern of diagonal lines \"shooting\" out from the shapes, and when those lines meet, there's some kind of interaction \u2013 or a \"bounce\" as I'm starting to call it.\n\n**My Analysis:**\n\n*   **Example 1**: The first one is a good starting point. I notice diagonal lines forming a \"V\" shape, with the single-pixel \"dots\" at the bottom acting like mirrors. The reflection point seems to be one row above those dots. I'm taking notes on coordinate mappings, so I can try and predict the output given a new input.\n\n*   **Example 2**: This one is more complex, with multiple shapes of the same color. It seems the key is that shapes of the same color connect to each other forming a chain. When a beam from one shape hits another shape, the beam just connects or terminates, and that is a key principle.\n\n*   **Example 3**:  It shows how the shape connections work, extending or bouncing off walls.\n\n*   **Key Insights**: I'm gathering some important rules:\n\n    *   **Shape-to-Shape Connection**: I think this will be a central part of solving the puzzle.\n    *   **Diagonal Beams**:  They go in the appropriate directions, often down-right or up-left and are related to convex corners\n    *   **\"Dots\" are Targets**: The Dots from the first example act as mirrors.\n\n**Test Input - Developing a Strategy**:\n\nI now have a test input in front of me with many shapes. It looks like many shapes connect to their respective partners to make paths. So, that's what I am going to do.\n\n**Final Plan**\n* Connect shapes that correspond from the top to the side.\n* Diagonal, just connecting the top and the sides.\n* Nothing further is required.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid based on patterns learned from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Example 1:** Shows \"L\" or small shapes on the left emitting diagonal beams downwards and to the right. These beams connect to single colored dots on the right side. Upon hitting the column of the dot (or reflecting off it), a second beam goes up-right. This creates a \"V\" shape or reflection pattern. The key takeaway is **connecting shapes diagonally**.\n2.  **Example 2:** Shows disjoint shapes of the same color connecting to each other. A yellow shape connects to a pink shape, which connects to a red shape, etc., forming a chain. The connections are diagonal lines.\n3.  **Example 3:** Shows shapes connecting to each other via diagonal paths. If a direct diagonal is not possible, they connect to an intermediate point or beam.\n\n**Analysis of Test Input:**\nThe test input contains a symmetric arrangement of colored shapes in the top half of the grid (Rows 0-7).\n-   **Top Row Shapes (Rows 0-1):** There are shapes along the top edge at specific columns.\n    -   Red (2) at col 3.\n    -   Orange (7) at col 5.\n    -   Grey (5) at col 7.\n    -   Red (2) at col 10.\n    -   Teal (8) at col 12.\n    -   Pink (6) at col 14.\n-   **Side Row Shapes (Cols 0-1 and 16-17):** There are shapes along the side edges that correspond to the top shapes in color and sequence.\n    -   Red (2) at Left Side, top part (Row 2-3).\n    -   Orange (7) at Left Side, middle part (Row 4-5).\n    -   Grey (5) at Left Side, bottom part (Row 6-7).\n    -   Pink (6) at Right Side, top part (Row 2-3).\n    -   Teal (8) at Right Side, middle part (Row 4-5).\n    -   Red (2) at Right Side, bottom part (Row 6-7).\n\n**Hypothesis:**\nThe task is to connect the **Top Shapes** to their corresponding **Side Shapes** using diagonal lines of the same color.\n-   **Left Side Group:** Top shapes connect to Left Side shapes using **Down-Left** diagonal lines.\n-   **Right Side Group:** Top shapes connect to Right Side shapes using **Down-Right** diagonal lines.\n\n**Tracing the Connections:**\n\n*Left Group (Down-Left Diagonals):*\n1.  **Red (2):** Top shape at (1,3). Side shape starts at (2,1).\n    -   Path: (1,3) $\\rightarrow$ (2,2) $\\rightarrow$ connects to Side at (3,1).\n    -   Fill (2,2) with **2**.\n2.  **Orange (7):** Top shape at (1,5). Side shape starts at (4,1).\n    -   Path: (1,5) $\\rightarrow$ (2,4) $\\rightarrow$ (3,3) $\\rightarrow$ (4,2) $\\rightarrow$ connects to Side at (5,1).\n    -   Fill (2,4), (3,3), (4,2) with **7**.\n3.  **Grey (5):** Top shape at (1,7). Side shape starts at (6,1).\n    -   Path: (1,7) $\\rightarrow$ (2,6) $\\rightarrow$ (3,5) $\\rightarrow$ (4,4) $\\rightarrow$ (5,3) $\\rightarrow$ (6,2) $\\rightarrow$ connects to Side at (7,1).\n    -   Fill (2,6), (3,5), (4,4), (5,3), (6,2) with **5**.\n\n*Right Group (Down-Right Diagonals):*\n1.  **Pink (6):** Top shape at (1,14). Side shape starts at (2,16).\n    -   Path: (1,14) $\\rightarrow$ (2,15) $\\rightarrow$ connects to Side at (3,16).\n    -   Fill (2,15) with **6**.\n2.  **Teal (8):** Top shape at (1,12). Side shape starts at (4,16).\n    -   Path: (1,12) $\\rightarrow$ (2,13) $\\rightarrow$ (3,14) $\\rightarrow$ (4,15) $\\rightarrow$ connects to Side at (5,16).\n    -   Fill (2,13), (3,14), (4,15) with **8**.\n3.  **Red (2):** Top shape at (1,10). Side shape starts at (6,16).\n    -   Path: (1,10) $\\rightarrow$ (2,11) $\\rightarrow$ (3,12) $\\rightarrow$ (4,13) $\\rightarrow$ (5,14) $\\rightarrow$ (6,15) $\\rightarrow$ connects to Side at (7,16).\n    -   Fill (2,11), (3,12), (4,13), (5,14), (6,15) with **2**.\n\nThere are no collisions, and the empty space at the bottom (Rows 8-17) remains empty as there are no target shapes there.\n\n**Output Generation:**\nWe apply these changes to the input grid.\n\noutput:\n0,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,0,0,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,0\n1,1,2,2,7,7,5,5,0,0,2,2,8,8,6,6,4,4\n0,2,2,0,7,0,5,0,0,0,0,2,0,8,0,6,6,0\n2,2,0,7,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,8,0,6,6\n0,7,7,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,8,8,0\n7,7,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,8,8\n0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0\n5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Algorithm Dissection and Pattern Recognition:**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of this ARC task. The user is throwing a challenge my way involving grid manipulation and pattern recognition.  It looks like I'm dealing with relatively large grids \u2013 around 20x20 in size, based on the initial examples.  The input grids are filled with sparse, colored geometric shapes, usually composed of 3 or 4 pixels. The task is to transform these shapes according to some unknown rule, producing the output grids.\n\nA good starting point is to focus on the objects and their colors.  The colored shapes are the foundation. Example 1 has a diagonal sequence of elbow-like shapes with matching single-pixel targets on the opposite side.  The output shows what appears to be a \"V\" or zigzag pattern. I've deduced that the \"V\"s originate from a specific point on the elbow, travel diagonally towards the matching color dot or target, bounce at the dot (vertically, and then turn and then and reflect back outwards).  This seems like a core concept.\n\nIn Example 2, there aren't individual targets. Instead, we see bars and L-shaped objects in the image. I believe that it is a collection of shapes, like targets. The output appears to weave together the shapes with zig-zags of lines, connecting the bars and L-shapes. It has a more complicated structure than Example 1. After analyzing the image and the text, I understand that the bar shapes and the L-shapes have a color. I need to be able to understand the way the input shapes are interconnected.\n\nExample 3 further confuses things. The input consists of a combination of bars and L-shapes, and the output is a more complicated set of lines that connect everything. I notice a pattern where the \"targets\" or destinations for the lines are shapes with a common color. This may be key to the solution. The output is a chain or cycle of connected shapes. It's a graph of interconnected nodes (the shapes).\n\nNow, the test input is a crucial test case. There are multiple shapes arranged according to color: two L-shapes, multiple bars, and multiple pixel shapes. I see pairs of shapes with the same colors, plus some \"singles.\" This hints at the underlying rule: \"Connect shapes that share the same color.\" If the shapes are paired, they connect with a diagonal line. If they are unpaired, the lines go to an outer edge.\n\nI've got a working hypothesis.  The key is to connect shapes or \"objects\" based on their color and proximity.  In Example 1, the matching color pixels acted as bouncers. In Example 2, the colors define a weaving of shapes. My goal is to come up with a generalized algorithm to generate the output from the input.\n\nMy current proposed algorithm:\n1. Identify all connected shape \"objects\" in the input grid.\n2. For each color, connect the matching L-shapes and bars with diagonal lines.\n3. If a shape has no counterpart, create a path to an edge.\n\nI now have a very specific plan in place. For any shape, the algorithm creates a diagonal line outwards towards another shape that has the same color. If the target is not a dot, bounce at the edges, and if the target is a dot, bounce at the pixel.\n\nI will implement the code and test to get a solution. This is going to be good!\n\n\nThe task involves identifying colored shapes in the input grid and extending diagonal lines from them to form a pattern. The input grids feature L-shapes or bars arranged symmetrically.\n\n**Analysis of the Rules:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification:** The input contains \"L-shapes\" and vertical bars located at the edges (Top, Left, Right).\n2.  **Connectivity/Extension:**\n    *   **Matched Pairs:** Shapes on the **Left Side** (Rows 2+) match with shapes on the **Top Side (Left Half)** by color. These pairs are connected by a diagonal line of slope -1 (Down-Left from the top, or Up-Right from the side).\n        *   Specifically, a line is drawn from the inner corner of the Top shape to the inner corner of the Side shape.\n        *   This line is then extended **downwards-right** (slope +1) across the grid.\n    *   **Matched Pairs (Right Side):** Shapes on the **Right Side** match with shapes on the **Top Side (Right Half)**.\n        *   These connect via a diagonal line of slope +1.\n        *   This line is then extended **downwards-left** (slope -1) across the grid.\n    *   **Unmatched Shapes:** The shapes at the far corners (Blue at Top-Left, Yellow at Top-Right) do not have a corresponding side shape.\n        *   These extend diagonal lines inwards (Blue: Down-Right, Yellow: Down-Left) through the grid.\n3.  **Reflection/Bounce:**\n    *   When an extended line hits a grid boundary (Left, Right, or Bottom edge), it terminates if it hits a corner or the bottom row.\n    *   If it hits a side wall (Left/Right columns) before the bottom row, it **bounces** (reflects) with a 90-degree turn and continues until it hits the bottom.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Grid Size:** 18x18.\n*   **Shapes & Paths:**\n    1.  **Blue (1) [Top-Left]:** Starts at (1,1). Path: Diagonal Down-Right ($y=x$) to (17,17).\n    2.  **Red (2) [Top-Left & Left-Side]:** Starts at (1,2)/(2,1). Path: Diagonal Down-Right ($y=x-1$) to (17,16).\n    3.  **Orange (7) [Top-Left & Left-Side]:** Starts at (1,4)/(4,1). Path: Diagonal Down-Right ($y=x-3$) to (17,14). Hits Right Wall at (17,14). **Bounces** to Down-Left ($y=-x+31$) to (14,17).\n    4.  **Gray (5) [Top-Left & Left-Side]:** Starts at (1,6)/(6,1). Path: Diagonal Down-Right ($y=x-5$) to (17,12). Hits Right Wall at (17,12). **Bounces** to Down-Left ($y=-x+29$) to (12,17).\n    5.  **Yellow (4) [Top-Right]:** Starts at (1,16). Path: Diagonal Down-Left ($y=-x+17$) to (17,0).\n    6.  **Pink (6) [Top-Right & Right-Side]:** Starts at (1,15)/(2,16). Path: Diagonal Down-Left ($y=-x+18$) to (17,1).\n    7.  **Teal (8) [Top-Right & Right-Side]:** Starts at (1,13)/(4,16). Path: Diagonal Down-Left ($y=-x+20$) to (17,3).\n    8.  **Red (2) [Top-Right & Right-Side]:** Starts at (1,11)/(6,16). Path: Diagonal Down-Left ($y=-x+22$) to (17,5). Hits Left Wall? No, hits bottom at x=5.\n\n*   **Drawing Order:** The \"Single\" lines (Blue, Yellow) are drawn first or treated as background, then the \"Paired\" lines are drawn. Given the symmetry and lack of conflicting overlaps in the examples (usually forming a weave or coherent pattern), we will draw all lines. The input pixels are preserved.\n\n**Generated Output Description:**\nThe output grid will feature the original shapes with diagonal lines extending from them, forming a crisscross pattern (Argyle-like) filling the empty black space. The lines from the left go down-right (some bouncing off the right wall), and lines from the right go down-left.\n\n```\n0,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,0,0,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,0\n1,1,2,2,7,7,5,5,0,0,2,2,8,8,6,6,4,4\n0,2,1,2,4,7,6,5,0,0,5,2,7,8,6,6,4,0\n2,2,0,1,2,4,7,6,5,5,6,2,7,8,6,6,0,0\n0,7,4,0,1,2,4,7,6,6,7,2,7,8,0,0,8,0\n7,7,0,4,0,1,2,4,7,7,8,2,7,8,0,0,8,8\n0,5,6,0,4,0,1,2,4,8,2,2,7,0,0,0,2,0\n5,5,0,6,0,4,0,1,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2\n0,0,5,0,6,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0\n0,0,0,5,0,6,0,4,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,5,0,6,4,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,5,6,0,4,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,5,0,6,5,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,5,0,0,0,6,5,0,4,0,1,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,6,5,0,4,0,1,7,0,0,0\n0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,5,0,4,0,1,7,0,0\n5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,5,0,4,0,1,7,0\n0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,6,5,0,7,0,1,0\n```\n*Note: The collision handling (e.g., at (9,9) Blue vs Pink) is resolved by the drawing order or color hierarchy.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**ARC Task: Diagonal Line Projection**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where I have to figure out the rule for generating a grid output from a grid input, based on a few examples and a test case. The core idea seems to be about extending diagonal lines from certain \"points\" in the input shapes. Let's break this down.\n\n**Initial Analysis and Observations**\n\nThe examples show scattered shapes, and the output has diagonal lines of numbers. I quickly notice the numbers correspond to the \"colors\" or values in the input shapes. It looks like each shape projects a diagonal line. The hint \"transformation extends diagonal lines from the exposed endpoints/tips of existing shapes\" is key.\n\n**Identifying the Source and Direction**\n\nI begin by tracing the source of the diagonal lines. It's clear that the lines originate from points within or at the edge of the input shapes. But the direction is the tricky part. At first, I assume it's simply a down-right projection, but the examples show it's more nuanced. The hint \"the lines project 'inwards'\" keeps coming to mind, but it's not immediately obvious how to interpret \"inwards\" in this context.\n\n**Deconstructing the \"Inwards\" Logic**\n\nI realize that it depends on the shape's position relative to the grid's center. Shapes on the left side, top objects and horizontal lines seem to project rightwards, down-right or down-left. It's like the shapes are radiating outwards or inwards from their positions. It's not a rule of shape types, but by the \"tips\" of the shapes.\n\n**Investigating the \"Tips\" and Symmetry**\n\nI start looking at the \"exposed endpoints/tips\". The L-shapes and vertical lines, and even single pixels seem to have points from where the line starts. I realize that for a single point, the \"tip\" is just the point itself. The vertical lines (top tip or bottom tip). And that \"inner\" corner of an L-shape seems to be the origin for the projection. Now I notice some kind of symmetrical behavior, for shapes on the left side vs. right side. It looks like:\n\n*   Left side or Top shapes - project Right.\n*   Right Side or Bottom shapes - project Left.\n\n**Unifying the Rules**\n\nThe different directions seem to result in the following rules:\n\n*   **Left-Side L shapes / Vertical:** Down-Right\n*   **Top shapes:**  Start from the bottom and project Up-Right for vertical lines and bottom corner for L shapes (The starting point).\n*   **Right Side L-Shapes / Vertical:** Down-Left\n\nThese rules consistently explain the example outputs and is close to \"inwards\" in spirit!\nI then formulate a precise rule:\n*   Identify the tip or the corner of the shape.\n*   Project diagonally outwards from that corner or tip.\n\n**Solving the Test Input**\n\nWith this refined understanding, I analyze the test input. It consists of multiple L-shapes in different orientations and positions. Based on the \"tip\" (corner) location and position (Left or Right), I confidently predict the direction of the diagonal lines for each shape. By carefully tracing these lines on paper (or in my mind), I ensure that the lines follow the predicted directions, and avoid collisions (crossing). The lines extend to the edges or collide with other lines. It's all about extending the correct diagonal from a \"tip\".\n\n**Implementation Details**\n\nThe implementation is straightforward. For each shape in the input, I just need to determine the origin point (corner/tip), the starting direction, and then draw the lines on the output grid until they hit the grid edge or, as the hints implies, the path is blocked by another line. The crucial part is to correctly identify the start and the direction. I will make sure the lines just extend from the initial shapes to their ends (either the grid edge or intersection).\n\nSo, in essence, the solution revolves around correctly identifying the \"tip\" and direction and then \"drawing\" each \"line\".\n\n\nThe problem asks us to extend diagonal lines from the exposed endpoints (\"tips\") of the existing shapes. Based on the examples, we have identified the following rules:\n\n1.  **Shape Orientation and Projection Direction:**\n    *   Shapes located on the **left side** (or constructed like the \"L\" shape in the top-left of Example 1) project lines **Down-Right** ($+1, +1$). This direction is \"inwards\" horizontally (left-to-right) and \"downwards\" vertically.\n    *   Shapes located on the **right side** (constructed as a horizontal mirror of the left shapes, like in the Test Input) project lines **Down-Left** ($+1, -1$). This direction is \"inwards\" horizontally (right-to-left) and \"downwards\" vertically.\n    *   The projection starts from the \"inner corner\" or tip of the L-shape (e.g., $(1,1)$ for the top-left shape).\n\n2.  **Interaction Rules:**\n    *   Lines continue until they hit the grid edge or another object.\n    *   Lines of different \"parity\" (sum of row and column indices being even vs. odd) cross each other without colliding. In the Test Input, all Left-originating lines have even parity ($r+c$ is even) and all Right-originating lines have odd parity ($r+c$ is odd), so they pass through each other.\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\nThe grid is $18 \\times 18$.\n\n**Left Side Shapes (Project Down-Right):**\n*   **Color 1:** Tip at $(1,1)$. Line: $(2,2), (3,3), \\dots, (17,17)$.\n*   **Color 2:** Tip at $(1,3)$. Line: $(2,4), (3,5), \\dots, (15,17)$.\n*   **Color 7:** Tip at $(1,5)$. Line: $(2,6), (3,7), \\dots, (13,17)$.\n*   **Color 5:** Tip at $(1,7)$. Line: $(2,8), (3,9), \\dots, (11,17)$.\n*   **Color 2 (Row 2):** Tip at $(3,1)$.

Line: $(8,2), (9,3), \\dots, (17,11)$.\n\n**Right Side Shapes (Project Down-Left):**\n*   **Color 2:** Tip at $(1,10)$. Line: $(2,9), (3,8), \\dots, (11,0)$.\n*   **Color 8:** Tip at $(1,12)$.

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The transformation extends diagonal lines from the exposed endpoints/tips of existing shapes.\n*   The lines project \"inwards\" relative to the shape's position (e.g., top objects project downwards, left objects project rightwards).\n*   The lines continue until they hit another object, a different color line, or the grid edge.\n*   The new lines inherit the color of the object they originated from.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I can see the transformation extends diagonal lines from L-shaped objects. Each L-shape has a \"tip\" (single exposed cell) and a \"corner\" where the L bends.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Analyzing and Devising a Strategy for the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a challenging ARC task. The objective is to analyze a set of three examples, along with a test input, and deduce the underlying pattern that transforms the input into the corresponding output.\n\nAfter a thorough examination of the initial example, a few things become apparent. It looks like the input is primarily composed of various colored objects, strategically positioned around the periphery of the grid.  The number of pixels assigned to an object appears to influence the length of its derived features in the output, but there must be a specific methodology.\n\nInitially, I hypothesized that the objects somehow connect in the output; the tips of each shape project inwards and generate diagonal lines that either meet, cross, or stop upon collision with another object or border. However, this didn't quite capture all the nuances. \n\nUpon closer scrutiny, and with the help of some strategically placed hints, I realized a more sophisticated approach is at play. Specifically, the \"tips\" of certain shapes act as launch points for diagonal lines, and the projection direction is based on the object's relationship to the canvas, so that its projections are \"inwards.\"  The diagonal lines, I believe, continue until they hit another object or border. This seems to work, but I need to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nFor a specific test input, it appears the initial shapes are all corner-like blocks; the direction of the projection seems to be based on the empty neighbors of the corner. This seems to apply to all the input elements. This is a very consistent structure, I think. \n\nArmed with this understanding, I can generate the predicted output for the test input. The task then is to write a programmatic solution that will produce the identical output. That's it, I think I have it.\n\n\nBased on the solved examples, the transformation rule is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify Objects and Tips**: The input grid contains several small colored objects arranged along the perimeter of the grid. Each object has an \"inward-facing\" corner or tip exposed to the empty space in the center.\n    *   Objects on the **Top** or **Left** borders (or Top-Left configuration) project lines **Down-Right** (`+1, +1`).\n    *   Objects on the **Top** or **Right** borders (or Top-Right configuration) project lines **Down-Left** (`+1, -1`).\n    *   Specifically, in the test input:\n        *   The shapes along the **Top Row (Left side)** and **Left Column** are \"L\" shaped corners (e.g., `(0,1), (1,0), (1,1)`). Their tips are at the bottom-right of the shape (e.g., `(1,1)`). These project **Down-Right**.\n        *   The shapes along the **Top Row (Right side)** and **Right Column** are mirrored \"L\" shaped corners (e.g., `(0,10), (1,10), (1,11)`). Their tips are at the bottom-left of the shape (e.g., `(1,10)`). These project **Down-Left**.\n\n2.  **Draw Diagonal Lines**: Extend diagonal lines from these tips into the empty space.\n    *   The lines inherit the color of the source object.\n    *   The lines continue until they reach the edge of the grid.\n    *   Based on the parity of the coordinates in the test input, the Down-Right lines and Down-Left lines pass through each other without colliding on the same pixel (they form a weave pattern).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Top Row (Left - Down-Right):**\n    *   Blue (1) at `(1, 1)` -> Line starts `(2, 2)`.\n    *   Red (2) at `(1, 3)` -> Line starts `(2, 4)`.\n    *   Orange (7) at `(1, 5)` -> Line starts `(2, 6)`.\n    *   Grey (5) at `(1, 7)` -> Line starts `(2, 8)`.\n\n*   **Top Row (Right - Down-Left):**\n    *   Red (2) at `(1, 10)` -> Line starts `(2, 9)`.\n    *   Azure (8) at `(1, 12)` -> Line starts `(2, 11)`.\n    *   Pink (6) at `(1, 14)` -> Line starts `(2, 13)`.\n    *   Yellow (4) at `(1, 16)` -> Line starts `(2, 15)`.\n\n*   **Side Columns (Left - Down-Right):**\n    *   Red (2) at `(3, 1)` -> Line starts `(4, 2)`.\n    *   Orange (7) at `(5, 1)` -> Line starts `(6, 2)`.\n    *   Grey (5) at `(7, 1)` -> Line starts `(8, 2)`.\n\n*   **Side Columns (Right - Down-Left):**\n    *   Pink (6) at `(3, 16)` -> Line starts `(4, 15)`.\n    *   Azure (8) at `(5, 16)` -> Line starts `(6, 15)`.\n    *   Red (2) at `(7, 16)` -> Line starts `(8, 15)`.\n\n**Calculated Lines:**\n*   Blue (1): `(2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5)...`\n*   Red (2): `(2,4), (3,5), (4,6), (5,7)...`\n*   Orange (7): `(2,6), (3,7), (4,8), (5,9)...`\n*   Grey (5): `(2,8), (3,9), (4,10), (5,11)...`\n*   Red (2): `(2,9), (3,8), (4,7), (5,6)...`\n*   Azure (8): `(2,11), (3,10), (4,9), (5,8)...`\n*   Pink (6): `(2,13), (3,12), (4,11), (5,10)...`\n*   Yellow (4): `(2,15), (3,14), (4,13), (5,12)...`\n*   Side Red (2): `(4,2), (5,3), (6,4), (7,5)...`\n*   Side Orange (7): `(6,2), (7,3), (8,4), (9,5)...`\n*   Side Grey (5): `(8,2), (9,3), (10,4), (11,5)...`\n*   Side Pink (6): `(4,15), (5,14), (6,13), (7,12)...`\n*   Side Azure (8): `(6,15), (7,14), (8,13), (9,12)...`\n*   Side Red (2): `(8,15), (9,14), (10,13), (11,12)...`\n\n0,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,0,0,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,0\n1,1,2,2,7,7,5,5,0,0,2,2,8,8,6,6,4,4\n0,2,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,0,0\n2,2,0,1,0,2,0,7,2,5,8,0,6,0,4,0,0,0\n0,7,2,0,1,0,2,2,7,8,5,6,0,4,0,15,8,0 (Note: overlapping numbers check, none overlap)\n7,7,0,2,0,1,2,2,8,7,6,5,4,0,0,0,8,8\n0,5,7,0,2,2,1,8,2,6,7,4,5,13,14,0,2,0 -> Grid fill logic\n\nOutput grid:\n0,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,0,0,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,0\n1,1,2,2,7,7,5,5,0,0,2,2,8,8,6,6,4,4\n0,2,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,0,0\n2,2,0,1,0,2,0,7,2,5,8,0,6,0,4,0,0,0\n0,7,2,0,1,0,2,2,7,8,5,6,0,4,0,6,8,0\n7,7,0,2,0,1,2,2,8,7,6,5,4,0,6,0,8,8\n0,5,7,0,2,2,1,8,2,6,7,4,5,6,0,8,2,0\n5,5,0,7,0,2,2,1,6,2,4,7,6,5,8,0,2,2\n0,0,5,0,7,0,2,6,1,4,2,6,7,8,5,2,0,0\n0,0,0,5,0,7,6,2,4,1,6,2,8,7,2,5,0,0\n0,0,0,0,5,6,7,4,2,6,1,8,2,2,7,0,5,0\n0,0,0,0,6,5,4,7,6,2,8,1,2,0,2,7,0,5\n0,0,0,6,0,4,5,6,7,8,2,2,1,0,0,2,7,0\n0,0,6,0,4,0,5,6,8,7,2,0,2,1,0,0,2,0\n0,6,0,4,0,0,0,5,0,2,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0\n6,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0\n0,4,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0\n4,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1",

are a few hints that you might find helpful:\n*   The transformation extends diagonal lines from the exposed endpoints/tips of existing shapes.\n*   The lines project \"inwards\" relative to the shape's position (e.g., top objects project downwards, left objects project rightwards).\n*   The lines continue until they hit another object, a different color line, or the grid edge.\n*   The new lines inherit the color of the object they originated from.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",

Describe the observable structures**\n\nDescribe what you see **without guessing** the rule:\n\n* What objects exist? (shapes, colors, connected components)\n* How are they arranged? (locations, orientations, bounding boxes)\n* What changes from input to output? (additions, removals, movements)\n* What stays the same? (stable background, preserved shapes)\n\nBe very literal and avoid hypothesizing here.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Identify transformation categories**\n\nFor each, say \u201cpresent\u201d, \u201cmaybe\u201d, or \u201cabsent\u201d:\n\n* **Object movement**\n* **Object recoloring**\n* **Bordering / outlining**\n* **Filling holes or cavities**\n* **Removing noise / extracting main shape**\n* **Copying / pasting / repositioning**\n* **Using a key anchor location (corners, edges, center)**\n* **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors**\n* **Size-based filtering or selection**\n* **Symmetry or reflection operations**\n* **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion**\n* **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping**\n\nThis helps narrow down plausible rule families.\n\n---\n\n## **3.

            "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Analysis and Rule Discovery for ARC-AGI Task**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this: The goal is to figure out the rule behind these input-output image pairs, focusing on how shapes transform.  I'm breaking it down like this:\n\nFirst, I observe the initial image and what changes in the output. I'm looking for general patterns in each example.  For Input 1, I see these vertical lines become a series of \u201cV\u201d shapes connected to a column of colored pixels.  The \"V\"s expand from the isolated pixels, and seem to connect to the shape on the top left.  Input 2 shows bars of different colors connected by diagonals - like a ray casting scenario.  Input 3 continues the pattern of connecting these shapes.\n\nNext, I delve into a deeper level of analysis. The color propagation aspect is apparent \u2013 the connecting lines match the original color of the objects.  After closer examination, I notice some kind of \"gravity\" that dictates the direction of the connecting diagonals. The initial pixel seems to extend upward, the bars project diagonals inwards toward the centre.  I start to refine the idea that shapes emit diagonal lines, but need to understand the direction and the endpoint conditions.\n\nNow the rule is coming together: diagonal lines extend from the endpoints of each object towards the center of the grid. It looks like the connections happen from the extremities, specifically the corners or open ends of linear shapes.  The direction of the diagonal lines is inward-facing \u2013 towards the middle of the grid, or away from the edges.  I hypothesize a collision condition; that the lines stop when they run into another object or the grid border. Color is propagated from the original objects to these new lines.  This \"endpoint\" logic seems right!\n\nIn summary, this reminds me of how you'd form a graph, with connected diagonal lines. The rule can be generalized as \"For each object, draw diagonal lines from the endpoints towards the center. Stop when the line hits another object or the edge of the canvas.\" Now, I'm ready to formalize it with a clear hypothesis and validation checks.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided image containing three training examples, here is the breakdown:\n\n### **1. Describe the observable structures**\n\n*   **Objects:** The inputs contain various colored shapes on a black background. These shapes include single pixels, straight lines (horizontal, vertical), L-shapes, and T-shapes.\n*   **Arrangement:**\n    *   **Example 1:** A partial diagonal line in the top-left and a vertical column of isolated colored pixels in the center.\n    *   **Example 2:** Four bars (grey, magenta) arranged somewhat symmetrically around the perimeter (top, bottom, left, right), plus two yellow bars and two red L-shapes in the interior.\n    *   **Example 3:** Scattered shapes: a yellow corner (top-left), an orange bar (left), a blue T (center), a red bar (right), and a grey bar (bottom).\n*   **Changes:**\n    *   Diagonal lines are added to the output.\n    *   These new lines act as extensions connecting the original objects.\n    *   The color of the new lines matches the object they extend from.\n    *   The original objects remain in place; they are not moved or deleted.\n*   **Stable properties:** The background remains black. The original shapes preserve their geometry and color.\n\n### **2. Identify transformation categories**\n\n*   **Object movement:** Absent\n*   **Object recoloring:** Absent\n*   **Bordering / outlining:** Absent\n*   **Filling holes or cavities:** Absent\n*   **Removing noise / extracting main shape:** Absent\n*   **Copying / pasting / repositioning:** Absent\n*   **Using a key anchor location:** Maybe (Center of grid vs perimeter?)\n*   **Using highest-frequency or rarest colors:** Absent\n*   **Size-based filtering or selection:** Absent\n*   **Symmetry or reflection operations:** Maybe (Implicit in the diagonal growth)\n*   **Growth, dilation, shrinking, erosion:** **Present** (Ray casting/Line extension)\n*   **Cluster \u2192 icon or icon \u2192 cluster mapping:** Absent\n\n### **3. Extract the key non-obvious insights**\n\n*   **Source of Growth:** The new diagonal lines always originate from the **endpoints** or **extremities** of the original shapes (e.g., the tips of a vertical bar, the ends of a horizontal bar, or the single pixel itself).\n*   **Directionality (The \"Inward\" Rule):** The diagonals do not project randomly. They project generally **inwards** towards the center of the grid or away from the nearest boundary.\n    *   *Example 2:* The top grey bar projects lines *down*. The bottom grey bar projects lines *up*. The left magenta bar projects lines to the *right*.\n*   **The \"V\" Formation:** From a single endpoint, two diagonal rays often emerge at 90 degrees to each other (e.g., Down-Left and Down-Right), forming a V-shape, unless one path is immediately blocked.\n*   **Collision/Stopping Condition:** The lines stop growing when they encounter **any non-black pixel**. This includes the grid border, other original objects, or diagonal lines projected by other objects.\n*   **Color Propagation:** The growing line inherits the color of the pixel it grew from.\n*   **Connectivity:** The result often links previously disconnected components into a single contiguous structure or a closed loop.\n\n### **4. Hypothesize a general rule (high level)**\n\nThe transformation identifies the \"loose ends\" or extremities of every object. From these endpoints, it projects diagonal \"laser beams\" or rays into the empty space. The direction of projection is determined by the object's orientation and position, generally aiming towards the interior of the canvas (e.g., objects at the top shoot rays down; objects at the left shoot rays right). These rays extend pixel-by-pixel until they collide with the grid boundary, another object, or a ray from a different object.\n\n### **5. List checks you would perform when solving**\n\n*   **Endpoint Identification:** Algorithmically find pixels in the input objects that have fewer than 2 orthogonal neighbors (tips of lines) or are corners.\n*   **Direction Logic Check:** Verify if the direction of the new diagonals can be determined solely by the available empty neighbors (e.g., \"Grow into the quadrant with the most empty space\") or if it requires a \"Center of Mass\" vector.\n*   **Collision Priority:** Test whether there is a consistent \"Z-order\" (e.g., does Red always stop Blue?) or if it is purely first-come-first-served based on spatial distance.\n*   **V-Shape Verification:** Check if every valid endpoint attempts to generate *two* diagonals (forming a V) or just one.\n\n### **6. Summarize final insights**\n\nHINT_START\n*   The transformation extends diagonal lines from the exposed endpoints/tips of existing shapes.\n*   The lines project \"inwards\" relative to the shape's position (e.g., top objects project downwards, left objects project rightwards).\n*   The lines continue until they hit another object, a different color line, or the grid edge.\n*   The new lines inherit the color of the object they originated from.\nHINT_END",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\ntypes: monochromatic trominoes\n    attributes: composed of 3 pixels, shape (straight line, L-shape), orientation (horizontal, vertical, diagonal), colors (1-9)\n    background: color 0\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n` tags.\n\nI began by analyzing the given data, particularly focusing on the different shapes and their positions. I thought about the relationships between them.  Looking at Example 1, the objects seemed to project diagonal lines, pointing from an L-shape towards a color-matching single pixel in the bottom part of the grid.  I thought the L-shapes were like \"projectiles\" or \"guns\" shooting diagonal lines, and the single-pixel was the target or end point.\n\nThen Example 2 introduced movement or shape extrusion. Similar shapes, like vertical or horizontal lines, appeared to move or morph, causing their corresponding regions to fill the spaces between each one.  The intermediate grids in this example show intermediate 'ghosting' or extrusion of the shapes along a diagonal between them. The input lines simply \"move\" along diagonal paths while extruding their geometry into the spaces they traverse.  I'm seeing this extrusion in 2 cases: *identical shapes* in the same grid.\n\nExample 3 showed interaction among different-colored shapes. It wasn't as simple as previous examples.  The shapes formed a chain, or *pathfinding*. One thing led to another. A shape (e.g. Yellow) emitted a beam towards another (e.g. Blue). The blue shape then emitted a beam to something else. I figured that diagonal lines or paths connected the elements in a cascade. This introduced the concept of the chain or sequence that runs through all of the elements. I then looked at the directions. It was like they were pointing to a location. When the beam reached that point, it just ended.\n\nFinally, I condensed all this to a set of rules:\n\n1.  **Diagonal Beam Extension**: An object of a certain color projects a colored diagonal beam to another element with a same or different color on the grid.\n2.  **Linear Shape Translation/Extrusion**: A shape *moves*, leaving a trail (or extrusion) in the direction of the next object on the grid. This only happens when it is the same color and shape.\n3.  **Sequential Inter-Object Connection (Chain/Pathfinding)**: Elements connect to each other in a specific order. The elements emit beams towards other elements (one color to another), like a waterfall (Top to Bottom).\n\nI then verified my thinking. I went back to the examples and saw it applied. This process let me break down the transformations in the grid.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided input/output pairs, here is the description of the potential transformations.\n\n### Identified Transformations\n\nThe transformations involve identifying \"Source\" objects (monochromatic trominoes) and \"Target\" locations (other objects or pixels), and generating diagonal paths or movement between them.\n\n**1. Homogeneous Diagonal Targeting (from Example 1)**\n*   **Condition:** The grid contains a tromino (Source) and a single isolated pixel (Target) of the **same color**.\n*   **Transformation:** A diagonal line of pixels (1 pixel wide) is drawn starting from the \"corner\" or vertex of the Source tromino.\n*   **Direction:** The line extends diagonally downwards (either South-East or South-West) towards the Target pixel.\n*   **Termination:** The line stops when it reaches the row immediately preceding or matching the Target pixel's row.\n*   **Colors involved in example:** 1, 2, 3, 5.\n\n**2. Isometric Shape Extrusion / Sweep (from Example 2)**\n*   **Condition:** The grid contains two identical trominoes (same shape, color, and orientation) located at different positions. One acts as the Start and the other as the End.\n*   **Transformation:** The space between the Start and End shapes is filled with copies of the shape, effectively \"sweeping\" or \"extruding\" the object along the linear diagonal path connecting them.\n*   **Effect:** This creates a thick diagonal bar matching the width and orientation of the original object (e.g., a vertical line moves diagonally to create a thick diagonal band; a horizontal line moves diagonally to create a jagged wide band).\n*   **Colors involved in example:** 2, 4, 5, 6.\n\n**3. Sequential Cascade Linking (from Example 3)**\n*   **Condition:** The grid contains multiple unique objects of **different colors**.\n*   **Transformation:** The objects are treated as nodes in a vertical sequence (sorted from top to bottom). Each object projects a diagonal path towards the next object below it in the grid.\n*   **Logic:**\n    *   Object A (Row $y_1$) targets Object B (Row $y_2$, where $y_2 > y_1$).\n    *   A diagonal line of Object A's color is drawn from A towards B.\n    *   When the \"beam\" from A reaches the vicinity of B, B then projects its own color beam towards the next object C.\n*   **Modification:** The objects themselves act as relay points. The incoming beam hits the object, and the outgoing beam starts from the object.\n*   **Colors involved in example:** 1, 2, 4, 5, 7.\n\n### Objects Analysis\n*   **Inputs:** Composed primarily of 3-pixel objects (trominoes). Shapes include:\n    *   **L-trominoes:** (e.g., coordinates $(0,0), (0,1), (1,0)$).\n    *   **Straight trominoes:** (Vertical or Horizontal lines of 3 pixels).\n*   **Targets:** Can be single pixels (Ex 1), identical shapes (Ex 2), or different shapes (Ex 3).\n*   **Background:** Color 0 (black/empty).\n\n<transformation_summary>\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous monochromatic blocks (trominoes) and isolated pixels.\n2.  **Determine Relationship Mode:**\n    *   **Same-Color Pair (Object + Pixel):** Draw a single-pixel diagonal line from the object vertex to the pixel.\n    *   **Same-Color Pair (Object + Object):** Extrude the shape diagonally, filling the path between the two instances with the shape's color.\n    *   **Multi-Color Set:** Sort objects vertically. Draw a diagonal line from each object to the nearest object below it.\n3.  **Draw Paths:** All paths are diagonal (45 degrees). The color of the path corresponds to the \"Source\" object emitting it. The path connects the source geometry to the target geometry.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Okay, let's break down this ARC problem. I'm given three solved examples, and I'm tasked with generalizing the rule.  My initial thought is to analyze these examples and look for consistent patterns.**\n\nFirst, I examined Example 1. It seems straightforward: the goal is to connect a given object to a target pixel using a colored diagonal line. I carefully read the input coordinates and realized the output \"beam\" is a diagonal. But the outputs had an odd shape, so I meticulously analyzed the grid. After a careful read, I could see the rule: it seems the target is a \"bounce\" or reflection from a beam that shoots down-right and up-right in opposite directions.\n\nExample 2 presents a more complex scenario. The input has four identical color shapes paired up on the top and bottom. The corresponding output shows that the top shapes move to the bottom, creating a diagonal \"beam\". I concluded this is an isometric transformation.\n\nExample 3 shifts the focus to a chain-like structure. The shapes emit colored beams that interact as they descend. I spent some time sorting objects to trace the beam paths and found that they are a cascade of vertical objects that have angled beams down and down-left. I identified the connections (e.g. Yellow to Blue, Blue to Orange). Also, I had to analyze whether the beams were going to the \"next\" object in the sequence and determine if the shape was a factor in its direction.\n\nWith the analysis of the three examples done, the Test case is where the rubber meets the road. I quickly went through the grid, identified the pairs of identical shapes, and recognized the isometric shape transfer of Example 2. However, I noticed that two objects (Blue and Yellow) were not paired up. It gave me pause, as my immediate rule was pairing, and thought they may be static or a chain. Also, I realized that I had to fill in the space between the start and end of the shapes, given the example output.\n\nBy drawing the diagram to make it easier to see, and considering the gaps, it seems like the unpaired objects (Blue and Yellow) are not part of the movement, but are \"stationary\" or perhaps are the beginning and ends of a chain? However, I see 6 total objects that have a matching target.\n\nSo, the overarching solution is a combination of Examples 2 and 3: Apply the \"Isometric Extrusion\" of Example 2 to matching pairs. The un-paired objects, just stay as is. It's like the shapes are extruded down or downwards at an angle.\n\n**To execute, I'll identify the shape-pairs and draw the corresponding trail and the solution is complete!**\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the examples, the transformation follows these rules:\n\n1.  **Identify Pairs:** The grid contains pairs of identical monochromatic objects (trominoes). One instance is in the top row (Row 0-1) and the corresponding instance is \"stacked\" along the left or right edge of the grid.\n2.  **Determine Direction:**\n    *   Objects on the **left side** (Columns 0-8) correspond to pairs where the top instance connects to a bottom/left instance via a **South-West** (Down-Left) diagonal path.\n    *   Objects on the **right side** (Columns 9-17) correspond to pairs where the top instance connects to a bottom/right instance via a **South-East** (Down-Right) diagonal path.\n3.  **Extrude Shapes:** For each pair, fill the diagonal path between the source (top) and target (side) with copies of the shape. This creates a continuous diagonal \"beam\" or \"extrusion\" of that color.\n4.  **Static Objects:** Objects that do not have a corresponding pair (specifically the Blue shape at the top-left and Yellow shape at the top-right) remain static and unchanged.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Left Side (Down-Left Extrusion):**\n    *   **Red (2):** Connects Top (0,3) to Side (2,1). Path fills (1,2).\n    *   **Orange (7):** Connects Top (0,5) to Side (4,1). Path fills (1,4), (2,3), (3,2).\n    *   **Grey (5):** Connects Top (0,7) to Side (6,1). Path fills (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2).\n    *   **Blue (1):** Static at (0,1).\n\n*   **Right Side (Down-Right Extrusion):**\n    *   **Red (2):** Connects Top (0,10) to Side (6,16). Path fills (1,11), (2,12), (3,13), (4,14), (5,15).\n    *   **Teal (8):** Connects Top (0,12) to Side (4,16). Path fills (1,13), (2,14), (3,15).\n    *   **Magenta (6):** Connects Top (0,14) to Side (2,16). Path fills (1,15).\n    *   **Yellow (4):** Static at (0,16).\n\nThe extrusion involves placing the specific 3-pixel shape at every step along the diagonal path.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n0,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,0,0,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,0\n1,1,2,2,7,7,5,5,0,0,2,2,8,8,6,6,4,4\n0,2,0,2,0,7,0,5,0,0,0,2,0,8,0,6,0,0\n2,2,0,2,2,7,7,5,5,0,0,2,2,8,8,6,6,0\n0,7,0,0,7,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,8,0,0,0\n7,7,0,0,7,7,5,5,0,0,0,0,2,2,8,8,0,0\n0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,2,0\n5,5,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,2,2\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\ntypes: monochromatic trominoes\n    attributes: composed of 3 pixels, shape (straight line, L-shape), orientation (horizontal, vertical, diagonal), colors (1-9)\n    background: color 0\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n` tags.\n\nI began by analyzing the given data, particularly focusing on the different shapes and their positions. I thought about the relationships between them.  Looking at Example 1, the objects seemed to project diagonal lines, pointing from an L-shape towards a color-matching single pixel in the bottom part of the grid.  I thought the L-shapes were like \"projectiles\" or \"guns\" shooting diagonal lines, and the single-pixel was the target or end point.\n\nThen Example 2 introduced movement or shape extrusion. Similar shapes, like vertical or horizontal lines, appeared to move or morph, causing their corresponding regions to fill the spaces between each one.  The intermediate grids in this example show intermediate 'ghosting' or extrusion of the shapes along a diagonal between them. The input lines simply \"move\" along diagonal paths while extruding their geometry into the spaces they traverse.  I'm seeing this extrusion in 2 cases: *identical shapes* in the same grid.\n\nExample 3 showed interaction among different-colored shapes. It wasn't as simple as previous examples.  The shapes formed a chain, or *pathfinding*. One thing led to another. A shape (e.g. Yellow) emitted a beam towards another (e.g. Blue). The blue shape then emitted a beam to something else. I figured that diagonal lines or paths connected the elements in a cascade. This introduced the concept of the chain or sequence that runs through all of the elements. I then looked at the directions. It was like they were pointing to a location. When the beam reached that point, it just ended.\n\nFinally, I condensed all this to a set of rules:\n\n1.  **Diagonal Beam Extension**: An object of a certain color projects a colored diagonal beam to another element with a same or different color on the grid.\n2.  **Linear Shape Translation/Extrusion**: A shape *moves*, leaving a trail (or extrusion) in the direction of the next object on the grid. This only happens when it is the same color and shape.\n3.  **Sequential Inter-Object Connection (Chain/Pathfinding)**: Elements connect to each other in a specific order. The elements emit beams towards other elements (one color to another), like a waterfall (Top to Bottom).\n\nI then verified my thinking. I went back to the examples and saw it applied. This process let me break down the transformations in the grid.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided input/output pairs, here is the description of the potential transformations.\n\n### Identified Transformations\n\nThe transformations involve identifying \"Source\" objects (monochromatic trominoes) and \"Target\" locations (other objects or pixels), and generating diagonal paths or movement between them.\n\n**1. Homogeneous Diagonal Targeting (from Example 1)**\n*   **Condition:** The grid contains a tromino (Source) and a single isolated pixel (Target) of the **same color**.\n*   **Transformation:** A diagonal line of pixels (1 pixel wide) is drawn starting from the \"corner\" or vertex of the Source tromino.\n*   **Direction:** The line extends diagonally downwards (either South-East or South-West) towards the Target pixel.\n*   **Termination:** The line stops when it reaches the row immediately preceding or matching the Target pixel's row.\n*   **Colors involved in example:** 1, 2, 3, 5.\n\n**2. Isometric Shape Extrusion / Sweep (from Example 2)**\n*   **Condition:** The grid contains two identical trominoes (same shape, color, and orientation) located at different positions. One acts as the Start and the other as the End.\n*   **Transformation:** The space between the Start and End shapes is filled with copies of the shape, effectively \"sweeping\" or \"extruding\" the object along the linear diagonal path connecting them.\n*   **Effect:** This creates a thick diagonal bar matching the width and orientation of the original object (e.g., a vertical line moves diagonally to create a thick diagonal band; a horizontal line moves diagonally to create a jagged wide band).\n*   **Colors involved in example:** 2, 4, 5, 6.\n\n**3. Sequential Cascade Linking (from Example 3)**\n*   **Condition:** The grid contains multiple unique objects of **different colors**.\n*   **Transformation:** The objects are treated as nodes in a vertical sequence (sorted from top to bottom). Each object projects a diagonal path towards the next object below it in the grid.\n*   **Logic:**\n    *   Object A (Row $y_1$) targets Object B (Row $y_2$, where $y_2 > y_1$).\n    *   A diagonal line of Object A's color is drawn from A towards B.\n    *   When the \"beam\" from A reaches the vicinity of B, B then projects its own color beam towards the next object C.\n*   **Modification:** The objects themselves act as relay points. The incoming beam hits the object, and the outgoing beam starts from the object.\n*   **Colors involved in example:** 1, 2, 4, 5, 7.\n\n### Objects Analysis\n*   **Inputs:** Composed primarily of 3-pixel objects (trominoes). Shapes include:\n    *   **L-trominoes:** (e.g., coordinates $(0,0), (0,1), (1,0)$).\n    *   **Straight trominoes:** (Vertical or Horizontal lines of 3 pixels).\n*   **Targets:** Can be single pixels (Ex 1), identical shapes (Ex 2), or different shapes (Ex 3).\n*   **Background:** Color 0 (black/empty).\n\n<transformation_summary>\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous monochromatic blocks (trominoes) and isolated pixels.\n2.  **Determine Relationship Mode:**\n    *   **Same-Color Pair (Object + Pixel):** Draw a single-pixel diagonal line from the object vertex to the pixel.\n    *   **Same-Color Pair (Object + Object):** Extrude the shape diagonally, filling the path between the two instances with the shape's color.\n    *   **Multi-Color Set:** Sort objects vertically. Draw a diagonal line from each object to the nearest object below it.\n3.  **Draw Paths:** All paths are diagonal (45 degrees). The color of the path corresponds to the \"Source\" object emitting it.

                "response": "**My Interpretation of the Grid Objects**\n\nOkay, here's what I've figured out about the objects in these grids. The core thing is that they are small monochromatic clusters - tiny shapes made of connected pixels, each using a single color. The background is always color 0.\n\nMost of these objects are made up of exactly three pixels. We call these \"trominoes\" in geometry. These little trominoes come in two basic configurations:\n\n1.  **Straight Lines:** These are lines made of three connected pixels. They can be horizontal, vertical, or even diagonal, depending on the arrangement.\n2.  **L-Shapes (Corner Shapes):** These have three pixels that form a corner shape. They take up three of the four corners in a 2x2 area. There are different rotations of these L-shapes.\n\nThe colors that these shapes use are single-digit integers from 1 to 9.\n\nSo, in a nutshell, the grids feature simple monochromatic geometric shapes which are trominoes. There are straight line segments and L-shaped corners.\n\n```\n<objects_summary>\n    types: monochromatic trominoes\n    attributes: composed of 3 pixels, shape (straight line, L-shape), orientation (horizontal, vertical, diagonal), colors (1-9)\n    background: color 0\n</objects_summary>\n```\n\n\nThe objects in the provided grids are small, monochromatic geometric shapes set against a background of color 0.\n\nEach object is a **tromino**, meaning it is composed of exactly three connected pixels of a single color (ranging from 1 to 9). These objects appear in two primary shape configurations:\n\n1.  **Straight Lines:**\n    *   These objects consist of three pixels arranged in a continuous straight line.\n    *   They can be oriented **horizontally** (e.g., a row of three), **vertically** (e.g., a column of three), or **diagonally** (e.g., three pixels connected at their corners in a diagonal slope).\n\n2.  **Corner Shapes (L-Shapes):**\n    *   These objects consist of three pixels arranged within a 2x2 square area, leaving one corner empty.\n    *   They appear in various rotations (resembling letters like 'L', 'J', 'r', or the number '7').\n\nThe objects are distinct and do not share colors with immediately adjacent objects. The colors observed across the grids include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.\n\n<objects_summary>\ntypes: monochromatic trominoes (3-pixel shapes)\nattributes:\n  - shapes: straight lines, corner shapes (L-shapes)\n  - orientations: horizontal, vertical, diagonal, rotated\n  - colors: numeric values 1-8\n  - size: 3 pixels\nbackground: color 0\n</objects_summary>",

                "response": "**My thinking on this problem has been quite detailed, involving a lot of examination of examples and creating potential rules.** I was given several input/output pairs and asked to identify the transformations. The initial idea was that the objects are monochromatic trominoes (L-shaped or linear shapes formed of 3 pixels), using numeric values for color. The output must be descriptions with `<transformation_summary>` tags.\n\nI began by analyzing the given data, particularly focusing on the different shapes and their positions. I thought about the relationships between them.  Looking at Example 1, the objects seemed to project diagonal lines, pointing from an L-shape towards a color-matching single pixel in the bottom part of the grid.  I thought the L-shapes were like \"projectiles\" or \"guns\" shooting diagonal lines, and the single-pixel was the target or end point.\n\nThen Example 2 introduced movement or shape extrusion. Similar shapes, like vertical or horizontal lines, appeared to move or morph, causing their corresponding regions to fill the spaces between each one.  The intermediate grids in this example show intermediate 'ghosting' or extrusion of the shapes along a diagonal between them. The input lines simply \"move\" along diagonal paths while extruding their geometry into the spaces they traverse.  I'm seeing this extrusion in 2 cases: *identical shapes* in the same grid.\n\nExample 3 showed interaction among different-colored shapes. It wasn't as simple as previous examples.  The shapes formed a chain, or *pathfinding*. One thing led to another. A shape (e.g. Yellow) emitted a beam towards another (e.g. Blue). The blue shape then emitted a beam to something else. I figured that diagonal lines or paths connected the elements in a cascade. This introduced the concept of the chain or sequence that runs through all of the elements. I then looked at the directions. It was like they were pointing to a location. When the beam reached that point, it just ended.\n\nFinally, I condensed all this to a set of rules:\n\n1.  **Diagonal Beam Extension**: An object of a certain color projects a colored diagonal beam to another element with a same or different color on the grid.\n2.  **Linear Shape Translation/Extrusion**: A shape *moves*, leaving a trail (or extrusion) in the direction of the next object on the grid. This only happens when it is the same color and shape.\n3.  **Sequential Inter-Object Connection (Chain/Pathfinding)**: Elements connect to each other in a specific order. The elements emit beams towards other elements (one color to another), like a waterfall (Top to Bottom).\n\nI then verified my thinking. I went back to the examples and saw it applied. This process let me break down the transformations in the grid.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided input/output pairs, here is the description of the potential transformations.\n\n### Identified Transformations\n\nThe transformations involve identifying \"Source\" objects (monochromatic trominoes) and \"Target\" locations (other objects or pixels), and generating diagonal paths or movement between them.\n\n**1. Homogeneous Diagonal Targeting (from Example 1)**\n*   **Condition:** The grid contains a tromino (Source) and a single isolated pixel (Target) of the **same color**.\n*   **Transformation:** A diagonal line of pixels (1 pixel wide) is drawn starting from the \"corner\" or vertex of the Source tromino.\n*   **Direction:** The line extends diagonally downwards (either South-East or South-West) towards the Target pixel.\n*   **Termination:** The line stops when it reaches the row immediately preceding or matching the Target pixel's row.\n*   **Colors involved in example:** 1, 2, 3, 5.\n\n**2. Isometric Shape Extrusion / Sweep (from Example 2)**\n*   **Condition:** The grid contains two identical trominoes (same shape, color, and orientation) located at different positions. One acts as the Start and the other as the End.\n*   **Transformation:** The space between the Start and End shapes is filled with copies of the shape, effectively \"sweeping\" or \"extruding\" the object along the linear diagonal path connecting them.\n*   **Effect:** This creates a thick diagonal bar matching the width and orientation of the original object (e.g., a vertical line moves diagonally to create a thick diagonal band; a horizontal line moves diagonally to create a jagged wide band).\n*   **Colors involved in example:** 2, 4, 5, 6.\n\n**3. Sequential Cascade Linking (from Example 3)**\n*   **Condition:** The grid contains multiple unique objects of **different colors**.\n*   **Transformation:** The objects are treated as nodes in a vertical sequence (sorted from top to bottom). Each object projects a diagonal path towards the next object below it in the grid.\n*   **Logic:**\n    *   Object A (Row $y_1$) targets Object B (Row $y_2$, where $y_2 > y_1$).\n    *   A diagonal line of Object A's color is drawn from A towards B.\n    *   When the \"beam\" from A reaches the vicinity of B, B then projects its own color beam towards the next object C.\n*   **Modification:** The objects themselves act as relay points. The incoming beam hits the object, and the outgoing beam starts from the object.\n*   **Colors involved in example:** 1, 2, 4, 5, 7.\n\n### Objects Analysis\n*   **Inputs:** Composed primarily of 3-pixel objects (trominoes). Shapes include:\n    *   **L-trominoes:** (e.g., coordinates $(0,0), (0,1), (1,0)$).\n    *   **Straight trominoes:** (Vertical or Horizontal lines of 3 pixels).\n*   **Targets:** Can be single pixels (Ex 1), identical shapes (Ex 2), or different shapes (Ex 3).\n*   **Background:** Color 0 (black/empty).\n\n<transformation_summary>\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous monochromatic blocks (trominoes) and isolated pixels.\n2.  **Determine Relationship Mode:**\n    *   **Same-Color Pair (Object + Pixel):** Draw a single-pixel diagonal line from the object vertex to the pixel.\n    *   **Same-Color Pair (Object + Object):** Extrude the shape diagonally, filling the path between the two instances with the shape's color.\n    *   **Multi-Color Set:** Sort objects vertically. Draw a diagonal line from each object to the nearest object below it.\n3.  **Draw Paths:** All paths are diagonal (45 degrees). The color of the path corresponds to the \"Source\" object emitting it. The path connects the source geometry to the target geometry.\n</transformation_summary>",

One acts as the Start and the other as the End.\n*   **Transformation:** The space between the Start and End shapes is filled with copies of the shape, effectively \"sweeping\" or \"extruding\" the object along the linear diagonal path connecting them.\n*   **Effect:** This creates a thick diagonal bar matching the width and orientation of the original object (e.g., a vertical line moves diagonally to create a thick diagonal band; a horizontal line moves diagonally to create a jagged wide band).\n*   **Colors involved in example:** 2, 4, 5, 6.\n\n**3. Sequential Cascade Linking (from Example 3)**\n*   **Condition:** The grid contains multiple unique objects of **different colors**.\n*   **Transformation:** The objects are treated as nodes in a vertical sequence (sorted from top to bottom). Each object projects a diagonal path towards the next object below it in the grid.\n*   **Logic:**\n    *   Object A (Row $y_1$) targets Object B (Row $y_2$, where $y_2 > y_1$).\n    *   A diagonal line of Object A's color is drawn from A towards B.\n    *   When the \"beam\" from A reaches the vicinity of B, B then projects its own color beam towards the next object C.\n*   **Modification:** The objects themselves act as relay points. The incoming beam hits the object, and the outgoing beam starts from the object.\n*   **Colors involved in example:** 1, 2, 4, 5, 7.\n\n### Objects Analysis\n*   **Inputs:** Composed primarily of 3-pixel objects (trominoes). Shapes include:\n    *   **L-trominoes:** (e.g., coordinates $(0,0), (0,1), (1,0)$).\n    *   **Straight trominoes:** (Vertical or Horizontal lines of 3 pixels).\n*   **Targets:** Can be single pixels (Ex 1), identical shapes (Ex 2), or different shapes (Ex 3).\n*   **Background:** Color 0 (black/empty).\n\n<transformation_summary>\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous monochromatic blocks (trominoes) and isolated pixels.\n2.  **Determine Relationship Mode:**\n    *   **Same-Color Pair (Object + Pixel):** Draw a single-pixel diagonal line from the object vertex to the pixel.\n    *   **Same-Color Pair (Object + Object):** Extrude the shape diagonally, filling the path between the two instances with the shape's color.\n    *   **Multi-Color Set:** Sort objects vertically. Draw a diagonal line from each object to the nearest object below it.\n3.  **Draw Paths:** All paths are diagonal (45 degrees). The color of the path corresponds to the \"Source\" object emitting it. The path connects the source geometry to the target geometry.",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\ntypes: monochromatic trominoes\n    attributes: composed of 3 pixels, shape (straight line, L-shape), orientation (horizontal, vertical, diagonal), colors (1-9)\n    background: color 0\n\n## Transformation Description\n\n` tags.\n\nI began by analyzing the given data, particularly focusing on the different shapes and their positions. I thought about the relationships between them.  Looking at Example 1, the objects seemed to project diagonal lines, pointing from an L-shape towards a color-matching single pixel in the bottom part of the grid.  I thought the L-shapes were like \"projectiles\" or \"guns\" shooting diagonal lines, and the single-pixel was the target or end point.\n\nThen Example 2 introduced movement or shape extrusion. Similar shapes, like vertical or horizontal lines, appeared to move or morph, causing their corresponding regions to fill the spaces between each one.  The intermediate grids in this example show intermediate 'ghosting' or extrusion of the shapes along a diagonal between them. The input lines simply \"move\" along diagonal paths while extruding their geometry into the spaces they traverse.  I'm seeing this extrusion in 2 cases: *identical shapes* in the same grid.\n\nExample 3 showed interaction among different-colored shapes. It wasn't as simple as previous examples.  The shapes formed a chain, or *pathfinding*. One thing led to another. A shape (e.g. Yellow) emitted a beam towards another (e.g. Blue). The blue shape then emitted a beam to something else. I figured that diagonal lines or paths connected the elements in a cascade. This introduced the concept of the chain or sequence that runs through all of the elements. I then looked at the directions. It was like they were pointing to a location. When the beam reached that point, it just ended.\n\nFinally, I condensed all this to a set of rules:\n\n1.  **Diagonal Beam Extension**: An object of a certain color projects a colored diagonal beam to another element with a same or different color on the grid.\n2.  **Linear Shape Translation/Extrusion**: A shape *moves*, leaving a trail (or extrusion) in the direction of the next object on the grid. This only happens when it is the same color and shape.\n3.  **Sequential Inter-Object Connection (Chain/Pathfinding)**: Elements connect to each other in a specific order. The elements emit beams towards other elements (one color to another), like a waterfall (Top to Bottom).\n\nI then verified my thinking. I went back to the examples and saw it applied. This process let me break down the transformations in the grid.\n\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided input/output pairs, here is the description of the potential transformations.\n\n### Identified Transformations\n\nThe transformations involve identifying \"Source\" objects (monochromatic trominoes) and \"Target\" locations (other objects or pixels), and generating diagonal paths or movement between them.\n\n**1. Homogeneous Diagonal Targeting (from Example 1)**\n*   **Condition:** The grid contains a tromino (Source) and a single isolated pixel (Target) of the **same color**.\n*   **Transformation:** A diagonal line of pixels (1 pixel wide) is drawn starting from the \"corner\" or vertex of the Source tromino.\n*   **Direction:** The line extends diagonally downwards (either South-East or South-West) towards the Target pixel.\n*   **Termination:** The line stops when it reaches the row immediately preceding or matching the Target pixel's row.\n*   **Colors involved in example:** 1, 2, 3, 5.\n\n**2. Isometric Shape Extrusion / Sweep (from Example 2)**\n*   **Condition:** The grid contains two identical trominoes (same shape, color, and orientation) located at different positions. One acts as the Start and the other as the End.\n*   **Transformation:** The space between the Start and End shapes is filled with copies of the shape, effectively \"sweeping\" or \"extruding\" the object along the linear diagonal path connecting them.\n*   **Effect:** This creates a thick diagonal bar matching the width and orientation of the original object (e.g., a vertical line moves diagonally to create a thick diagonal band; a horizontal line moves diagonally to create a jagged wide band).\n*   **Colors involved in example:** 2, 4, 5, 6.\n\n**3. Sequential Cascade Linking (from Example 3)**\n*   **Condition:** The grid contains multiple unique objects of **different colors**.\n*   **Transformation:** The objects are treated as nodes in a vertical sequence (sorted from top to bottom). Each object projects a diagonal path towards the next object below it in the grid.\n*   **Logic:**\n    *   Object A (Row $y_1$) targets Object B (Row $y_2$, where $y_2 > y_1$).\n    *   A diagonal line of Object A's color is drawn from A towards B.\n    *   When the \"beam\" from A reaches the vicinity of B, B then projects its own color beam towards the next object C.\n*   **Modification:** The objects themselves act as relay points. The incoming beam hits the object, and the outgoing beam starts from the object.\n*   **Colors involved in example:** 1, 2, 4, 5, 7.\n\n### Objects Analysis\n*   **Inputs:** Composed primarily of 3-pixel objects (trominoes). Shapes include:\n    *   **L-trominoes:** (e.g., coordinates $(0,0), (0,1), (1,0)$).\n    *   **Straight trominoes:** (Vertical or Horizontal lines of 3 pixels).\n*   **Targets:** Can be single pixels (Ex 1), identical shapes (Ex 2), or different shapes (Ex 3).\n*   **Background:** Color 0 (black/empty).\n\n<transformation_summary>\n1.  **Identify Objects:** Locate all contiguous monochromatic blocks (trominoes) and isolated pixels.\n2.  **Determine Relationship Mode:**\n    *   **Same-Color Pair (Object + Pixel):** Draw a single-pixel diagonal line from the object vertex to the pixel.\n    *   **Same-Color Pair (Object + Object):** Extrude the shape diagonally, filling the path between the two instances with the shape's color.\n    *   **Multi-Color Set:** Sort objects vertically. Draw a diagonal line from each object to the nearest object below it.\n3.  **Draw Paths:** All paths are diagonal (45 degrees). The color of the path corresponds to the \"Source\" object emitting it. The path connects the source geometry to the target geometry.\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain four main object types on a color 0 background: (1) 3-cell L-shaped objects in various orientations, (2) short straight lines (3 cells, horizontal or vertical), (3) diagonal lines of varying lengths, and (4) single isolated pixels. Objects use colors 1-8 and vary in position, orientation, and size across the grids.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nThe transformation draws diagonal lines (using colors 1-8) extending from each object:\n1. **L-shaped objects**: Diagonal extends from the corner into the \"open\" direction of the L (down-right for left-opening Ls, down-left for right-opening Ls)\n2. **Straight 3-cell lines**: Diagonal extends perpendicular to the line, direction based on grid position\n3. **Single pixels**: Two diagonals extend in opposite diagonal directions (X-pattern)\n4. All original objects are preserved\n5. Diagonals use the same color as their source object and extend to grid boundaries\n6. Same-colored objects have diagonals that connect/converge toward each other\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "**Inference of Diagonal Transformations**\n\nAlright, the task is to decipher a transformation rule and apply it to an ARC problem with a grid of numbers. After reviewing the provided data and initial description, it's clear the original prompt's description isn't quite accurate. A deeper analysis of the provided examples will give us the actual rule.\n\nLet's dive into example 1. The input appears to have L-shaped objects which seem to extend a diagonal trail to a pixel on the right of the L-shape. The goal is to determine the complete transformation rule to apply in test cases. I suspect the generic description is a placeholder. After exploring the inputs and outputs, it seems that there's a diagonal \"beam\" from the L to a target. There are a series of L shapes with single pixels. It seems the diagonal is emitting from one of the \"corners\". From the first example, this appears to be either right and down diagonal extending from the L-shape and another one, the target pixel, seems to be located at a different coordinates. The diagonal path from the \"filled corner\" of the shape to the pixel is clearly visible in the outputs. The description says extending lines. The diagonals seem to extend across cells, hitting a single pixel which emits another diagonal (the \"/\" diagonal from the input pixel).\n\nAfter observing multiple examples, the rule seems to be as follows. For each color, identify the L shape on the left. The diagonal extends from the bottom-right corner pixel of the 2x2 bounding box of the L to the right pixel and from there an upward diagonal is created. I now believe the rule is to identify the \"corner\" pixel (the one with two neighbors) of each L shape. The filled pixels will project a diagonal down and to the right (`\\`), hitting the pixel on the right, which then sends another diagonal `/` upward. This diagonal continues up-right from the hit pixel, which then is sent to the boundary.\n\nNow, let's analyze example 2. The objects are either straight or L shaped and the general approach is used to determine a pattern with line segments with new diagonal beams. After analysis, in this example, there are 2 sets of lines - horizontal and vertical. Diagonals extend from the ends of vertical lines and from the center for the horizontal lines. From the pattern, it can be said that the diagonals seem to converge toward each other. The prompt says that the rule is \"same-colored objects have diagonals that connect/converge\". From observation of each example, the diagonals have a relationship. The horizontal objects emit \"/\". The vertical ones emit \"/\".\n\nLet's test this in example 3. With a mix of shapes, a L, a vertical line and a horizontal line are available. The pattern is as per the above rules. The rule from example 1 should work.\n\nFinally, let's get into the Test Input. It's filled with L-shaped objects of varying colors. By checking the examples, it is evident that a \"diagonal\" is produced from the \"filled corner\" pixel of the L shape. The corners of this shape are missing. The diagonal is opposite of the missing side, therefore it is sent down-right (`\\`). Let's calculate the coordinates. Based on all the knowledge, all calculations are in place and this should solve the ARC task.\n\n\nTo solve this challenge, I analyzed the provided examples to infer the transformation rules.\n\n**Logic and Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Object Identification**: The grid contains L-shaped objects (2x2 blocks with one corner missing). Each L-shape has a \"corner\" pixel (the one connecting the two arms, i.e., having two neighbors of the same color) and a \"missing\" pixel (the empty spot in the 2x2 bounding box).\n\n2.  **Transformation Rule**:\n    *   For each L-shaped object, a diagonal line is drawn starting from the \"corner\" pixel.\n    *   The direction of the diagonal is opposite to the vector pointing from the corner to the missing pixel.\n        *   If the missing pixel is to the Top-Left of the corner (vector -1, -1), the diagonal goes Down-Right (+1, +1).\n        *   If the missing pixel is to the Top-Right of the corner (vector -1, +1), the diagonal goes Down-Left (+1, -1).\n    *   The diagonal extends from the pixel adjacent to the corner until it hits the grid boundary.\n    *   Lines of different colors in this specific task setup (based on parity analysis of the start positions) do not collide; they pass through each other in the empty spaces between the grid cells (cross-stitch pattern).\n\n3.  **Application to Test Input**:\n    The input consists of a series of L-shaped objects arranged in the top half of the grid.\n    *   **Left Side Objects** (Missing corner is Top-Left relative to the filled corner): These produce diagonals extending **Down-Right**.\n        *   Color 1 (Corner 1,1) -> Starts (2,2)\n        *   Color 2 (Corner 1,3) -> Starts (2,4)\n        *   Color 7 (Corner 1,5) -> Starts (2,6)\n        *   Color 5 (Corner 1,7) -> Starts (2,8)\n        *   Color 2 (Corner 3,1) -> Starts (4,2)\n        *   Color 7 (Corner 5,1) -> Starts (6,2)\n        *   Color 5 (Corner 7,1) -> Starts (8,2)\n    *   **Right Side Objects** (Missing corner is Top-Right relative to the filled corner): These produce diagonals extending **Down-Left**.\n        *   Color 2 (Corner 1,10) -> Starts (2,9)\n        *   Color 8 (Corner 1,12) -> Starts (2,11)\n        *   Color 6 (Corner 1,14) -> Starts (2,13)\n        *   Color 4 (Corner 1,16) -> Starts (2,15)\n        *   Color 6 (Corner 3,16) -> Starts (4,15)\n        *   Color 8 (Corner 5,16) -> Starts (6,15)\n        *   Color 2 (Corner 7,16) -> Starts (8,15)\n\n    I will fill the grid with these diagonal lines.\n\n**Output Generation:**\n\n*   **Color 1**: (2,2) to (17,17)\n*   **Color 2**:\n    *   (2,4) to (15,17)\n    *   (2,9) to (11,0)\n    *   (4,2) to (17,15)\n    *   (8,15) to (17,6)\n*   **Color 7**:\n    *   (2,6) to (13,17)\n    *   (6,2) to (17,13)\n*   **Color 5**:\n    *   (2,8) to (11,17)\n    *   (8,2) to (17,11)\n*   **Color 8**:\n    *   (2,11) to (13,0)\n    *   (6,15) to (17,4)\n*   **Color 6**:\n    *   (2,13) to (15,0)\n    *   (4,15) to (17,2)\n*   **Color 4**:\n    *   (2,15) to (17,0)\n\n```text\n0,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,0,0,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,0\n1,1,2,2,7,7,5,5,0,0,2,2,8,8,6,6,4,4\n0,2,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,0,0\n2,2,0,1,0,2,0,7,2,5,8,0,6,0,4,0,0,0\n0,7,2,0,1,0,2,2,7,8,5,6,0,4,0,6,8,0\n7,7,0,2,0,1,2,0,8,7,6,5,4,0,6,0,8,0\n0,5,7,0,2,0,1,0,0,6,7,4,5,6,0,8,2,0\n5,5,0,7,0,2,0,1,6,0,4,7,6,5,8,0,2,2\n0,0,5,0,7,0,2,0,1,4,0,6,7,8,5,2,0,0\n0,0,0,5,0,7,0,2,4,1,0,0,8,7,6,5,2,0\n0,0,0,0,5,0,7,4,2,0,1,0,0,8,7,6,5,2\n0,0,0,0,0,5,4,7,0,2,0,1,0,0,8,7,6,5\n0,0,0,0,0,4,5,0,7,0,2,0,1,0,0,8,7,6\n0,0,0,0,4,0,0,5,0,7,0,2,0,1,0,0,8,7\n0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,5,0,7,0,2,0,1,0,0,8\n0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,7,0,2,0,1,0,0\n0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,7,0,2,0,1,0\n4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,7,0,2,0,1\n```",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain four main object types on a color 0 background: (1) 3-cell L-shaped objects in various orientations, (2) short straight lines (3 cells, horizontal or vertical), (3) diagonal lines of varying lengths, and (4) single isolated pixels. Objects use colors 1-8 and vary in position, orientation, and size across the grids.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nThe transformation draws diagonal lines (using colors 1-8) extending from each object:\n1. **L-shaped objects**: Diagonal extends from the corner into the \"open\" direction of the L (down-right for left-opening Ls, down-left for right-opening Ls)\n2. **Straight 3-cell lines**: Diagonal extends perpendicular to the line, direction based on grid position\n3. **Single pixels**: Two diagonals extend in opposite diagonal directions (X-pattern)\n4. All original objects are preserved\n5. Diagonals use the same color as their source object and extend to grid boundaries\n6. Same-colored objects have diagonals that connect/converge toward each other\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
            "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to analyze how the transformation works in the examples:\n\n1. **L-shaped objects**: Each L-shape has a \"corner\" where two cells meet. A diagonal line extends from this corner in the \"open\" direction of the L. Left-opening L's (opening on top-left) extend down-right. Right-opening L's (opening on top-right) extend down-left.\n\n2. **Same-colored objects**: Their diagonals extend toward each other, converging somewhere in the grid.\n\n**Analyzing the test input:**\nI identify L-shaped objects at:\n\n**Left column (down-right diagonals from corners):**\n- Color 1: corner at (1,1)\n- Color 2: corner at (3,1)  \n- Color 7: corner at (5,1)\n- Color 5: corner at (7,1)\n\n**Top-left (down-right diagonals):**\n- Color 2: corner at (1,3)\n- Color 7: corner at (1,5)\n- Color 5: corner at (1,7)\n\n**Top-right (down-left diagonals):**\n- Color 2: corner at (1,10)\n- Color 8: corner at (1,12)\n- Color 6: corner at (1,14)\n- Color 4: corner at (1,16)\n\n**Right column (down-left diagonals):**\n- Color 6: corner at (3,16)\n- Color 8: corner at (5,16)\n- Color 2: corner at (7,16)\n\nI trace each diagonal from its corner extending in the appropriate direction (+1,+1 for down-right or +1,-1 for down-left) until reaching grid boundaries.\n\n```\n0,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,0,0,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,0\n1,1,2,2,7,7,5,5,0,0,2,2,8,8,6,6,4,4\n0,2,1,0,2,0,7,0,5,2,0,8,0,6,0,4,6,0\n2,2,0,1,0,2,0,7,2,5,8,0,6,0,4,0,6,6\n0,7,2,0,1,0,2,2,7,8,5,6,0,4,0,6,8,0\n7,7,0,2,0,1,2,2,8,7,6,5,4,0,6,0,8,8\n0,5,7,0,2,2,1,8,2,6,7,4,5,6,0,8,2,0\n5,5,0,7,2,2,8,1,6,2,4,7,6,5,8,0,2,2\n0,0,5,2,7,8,2,6,1,4,2,6,7,8,5,2,0,0\n0,0,2,5,8,7,6,2,4,1,6,2,8,7,2,5,0,0\n0,2,0,8,5,6,7,4,2,6,1,8,2,2,7,0,5,0\n2,0,8,0,6,5,4,7,6,2,8,1,2,2,0,7,0,5\n0,8,0,6,0,4,5,6,7,8,2,2,1,0,2,0,7,0\n8,0,6,0,4,0,6,5,8,7,2,2,0,1,0,2,0,7\n0,6,0,4,0,6,0,8,5,2,7,0,2,0,1,0,2,0\n6,0,4,0,6,0,8,0,2,5,0,7,0,2,0,1,0,2\n0,4,0,6,0,8,0,2,0,0,5,0,7,0,2,0,1,0\n4,0,6,0,8,0,2,0,0,0,0,5,0,7,0,2,0,1\n```",

L-Shaped Objects\nSmall formations consisting of 3 cells arranged in an \"L\" configuration. These appear in multiple orientations (rotated 0\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 270\u00b0). Colors observed include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. The L-shapes typically have one cell at a corner with two cells extending in perpendicular directions.\n\n### 2. Straight Lines\nShort linear arrangements of cells:\n- **Horizontal lines**: Typically 3 cells in a row\n- **Vertical lines**: Typically 3 cells in a column\nColors vary across instances.\n\n### 3. Diagonal Lines\nSequences of single pixels arranged along diagonal paths (either ascending or descending direction). These can extend for varying lengths, from just a few cells to spanning significant portions of the grid. Multiple colors (2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 3) form these diagonal patterns.\n\n### 4. Single Pixels\nIndividual isolated cells of non-background colors scattered at various positions.\n\n## Common Attributes\n- **Color**: Values 1-8 observed for objects\n- **Size**: L-shapes and straight lines typically 3 cells; diagonal lines vary in length\n- **Orientation**: L-shapes appear in 4 rotational variants; lines are horizontal, vertical, or diagonal\n- **Position**: Objects appear at various locations throughout the grids\n- **Connectivity**: Some objects appear as isolated units; others form extended patterns\n\n<objects_summary>\nThe grids contain four main object types on a color 0 background: (1) 3-cell L-shaped objects in various orientations, (2) short straight lines (3 cells, horizontal or vertical), (3) diagonal lines of varying lengths, and (4) single isolated pixels.

Objects Description\nThe grids contain four main object types on a color 0 background: (1) 3-cell L-shaped objects in various orientations, (2) short straight lines (3 cells, horizontal or vertical), (3) diagonal lines of varying lengths, and (4) single isolated pixels. Objects use colors 1-8 and vary in position, orientation, and size across the grids.",
                "response": "Looking at the three examples, I can identify the following transformations:\n\n## Identified Transformations:\n\n### 1. **Original Object Preservation**\nAll original objects (L-shapes, lines, single pixels) remain in their original positions in the output.\n\n### 2. **Diagonal Line Generation from L-shaped Objects (3-cell L-shapes)**\n- Each L-shaped object generates a diagonal line extending from its \"corner\" cell\n- The diagonal direction is into the \"opening\" of the L (the direction opposite to both arms)\n- For L-shapes oriented like:\n  ```\n  .X    X.\n  XX    XX\n  ```\n  Left type \u2192 diagonal goes down-right; Right type \u2192 diagonal goes down-left\n- Diagonals continue until reaching the grid boundary\n\n### 3. **Diagonal Line Generation from Straight Lines (3-cell vertical/horizontal)**\n- Vertical lines generate diagonal lines perpendicular to the line direction\n- Horizontal lines also generate perpendicular diagonals\n- Direction depends on position: upper lines extend downward, lower lines extend upward\n- Left-positioned lines extend rightward, right-positioned extend leftward\n\n### 4. **X-Pattern Diagonals from Single Pixels**\n- Isolated single-cell pixels generate TWO diagonal lines\n- One diagonal goes up-left/down-right, the other goes up-right/down-left\n- Creates an X-pattern emanating from the pixel location\n\n### 5. **Color Matching and Connection**\n- When multiple objects of the same color exist, their diagonals extend toward each other\n- Diagonals can \"connect\" objects of the same color across the grid\n- Each diagonal maintains the color of its source object\n\n### 6. **Diagonal Extension Rules**\n- All diagonals extend until they reach the grid boundary\n- Diagonals are exactly 1 cell wide (single-pixel thickness)\n- Diagonals move at 45\u00b0 angles (one cell horizontal + one cell vertical per step)\n\n<transformation_summary>\nThe transformation draws diagonal lines (using colors 1-8) extending from each object:\n1. **L-shaped objects**: Diagonal extends from the corner into the \"open\" direction of the L (down-right for left-opening Ls, down-left for right-opening Ls)\n2. **Straight 3-cell lines**: Diagonal extends perpendicular to the line, direction based on grid position\n3. **Single pixels**: Two diagonals extend in opposite diagonal directions (X-pattern)\n4. All original objects are preserved\n5. Diagonals use the same color as their source object and extend to grid boundaries\n6. Same-colored objects have diagonals that connect/converge toward each other\n</transformation_summary>",

solve this problem, please consider using the description of the input/output data below:\n\n## Objects Description\n\nThe grids contain four main object types on a color 0 background: (1) 3-cell L-shaped objects in various orientations, (2) short straight lines (3 cells, horizontal or vertical), (3) diagonal lines of varying lengths, and (4) single isolated pixels. Objects use colors 1-8 and vary in position, orientation, and size across the grids.\n\n## Transformation Description\n\nThe transformation draws diagonal lines (using colors 1-8) extending from each object:\n1. **L-shaped objects**: Diagonal extends from the corner into the \"open\" direction of the L (down-right for left-opening Ls, down-left for right-opening Ls)\n2. **Straight 3-cell lines**: Diagonal extends perpendicular to the line, direction based on grid position\n3. **Single pixels**: Two diagonals extend in opposite diagonal directions (X-pattern)\n4. All original objects are preserved\n5. Diagonals use the same color as their source object and extend to grid boundaries\n6. Same-colored objects have diagonals that connect/converge toward each other\n\nRespond with an explanation of your thinking that is detailed enough that someone can reconstruct your solution. Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid."
