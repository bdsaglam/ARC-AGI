Afterwards, you MUST also respond with the completed output grid.",
        "Full raw LLM response": "**My thinking on this ARC task has been quite involved, but I've finally formulated a robust approach!**\n\nInitially, I dived into the examples, searching for any obvious patterns. I looked at pixel counts, shape arrangements, and even considered convolution, but nothing clicked. Then I realized the input seemed like a vertical stack of \"blocks\", each containing two 3x3 shapes: one on the left, one on the right, separated by an empty column. The \"5\" in the right side of the input became a key, a \"cursor\" that I believe, moves across a predefined, vertical canvas, creating the output.\n\nMy key realization: The output is a construction built by stacking each of the left column shapes, followed by the right column shapes. Each shape represents a block with a defined *width* and a *vertical height of one* except for a magenta block, which can have a height of two. Each shape also has \"in\" and \"out\" connection ports, controlling how blocks stack in each column.\n\nThe Shapes (identified):\n*   Red (2): 2x1 block, In=1, Out=0\n*   Blue (1): 3x1 block, In=0, Out=2\n*   Magenta (6): 1x2 block, In=0, Out=0\n*   Green (3): 4x1 block, In=3, Out=0\n\nEssentially, I determined to treat each shape as a command with instructions. Based on the position of the input shapes, starting with the \"5\", I process each shape and move the cursor according to in and out port. The shapes at the top of the canvas will be processed first. Processing follows the Left Column (Top to Bottom) followed by the Right Column (Top to Bottom). Finally, at the end of execution, the resulting construction is a representation of the shape stack, and the original \"5\" is at the same vertical position.\n\nThere's one additional critical rule I discovered by carefully examining Example 3: if a Red shape (Shape 2) is the *last one at the bottom* of a particular column (either Left or Right), it's completely skipped. This seems an edge condition of the rule set.\n\nSo, I can now:\n1.  Read the input grid and identify the 3x3 shapes.\n2.  Determine their type (Red, Blue, Magenta, Green).\n3.  Based on the list, build the \"blocks\" from the shapes, calculating their positions relative to an initial cursor determined from the position of the \"5\".\n4.  Apply that the \"Red at Bottom\" rule, skipping as necessary.\n5.  Construct the output grid based on the processed positions and shape colors.\n\nThis approach gives me a complete method to solve the ARC task!\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid into an output grid based on the logic inferred from the examples.\n\n**Inferred Logic:**\n\n1.  **Separation:** The input grid is divided into a **Left Side** (columns 0-6) and a **Right Side** (columns 8-14), separated by a vertical line of `4`s at column 7.\n\n2.  **Shapes:** The Left and Right sides contain 3x3 colored patterns (shapes). These shapes are stacked vertically. We identify the sequence of shapes by reading the Left Side from top to bottom, followed by the Right Side from top to bottom.\n\n3.  **Shape Definitions:** Each unique shape (by color/pattern) corresponds to a block in the output grid with specific dimensions (Width `W`, Height `H`) and \"connection ports\" (Input Offset `In`, Output Offset `Out`).\n    *   **Red (Color 2):** Width 2, Height 1. `In` = 1, `Out` = 0.\n    *   **Blue (Color 1):** Width 3, Height 1. `In` = 0, `Out` = 2.\n    *   **Magenta (Color 6):** Width 1, Height 2. `In` = 0, `Out` = 0.\n    *   **Green (Color 3):** Width 4, Height 1. `In` = 3, `Out` = 0.\n\n4.  **Cursor Mechanism:**\n    *   A \"Cursor\" `C` is initialized based on the position of the grey pixel (`5`) in the Right Side of the input. If the `5` is at column `k` (relative to the Right Side, 0-indexed), then `C = k`.\n    *   The output grid's first row (Row 0) contains the `5` at column `C`.\n    *   We process the list of shapes sequentially. For each shape:\n        1.  Calculate the starting column `Pos` of the block: `Pos = C - In`.\n        2.  Draw the block in the output grid at the current row(s) starting at `Pos`. The block fills `W` columns and `H` rows.\n        3.  Update the Cursor for the next shape: `C_new = Pos + Out`.\n        4.  Move the current row pointer down by `H`.\n\n5.  **Special Condition:** Based on Example 3, if a **Red** shape immediately follows another **Red** shape in the sequence, and logic suggests a conflict or redundant move, it might be skipped. However, in the Test Input, the Red shapes are not consecutive. We will assume standard processing for the last Red shape.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Initialization:** The `5` is at column 10 in the input. Relative to the Right Side (starts at col 8), `C = 10 - 8 = 2`.\n*   **Shape Sequence:**\n    *   **Left Side:** Blue (1), Red (2), Magenta (6), Green (3), Magenta (6).\n    *   **Right Side:** Blue (1), Blue (1), Magenta (6), Green (3), Red (2).\n\n*   **Processing:**\n    1.  **Row 0:** `5` at col 2.\n    2.  **L1 Blue:** `C=2`. `In=0`. `Pos=2`. Draw at Row 1. `C` becomes `2 + 2 = 4`.\n    3.  **L2 Red:** `C=4`. `In=1`. `Pos=3`. Draw at Row 2. `C` becomes `3 + 0 = 3`.\n    4.  **L3 Magenta:** `C=3`. `In=0`. `Pos=3`. Draw at Rows 3-4. `C` becomes `3 + 0 = 3`.\n    5.  **L4 Green:** `C=3`. `In=3`. `Pos=0`. Draw at Row 5. `C` becomes `0 + 0 = 0`.\n    6.  **L5 Magenta:** `C=0`. `In=0`. `Pos=0`. Draw at Rows 6-7. `C` becomes `0 + 0 = 0`.\n    7.  **R1 Blue:** `C=0`. `In=0`. `Pos=0`. Draw at Row 8. `C` becomes `0 + 2 = 2`.\n    8.  **R2 Blue:** `C=2`. `In=0`. `Pos=2`. Draw at Row 9. `C` becomes `2 + 2 = 4`.\n    9.  **R3 Magenta:** `C=4`. `In=0`. `Pos=4`. Draw at Rows 10-11. `C` becomes `4 + 0 = 4`.\n    10. **R4 Green:** `C=4`. `In=3`. `Pos=1`. Draw at Row 12. `C` becomes `1 + 0 = 1`.\n    11. **R5 Red:** `C=1`. `In=1`. `Pos=0`. Draw at Row 13. `C` becomes `0 + 0 = 0`.\n\n**Constructed Output Grid:**\n\n0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,1,1,0,0\n0,0,0,2,2,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n0,0,0,6,0,0,0\n3,3,3,3,0,0,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n6,0,0,0,0,0,0\n1,1,1,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,1,1,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,0,0,0,6,0,0\n0,3,3,3,3,0,0\n2,2,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**Decoding the Arcane Logic of the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with this ARC puzzle. The goal is to figure out the hidden pattern based on a few examples and one test case. The input is a bunch of grids with numbers from 0 to 9, and the output is a narrower grid. My initial thought is to break down the input and see how it relates to the output.\n\n**The Grid's Structure**\nIt looks like there's a key vertical \"separator\" column of 4s. This divides each input grid into two parts. The left side is where all the interesting stuff happens, it looks like it's built out of repeating 3x3 blocks, each block is paired with another. On the right side, there's a single number usually accompanied by empty space. This single number seems to act as a crucial \u201cpointer\u201d.\n\n**The Pointer's Significance**\n\nThat number seems to \"point\" to something important within the left side. Let me call this distance from the separator,  $P$.\nEach block appears to be 3 rows high and is a 3x3 pattern. These patterns are associated with the value in the grid and may represent a logical operator or some \"shapes\".\nThere also seems to be layers of these paired blocks, which is the total height of the input grid.\nThe output grid has a width of 7, which fits with the logic of the left-hand grid which is 7-long.\n\n**Output Generation: The Ball and the Blocks**\n\nMy theory is that a \"ball\" (the pointer) falls, and during its fall interacts with the layers of blocks. The key is how this \"ball\" interacts, where the layers generate different effects in the output grid.\nThe horizontal location of the ball seems to matter. It influences something about how the left-hand side shapes combine into shapes on the right-hand side.\nSo I think the input patterns are acting like an instruction set.\n\nLet\u2019s see, so the output appears to be constructed from columns of the blocks on the left.\nExamine how, within each layer, two patterns on the left of the separator, is related to the final output, based on where the \"ball\" is placed.\n\n**Deduction**\n\n1. The position of the \u201cball\u201d determines the columns from the pattern blocks.\n2. The strips, the vertical column from the blocks are used to generate the shapes in the output.\nThe column index is important. So the ball has a direct impact on the structure of the output.\n3. Finally, I will determine exactly what patterns are created based on each stripe, given the column, the output blocks.\n\n**Test Case: A Deep Dive**\n\nSo for the test case, the ball is at position 3, so its \"x\" value in the output is 2. The ball's horizontal location, seems to dictate how the blocks transform into the output.\n\n**Final Construction**\n\nSo, with $P=3$ for the test case, I should use the following rules to build the output:\n\n*   **Ball at 2 (x-coord for Output):** The column is in the middle of the grid in this test and the ball \u201cselects\u201d a set of patterns in order, as I had previously concluded.\n*   **Vertical Strip Generation:** Each set of 3 pixels within a vertical block of the input, generates a pattern. The shape and the order are crucial.\n\nBy applying this logic, and considering the color of the output, I'm now confident I can successfully generate the output for this specific ARC task and similar tasks.\n\n*   In summary, it's about translating these blocks into horizontal shapes. The test input shows it should be: a \u201c5\u201d in the top, then a list of 1s in a row (3 times), then a list of 2s (2 times) after the 1s, then a list of 6s at the bottom (2 times), etc.\n\nFrom now on, I can automate the generation.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid into an output grid based on a set of rules inferred from the examples.\n\n**Inferred Rules:**\n\n1.  **Structure:** The input grid consists of a Left Side (cols 0-6), a Separator (col 7, vertical line of 4s), and a Right Side (cols 8-14). The output grid is 7 columns wide.\n2.  **Pointer:** There is a single non-zero pixel (color 5) in the first row of the Right Side. Its distance from the separator determines a target parameter $P$.\n    *   Example 1: Col 9 (Dist 2) $\\rightarrow P=2$.\n    *   Example 2: Col 11 (Dist 4) $\\rightarrow P=4$.\n    *   Example 3: Col 12 (Dist 5) $\\rightarrow P=5$.\n    *   Test Input: Col 10 (Dist 3) $\\rightarrow P=3$.\n3.  **Ball Position:** In the output grid (row 0), a '5' is placed at column $X_{ball} = P - 1$.\n    *   Test Input: $P=3 \\rightarrow X_{ball} = 2$.\n4.  **Column Selection:** The processing logic extracts specific 3-pixel vertical strips from the 3x3 blocks on the Left Side (cols 0-2) and Right Side (cols 4-6). The column index selected depends on $P$.\n    *   If $P$ corresponds to an \"Edge\" relative to the blocks ($P=2, 4, 5$), it selects the \"Inner/Center\" columns or \"Outer\" columns based on specific mapping.\n    *   Based on Example 2 (Dist 4) and Example 3 (Dist 5), the column selection uses the \"Inner Edges\" of the blocks relative to the gap (Index 2 for Left Block, Index 0 for Right Block).\n    *   Since the Test Input ($P=3$) represents the gap (symmetric center), we apply the same \"Inner Edge\" selection: Left Block Column 2, Right Block Column 0.\n5.  **Strip Transformation:** The extracted 3-pixel strips are converted into output patterns.\n    *   Strip `X X X` or `X 0 X` (Top+Bot) or `X X 0` (Top+Mid) $\\rightarrow$ Horizontal bar. Width depends on shape.\n        *   `1 1 0` / `1 0 1` / `0 1 0` $\\rightarrow$ `1 1 1` (Width 3).\n        *   `2 2 2` / `2 0 2` $\\rightarrow$ `2 2` (Width 2).\n        *   `3 0 3` / `3 3 0` $\\rightarrow$ `3 3 3 3` (Width 4).\n    *   Strip `X 0 0` (Top only) $\\rightarrow$ Vertical bar `X` then `X` (Width 1, Height 2).\n6.  **Ordering and Placement:**\n    *   The layers are processed top to bottom. For each layer, the Left Block result is output first, then the Right Block result.\n    *   Left Block outputs are placed starting at $X_{ball} - 1$.\n    *   Right Block outputs are placed starting at $X_{ball}$.\n    *   Results are stacked vertically.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n*   **Pointer:** $P=3$. Output Ball at col 2.\n*   **Selected Columns:** Left Col 2, Right Col 0.\n*   **Layers:**\n    *   **L1 (Color 1):** Left Col 2 (`0 1 0`) $\\rightarrow$ `1 1 1`. Right Col 0 (`1 1 0`) $\\rightarrow$ `1 1 1`.\n    *   **L2 (Left 2, Right 1):** Left Col 2 (`2 2 2`) $\\rightarrow$ `2 2`. Right Col 0 (`1 1 0`) $\\rightarrow$ `1 1 1`.\n    *   **L3 (Color 6):** Left Col 2 (`6 0 0`) $\\rightarrow$ `6`, `6`. Right Col 0 (`6 0 0`) $\\rightarrow$ `6`, `6`.\n    *   **L4 (Color 3):** Left Col 2 (`3 0 3`) $\\rightarrow$ `3 3 3 3`. Right Col 0 (`3 0 3`) $\\rightarrow$ `3 3 3 3`.\n    *   **L5 (Left 6, Right 2):** Left Col 2 (`6 0 0`) $\\rightarrow$ `6`, `6`. Right Col 0 (`2 2 2`) $\\rightarrow$ `2 2`.\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\nRow 0: `0 0 5 0 0 0 0`\nRow 1: L1L (at 1) `0 1 1 1 0 0 0`\nRow 2: L1R (at 2) `0 0 1 1 1 0 0`\nRow 3: L2L (at 1) `0 2 2 0 0 0 0`\nRow 4: L2R (at 2) `0 0 1 1 1 0 0`\nRow 5: L3L (at 1) `0 6 0 0 0 0 0`\nRow 6: L3L (at 1) `0 6 0 0 0 0 0`\nRow 7: L3R (at 2) `0 0 6 0 0 0 0`\nRow 8: L3R (at 2) `0 0 6 0 0 0 0`\nRow 9: L4L (at 1) `0 3 3 3 3 0 0`\nRow 10: L4R (at 2) `0 0 3 3 3 3 0`\nRow 11: L5L (at 1) `0 6 0 0 0 0 0`\nRow 12: L5L (at 1) `0 6 0 0 0 0 0`\nRow 13: L5R (at 2) `0 0 2 2 0 0 0`\n\n0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,1,1,1,0,0,0\n0,0,1,1,1,0,0\n0,2,2,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,1,1,0,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,3,3,3,3,0,0\n0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,6,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,2,2,0,0,0",

Each shape has a specific type determining direction and segment length:\n   - **Diagonal type** (like color 1): `1,1,0 / 1,0,1 / 0,1,0` \u2192 moves RIGHT, length 3\n   - **U-type** (like color 2): `2,0,2 / 2,0,2 / 2,2,2` \u2192 moves LEFT, length 2\n   - **V-type** (like color 6): `6,0,6 / 0,6,0 / 0,6,0` \u2192 moves DOWN, length 2\n   - **T-type** (like color 3): `3,3,3 / 0,3,0 / 3,0,3` \u2192 moves LEFT, length 4\n\n2.
