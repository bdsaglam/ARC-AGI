        "Full raw LLM response": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Dissection**\n\nI'm faced with an ARC task where I need to fill in missing parts (inpainting) of a grid. The grid's input size is consistently 30x30, but the output dimensions vary. My expert-level intuition suggests leveraging the grid's inherent structure\u2014likely symmetry\u2014to decode the hidden patterns and reconstruct the missing elements, represented by the value 8 in all examples provided.\n\n**Symmetry and Pattern Recognition**\n\nI've observed a strong presence of symmetry. The primary challenge is pinpointing the exact type of symmetry in each example. While the grid *looks* globally symmetric, my analysis reveals the underlying symmetry axis(es) can shift between examples and is not always obvious or easily found, especially when dealing with the \"hole\" regions. It appears that a combination of vertical and horizontal symmetry, or sometimes just one, is employed. The value 8 serves as a telltale sign that some \"folding\" (symmetry) is happening. The hidden data is likely found in \"mirrored\" parts of the grid.\n\n**Methodical Approach and Hypotheses**\n\nMy approach involves systematically testing for different types of symmetry. I begin by checking for standard vertical, horizontal, diagonal, and rotational symmetry. Then, I check for block repetitions or quadrant symmetries. I will also check for symmetry with respect to the *columns* or the *rows*, not just their full reversal.\n\n**Iterative Discovery and Key Insights**\n\nMy most crucial finding is the \"vertical symmetry\" which is around a value that is NOT the grid center. This symmetry is sometimes applied with the sum of the indices being 31 or 32 depending on the example. The hole is, in most examples, right-aligned, and I hypothesize the symmetry with respect to it. However, the exact symmetry transformation depends on the configuration of each example. The \"holes\" are \"hidden\" data in the examples I'm given, which can be uncovered by the symmetry.\n\n**Algorithm Design and Implementation**\n\nMy current algorithm, now refined through multiple iterations, is structured as follows:\n\n1.  **Symmetry Detection**: Determine the correct vertical symmetry sum (often 31) by checking for row matches across the grid. The block rows, especially the ones near the 8-containing part, are important here. The horizontal symmetry is dependent on this, so it is necessary to check if the symmetry works. The values in the example will be helpful for this.\n2.  **Symmetry Application**: Once the appropriate symmetry is determined, copy the value from the matching symmetrical row. If the target location doesn't have an 8, it's safe to copy the value. However, the data that needs to be filled in (the value 8) is dependent on where the hole is and the size of the hole.\n3.  **Boundary Conditions and Hole Handling**: Handle cases where symmetry is \"self-referential\" (the 8s lie on the symmetry axis). I need to determine the specific mapping to derive the value inside the 8s. This relies on the idea of horizontal symmetry within the row and finding the relationships between specific pixels and their mirrored versions. The hole has a specific size.\n\n**Challenges and Refinement**\n\nThe major complexity lies in the self-referential rows (where two symmetrical parts both contain 8s). In these cases, it's not simply a mirror copy, but a more complex relationship must be found. It can be a permutation, and it should hold in the given examples. I must find the way the pixels \"fold\" to fit the hole.\n\n**Solution and Verification**\n\nBy iteratively checking and applying the rules, I can successfully infer the missing values. The final solution is a grid, which I can verify using the test case data and cross-checking my findings with the available examples. The 8s reveal the solution when the other regions are properly mirrored and the structure is completely understood.\n\nThe problem asks us to fill in a rectangular block of `8`s in the input grid. By analyzing the solved examples, we can identify two main symmetries used to reconstruct the obscured data:\n\n1.  **Vertical Symmetry:** The grid exhibits a reflection across a horizontal axis. For the test input, by comparing rows with valid data (e.g., Row 13 vs Row 18, Row 8 vs Row 23), we determine the symmetry relates row $r$ with row $31-r$.\n    *   Row 22 (part of the 8-block) corresponds to Row $31-22=9$. Row 9 contains valid data `1, 6, 1` in the target columns (0-2).\n    *   Row 21 corresponds to Row 10. Data: `6, 6, 6`.\n    *   Row 20 corresponds to Row 11. Data: `6, 6, 6`.\n    *   Row 19 corresponds to Row 12. Data: `4, 4, 7`.\n    *   Row 18 corresponds to Row 13. Data: `4, 4, 7`.\n\n2.  **Horizontal Symmetry (Core Rows):** For rows 14, 15, 16, and 17, the vertical reflection maps them to each other (14 to 17, 15 to 16) and both contain `8`s, meaning vertical symmetry cannot retrieve the missing pixels. We must use horizontal symmetry.\n    *   Analyzing Row 14, we find matches between columns $c$ and $31-c$ for the valid data (e.g., Col 6 matches Col 25, Col 4 matches Col 27). This suggests a palindrome-like structure. For column 2, the mirror is $31-2=29$. Row 14 Col 29 is `9`. Thus, Row 14 Col 2 is `9`.\n    *   Analyzing Row 15, we find matches between columns $c$ and $32-c$ (e.g., Col 3 matches Col 29, Col 4 matches Col 28). For column 3, the mirror is $32-3=29$. Row 15 Col 29 is `9`. Row 15 Col 3 is `9`.\n    *   Considering the pattern of neighbors and the strong `9`s appearing in the mirrored positions, along with the consistent block structure in Example 1, the most logical completion for the missing start columns 0 and 1 in these \"core\" rows (14-17) is `9, 9`.\n    *   Therefore, Rows 14-17 are filled with `9, 9, 9`.\n\n**Completed 8-block (9 rows x 3 columns):**\nRow 14: 9, 9, 9\nRow 15: 9, 9, 9\nRow 16: 9, 9, 9\nRow 17: 9, 9, 9\nRow 18: 4, 4, 7\nRow 19: 4, 4, 7\nRow 20: 6, 6, 6\nRow 21: 6, 6, 6\nRow 22: 1, 6, 1\n\noutput:\n9,9,9\n9,9,9\n9,9,9\n9,9,9\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n6,6,6\n6,6,6\n1,6,1",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**A Deep Dive into ARC Puzzle Solving: Finding the Pattern**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The user wants me to solve an ARC puzzle, and I'm on it. Looking at Example 1, I immediately see structure \u2013 the input grid has some repeating patterns. I scan it visually, checking for symmetries, trying to find anything distinctive. Those blocks of 8s? They jump out, and I realize the output is the same size, pointing me toward an inpainting task.\n\nThe initial thought is to try 180-degree rotation, but the data is messy, no direct mirror images.  Horizontal and vertical symmetry don't work either. I start splitting the grid into parts, looking for hidden patterns.  The 8s start to feel like a marker, a region needing a fill. That\u2019s the key. Now, it seems like horizontal reflection is a good candidate, given the hole location in examples, but it doesn't give a direct read.\n\nExample 2 brings a change of pace: 4x5 block with 8s.  I look at 180-degree rotations again, trying out vertical and horizontal mirrors. Again, the visual inspection gives me more hints. I\u2019m starting to think about relationships and connections.\n\nThen, Example 3 comes in with 3x7 and I can tell that a reflection across an axis is at play. I'm focusing on trying to find where the filled-in parts of the grid are coming from. The core idea is now: find a pattern where it is, and then flip it in a way that fills the hole. I begin to think about the hole area and the symmetric source area. This leads me back to example 1, where I have to now consider reflections. I start to understand the formula.\n\nMy breakthrough is realizing the rows have a \"sum\" in them: the row in the source area plus the corresponding row in the destination hole will add up to the same number. With more experimentation, the pattern reveals itself: vertical reflection works, the data is just offset.\n\nTesting this hypothesis on multiple cases, a consistent rule emerges for all but one. It is a vertical offset, which applies horizontal reflection. So finally it appears that each time there is a missing space (indicated by the 8s), the corresponding data should be obtained from a different part of the map by the 32-row sum, which is basically the center line of symmetry.\n\nNow, for any overlaps, or where the vertical reflection hits the hole, the values are determined horizontally from one edge to the other.\n\nThis makes sense. For Test, and by extending this with my knowledge of the patterns, I can create the output!\n\n\nTo solve the Test Input, I will apply the transformation rules derived from the examples.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n1.  **Identify the \"Hole\":** In each example, there is a rectangular region filled with 8s (or values that don't fit the surrounding pattern, effectively a hole).\n2.  **Vertical Reflection Strategy:** The primary mechanism to fill the hole is a vertical reflection across a specific horizontal axis.\n    -   In Example 2 and 3, the axis was effectively $y=15.5$ (mapping row $r$ to $31-r$).\n    -   In Example 1, the mapping was $r \\to 32-r$ (axis $y=16$), but for rows where the reflection source was also in the hole, a secondary strategy was needed.\n3.  **Horizontal Reflection Strategy (Secondary):** When the vertical reflection maps a hole row to another hole row (self-reference), the values are retrieved by reflecting horizontally from the visible part of the same row (e.g., taking the rightmost columns to fill the leftmost hole).\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n-   **Hole Location:** Rows 14-22, Columns 0-2 (3 columns wide).\n-   **Vertical Reflection ($r_{src} = 32 - r_{hole}$):**\n    -   Hole Row 22 $\\to$ Source Row $32-22 = 10$.\n    -   Hole Row 21 $\\to$ Source Row $32-21 = 11$.\n    -   Hole Row 20 $\\to$ Source Row $32-20 = 12$.\n    -   Hole Row 19 $\\to$ Source Row $32-19 = 13$.\n    -   Hole Row 18 $\\to$ Source Row $32-18 = 14$ (Row 14 is in the hole).\n    -   Hole Row 17 $\\to$ Source Row $32-17 = 15$ (Row 15 is in the hole).\n    -   Hole Row 16 $\\to$ Source Row $32-16 = 16$ (Row 16 is in the hole).\n    -   Hole Row 15 $\\to$ Source Row $32-15 = 17$ (Row 17 is in the hole).\n    -   Hole Row 14 $\\to$ Source Row $32-14 = 18$ (Row 18 is in the hole).\n\n**Filling the Non-Overlapping Rows (19-22):**\n-   **H22:** Source Row 10, Cols 0-2.\n    Row 10: `6,6,6,6,7...` $\\to$ **`6,6,6`**\n-   **H21:** Source Row 11, Cols 0-2.\n    Row 11: `6,6,1,6,7...` $\\to$ **`6,6,1`**\n-   **H20:** Source Row 12, Cols 0-2.\n    Row 12: `4,4,7,7,9...` $\\to$ **`4,4,7`**\n-   **H19:** Source Row 13, Cols 0-2.\n    Row 13: `4,4,7,2,7...` $\\to$ **`4,4,7`**\n\n**Filling the Overlapping Rows (14-18):**\nSince these rows map to each other (14$\\leftrightarrow$18, 15$\\leftrightarrow$17, 16$\\leftrightarrow$16), we use the secondary horizontal reflection strategy. We take the values from the symmetric column positions on the right side (Cols 27-29) to fill the left side (Cols 0-2).\n-   **H14:** Source Row 14, Cols 27-29.\n    Row 14 text: `...9,2,3,1,9`. Cols 27-29 are **`3,1,9`**.\n-   **H15:** Source Row 15, Cols 27-29.\n    Row 15 text: `...7,3,2,9,9`. Cols 27-29 are **`2,9,9`**.\n-   **H16:** Source Row 16, Cols 27-29.\n    Row 16 text: `...7,3,2,9,9`. Cols 27-29 are **`2,9,9`**.\n-   **H17:** Source Row 17, Cols 27-29.\n    Row 17 is identical to Row 14. Cols 27-29 are **`3,1,9`**.\n-   **H18:** Source Row 18, Cols 27-29.\n    Row 18 is identical to Row 14. Cols 27-29 are **`3,1,9`**.\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\nThe output grid consists of the filled hole values.\n\nRow 0 (H14): 3,1,9\nRow 1 (H15): 2,9,9\nRow 2 (H16): 2,9,9\nRow 3 (H17): 3,1,9\nRow 4 (H18): 3,1,9\nRow 5 (H19): 4,4,7\nRow 6 (H20): 4,4,7\nRow 7 (H21): 6,6,1\nRow 8 (H22): 6,6,6\n\n3,1,9\n2,9,9\n2,9,9\n3,1,9\n3,1,9\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n6,6,1\n6,6,6",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at the examples, I need to find the pattern for filling in the regions marked with 8s.\n\n**Analysis of the pattern:**\n\n1. In each example, there's a rectangular region of 8s that needs to be filled.\n\n2. The grid appears to have **reflection symmetry** around a horizontal axis (row 15.5 in a 30x30 grid).\n\n3. For rows below the center (rows 18-22 in Example 1), the 8s values come from their **mirror rows** at the **same columns**.\n   - Row 18 mirrors Row 13 (18+13=31, so axis at 15.5)\n   - Row 19 mirrors Row 12\n   - etc.\n\n4. For the central rows (rows 14-17), which mirror each other internally:\n   - Rows 14 and 17 are identical\n   - Rows 15 and 16 are identical\n   - These rows use **vertical (column) reflection** around col 14.5\n   - Col 0 mirrors Col 29, Col 1 mirrors Col 28, Col 2 mirrors Col 27\n\n**Applying to test input:**\n\nThe 8s are at rows 14-22, columns 0-2 (9 rows \u00d7 3 columns).\n\n**For rows 14-17 (using vertical reflection):**\n- Row 14 cols 27,28,29 = 3,1,9 \u2192 cols 0,1,2 = **9,1,3**\n- Row 15 cols 27,28,29 = 2,9,9 \u2192 cols 0,1,2 = **9,9,2**\n- Row 16 = Row 15, so **9,9,2**\n- Row 17 = Row 14, so **9,1,3**\n\n**For rows 18-22 (using horizontal reflection):**\n- Row 18 mirrors Row 13: cols 0-2 = **4,4,7**\n- Row 19 mirrors Row 12: cols 0-2 = **4,4,7**\n- Row 20 mirrors Row 11: cols 0-2 = **6,6,1**\n- Row 21 mirrors Row 10: cols 0-2 = **6,6,6**\n- Row 22 mirrors Row 9: cols 0-2 = **1,6,1**\n\n```\n9,1,3\n9,9,2\n9,9,2\n9,1,3\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n6,6,1\n6,6,6\n1,6,1\n```",

        "Full raw LLM response": "Looking at this problem, I need to identify the pattern used to fill in regions marked with 8s.\n\n**Analysis of Examples:**\n\nIn each example, I notice:\n1. A rectangular region contains 8s (marking \"unknown\" values)\n2. The output size matches the 8s region size\n3. The grids have reflection symmetry\n\n**Key observations from Example 1:**\n- 8s are at rows 14-22, cols 25-28\n- Rows 14=17 and 15=16 (vertical reflection around y=15.5)\n- For rows 18-22, the values come from their vertically symmetric rows (13-9) at the same columns\n- For rows 14-17 (where symmetric rows also have 8s), values come from horizontal reflection\n\n**Verifying the symmetry:**\n- Row 18's output [9,9,2,1] matches row 13, cols 25-28 \u2713\n- Row 19's output [6,9,9,9] matches row 12, cols 25-28 \u2713\n- For row 14, horizontal reflection around x=15.5 gives cols 6,5,4,3 \u2192 [9,9,6,4] \u2713\n\n**Applying to Test Input:**\n- 8s are at rows 14-22, cols 0-2 (9 rows \u00d7 3 cols)\n- Vertical reflection: row r \u2194 row 31-r\n- For rows 14-17, use horizontal reflection around x=14.5: col c \u2194 col 29-c\n\n**For rows 14-17 (horizontal reflection):**\n- Row 14: cols 29,28,27 = 9,1,3\n- Row 15: cols 29,28,27 = 9,9,2  \n- Row 16: same as row 15 = 9,9,2\n- Row 17: same as row 14 = 9,1,3\n\n**For rows 18-22 (vertical reflection from rows 13-9):**\n- Row 18 \u2190 Row 13, cols 0-2: 4,4,7\n- Row 19 \u2190 Row 12, cols 0-2: 4,4,7\n- Row 20 \u2190 Row 11, cols 0-2: 6,6,1\n- Row 21 \u2190 Row 10, cols 0-2: 6,6,6\n- Row 22 \u2190 Row 9, cols 0-2: 1,6,1\n\n```\n9,1,3\n9,9,2\n9,9,2\n9,1,3\n4,4,7\n4,4,7\n6,6,1\n6,6,6\n1,6,1\n```",
