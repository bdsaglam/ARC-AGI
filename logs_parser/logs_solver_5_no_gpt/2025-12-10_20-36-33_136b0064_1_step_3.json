        "Full raw LLM response": "**My Strategy for Solving the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, here's what I've figured out.  I've got to transform input grids into output grids. The input has a clear structure: it's like a vertical stack of \"blocks,\" each consisting of two 3x3 patterns (tiles) and separated by empty rows or a yellow \"wall\" (represented by 4s). The output will be 7 columns wide, regardless of the input's height, but its height will be the same as the input grid's.\n\nIt seems the position of a '5' in the input determines where things begin. This '5' is located at the same horizontal position on the first row of each output grid.  The key is probably how the left and right 3x3 tiles interact based on that '5' marker.\n\nHere's my general idea. I'll define these 3x3 tile-types:\n*   Red (U shape): Outputs 2 adjacent pixels (2,2) starting at a specific column.\n*   Blue (h shape): Outputs 3 contiguous pixels (1,1,1).\n*   Pink (Y shape): Generates a vertical line (a stack of pixels, like a stream).\n*   Green (box shape): Outputs a 4-pixel block.\n\nI think the input's '5' acts as a starting point. It's like a cursor that picks a path by looking at the tiles.  Then depending on which tile it \"sees\" it'll either create a short horizontal line, a vertical stream, or a rectangular block. If its '5' touches a tile that means a new tile is added to that line.\n\nMore complex, the tiles are activated at the same time: one tile creates output while triggering other tiles.\n\nMy approach:\n*   **Grid Size:** I'll verify the output will be the same height, and 7 columns wide.\n*   **Locating '5':** The right panel's '5' position indicates the starting column in the output.\n*   **Tile Effect:** If '5' touches a left tile, it activates that tile's generator. If it doesn't touch, no output.\n*   **Color-coded Output:** Tiles are assigned colors, the output contains that color and pixel quantity from the active tile.\n*   **Interleaving/Merging:** Multiple activated tiles create lines. These streams are combined, row by row to build the final grid.\n*   **Final Plan:** Build the output, layer by layer, starting with '5's column, and adding tiles depending if those tiles are \"selected\" by the '5' pixel. I'll test the resulting output against the examples and refine my logic if it does not match.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform the input grid into an output grid based on a set of logic inferred from examples.\n\n**Inferred Logic:**\n1.  **Input Structure:** The input grid consists of pairs of 3x3 patterns (Left and Right blocks) arranged vertically, separated by a column of `0`s (index 3). There is a divider column of `4`s at index 7. To the right of the divider (indices 8-14), there is a single `5` (grey pixel) which acts as a starting position indicator.\n2.  **Output Grid:** The output grid is 7 columns wide (corresponding to the width of the Left/Right pattern area). The rows are filled based on the interaction of a \"falling particle\" (starting at the `5`) with the 3x3 patterns.\n3.  **Particle Start:** The column index of the `5` in the Right Panel (0-6 relative to the panel start) determines the starting column of the particle in the Output Grid.\n    *   Test Input: `5` is at index 2 (Col 10). So particle starts at **Column 2** (Left side).\n4.  **Pattern Interaction:** As the particle moves down, it encounters the 3x3 patterns (Left and Right) at each block level. The particle activates the pattern in its current column.\n    *   **Blue Pattern (1):** Generates a horizontal bar `1,1,1` (1 row).\n    *   **Red Pattern (2):** Generates a short bar `2,2` (1 row). **Crucially**, encountering a Red pattern on the Left triggers a second particle/stream on the Right side (Col 5) for subsequent blocks.\n    *   **Pink Pattern (6):** Generates a vertical stream/line of `6`s (multiple rows, e.g., 3).\n    *   **Green Pattern (3):** Generates a wide bar `3,3,3,3` (1 row).\n5.  **Test Input Sequence:**\n    *   **Row 0:** Output `5` at Col 2.\n    *   **Block 1 (Row 0-2):** Left is **Blue**. Output `1,1,1` at Left.\n    *   **Block 2 (Row 4-6):** Left is **Red**. Output `2,2` at Left. **Trigger Right Stream.** Right is **Blue**. Output `1,1,1` at Right (following Red).\n    *   **Block 3 (Row 8-10):** Left is **Pink**. Right is **Pink**. Both active (Left stream + triggered Right stream). Output parallel vertical lines of `6`.\n    *   **Block 4 (Row 12-14):** Left is **Green**. Right is **Green**. Both active. Output `3,3,3,3` (Left) then `3,3,3,3` (Right).\n    *   **Block 5 (Row 16-18):** Left is **Pink**. Right is **Red**. Left outputs `6` stream. Right outputs `2,2`.\n\n**Constructed Output:**\n*   **Row 0:** `0,0,5,0,0,0,0`\n*   **Row 1 (B1 L):** `0,1,1,1,0,0,0` (Blue)\n*   **Row 2 (B2 L):** `0,2,2,0,0,0,0` (Red)\n*   **Row 3 (B2 R):** `0,0,0,0,1,1,1` (Blue - triggered)\n*   **Rows 4-6 (B3 L+R):** `0,0,6,0,0,6,0` (Pink streams)\n*   **Row 7 (B4 L):** `0,0,3,3,3,3,0` (Green)\n*   **Row 8 (B4 R):** `0,0,3,3,3,3,0` (Green)\n*   **Row 9 (B5 L+R):** `0,0,6,0,2,2,0` (Pink L + Red R)\n*   **Row 10-11 (B5 L cont):** `0,0,6,0,0,0,0` (Pink L continues)\n*   **Rows 12+:** `0`s.\n\n0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,1,1,1,0,0,0\n0,2,2,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,1,1,1\n0,0,6,0,0,6,0\n0,0,6,0,0,6,0\n0,0,6,0,0,6,0\n0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,3,3,3,3,0\n0,0,6,0,2,2,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

        "Full raw LLM response": "**My Approach to Solving the ARC Task**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an ARC task where the goal is to generate output grids based on a pattern from three solved examples and one test input. After a thorough examination, here's how I'm approaching this:\n\n1.  **Grid Analysis:** I start by noticing all inputs have a 15-column layout with a vertical '4' separator. Left of the separator is the pattern, right is mostly black with one non-zero pixel defining a starting point, which appears to be a grey '5'.\n\n2.  **Left-Side Pattern Decoding:** The left side is built in vertically stacked blocks of 3x7, separated by a row of 0s. Further, it seems each 3x7 block is made up of two 3x3 shapes (Shape A and Shape B), separated by a single column of zeros. These shapes are made by different color pixels.\n\n3.  **Output Grid Observations:** Output grids are 7 columns wide and appear to be of the same height as the input. The initial '5' in the first row is key, indicating a start position. The other values appear to be some kind of operation involving the left side's 3x3 shapes. It looks like the output is stacking rows of horizontal bars, where each bar's color corresponds to shapes in the input.\n\n4.  **Shape Classification:** I categorize the shapes based on their \"look\" (like a 'U', a 'Y', an 'h', or a 'C') and start to suspect they might represent numbers or some control parameters.\n\n5.  **Hypothesis: Shape-Based Instruction:** Each shape might be instructing some form of horizontal bar, with characteristics: the color of pixels in the bar matching with one of the colored shapes in the input, the \"length\" of the bar, and its \"position\" in the output.\n\n6.  **Deconstructing the Examples:** Let me figure out what the \"code\" is! Example 2, in particular, looks like the different colored bars are stacking in sequence.\n    *   **Position:** The gray '5' in the first row seems to denote a column index; it appears to be a horizontal \"center\" for placement.\n    *   **Width:** The width of these bars is constant and is encoded by each particular shape in the input.\n    *   **Offset:** This is tricky. The location seems to be influenced by both shape, the row index of the input block, and potentially the value of the '5' in the input. It might represent an x-position (Horizontal Position)\n\n7.  **Shape Encoding & Falling Block Theory:** The key is to transform the input shapes to something that will result in the output values.\n    *   **Shape Width:** Shape 1 = Width 3, Shape 2 = Width 2, Shape 3 = Width 4, Shape 6 = Width 1.\n    *   **Offset:** After many trials, I realized that the value of the 5 is an important reference. I also realized the input has an order. If I consider the position of the 5 in the grid (1,3,4) I start realizing the offset may follow a pattern of some sort. It seems the input blocks' sequence from the bottom upwards and the blocks' side are important factors for the values.\n    *   **Z-Order:** Right blocks are processed from the bottom upwards, and then left blocks from the bottom upwards. I also see that there is some form of falling/stacking logic, where the blocks stack up, perhaps, from the bottom upwards.\n\n8.  **Refining the Model: Test input Analysis:** For the test grid, the 5 is at index 2 (counting from zero).  It looks like a sequence of \"instructions\" for horizontal bars.\n    *   I propose a sequence, according to the observations on the previous examples.\n    *   Now, based on the previous offsets:\n        *   3: Abs 1.\n        *   1: Abs p (p=2).\n        *   2: Abs 2 (interpolation between the others).\n        *   6: Aligns with what's below it.\n    *   I am now constructing the stack one block at a time, each block in the sequence. Each Block's position (x) is determined by its shapes: if left is centered, and right aligns with '1'.\n\n9.  **Building the Final Output:** Based on the stack sequence, now I construct the grid and I see there is an empty space at the bottom (margin).\n\n10. **Final Verification:** I re-verify the whole idea to make sure the assumptions are consistent, and then I generate the final output and check again.\n\n\nThe problem asks us to transform an input grid into an output grid based on the logic inferred from three examples.\n\n**Inferred Logic:**\n\n1.  **Input Structure**: The input grid (15 columns wide) is divided into two main sections by a vertical separator of '4's at column 7.\n    *   **Left Section (Cols 0-6)**: Contains a vertical stack of \"blocks\". Each block is 3 rows high and contains two 3x3 shapes (one on the left, cols 0-2; one on the right, cols 4-6). These shapes represent \"falling pieces\".\n    *   **Right Section (Cols 8-14)**: Contains a single '5' (grey pixel) in the top row. The position of this '5' acts as a reference point ($p$) for the horizontal alignment of the falling pieces.\n\n2.  **Piece Decoding**: Each 3x3 shape corresponds to a specific color and width in the output.\n    *   **Color 1 (Shape 'h')**: Width 3. Height 1 row.\n    *   **Color 2 (Shape 'U')**: Width 2. Height 1 row.\n    *   **Color 3 (Shape 'C')**: Width 4. Height 1 row.\n    *   **Color 6 (Shape 'Y')**: Width 1. Height 2 rows.\n\n3.  **Sequence of Pieces**: The pieces are processed and \"dropped\" into the output grid in a specific order:\n    *   Iterate through the rows of blocks in the input from **Bottom to Top**.\n    *   For each row block, first take the **Right** shape, then later take the **Left** shape.\n    *   This implies a full sequence: Bottom-Right, Next-Up-Right, ..., Top-Right, then Bottom-Left, ..., Top-Left.\n    *   However, examining the stacking order in the examples, the single unified sequence is: **Right Column (Bottom to Top) followed by Left Column (Bottom to Top)**.\n\n4.  **Placement and Stacking**:\n    *   The output grid is 7 columns wide.\n    *   The '5' from the input marks the header position. Its column index relative to the right section (col 8) determines a base offset $p$. For the test input, the '5' is at column 10, so $p = 10 - 8 = 2$. Output row 0 contains the '5' at index 2.\n    *   Pieces fall from the top and stack on top of each other or the floor.\n    *   **Horizontal Position**: Determined by the shape type and the reference $p$.\n        *   **Shape 3**: Centered at/covering index 1. (Abs Range 1-4).\n        *   **Shape 1**: Centered at $p$. For $p=2$, Abs Range 1-3 or 2-4. Based on examples, Abs Range 2-4 fits best.\n        *   **Shape 2**: Centered at $p$. For $p=2$, Abs Range 2-3.\n        *   **Shape 6**: Aligns with the stack. Placed at index 2.\n\n**Application to Test Input:**\n\n*   **Reference**: '5' at col 10 $\\rightarrow$ $p=2$. Output Row 0 has '5' at index 2.\n*   **Blocks (Top to Bottom in Input)**:\n    *   Row 0 (B1): Left=1, Right=1\n    *   Row 4 (B2): Left=2, Right=1\n    *   Row 8 (B3): Left=6, Right=6\n    *   Row 12 (B4): Left=3, Right=3\n*   **Processing Sequence (Right Bottom-Up, then Left Bottom-Up)**:\n    1.  **B4 Right (3)**: Width 4. Place at 1..4. Stack bottom (Row 10).\n    2.  **B3 Right (6)**: Width 1, Height 2. Place at 2. Stack on 3 (Rows 8-9).\n    3.  **B2 Right (1)**: Width 3. Place at 2..4. Stack on 6 (Row 7).\n    4.  **B1 Right (1)**: Width 3. Place at 2..4. Stack on 1 (Row 6).\n    5.  **B4 Left (3)**: Width 4. Place at 1..4. Stack on 1 (Row 5).\n    6.  **B3 Left (6)**: Width 1, Height 2. Place at 2. Stack on 3 (Rows 3-4).\n    7.  **B2 Left (2)**: Width 2. Place at 2..3. Stack on 6 (Row 2).\n    8.  **B1 Left (1)**: Width 3. Place at 2..4. Stack on 2 (Row 1).\n\n**Output Grid Construction:**\n\n0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,1,1,0,0\n0,0,2,2,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,3,3,3,3,0,0\n0,0,1,1,1,0,0\n0,0,1,1,1,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,3,3,3,3,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n\n0,0,5,0,0,0,0\n0,0,1,1,1,0,0\n0,0,2,2,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,3,3,3,3,0,0\n0,0,1,1,1,0,0\n0,0,1,1,1,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,0,6,0,0,0,0\n0,3,3,3,3,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0\n0,0,0,0,0,0,0",

The left section contains paired 3x3 patterns (left patterns in cols 0-2, right patterns in cols 4-6), separated by blank rows. A \"5\" marker appears in the right section.\n\n2. **Pattern Analysis**: Each 3x3 pattern has a specific shape that encodes:\n   - **Color**: The number used in the pattern (1, 2, 3, or 6)\n   - **Direction**: Pattern 1 \u2192 RIGHT, Pattern 2 \u2192 LEFT, Pattern 3 \u2192 LEFT, Pattern 6 \u2192 DOWN\n   - **Length**: Pattern 1 \u2192 3, Pattern 2 \u2192 2, Pattern 3 \u2192 4, Pattern 6 \u2192 2\n\n3. **Path Drawing**: Starting from the \"5\" position, draw segments in order:\n   - First, all LEFT patterns (top to bottom)\n   - Then, all RIGHT patterns (top to bottom)\n   - Each segment moves to the next row (or multiple rows for DOWN) and draws in its encoded direction\n\n**Test Input Analysis**:\n- 5 is at column 10 \u2192 output column 2\n- Blocks (rows 0-2, 4-6, 8-10, 12-14, 16-18):\n  - Block 0: L=1, R=1\n  - Block 1: L=2, R=1\n  - Block 2: L=6, R=6\n  - Block 3: L=3, R=3\n  - Block 4: L=6, R=2\n\n**Segment sequence**: 1, 2, 6, 3, 6 (lefts), then 1, 1, 6, 3, 2 (rights)\n\n**Tracing the path** from (0,2):\n1. Pattern 1 (right 3): row 1, cols 2-4\n2. Pattern 2 (left 2): row 2, cols 3-4\n3. Pattern 6 (down 2): rows 3-4, col 3\n4. Pattern 3 (left 4): row 5, cols 0-3\n5.
