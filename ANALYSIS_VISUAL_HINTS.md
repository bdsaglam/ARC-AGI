Explicit solution:
```
"- Each single dot corresponds to a shape (#2 to a #4 square, #3 to a#1 circle, etc)
- A single dot in the input is replaced by its shape in the input
- If a shape is present in the input together with its corresponding dot in the bottom right corner, the shape and the corresponding dot is removed from the output
- Note: In example 2 in the bottom right, there is both a shape with its corresponding dot, as well as a #3 dot, therefore the shape is first removed and then added back"
```
